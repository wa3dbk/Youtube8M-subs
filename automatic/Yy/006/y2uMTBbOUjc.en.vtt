00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820
 I'm ready for the second round of 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.820
 surprises 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.170
 do not go scared it's his share but boring 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.969
 it's not mean 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.580
 hello to all today I find 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.770
 with enzo pollutes and we find ourselves for 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.500
 our favorite beauty care men and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.330
 women for the summer and task and that in 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 same time we find on our channel 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.289
 lifestyle that are the favorites 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.330
 summer but this time the favorites 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.219
 lifestyle and me the way we are you 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.780
 will leave the video here the echo part and in 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.910
 info bar so you can 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.090
 to have it but here we focus on my 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.450
 chain that on care and have them 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.719
 need 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.559
 and it's us and we'll fall from favorite 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.500
 I will introduce you 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.629
 it's a cleansing foam with 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.860
 at body surf like wanted to see that 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.090
 present in liquid form and not 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.770
 foam as I just told you 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.600
 but it is indeed a foam a 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.640
 once we have done a pressure so 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.989
 it turns into foam and that's where 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.379
 we can start washing the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.690
 face 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.829
 the foam is really soft and we have 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.840
 the impression of cleaning yourself 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.140
 just the face with a cloud boom 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.780
 and so that was surprising 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.189
 first time and it was effective and 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.930
 keep explaining that what is good with 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.070
 a foam it's not aggressive for the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.450
 facial skin that you can use 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.990
 every night where every morning 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.060
 really a scrub where there is better or 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.890
 once or twice a week and especially 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.270
 not every day so my product 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.830
 favorite is a lipstick from 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.479
 sephora it is part of the range 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.689
 sephora red them it's the r and 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.890
 recipes and it's a coral red it's 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.119
 I now bears though there 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.950
 I mix them with another cat 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.689
 game lips but quite often because 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.909
 it brightens you want makeup games 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.770
 it's crazy that in winter 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.590
 but not so perfect for the summer 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.229
 and peace here and also not very expensive 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.750
 like lipstick and creamy texture 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.609
 so full of what positive 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.780
 I recommend the second product 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:53.819
 it's a product that I use 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.709
 after using a foam that I do not 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.140
 so you're showing products in 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.450
 question is a self nick that comes 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.109
 from nature reserve it's me who 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.439
 will pass both this one and the 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.439
 air foam 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.950
 it's a technique we can use on 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.430
 facial skin but also on the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.530
 lips 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.019
 it has the distinction of being 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.610
 purifying for the skin yes its g 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.959
 was that we can bet on the lips 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.760
 no I'm going because after when I 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.319
 Spend the language like that I have a little 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.360
 taste of not producing it no but there 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.420
 a good smell she is also a good 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:32.760
 taste also yes and she leaves me a little 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.079
 the dull complexion it is you who want to give 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.290
 auto nique 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.390
 I know the price so I keep it 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.000
 if it's a small price below 10 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.819
 euros is good to try why not 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.340
 so we are clean budget that's my 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.590
 second favorite is a scrub for 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.180
 the faces and that scrub it was my 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.950
 god the favorite of the summer 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.299
 in fact it was also a small 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.069
 surprise because it's a scrub 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.859
 transparent with small grains 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.169
 necessarily but when the mixture with water 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.569
 on the face it becomes a donations 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:05.430
 that he whitens common like a milk so 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.290
 it really leaves the face cleanse 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.910
 sweet is a tribute that does not offend 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.120
 not at all the face is a texture 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.190
 quite special never met her 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.040
 I love I use I do not read that he 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.790
 in fact it's been a month and I'm not coming 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.739
 to part with me 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.180
 I recommend it third product 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.669
 it is a moisturizing care always for the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.010
 face of that auch who is called dude 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.510
 ultra is a product that 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.160
 I use every day every day 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.540
 mornings besides after the two 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.680
 products that I do not show you to 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.330
 unfortunately is the skin a little 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.170
 fat 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.030
 but it's a cream on demand so 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.460
 james and beyond so I use with 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.120
 fun in the morning it was happening because you 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.550
 proves nice announcement no no it's 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.830
 true fishing and forest texture or enough 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.020
 light is false repeats to me it's 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.250
 why I have trouble going to type 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.320
 on my skin that's why she gives me 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.590
 leave a little litra good but I sleep 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.600
 well 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.800
 my third favorite is still a 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.680
 pity but this time it's for the 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.180
 body and again the rhymes 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.860
 but again it's a super 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.120
 discovery we play to the pot of 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.620
 scrub I really saw that they 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.380
 had the sandstone below and above 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.090
 a layer of oil I told myself 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.400
 notice it's going to be a moisturizing ipa scrub 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.050
 and that's why I love it 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.590
 that we have to mix the seeds and 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.410
 oil 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.830
 and then when we think back it leaves a 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.810
 good moisturizing fat film and fat film 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.760
 it's not unpleasant that I do not like 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.560
 all but that one leaves you skin 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.510
 sweet for two days no need to 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.390
 moisturizing body cream naught 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.030
 exfoliation does 2 in 1 actually doing that on the 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.150
 mode the eye in addition to the monoi these are 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.470
 the holidays too well so I empty the 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.000
 division I think they left me 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.200
 only for once or twice 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.120
 am I saddened but here is the kif and I 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.169
 I received them in my beauty box 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.080
 month of June 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.220
 yeah without seeing if in the cliches the 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.470
 fourth and last product that I 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.750
 wanted to introduce me it's a gel or 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.820
 rather hair wax so 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.130
 being a boy in need of styling 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.500
 the short length I 've been looking for 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.900
 desperately a gel at least a wax 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.910
 who does not leave me greasy hair and 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.710
 in this case I found it's a 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.660
 product from the real so the range 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.910
 technique that is perfectly fine 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.800
 work so not only does it hold up well 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.200
 it makes the hair fit properly 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.270
 and his hall and matifies almost 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.640
 so here I am very happy with his 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.919
 product saleh does not do that 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.600
 cartons that cartonne but as long as 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.490
 they personally hold my 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.340
 fourth is given favorite this is a 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.759
 blue cream and summer cream is clear 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.849
 and net because it is really I 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.639
 say orange and I mean very east 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.199
 but its particularity of having two micro 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.360
 micro micro glitter 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.610
 so I say the microphone I insist on 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.069
 do not see her writing herself once and 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.430
 to the east but it looks good 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.870
 illuminate the face and there I am a whole 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.940
 a little too pale to use 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.910
 because we see a difference has had my 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.710
 skin just on swatch but once well 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.360
 applied and once I make up 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.590
 and we see no difference but 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.630
 I think that on vacation 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.190
 even on vacation one does not make up a 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.840
 little bit but that should make me 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.159
 broadly the sphere it hydrates well 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.169
 she gives good looks 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:13.400
 lm good outfit it was my shot of 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.370
 heart of the moment and I used a lot 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.409
 this summer temporality depends to finish I 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.330
 reassure you we do not describe but 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:22.280
