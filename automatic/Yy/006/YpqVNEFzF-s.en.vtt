00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
this is kind of a sharp in so if you

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.179 
this is kind of a sharp in so if you
wanted<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.359> start<00:04:12.750> off<00:04:12.989> by<00:04:13.739> adding<00:04:14.010> your

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
probably be a really good idea because

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.730 
probably be a really good idea because
this<00:04:19.859> in<00:04:20.280> provides<00:04:20.849> a<00:04:21.120> little<00:04:21.560> sharpness<00:04:22.560> to

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740
