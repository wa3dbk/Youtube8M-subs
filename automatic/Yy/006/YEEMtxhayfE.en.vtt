00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
get the ID has a pretty good blast

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.650 
get the ID has a pretty good blast
radius<00:00:28.859> it'll<00:00:29.310> obviously<00:00:29.460> mark<00:00:30.090> people<00:00:30.300> now

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
radius it'll obviously mark people now

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.810 
radius it'll obviously mark people now
because<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.260> recon<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.009> explicit

if there's a bomb on one side a bomb on
the<00:00:57.210> other<00:00:57.329> side<00:00:57.510> they're<00:00:57.719> probably

somewhere<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.250> middle<00:00:59.550> normally<00:01:00.449> you

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
somewhere in the middle normally you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.060 
somewhere in the middle normally you
don't<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.199> leave<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.440> unless<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.920> bomb

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
don't we just leave it unless the bomb

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.349 
don't we just leave it unless the bomb
is<00:01:02.219> playing<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.550> won't<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:02.879> leave<00:01:03.030> an<00:01:03.210> area

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
is playing you won't just leave an area

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.450 
is playing you won't just leave an area
and<00:01:03.539> obviously<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.019> mainly<00:01:04.559> search<00:01:04.949> classes

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and obviously so mainly search classes

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.640 
and obviously so mainly search classes
that's<00:01:05.610> why<00:01:05.700> they're<00:01:05.850> not<00:01:05.939> set<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.650> lots

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
that's why they're not set up for lots

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.770 
that's why they're not set up for lots
of<00:01:07.770> gun<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.070> gone<00:01:08.310> they're<00:01:08.909> mainly<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.479> give

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
of gun on gone they're mainly just give

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.719

the ammo crates and things like that

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.640 
the ammo crates and things like that
you'll<00:01:39.150> also<00:01:39.299> be<00:01:39.509> able<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.720> see<00:01:39.869> obviously<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
you'll also be able to see obviously the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.350 
you'll also be able to see obviously the
care<00:01:41.280> package<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.759> fall<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> sky

and<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.570> sort<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.899> great<00:01:43.049> stuff<00:01:43.350> now

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and that sort of great stuff now

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.620 
and that sort of great stuff now
obviously<00:01:44.040> not<00:01:44.460> everyone<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.119> going<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.360> use<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
obviously not everyone is going to use a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.940 
obviously not everyone is going to use a
tactical<00:01:46.259> equipment<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.649> they<00:01:46.680> throw<00:01:46.890> on

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
tactical equipment that they throw on

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.039

the<00:01:47.130> ground<00:01:47.340> or<00:01:47.549> leave<00:01:48.210> little<00:01:48.329> equipment<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the ground or leave little equipment the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:49.999 
the ground or leave little equipment the
thing<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.290> thrown<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.560> ground<00:01:49.680> now<00:01:49.890> with

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
thing is thrown on the ground now with

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950 
thing is thrown on the ground now with
that<00:01:50.130> said<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:51.030> still<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.390> recon<00:01:51.720> there<00:01:51.869> to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that said you still have recon there to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.929 
that said you still have recon there to
pick<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.560> now<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.890> wiretap<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
pick you up and now you have wiretap the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.550 
pick you up and now you have wiretap the
reason<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.390> wiretap<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.049> because<00:01:55.259> just

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
reason we have wiretap is because just

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.709 
reason we have wiretap is because just
like<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.770> says<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.100> utilizes<00:01:56.460> all<00:01:56.850> active

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
like it says it utilizes all active

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.749 
like it says it utilizes all active
enemy<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.649> friendly<00:01:58.799> SATCOM<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.579> if<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
enemy and friendly SATCOM so if the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.340 
enemy and friendly SATCOM so if the
enemy<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.570> one<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.930> now<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.290> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
enemy is one you have one you now have a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.499 
enemy is one you have one you now have a
radar<00:02:01.860> sweep<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.759> type<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.060> thing<00:02:03.360> and

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
radar sweep that type of thing and

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.969 
radar sweep that type of thing and
everyone<00:02:04.079> always<00:02:04.290> likes<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.530> throw<00:02:04.710> there's

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
everyone always likes to throw there's

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.330 
everyone always likes to throw there's
down<00:02:05.250> by<00:02:05.820> themselves<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:08.129> play<00:02:08.310> a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
down by themselves so you I just play a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.040 
down by themselves so you I just play a
couple<00:02:08.550> games<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.970> ever<00:02:09.000> Iran<00:02:09.509> must<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:09.899> had<00:02:10.020> a

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
couple games I ever Iran must have had a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.960 
couple games I ever Iran must have had a
radar<00:02:10.349> sweep<00:02:10.590> every<00:02:11.009> single<00:02:11.280> round<00:02:11.459> we<00:02:11.849> knew

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
radar sweep every single round we knew

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.559 
radar sweep every single round we knew
exactly

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
exactly

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.119 
exactly
other<00:02:12.719> team<00:02:12.900> was<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.170> all<00:02:13.469> thanks<00:02:14.040> to

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
other team was that all thanks to

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.819 
other team was that all thanks to
wiretap<00:02:14.549> so<00:02:14.999> each<00:02:15.239> perk<00:02:15.719> itself<00:02:16.170> catches<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
wiretap so each perk itself catches the

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.860 
wiretap so each perk itself catches the
other<00:02:16.950> perkin<00:02:17.370> saves<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.879> from<00:02:17.969> bailing<00:02:18.420> it's

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
other perkin saves it from bailing it's

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.720 
other perkin saves it from bailing it's
kind<00:02:19.019> of<00:02:19.109> a<00:02:19.230> fail-safe<00:02:19.439> between<00:02:20.040> them<00:02:20.159> all<00:02:20.310> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
kind of a fail-safe between them all the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.160 
kind of a fail-safe between them all the
reason<00:02:20.999> I<00:02:21.090> put<00:02:21.329> this<00:02:21.450> one<00:02:21.629> here<00:02:21.659> is<00:02:21.780> obviously

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
reason I put this one here is obviously

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.929 
reason I put this one here is obviously
I<00:02:22.290> couldn't<00:02:22.349> put<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.769> in<00:02:22.859> lethal<00:02:23.159> I<00:02:23.340> have

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
I couldn't put it in lethal I have

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.270 
I couldn't put it in lethal I have
enough<00:02:24.120> points<00:02:24.299> but<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.349> extra<00:02:25.709> tactical

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
enough points but the extra tactical

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.849 
enough points but the extra tactical
does<00:02:26.639> give<00:02:26.939> you<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.239> extra<00:02:27.269> sort<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.989> Vantage

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859

you can almost lock it down it's not

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.319 
you can almost lock it down it's not
