video<00:06:36.210> just<00:06:36.750> showing<00:06:37.170> slides<00:06:37.560> of<00:06:38.130> pictures

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
video just showing slides of pictures

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.270 
video just showing slides of pictures
and<00:06:39.000> stuff<00:06:39.390> like<00:06:39.540> that<00:06:39.600> the<00:06:40.500> only<00:06:40.650> way<00:06:40.890> I<00:06:40.920> guess

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
and stuff like that the only way I guess

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.210 
and stuff like that the only way I guess
it's<00:06:41.520> the<00:06:42.240> rough<00:06:45.170> nazi<00:06:46.170> zombie<00:06:46.200> people<00:06:46.890> so

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
it's the rough nazi zombie people so

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.030 
it's the rough nazi zombie people so
anyway<00:06:47.780> you<00:06:48.780> want<00:06:49.110> to<00:06:49.170> say<00:06:49.320> anything<00:06:49.500> and<00:06:49.920> that

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
anyway you want to say anything and that

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.470 
anyway you want to say anything and that
i<00:06:50.070> think<00:06:50.400> we<00:06:50.580> should<00:06:50.610> stop<00:06:51.180> the<00:06:51.390> video

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
i think we should stop the video
