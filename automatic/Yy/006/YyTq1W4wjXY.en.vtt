I've<00:00:30.050> been<00:00:30.140> lucky<00:00:30.470> enough<00:00:30.500> to<00:00:30.769> actually<00:00:30.890> play

I've been lucky enough to actually play
watchdogs<00:00:31.760> at<00:00:31.939> an<00:00:32.000> event<00:00:32.300> I<00:00:32.449> can<00:00:32.930> confirm<00:00:33.380> that

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
watchdogs at an event I can confirm that

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.100 
watchdogs at an event I can confirm that
you<00:00:34.010> can't<00:00:34.309> buy<00:00:34.850> this<00:00:34.910> gun<00:00:35.300> in<00:00:35.540> a<00:00:35.630> store<00:00:35.899> in

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
you can't buy this gun in a store in

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.049 
you can't buy this gun in a store in
watchdogs<00:00:36.320> so<00:00:37.100> it's<00:00:37.250> likely<00:00:37.430> to<00:00:37.579> be<00:00:37.790> an

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
watchdogs so it's likely to be an

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.240 
watchdogs so it's likely to be an
exclusive<00:00:38.600> to<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:38.809> deal<00:00:39.050> there<00:00:39.649> is<00:00:39.829> actually

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
exclusive to this deal there is actually

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.100 
exclusive to this deal there is actually
another<00:00:40.280> revolver<00:00:41.059> in<00:00:41.210> watchdogs<00:00:41.450> called<00:00:42.020> the

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
another revolver in watchdogs called the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.020 
another revolver in watchdogs called the
m8<00:00:42.590> M<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.370> I<00:00:43.399> don't<00:00:43.550> know<00:00:43.610> how<00:00:43.700> it's<00:00:43.850> going<00:00:43.940> to

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
m8 M so I don't know how it's going to

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.420 
m8 M so I don't know how it's going to
compare<00:00:44.510> I<00:00:44.540> can<00:00:44.809> imagine<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.350> m8<00:00:45.770> M<00:00:46.010> since

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
compare I can imagine the m8 M since

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.069 
compare I can imagine the m8 M since
it's<00:00:46.579> the<00:00:46.670> most<00:00:46.820> expensive<00:00:47.149> pistol<00:00:47.899> in

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
it's the most expensive pistol in

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.630 
it's the most expensive pistol in
watchdogs<00:00:48.320> it's<00:00:49.039> probably<00:00:49.309> going<00:00:49.399> to<00:00:49.460> be<00:00:49.610> a

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
watchdogs it's probably going to be a

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.549 
watchdogs it's probably going to be a
little<00:00:49.940> bit<00:00:50.059> better<00:00:50.210> than<00:00:50.539> this<00:00:50.719> item<00:00:51.079> but

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
little bit better than this item but

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:52.660 
little bit better than this item but
it's<00:00:51.680> definitely<00:00:51.800> worth<00:00:52.070> picking<00:00:52.219> up<00:00:52.430> since

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
it's definitely worth picking up since

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.760 
it's definitely worth picking up since
