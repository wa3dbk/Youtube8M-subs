part of the pump to change your seal if
you've<00:03:41.849> watched<00:03:42.030> our<00:03:42.150> videos<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.780> then<00:03:43.170> when

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
you've watched our videos and then when

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.869 
you've watched our videos and then when
you<00:03:43.319> go<00:03:43.409> to<00:03:43.470> put<00:03:43.650> this<00:03:43.709> back<00:03:43.920> together<00:03:44.129> I'll

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
you go to put this back together I'll

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.910 
you go to put this back together I'll
demonstrate<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:45.930> we'll<00:03:46.170> just<00:03:46.200> snag<00:03:46.650> out<00:03:46.889> a

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
demonstrate this we'll just snag out a

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.619 
demonstrate this we'll just snag out a
little<00:03:47.159> like<00:03:47.310> it'll<00:03:47.579> bend<00:03:47.760> in<00:03:47.909> like<00:03:48.060> that

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
little like it'll bend in like that

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.330 
little like it'll bend in like that
okay<00:03:49.109> well<00:03:49.290> back<00:03:49.439> then<00:03:49.590> just<00:03:49.680> like<00:03:49.829> this<00:03:50.069> or

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
okay well back then just like this or

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.099 
okay well back then just like this or
maybe<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:51.000> gasket<00:03:51.420> will<00:03:51.450> flow<00:03:51.719> up<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.840> slide

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
maybe the gasket will flow up the slide

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.390 
maybe the gasket will flow up the slide
and<00:03:52.139> then<00:03:52.409> even<00:03:52.650> if<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:52.889> just<00:03:52.980> pinches<00:03:53.250> a

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
and then even if it just pinches a

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.520 
and then even if it just pinches a
little<00:03:53.670> bit<00:03:53.849> that<00:03:54.359> will<00:03:54.569> cause<00:03:54.840> water<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.379> come

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
little bit that will cause water to come

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.710 
little bit that will cause water to come
out<00:03:55.620> not<00:03:56.189> only<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.549> but<00:03:56.760> sometimes<00:03:57.000> this

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
out not only that but sometimes this

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.890 
out not only that but sometimes this
gasket<00:03:58.159> okay<00:03:59.159> is<00:03:59.400> also<00:03:59.790> flatten<00:04:00.180> spots<00:04:00.629> and

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
gasket okay is also flatten spots and

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.360 
gasket okay is also flatten spots and
you<00:04:01.139> don't<00:04:01.290> mean<00:04:01.439> like<00:04:01.530> in<00:04:01.709> here<00:04:01.889> right<00:04:02.099> here

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
you don't mean like in here right here

you don't mean like in here right here
and<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.849> starts<00:04:03.000> leaking<00:04:03.239> now<00:04:03.810> next<00:04:04.409> question

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
and it starts leaking now next question

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.059 
and it starts leaking now next question
how<00:04:05.250> do<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.489> test<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:06.120> gaskets<00:04:06.599> okay<00:04:07.590> besides

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.189 
dry because what will happen is are
different<00:04:29.940> ways<00:04:30.090> this<00:04:30.270> gasket<00:04:30.510> can<00:04:30.870> go<00:04:31.020> back

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
different ways this gasket can go back

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.800 
different ways this gasket can go back
okay<00:04:31.830> what<00:04:32.400> could<00:04:32.520> happen<00:04:32.880> is<00:04:33.000> they<00:04:33.389> can<00:04:33.539> dry

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
okay what could happen is they can dry

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.480 
okay what could happen is they can dry
out<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:34.199> you<00:04:34.260> come<00:04:34.530> really<00:04:34.800> brittle<00:04:35.099> like<00:04:35.340> for

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
out and you come really brittle like for

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.529 
out and you come really brittle like for
saying<00:04:35.699> it<00:04:35.760> like<00:04:35.880> you<00:04:36.030> live<00:04:36.150> in<00:04:36.210> an<00:04:36.360> area

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
saying it like you live in an area

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:37.719 
saying it like you live in an area
laying<00:04:36.810> in<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.110> desert<00:04:37.500> environment

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
laying in the desert environment

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.610 
laying in the desert environment
California<00:04:38.729> Nevada<00:04:39.150> you'll<00:04:39.960> soar<00:04:40.169> like<00:04:40.289> that

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
California Nevada you'll soar like that

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.080 
California Nevada you'll soar like that
maybe<00:04:40.979> deep<00:04:41.250> in<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.430> south<00:04:41.669> where<00:04:41.940> it's

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
maybe deep in the south where it's

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.330 
maybe deep in the south where it's
inland<00:04:42.570> that's<00:04:43.169> not<00:04:43.349> really<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.710> shore<00:04:43.949> this

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
inland that's not really the shore this

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.640 
inland that's not really the shore this
gas<00:04:44.639> will<00:04:44.820> dry<00:04:45.150> out<00:04:45.180> become<00:04:45.599> brittle<00:04:45.960> before

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
gas will dry out become brittle before

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.469 
gas will dry out become brittle before
it<00:04:46.740> will<00:04:46.860> actually<00:04:47.070> crush<00:04:47.580> everybody<00:04:48.210> in<00:04:48.270> some

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
it will actually crush everybody in some

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.210 
it will actually crush everybody in some
areas<00:04:48.900> you<00:04:48.930> know<00:04:49.229> warm<00:04:49.440> a<00:04:49.530> tropical<00:04:50.099> climate

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
areas you know warm a tropical climate

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.339 
areas you know warm a tropical climate
like<00:04:50.520> Hawaii<00:04:50.940> where<00:04:51.659> you're<00:04:51.780> using<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.199> pool

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
like Hawaii where you're using the pool

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.260 
like Hawaii where you're using the pool
but<00:04:52.530> continuous<00:04:53.340> duty<00:04:53.520> cycle<00:04:54.090> which<00:04:54.240> means

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
but continuous duty cycle which means

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.969 
but continuous duty cycle which means
all<00:04:54.599> the<00:04:54.690> time<00:04:54.900> you're<00:04:55.470> getting<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.800> right

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
all the time you're getting the right

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.500 
all the time you're getting the right
amount<00:04:56.039> of<00:04:56.310> moisture<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.789> gases<00:04:57.120> same<00:04:57.270> good

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
amount of moisture the gases same good

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.360 
amount of moisture the gases same good
but<00:04:58.020> it's<00:04:58.169> just<00:04:58.199> become<00:04:58.590> compressed<00:04:59.010> from<00:04:59.280> a

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
but it's just become compressed from a

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.310 
but it's just become compressed from a
lot<00:04:59.520> of<00:04:59.550> use<00:04:59.789> so<00:05:00.330> what<00:05:00.479> you<00:05:00.570> want<00:05:00.750> to<00:05:00.810> do<00:05:00.930> is<00:05:01.199> if

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
lot of use so what you want to do is if

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.750 
lot of use so what you want to do is if
the<00:05:01.440> gas<00:05:01.620> good<00:05:01.860> visually<00:05:02.250> looks<00:05:02.430> good<00:05:02.639> if<00:05:02.699> you

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
the gas good visually looks good if you

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.399 
the gas good visually looks good if you
want<00:05:02.909> to<00:05:02.940> stretch<00:05:03.180> it<00:05:03.210> out<00:05:03.389> and<00:05:03.659> if<00:05:04.050> it<00:05:04.169> doesn't

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
want to stretch it out and if it doesn't

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:05.870 
want to stretch it out and if it doesn't
break<00:05:04.560> then<00:05:05.159> it's<00:05:05.310> good<00:05:05.430> to<00:05:05.520> go

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
break then it's good to go

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.029 
break then it's good to go

about how to officially inspect your
gaskets<00:05:14.010> read<00:05:14.430> they<00:05:14.550> can<00:05:14.580> leave<00:05:14.970> you<00:05:15.060> from
