media<00:00:03.810> pc<00:00:04.319> build<00:00:04.589> i<00:00:04.859> thought<00:00:05.430> i'd<00:00:05.609> give<00:00:06.000> an

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
media pc build i thought i'd give an

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.110 
media pc build i thought i'd give an
update<00:00:06.330> on<00:00:06.600> how<00:00:07.350> things<00:00:07.379> are<00:00:07.770> going<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.250> how

update on how things are going and how

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.660 
update on how things are going and how
the<00:00:09.179> system's<00:00:09.660> configures<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.440> yeah<00:00:11.429> just

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
the system's configures and yeah just

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.419 
the system's configures and yeah just
general<00:00:12.090> impression<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:13.230> how<00:00:13.920> it's

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
general impression of of how it's

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.990 
general impression of of how it's
working<00:00:15.410> well<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.680> mean<00:00:17.400> I've<00:00:17.550> made<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> couple

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
working well I mean I've made a couple

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.630 
working well I mean I've made a couple
of<00:00:18.180> changes<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.080> media<00:00:19.410> pc<00:00:19.590> i've<00:00:20.250> put<00:00:20.609> a

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
of changes to the media pc i've put a

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.529 
of changes to the media pc i've put a
blu-ray<00:00:21.240> player<00:00:22.369> rewrite<00:00:23.369> or<00:00:23.580> blue<00:00:23.760> LG

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
blu-ray player rewrite or blue LG

blu-ray player rewrite or blue LG
blu-ray<00:00:24.960> writer<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.920> here<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.990> yeah<00:00:27.990> that's

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
blu-ray writer in here so yeah that's

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.929 
blu-ray writer in here so yeah that's
that's<00:00:28.439> quite<00:00:28.740> nice<00:00:28.920> really<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.429> more<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.880> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
that's quite nice really it's more of a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.820 
that's quite nice really it's more of a
data<00:00:30.150> storage<00:00:30.510> thing<00:00:30.869> than<00:00:31.050> than<00:00:31.439> anything

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
data storage thing than than anything

else and just for ripping cds the other
minor<00:00:34.440> change<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.920> i've<00:00:35.040> made<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.460> is

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
minor change that i've made to it is

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.910 
minor change that i've made to it is
i've<00:00:35.730> put<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:37.550> creative<00:00:38.840> x-fi<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.110> x-fi

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
i've put a creative x-fi to x-fi

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.630 
i've put a creative x-fi to x-fi
titanium<00:00:41.660> sound<00:00:42.800> card<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.950> there<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.340> reason

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
titanium sound card in there the reason

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.160 
titanium sound card in there the reason
for<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.149> because<00:00:45.180> I've<00:00:45.629> actually<00:00:45.780> put

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
for that is because I've actually put

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.630 
for that is because I've actually put
windows<00:00:46.530> seven<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.280> I'll<00:00:47.340> come<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
windows seven on that and I'll come to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.900 
windows seven on that and I'll come to
that<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.969> moment<00:00:48.770> so<00:00:49.770> yeah<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.489> sort<00:00:50.820> of

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
that in a moment so yeah just to sort of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.580 
that in a moment so yeah just to sort of
zoom<00:00:51.090> back<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> system<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.170> sort<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.440> all

ensure that the the AC current coming in

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.289 
ensure that the the AC current coming in
is<00:01:06.060> nice<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.570> clean<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.799> media<00:01:08.549> pc<00:01:09.060> they're

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
is nice and clean the media pc they're

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.450 
is nice and clean the media pc they're
running<00:01:09.659> completely<00:01:10.320> silently<00:01:10.979> i'll<00:01:11.280> just

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
running completely silently i'll just

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.920 
running completely silently i'll just
move<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> camera<00:01:12.030> up<00:01:12.330> close<00:01:16.700> no<00:01:17.700> noise<00:01:17.930> so

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
move the camera up close no noise so

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.730 
move the camera up close no noise so
totally<00:01:19.320> silently<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:20.869> cord<00:01:23.630> CPM<00:01:24.740> 2600

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
totally silently the cord CPM 2600

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.850 
totally silently the cord CPM 2600
integrated<00:01:26.310> amplifier<00:01:26.759> i<00:01:27.259> have<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> cord

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
integrated amplifier i have a cord

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.109 
integrated amplifier i have a cord
digital<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.790> analog<00:01:30.119> converter<00:01:30.150> here<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:32.119> yeah

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
digital to analog converter here so yeah

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
digital to analog converter here so yeah
this<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.420> quite<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> pretty<00:01:33.869> little<00:01:34.079> thing<00:01:34.350> also

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
this is quite a pretty little thing also

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
this is quite a pretty little thing also
what<00:01:36.000> kind<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.600> important<00:01:37.049> about<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.380> DAC<00:01:37.680> is

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
what kind of important about this DAC is

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.330 
what kind of important about this DAC is
it's<00:01:39.360> buffered<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.290> see<00:01:40.470> here<00:01:40.829> zero

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
it's buffered so you can see here zero

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.600 
it's buffered so you can see here zero
buffer<00:01:41.930> minimum<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.140> maximum<00:01:43.189> i<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.460> on

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
buffer minimum and maximum i have it on

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.359 
buffer minimum and maximum i have it on
minimum<00:01:45.450> which<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.899> there's<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.799> two-second

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
minimum which is a there's a two-second

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.429 
minimum which is a there's a two-second
delay<00:01:47.460> what's<00:01:48.270> happening<00:01:48.720> there<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
delay what's happening there is that the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.310 
delay what's happening there is that the
the<00:01:50.430> digital<00:01:51.270> data<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.720> comes<00:01:51.869> from<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
the digital data that comes from the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.010 
the digital data that comes from the
media<00:01:52.530> pc<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.549> coming<00:01:53.880> through<00:01:54.060> an<00:01:54.509> optical

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
media pc is coming through an optical

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.050 
media pc is coming through an optical
cable<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.070> good<00:01:56.310> quality<00:01:56.610> while<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:56.969> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
cable it's a good quality while it's a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.690 
cable it's a good quality while it's a

wire world supernova optical cable it's

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.539 
wire world supernova optical cable it's
coming<00:02:00.030> into<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:01.649> DAC<00:02:01.950> when<00:02:02.250> when

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
coming into here and this DAC when when

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.569 
coming into here and this DAC when when
you<00:02:02.579> use<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.000> buffer<00:02:03.530> basically<00:02:04.530> takes<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
you use the buffer basically takes the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.999 
you use the buffer basically takes the
clock<00:02:05.880> from<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.810> computer<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
clock from the computer out of the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.619 
clock from the computer out of the
signal<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.610> basically<00:02:08.729> re<00:02:09.179> clocks<00:02:09.450> it

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
signal so it basically re clocks it

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.650 
signal so it basically re clocks it

and any jitter associated with the
perhaps<00:02:15.720> lower<00:02:16.050> quality<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.710> noisy

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
perhaps lower quality and noisy

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.770 
perhaps lower quality and noisy
environment<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.300> computer

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780

produces<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> very<00:02:19.680> very<00:02:19.830> clean<00:02:20.100> sound<00:02:20.370> so

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
produces a very very clean sound so

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.820 
produces a very very clean sound so
there's<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> very<00:02:21.180> nice<00:02:21.330> DAC<00:02:21.630> I've<00:02:22.380> got<00:02:22.590> some

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
there's a very nice DAC I've got some

mentioned is windows seven so I've put a
touchscreen<00:02:43.170> monitor<00:02:43.680> on<00:02:43.800> there<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.570> you<00:02:45.570> know

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
touchscreen monitor on there so you know

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.500 
touchscreen monitor on there so you know
I<00:02:45.720> can<00:02:45.990> just<00:02:46.230> move<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.310> around<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:47.910> scroll

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
I can just move this around and scroll

through to particular pieces of music

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.110 
through to particular pieces of music
that<00:02:51.300> I<00:02:51.390> might<00:02:51.570> be<00:02:51.690> interested<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:53.580> then

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
that I might be interested in and then

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.310 
that I might be interested in and then
you<00:02:54.780> know<00:02:54.900> basically<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.970> double<00:02:56.970> click<00:02:57.240> and

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
you know basically a double click and

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:40.690 
you know basically a double click and
run<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.380> piece<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.620> music<00:02:58.830> so

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.690 

well<00:03:42.290> well<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.470> works<00:03:43.650> very<00:03:43.860> well<00:03:43.980> now<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.670> I

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
well well it works very well now so I

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.130 
well well it works very well now so I
don't<00:03:45.000> need<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.180> have<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:45.390> keyboard<00:03:45.660> or<00:03:46.020> a<00:03:46.080> mouse

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
want to or reorganize the media library

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.170 
want to or reorganize the media library
obviously<00:04:04.500> for<00:04:04.680> serious<00:04:05.370> listening<00:04:05.819> i<00:04:05.910> move

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
obviously for serious listening i move

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
obviously for serious listening i move
the<00:04:06.330> speakers<00:04:06.750> out<00:04:06.900> into<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.880> more<00:04:08.959> yeah<00:04:09.959> a

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
the speakers out into a more yeah a

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.780 
the speakers out into a more yeah a
couple<00:04:10.709> of<00:04:10.890> meters<00:04:11.130> apart<00:04:11.340> from<00:04:11.580> each<00:04:11.670> other

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
couple of meters apart from each other

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.550 
couple of meters apart from each other
two<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.480> half<00:04:12.570> meters<00:04:12.750> apart<00:04:13.140> so<00:04:13.380> that's

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
two and a half meters apart so that's

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.080 
two and a half meters apart so that's
that's<00:04:13.830> a<00:04:14.010> little<00:04:14.250> bit<00:04:14.340> better<00:04:14.459> but<00:04:14.730> just<00:04:14.790> you

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
that's a little bit better but just you

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.550 
that's a little bit better but just you
know<00:04:15.209> keeping<00:04:15.570> things<00:04:15.840> stowed<00:04:16.079> away<00:04:16.230> nicely

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
know keeping things stowed away nicely

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.120 
know keeping things stowed away nicely
their<00:04:16.919> terms<00:04:17.910> of<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.120> quality<00:04:18.530> yes<00:04:19.530> it's<00:04:19.890> it's

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
their terms of the quality yes it's it's

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.220 
their terms of the quality yes it's it's
really<00:04:20.310> really<00:04:20.640> good<00:04:20.669> so<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.450> guess<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.959> proves

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
really really good so I guess it proves

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.860 
really really good so I guess it proves
that<00:04:22.410> you<00:04:22.620> can<00:04:22.800> use<00:04:23.040> a<00:04:23.070> computer<00:04:23.460> as<00:04:24.419> part<00:04:24.750> of

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
that you can use a computer as part of

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.960 
that you can use a computer as part of
your<00:04:25.020> hi-fi<00:04:25.290> system<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:26.130> not<00:04:26.430> compromise<00:04:26.669> on

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
your hi-fi system and not compromise on

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.560 
your hi-fi system and not compromise on
sound<00:04:27.360> quality<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:29.250> suppose<00:04:29.970> with<00:04:30.150> that<00:04:30.330> it

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
sound quality and I suppose with that it

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.960 
sound quality and I suppose with that it
brings<00:04:30.750> me<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.169> end<00:04:31.200> of<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.650> story<00:04:32.490> of<00:04:32.760> the

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
brings me to the end of the story of the

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.200 
brings me to the end of the story of the
media<00:04:33.300> pc<00:04:33.479> build<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.200> i<00:04:35.130> guess<00:04:35.880> i<00:04:36.030> can

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
media pc build and i guess i can

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.620 
media pc build and i guess i can
remember<00:04:36.479> i<00:04:36.660> could<00:04:37.140> recommend<00:04:37.560> building<00:04:38.070> a<00:04:38.280> pc

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
remember i could recommend building a pc

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.620 
remember i could recommend building a pc
using<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:40.220> buffering<00:04:41.220> DAC<00:04:41.550> using<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.270> decent

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
using a buffering DAC using a decent

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.230 
using a buffering DAC using a decent
amplifier<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.669> yeah<00:04:44.669> i<00:04:44.880> mean<00:04:45.120> this

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
amplifier and yeah i mean this

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.730 
amplifier and yeah i mean this
touchscreen<00:04:45.540> monitor<00:04:46.169> of<00:04:46.260> courses<00:04:46.620> are

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
touchscreen monitor of courses are

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.890 
touchscreen monitor of courses are
really<00:04:46.950> nice<00:04:47.130> is<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:48.030> really<00:04:48.360> nice<00:04:48.479> thing<00:04:48.750> as

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
really nice is a really nice thing as
