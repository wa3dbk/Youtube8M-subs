Damn it! Where's this stupid file? It must be somewhere!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.485
Woah, was that what he said?
-HEY!

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.482
Do you..want to..buy..shoes?

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.548
Hm?

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:20.548
We will postpone the meeting

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.000
Good evening!

00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:38.000
What do you want?
-Ehm, what do you mean, you "sell time"?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Well, I'm just selling time...in handy boxes!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
"Time"

00:01:48.578 --> 00:01:52.000
Howsoever, I might need this. Give me one of those.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.500
Here you are.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.684
And, eh..use it carefully!
-Yeah....

00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:12.000
*Mobile rings*

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.515
Honey, when will you be here?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.617
Yeah, I'm on my way.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We don't see each other much. You are always working!
-I promise. Today I've got some extra time for you!

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Okaaay..See you.
-See you later.

00:02:55.514 --> 00:02:59.541
Ehm..hey!
-Hi!

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.644
What have you brought me there?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
As I said before: Extra time for you.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.964
Ehhhmm...

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Oh, thank you for giving me your time today!
-Eh?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Great news! There's more work for you!

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Hmpf

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.125
I'm sorry, but I can't finish it.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Hm, I think I know how to help you.

00:04:01.123 --> 00:04:03.895
So you're selling time?
-Eh

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.468
I buy your whole stock! Send it to this address!

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Goodbye.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
*Swearing*

00:04:32.456 --> 00:04:37.000
All of them are empty?! What's this crap?

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.000
I spend all of my money..for NOTHING?!?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I will bring him to justice!
He will pay for this!

00:04:45.462 --> 00:04:48.545
Here try this one. It should work.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
You deceiver!!
-Ah!

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.154
I knew you would come again!

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
You are a liar! Your boxes don't work anymore!

00:05:12.132 --> 00:05:19.000
Hehehe, time..can't be bought. It can only be gifted.

00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:23.000
You talk rubbish! My boss wants his money back!

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.894
I'm sorry. There's no refund!

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Hm, you are crazy.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Hey, do you want to buy time?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.915
