compare<00:03:35.840> this<00:03:36.019> now<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.260> my<00:03:36.620> homemade

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
compare this now to my homemade

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.490 
compare this now to my homemade
moisturizing<00:03:37.670> shampoo<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:38.660> compared<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.350> that

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
moisturizing shampoo so compared to that

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.590

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
I think it's just okay but if I had

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.330 
I think it's just okay but if I had
never<00:03:41.810> tried<00:03:42.110> by<00:03:42.260> moisturizing<00:03:42.590> shampoo<00:03:42.829> I

never tried by moisturizing shampoo I

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.590

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.700 
mist I'm very afraid to use this because
it's<00:06:52.520> supposed<00:06:52.850> to<00:06:52.940> provide<00:06:53.210> whole<00:06:53.540> it<00:06:53.930> it

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
it's supposed to provide whole it it

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.650 
it's supposed to provide whole it it
looks<00:06:55.070> just<00:06:55.370> scary<00:06:56.000> because<00:06:56.270> it's<00:06:56.420> it's

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
looks just scary because it's it's

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.140 
looks just scary because it's it's
reminding<00:06:57.380> me<00:06:57.380> of<00:06:57.560> this<00:06:58.010> which<00:06:58.610> did<00:06:58.850> not<00:06:58.880> work

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
reminding me of this which did not work

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.600 
reminding me of this which did not work
out<00:06:59.300> for<00:06:59.510> me<00:06:59.860> so<00:07:00.860> I<00:07:00.890> will<00:07:01.190> let<00:07:01.340> you<00:07:01.460> know<00:07:01.520> how

so that's just a really quick

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.170 
so that's just a really quick
impressions<00:07:24.950> of<00:07:25.040> the<00:07:25.130> line<00:07:25.340> overall<00:07:25.910> I<00:07:25.940> would

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:26.180 
impressions of the line overall I would
