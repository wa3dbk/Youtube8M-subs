00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.689
 taking advantage of this mini break from 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.970
 football this week we want to take a

 Ojito to another sports competition that

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.550
 travel the three thousand 430 kilometers that 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.059
 they separate the same past from Paris 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.309
 while the 198 cyclists of the 22 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.530
 participating teams climb mountains 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.329
 they fight against the clock and draw everything 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.789
 type of obstacles tiredness and 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.829
 rivalries here are some data from 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:46.159
 this almost century-old competition 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.749
 cyclist madam rocked to pedal the 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.760
 Tour de France was the first 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:52.999
 cyclist competition by stages of the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.190
 history that was in 1903 when 60 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:58.460
 cyclists enjoyed 6 stages to 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.739
 complete two thousand 428 kilometers on 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.329
 French Morgan Kagan was the first to 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.610
 crossing the finish line in that first 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.670
 occasion for it received six thousand 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.060
 francs 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.350
 1915 1918 no race was disputed 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.479
 due to the First World War 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.600
 panorama that was repeated between 1940 in 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.850
 1946 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.799
 due to the second formerly the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.080
 runners could only use one 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.970
 bike during the whole tour so 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.130
 if it broke down they had to repair it 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.290
 themselves in the known place and 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.290
 remembered is the feat of eugène 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.869
 christophe that in 1913 had to travel 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.060
 14 kilometers on foot to take your 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.429
 front fork rotates up to one 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.410
 smithy to be able to keep running the 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.750
 sports commissioners were up to the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.140
 place to check that he himself would 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.970
 the repair in 1956 began to 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.580
 allow the change of punctured wheels 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.409
 the first two editions were run 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.140
 also at night so bicycles 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.149
 they had poor lighting 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.399
 but enough cycling is a 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.560
 sport shaken by the scandals of 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.240
 doping the first record you have 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.539
 of illicit substance use 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.640
 prohibited was in 1924 when the 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.660
 Felix brothers taught him 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.880
 journalist 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.160
 london part of his diet included in 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.860
 his backpacks cocaine strychnine and 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.220
 some pills of suspicious colors 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.230
 in 1966 the first ones were introduced 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.000
 anti-doping controls if in spite of the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.580
 strike that cyclists did this 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.440
 year since then several brokers have 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.690
 been disqualified for consuming 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.910
 stimulating substances that enhance the 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.440
 agency performance and put them in 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.720
 advantage over the rest of the 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.640
 competitors death has also been 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.590
 very present in this sport 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.800
 some of the most shocking were 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.380
 those of 1935 when the Spanish francisco 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.560
 zepeda crashed his bike on the ride 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.690
 of cali biel that of 1967 when the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.310
 British Tom Simpson died of 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.710
 exhaustion after having ingested 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.190
 amphetamines to withstand the rise of 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.470
 monte ventoux or when in 1995 the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.710
 italian fabio casartelli chocó 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.320
 mortally in the Pyrenees in 1906 the 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.270
 tour leaves france and goes through some 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.100
 kilometers from germany the organization 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.350
 he had to ask the German policemen 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.150
 that they did not open oral processes to 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.329
 cyclists for exceeding the 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.459
 of speed allowed since 1960 is 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.579
 common that some stage passes through some 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.470
 country I define since 1975 the line of 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.629
 arrival is established in the fields 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.849
 Elysees de Paris The tourmalet is the 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.310
 port that has been promoted the most times 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:36.370
 a total of 72 times follows the 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.829
 galibier with 57 extensions and this year 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.049
 it will go up twice in 24 hours to 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.390
 commemorate 100 years of its first 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.920
 extension another great peak is the alpe 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.299
 d'huez also present in this 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.519
 competition that requires a 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.090
 physical condition and a concentration 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.040
 mental like few sports in 1919 it 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.840
 decided that yellow was the color 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.670
 representative of the leader of each stage 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.519
 the first time is not known

 runner in wearing the yellow mesh 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.849
 some unforgettable names that 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.950
 They wore yellow they were france 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.900

 front drew in 1929 and there was no 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.620
 way to declare a single winner like that 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.900
 that the three of them dressed in yellow 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.360
 logan fignon and pedro delgado achieved 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.759
 one of the most attractive rivalries of

 all tours greg lemond won the tour 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:35.310
