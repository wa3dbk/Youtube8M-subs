00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.420
 I was able to wear it today 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.990
 8 Today 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:18.740
 using r 8 mtr 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:25.650
 What kind of equipment is normal to record ? 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:28.800
 I think that I want to explain how to use and serve Settings 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.090
 First of all 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.510
 It is basic things microphone 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.960
 Microphone 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.960
 This is positive 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.130
 Anything is fine, but 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:48.850
 I will try to stay in Sudan 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:51.220
 So you can use quite a Sirena do first is good if there is a Well those of reasonable price 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.010
 I think it is not 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.589
 so 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.589
 Even though it's a cable that connects the microphone 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:08.000
 Nde has become a painter say terminal where the railway I microphone that 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.230
 If you are connected to a microphone, this is definitely something like this 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.079
 Type of 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:18.840
 It will be correct 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:22.710
 It is Toka well that karaoke in capital destination Kedomo that is the other side of you 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.920
 I think the feeling you are using is of this type 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.480
 Though it is such a sound document of your mother, 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.790
 In the case of r 8 of maa, this type is good and 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:38.320
 I of 8 one more such type 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.820
 Kedomo Canon I have a the Tteyuu considerably you can use any Madochira 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.680
 that 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.680
 I'm connecting floor 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.830
 Though you're connected here 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.780
 Sagiko the woman grinding in this type 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.130
 I will stab 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.210
 car 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.890
 this 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.940
 Even type 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.940
 I will stab it 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:09.640
 There is no problem at all 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.640
 I think it would be nice if you could use a certain cable 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.060
 That's it 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.860
 Microphone stand eh 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.069
 Something like this 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.970
 8 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.070
 The body is for the tabletop 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.740
 Approach 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:32.530
 I brought it but 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:36.530
 Originally seems to be a live house often 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.860
 I think that the brain will support the sweet sky to sleep on the floor someday 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.610
 As we brought almost for explanation 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.610
 Something like this 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.200
 so 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.740
 It is a microphone but 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.750
 Japanese- like Japan 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.750
 It will bloom on the stand 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.140
 Manufacturer 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.530
 Death ne 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.700
 It is a pop guard here 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.690
 2 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.690
 Also I'd like this 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.340
 I'm attaching it 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.760
 Well, even if this is not my first 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.350
 For example, worn-out stockings something the 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:31.800
 Hangers and money high with a needle 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.130
 There are also people who use it often When you do not change the time of the student of the book 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.300
 Doing right under 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:42.440
 Why do n't you have a dedicated action 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.710
 Have you used this money that there was a certain person 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.710
 doing 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.720
 It is such a feeling as an image well 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.879
 Sometimes seal of say Tatte sing 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.630
 So as not to hit not a ne single military uniform or a go 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:14.350
 It is for this if possible 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.350
 The upper is good , so it is also possible to substitute with stockings 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.650

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.860

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.380
 Mike 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.840
 Though I conclude to m 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.040
 North 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.040
 From the microphone
