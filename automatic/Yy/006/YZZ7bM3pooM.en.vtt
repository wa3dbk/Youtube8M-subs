00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
it's sort of locked in there and then to

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.070 
it's sort of locked in there and then to
open<00:01:55.790> it<00:01:56.120> again<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:56.479> just<00:01:56.660> use<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.810> little

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
open it again you just use a little

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.630 
open it again you just use a little
force<00:01:57.260> and<00:01:57.560> pull<00:01:57.680> it<00:01:57.770> out<00:01:57.920> which<00:01:58.190> I<00:01:58.310> can't<00:01:58.520> do

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
force and pull it out which I can't do

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.410 
force and pull it out which I can't do
with<00:01:58.670> one<00:01:58.970> hand

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
the way to the back to turn it on let's

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.160 
the way to the back to turn it on let's
take<00:02:07.940> a<00:02:07.970> quick<00:02:08.240> look<00:02:08.450> at<00:02:08.570> the<00:02:08.660> back<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:09.020> the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
lamp on the left hand side here we have

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.380 
lamp on the left hand side here we have
a<00:02:11.600> power<00:02:11.810> button<00:02:12.200> on<00:02:12.620> or<00:02:12.920> off<00:02:13.070> we<00:02:13.850> have<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.060> timer

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
a power button on or off we have a timer

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.840 
a power button on or off we have a timer
that<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.840> can<00:02:14.990> set<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.290> 120<00:02:16.220> seconds

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
that you can set to 120 seconds

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.540 
that you can set to 120 seconds
180<00:02:17.810> seconds<00:02:18.320> or<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.770> can<00:02:18.920> set<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.220> timer

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
180 seconds or you can set it to timer

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.370 
180 seconds or you can set it to timer
off<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.209> when<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:20.570> off<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.930> will<00:02:21.050> run<00:02:21.260> in

off and when it's off it will run in

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.850 
off and when it's off it will run in
continuous<00:02:22.010> mode<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:22.790> most<00:02:23.360> UV<00:02:23.930> products<00:02:24.650> will

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
continuous mode so most UV products will

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.800 
continuous mode so most UV products will
cure<00:02:25.070> in<00:02:25.160> 120<00:02:25.730> seconds<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.120> be<00:02:26.330> sure<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.510> read

nails now having the button on the back

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.449 
nails now having the button on the back
is<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.750> little<00:02:39.230> inconvenient<00:02:39.890> for<00:02:40.040> home<00:02:40.220> use

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
is a little inconvenient for home use

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.030 
is a little inconvenient for home use
it's<00:02:40.760> probably<00:02:41.269> better<00:02:41.420> for<00:02:41.750> someone<00:02:41.930> use<00:02:42.350> but

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
it's probably better for someone use but

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.470 
it's probably better for someone use but
if<00:02:43.250> you're<00:02:43.400> using<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.790> lamp<00:02:43.970> at<00:02:44.120> home<00:02:44.269> you

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
if you're using the lamp at home you

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.780 
if you're using the lamp at home you
simply<00:02:44.810> reach<00:02:44.989> around<00:02:45.340> behind<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.489> lamp<00:02:46.610> and

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
simply reach around behind the lamp and

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.600 
simply reach around behind the lamp and
push<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.120> button<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.980> let's<00:02:49.010> talk<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.489> little

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
push that button so let's talk a little

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.750 
push that button so let's talk a little
bit<00:02:49.850> about<00:02:50.120> size<00:02:50.450> as<00:02:51.230> far<00:02:51.260> as<00:02:51.620> UV<00:02:51.920> lamps<00:02:52.280> go<00:02:52.459> it

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
bit about size as far as UV lamps go it

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.430 
bit about size as far as UV lamps go it
is<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:52.940> one<00:02:53.180> handed<00:02:53.480> lamp<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:53.870> it's<00:02:53.989> not<00:02:54.170> as<00:02:54.290> to

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
is a one handed lamp so it's not as to

is a one handed lamp so it's not as to
you<00:02:54.530> just<00:02:54.739> some<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:54.920> them<00:02:55.160> but<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.550> still<00:02:55.760> a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
you just some of them but it is still a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.880 
you just some of them but it is still a
pretty<00:02:56.060> good<00:02:56.150> size<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:57.230> I'm<00:02:57.500> gonna<00:02:57.620> take<00:02:57.800> a

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
pretty good size and I'm gonna take a

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.740 
pretty good size and I'm gonna take a
step<00:02:58.160> back<00:02:58.370> here<00:02:58.580> just<00:02:58.820> so<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.000> can<00:02:59.269> see<00:02:59.570> my

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
step back here just so you can see my

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.080 
step back here just so you can see my
nail<00:02:59.930> station<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.489> can<00:03:01.640> see<00:03:01.820> how<00:03:01.940> much

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
nail station and you can see how much

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.540 
nail station and you can see how much
space<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.480> lamp<00:03:02.930> takes<00:03:03.230> up<00:03:03.470> on<00:03:03.650> my<00:03:03.980> on<00:03:04.489> my

table also for comparison purposes I
have<00:03:07.970> here<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.890> Melody's<00:03:10.580> Suzy<00:03:10.910> 12<00:03:11.239> watt<00:03:11.480> LED

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
have here the Melody's Suzy 12 watt LED

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.199 
have here the Melody's Suzy 12 watt LED
lamp<00:03:12.320> which<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.190> can<00:03:13.340> see<00:03:13.519> is<00:03:13.610> considerably

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
lamp which you can see is considerably

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.660 
lamp which you can see is considerably
smaller<00:03:14.600> and<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:15.019> is<00:03:15.170> pretty<00:03:15.380> typical<00:03:15.670> LED

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
smaller and that is pretty typical LED

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.400 
smaller and that is pretty typical LED
lamps<00:03:17.030> are<00:03:17.120> usually<00:03:17.540> smaller<00:03:17.810> than<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.140> UV

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
lamps are usually smaller than the UV

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.680 
lamps are usually smaller than the UV
lamps<00:03:18.769> but<00:03:19.459> just<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:20.000> know<00:03:20.150> so<00:03:20.359> you<00:03:20.450> can<00:03:20.570> get

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
lamps but just you know so you can get

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.320 
lamps but just you know so you can get
an<00:03:20.780> idea<00:03:20.840> of<00:03:21.139> the<00:03:21.290> size<00:03:21.470> it

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
an idea of the size it

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.020 
an idea of the size it
take<00:03:22.600> up<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.870> fair<00:03:23.110> amount<00:03:23.200> of<00:03:23.380> space<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:24.790> is

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
take up a fair amount of space it is

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.030 
take up a fair amount of space it is
considered<00:03:25.480> portable<00:03:25.870> because<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:26.650> can<00:03:26.830> pick

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
considered portable because you can pick

well I have this LED lamp out let's talk
a<00:03:42.360> little<00:03:42.510> bit<00:03:42.780> about<00:03:43.080> some<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.500> the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
a little bit about some of the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.970 
a little bit about some of the
differences<00:03:44.160> between<00:03:44.220> UV<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.270> LED<00:03:45.810> lamps<00:03:46.290> so

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
differences between UV and LED lamps so

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.340 
differences between UV and LED lamps so
in<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.430> back<00:03:47.580> here<00:03:47.610> again<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.330> is<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.720> UV

off when it was done automatically and
last<00:06:57.730> step<00:06:57.940> is<00:06:58.180> just<00:06:58.210> to<00:06:58.480> wipe<00:06:58.750> off<00:06:58.960> that<00:06:58.990> tacky

ease of use and ease of cleaning the
only<00:07:21.130> trade<00:07:21.400> off<00:07:21.580> for<00:07:21.850> me<00:07:21.970> is<00:07:22.180> the<00:07:22.420> curing

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:22.810 
only trade off for me is the curing

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.090 
only trade off for me is the curing
times<00:07:23.080> at<00:07:23.320> two<00:07:23.500> minutes

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.100

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.530 
obviously that's longer than LED which

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.590 
obviously that's longer than LED which
is<00:07:26.680> thirty<00:07:26.920> seconds<00:07:27.400> but<00:07:27.940> again<00:07:28.180> this<00:07:28.330> does

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:28.600 
is thirty seconds but again this does
