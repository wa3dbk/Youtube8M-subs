00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
gave it to me I think I want to do is

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.080 
gave it to me I think I want to do is
just<00:00:25.279> I'm<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.609> put<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.910> right

just I'm just going to put that right
there<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.689> think<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:29.279> think<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.730> would<00:00:29.820> look<00:00:29.880> diff

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
there I think I think it would look diff

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.519 
there I think I think it would look diff
appropriate<00:00:30.570> right<00:00:30.720> there<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.410> would

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
appropriate right there and it would

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.110 
appropriate right there and it would
suit<00:00:31.710> me<00:00:31.920> very<00:00:32.099> well<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:32.940> about

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the right size and look lot better than

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.319
