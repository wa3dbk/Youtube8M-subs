all<00:00:00.960> right<00:00:01.079> in<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.260> clip<00:00:01.319> we're<00:00:01.620> going<00:00:01.650> to

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
all right in this clip we're going to

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.350 
all right in this clip we're going to
teach<00:00:01.949> you<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.159> basics<00:00:02.580> of<00:00:02.700> driving<00:00:03.270> an

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
teach you the basics of driving an

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.240 
teach you the basics of driving an
automatic<00:00:03.750> transmission<00:00:04.140> vehicle<00:00:04.799> it's

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
automatic transmission vehicle it's

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.980 
automatic transmission vehicle it's
important<00:00:05.670> of<00:00:05.850> two<00:00:06.480> major<00:00:06.690> differences

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
important of two major differences

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.780 
important of two major differences
between<00:00:07.290> automatic<00:00:07.740> transmissions<00:00:08.639> and

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
between automatic transmissions and

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.850 
between automatic transmissions and
manual<00:00:09.059> transmission<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:10.050> there<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.410> no

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
manual transmission one there is no

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.530 
manual transmission one there is no
clutch<00:00:11.250> pedal<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:11.910> there's<00:00:12.059> really<00:00:12.179> nothing

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
clutch pedal so there's really nothing

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.240 
clutch pedal so there's really nothing
for<00:00:12.719> your<00:00:12.809> left<00:00:13.019> foot<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.500> except<00:00:13.889> just<00:00:14.040> sit

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
for your left foot to do except just sit

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.770 
for your left foot to do except just sit
idle<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.700> entire<00:00:15.000> time<00:00:15.269> you're<00:00:15.420> driving

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
idle the entire time you're driving

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.650 
idle the entire time you're driving
secondly<00:00:16.590> instead<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.279> manual<00:00:18.060> stick<00:00:18.390> shift

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
secondly instead of a manual stick shift

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.510 
secondly instead of a manual stick shift
you've<00:00:18.960> got<00:00:19.170> essentially<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.710> gear<00:00:20.039> selector

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
you've got essentially a gear selector

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.310 
you've got essentially a gear selector
that<00:00:20.670> allows<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.210> pick<00:00:21.900> different

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
that allows you to pick different

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.470 
that allows you to pick different
positions<00:00:22.740> from<00:00:22.920> Park<00:00:23.279> reverse<00:00:23.519> neutral<00:00:23.730> or

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
positions from Park reverse neutral or

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.019 
positions from Park reverse neutral or
just<00:00:25.109> drive<00:00:25.619> once<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.369> put<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.880> D

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
just drive once you put in the D

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.359 
just drive once you put in the D
position<00:00:27.510> essentially<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.710> vehicle<00:00:29.130> does

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
position essentially the vehicle does

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.730 
position essentially the vehicle does
the<00:00:29.640> rest<00:00:29.910> as<00:00:30.179> far<00:00:30.420> as<00:00:30.539> picking<00:00:30.990> what<00:00:31.289> gear<00:00:31.619> it

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
the rest as far as picking what gear it

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.650 
the rest as far as picking what gear it
should<00:00:31.949> be<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.340> under<00:00:32.640> what<00:00:32.850> circumstances

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
should be in under what circumstances

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.450 
should be in under what circumstances
it's<00:00:34.230> also<00:00:34.380> important<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.860> note<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.130> can't

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
it's also important to note you can't

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.299 
it's also important to note you can't
take<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:36.030> gear<00:00:36.930> selector<00:00:37.380> out<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:38.010> park

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
take this gear selector out of park

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.549 
take this gear selector out of park
unless<00:00:39.059> you've<00:00:39.239> actually<00:00:39.420> depressed<00:00:40.260> your

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
unless you've actually depressed your

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.619 
unless you've actually depressed your
foot<00:00:40.860> onto<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.489> brake<00:00:41.730> that's<00:00:42.149> essentially

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
foot onto the brake that's essentially

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.420 
foot onto the brake that's essentially
just<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.870> keep<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.320> make<00:00:43.649> sure<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.070> know<00:00:44.399> that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
just to keep you make sure you know that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.389 
just to keep you make sure you know that
you<00:00:44.879> want<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.329> go<00:00:45.510> into<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.960> gear<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:47.039> once<00:00:47.280> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
you want to go into a gear so once you

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.459 
you want to go into a gear so once you
get<00:00:47.550> yourself<00:00:47.910> ready<00:00:48.149> situated<00:00:48.960> buckled<00:00:49.350> in

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
get yourself ready situated buckled in

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.920 
get yourself ready situated buckled in
put<00:00:50.160> your<00:00:50.280> foot<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> brake<00:00:50.840> shifting<00:00:51.840> in

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
put your foot on the brake shifting in

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.229 
put your foot on the brake shifting in
and<00:00:52.079> drive<00:00:52.379> take<00:00:53.129> foot<00:00:53.340> off<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> brake<00:00:53.820> and

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and drive take foot off the brake and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
and drive take foot off the brake and
the<00:00:54.329> car<00:00:54.360> will<00:00:54.750> build<00:00:55.020> itself<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.559> little

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
the car will build itself a little

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.139 
the car will build itself a little
momentum<00:00:56.100> that's<00:00:56.460> because<00:00:56.760> there<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.120> no

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
momentum that's because there is no

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.180 
momentum that's because there is no
clutch<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:57.960> there's<00:00:58.170> no<00:00:58.350> way<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.829> vehicle

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
clutch so there's no way for the vehicle

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.880 
clutch so there's no way for the vehicle
to<00:00:59.340> take<00:00:59.670> full<00:01:00.149> engine<00:01:00.570> power<00:01:00.780> away<00:01:01.410> from<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
to take full engine power away from the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.830 
to take full engine power away from the
transmission<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.969> you're<00:01:03.120> always<00:01:03.300> kind<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
transmission so you're always kind of

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.870 
transmission so you're always kind of
putting<00:01:04.350> some<00:01:04.680> sort<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.010> power<00:01:05.220> down<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
putting some sort of power down to the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.370 
putting some sort of power down to the
transmission<00:01:06.330> at<00:01:06.630> all<00:01:06.720> times<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> only

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
transmission at all times and the only

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.539 
transmission at all times and the only
way<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.619> bring<00:01:07.770> yourself<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> full<00:01:08.430> stop

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
way to bring yourself to a full stop

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.179 
way to bring yourself to a full stop
actually<00:01:09.119> hold<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> brake<00:01:10.200> but

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
actually hold on to the brake but

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.190 
actually hold on to the brake but
otherwise<00:01:11.430> what<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.240> get<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.049> either

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
otherwise what you get going it's either

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.070 
otherwise what you get going it's either
gas<00:01:13.560> four<00:01:13.860> go<00:01:14.040> break<00:01:14.820> four<00:01:15.030> stomp<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.810> it's

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
gas four go break four stomp and it's

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.830 
gas four go break four stomp and it's
fairly<00:01:16.290> simple<00:01:16.790> now<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.970> some<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> modern

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
fairly simple now on some of the modern

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.929 
fairly simple now on some of the modern
automatic<00:01:19.350> transmissions<00:01:20.159> you've<00:01:20.670> got

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
automatic transmissions you've got

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.390 
automatic transmissions you've got
what's<00:01:21.869> called<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.229> manual<00:01:22.710> gear<00:01:22.950> selector

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
what's called a manual gear selector

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
what's called a manual gear selector
selector<00:01:23.939> or<00:01:24.090> trip<00:01:24.479> tronic<00:01:24.900> depending<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.350> who

you<00:01:37.110> would<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.549> shift<00:01:38.610> it

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you would like to be in so you shift it

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.840 
you would like to be in so you shift it
just<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> over<00:01:40.140> position<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.740> down<00:01:41.340> for

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
just to the over position and down for

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.569 
just to the over position and down for
down<00:01:42.060> gears<00:01:42.420> once<00:01:43.049> again<00:01:43.350> no<00:01:43.649> clutch<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
down gears once again no clutch just a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.149 
down gears once again no clutch just a
simple<00:01:44.939> push<00:01:45.119> down<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.500> go<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.890> gears

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
simple push down and up to go up gears

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.569 
simple push down and up to go up gears
so<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.880> wanted<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.390> hold<00:01:49.259> first<00:01:49.920> gear<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
so if I wanted to hold first gear and

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.700 
so if I wanted to hold first gear and
not<00:01:51.149> allow<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.509> vehicle<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.079> shift<00:01:52.500> any

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
not allow the vehicle to shift any

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.560 
not allow the vehicle to shift any
further<00:01:52.950> than<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.640> would<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.149> put<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.479> in

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
further than that I would just put it in

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.600 
further than that I would just put it in
this<00:01:54.659> position<00:01:54.930> push<00:01:55.710> all<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.009> way<00:01:56.130> down<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
this position push all the way down and

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.280 
this position push all the way down and
notice<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.090> vehicle<00:01:57.540> cannot<00:01:57.990> shift

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
notice that the vehicle cannot shift

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.620 
notice that the vehicle cannot shift
from<00:01:58.619> first<00:01:58.950> until<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.640> tell<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> tale<00:02:00.450> with<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
from first until I tell the tale with a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.090 
from first until I tell the tale with a
simple<00:02:00.990> click<00:02:01.229> up

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
