calm and in this video I want to tell
you<00:00:03.540> how<00:00:03.720> you<00:00:03.780> can<00:00:03.929> make<00:00:04.110> multiple<00:00:04.620> exposure

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
you how you can make multiple exposure

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.190 
you how you can make multiple exposure
images<00:00:06.690> with<00:00:07.170> your<00:00:07.919> DSLR<00:00:08.790> with<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.780> multiple

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
images with your DSLR with the multiple

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.390 
images with your DSLR with the multiple
exposure<00:00:10.500> function<00:00:11.040> or<00:00:12.290> with<00:00:13.290> Photoshop<00:00:13.769> not

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
exposure function or with Photoshop not

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.790 
exposure function or with Photoshop not
all<00:00:14.670> DSLRs<00:00:15.030> have<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.020> multiple<00:00:16.500> exposure

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
all DSLRs have the multiple exposure

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.570 
all DSLRs have the multiple exposure
function<00:00:17.390> although<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:19.020> think<00:00:19.500> all<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
function although I think all the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.540 
function although I think all the
higher-end<00:00:21.510> Nikon<00:00:22.109> cameras<00:00:22.470> do<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.890> some<00:00:23.460> of

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
higher-end Nikon cameras do and some of

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.849 
higher-end Nikon cameras do and some of
the<00:00:23.640> Canon<00:00:24.420> cameras<00:00:25.019> do<00:00:25.170> as<00:00:25.289> well<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.710> I'll

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
the Canon cameras do as well so I'll

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.900 
the Canon cameras do as well so I'll
leave<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.070> link<00:00:26.310> down<00:00:26.400> below<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.849> the

description for all that information but
in<00:00:29.010> any<00:00:29.160> case<00:00:29.429> what<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> multiple<00:00:30.990> exposure

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
in any case what is a multiple exposure

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.470 
in any case what is a multiple exposure
all<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.460> where<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.850> take<00:00:33.030> one<00:00:33.059> picture

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
all it is is where you take one picture

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.540 
all it is is where you take one picture
and<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.710> take<00:00:34.860> another<00:00:35.070> picture<00:00:35.250> right<00:00:35.520> on

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and you take another picture right on

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.760 
and you take another picture right on
top<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.510> blends<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.200> two<00:00:37.410> photos

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
top of it and it blends the two photos

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.799 
top of it and it blends the two photos
together<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.790> actually<00:00:38.910> gets<00:00:39.180> brighter

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
together and it actually gets brighter

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.840 
together and it actually gets brighter
so<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:41.010> one<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.219> want<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.430> show<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.670> how<00:00:41.820> to

that says multiple exposure you'll find

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.650 
that says multiple exposure you'll find
it<00:01:01.559> look<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.829> your<00:01:01.920> instruction<00:01:02.399> manual<00:01:02.730> you

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
want to turn autogain off because you

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.929 
want to turn autogain off because you
want<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.470> make<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.979> pictures<00:01:08.310> brighter<00:01:08.700> as

want to make the pictures brighter as
you<00:01:09.060> go<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.689> if<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.110> had<00:01:10.290> out<00:01:10.439> again<00:01:10.680> on

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
you go on if you if you had out again on

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.000 
you go on if you if you had out again on
it<00:01:11.400> would<00:01:11.549> try<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.820> automatically<00:01:12.680> zero<00:01:13.680> out

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
it would try to automatically zero out

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.789 
it would try to automatically zero out
the<00:01:14.670> exposure<00:01:15.630> value<00:01:15.840> which<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.530> don't<00:01:16.680> want

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the exposure value which you don't want

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.380 
the exposure value which you don't want
to<00:01:16.860> do<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.130> leave<00:01:17.250> autogain<00:01:17.640> off<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.270> this

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
to do is to leave autogain off for this

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.780 
to do is to leave autogain off for this
particular<00:01:18.960> example<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.710> want<00:01:20.460> number<00:01:20.729> of

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
particular example you want number of

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.030 
particular example you want number of
shots<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.240> although<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.530> do<00:01:22.680> more<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:22.950> you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
want to click most of exposure mode and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.649 
want to click most of exposure mode and
then<00:01:25.890> click<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:27.500> series<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.829> then<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.420> go

then click on series and then you can go

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.480 
then click on series and then you can go
around<00:01:30.750> take<00:01:31.110> one<00:01:31.380> picture<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:32.280> take

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
around take one picture and then take

another picture and then I'll take those

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.340 
another picture and then I'll take those
two<00:01:35.100> pictures<00:01:35.810> squish<00:01:36.810> them<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.020> top<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.229> one

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
two pictures squish them on top of one

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.380 
two pictures squish them on top of one
another<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.860> then<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.670> are<00:01:38.880> good<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.210> go

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
all right so the sneaky secret to get

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.160 
all right so the sneaky secret to get
the<00:01:41.460> high<00:01:41.729> key<00:01:42.259> multiple<00:01:43.259> exposure<00:01:45.170> nature

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
the high key multiple exposure nature

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.319 
the high key multiple exposure nature
self<00:01:46.649> portrait<00:01:47.189> photos<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.670> look<00:01:47.790> really<00:01:48.060> good

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
self portrait photos to look really good

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.819 
self portrait photos to look really good
is<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:49.890> first<00:01:50.159> put<00:01:50.490> your<00:01:50.610> camera<00:01:50.960> into<00:01:51.960> spot

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
is to first put your camera into spot

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.520 
is to first put your camera into spot
metering<00:01:53.250> mode<00:01:53.630> then<00:01:54.630> put<00:01:54.899> your<00:01:54.960> camera<00:01:55.170> into

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
metering mode then put your camera into

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.560 
metering mode then put your camera into

the focus point in the center and then

take a picture of your self now if you

take the picture correctly and if you

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.150 
take the picture correctly and if you
take<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.200> sky<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.530> against<00:02:11.069> the

you should see the blinky lights when

all those are indicating is that the

it's not maxed out white but it's still

it's not maxed out white but it's still
pretty<00:02:28.100> close<00:02:28.400> it'll<00:02:29.060> probably<00:02:29.600> be<00:02:30.080> fine<00:02:30.160> so

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
pretty close it'll probably be fine so

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.060 
pretty close it'll probably be fine so
now<00:02:31.310> you've<00:02:31.550> got<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.850> first<00:02:32.150> shot<00:02:32.800> like<00:02:33.800> that

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
now you've got the first shot like that

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.120 
now you've got the first shot like that
next<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:35.030> want<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.420> bump<00:02:36.410> up<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.770> exposure

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
next you want to bump up the exposure

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.390 
next you want to bump up the exposure
compensation<00:02:37.490> about<00:02:38.300> two<00:02:38.630> stops<00:02:39.020> so<00:02:39.980> that

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
compensation about two stops so that

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.970 
compensation about two stops so that
when<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.760> aim<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.030> up<00:02:41.240> at<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.480> tree<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:42.140> blows

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
when you aim it up at the tree it blows

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.650 
when you aim it up at the tree it blows
out<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.310> background<00:02:43.670> completely<00:02:44.209> because

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
out the background completely because

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.280 
out the background completely because
tree<00:02:44.900> branches<00:02:45.410> are<00:02:45.620> not<00:02:45.830> as<00:02:46.010> solid<00:02:46.400> as<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:47.570> face

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
tree branches are not as solid as a face

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.490 
tree branches are not as solid as a face
I<00:02:48.650> will<00:02:49.160> be<00:02:49.310> right<00:02:49.700> back<00:02:49.850> one<00:02:50.150> second<00:02:53.500> alright

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
I will be right back one second alright

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.820 
I will be right back one second alright
I<00:02:54.770> am<00:02:54.830> back<00:02:55.600> here's<00:02:56.600> my<00:02:56.780> result<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.230> got<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.560> just

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
I am back here's my result I got I just

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.130 
I am back here's my result I got I just
took<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.070> literally<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:59.030> few<00:02:59.690> seconds<00:03:00.080> from

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
took that literally a few seconds from

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.770 
took that literally a few seconds from
now<00:03:00.230> as<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:00.980> can<00:03:01.100> see<00:03:01.250> it's<00:03:01.400> not<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.820> best

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
now as you can see it's not the best

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.560 
now as you can see it's not the best
thing<00:03:03.170> but<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.680> does<00:03:03.830> give<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.570> example

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
thing but it does give you the example

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.449 
thing but it does give you the example
of<00:03:05.630> what<00:03:05.780> I'm<00:03:05.870> talking<00:03:06.230> about<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:07.040> just<00:03:07.250> need

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
of what I'm talking about you just need

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.090 
of what I'm talking about you just need
to<00:03:07.550> make<00:03:07.700> sure<00:03:08.110> that<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.260> first<00:03:09.410> photo<00:03:09.950> you

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
to make sure that the first photo you

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.460 
to make sure that the first photo you
take<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.489> your<00:03:10.610> face<00:03:10.880> spot<00:03:11.510> metering<00:03:11.810> zero

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
take of your face spot metering zero

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.350 
take of your face spot metering zero
evey<00:03:12.860> second<00:03:13.820> photo<00:03:14.000> about<00:03:14.989> plus<00:03:15.500> two<00:03:15.739> EB<00:03:16.100> all

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
evey second photo about plus two EB all

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.100 
evey second photo about plus two EB all
situations<00:03:17.360> are<00:03:17.480> different<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:17.870> you<00:03:17.930> will

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
situations are different so you will

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.440 
situations are different so you will
have<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.350> experiment<00:03:18.739> but<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.760> key<00:03:19.910> is<00:03:20.120> just

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
have to experiment but the key is just

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.000 
have to experiment but the key is just
to<00:03:20.570> get<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.810> background<00:03:21.019> blown<00:03:21.650> out<00:03:21.830> white

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
to get the background blown out white

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
to get the background blown out white
and<00:03:22.220> then<00:03:22.519> you're<00:03:22.640> good<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:22.880> go

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
and then you're good to go

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.880 
and then you're good to go
it<00:03:23.209> is<00:03:23.390> very<00:03:23.630> hit<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:23.930> miss<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:24.620> will

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
it is very hit and miss you will

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.699 
it is very hit and miss you will
probably<00:03:25.130> be<00:03:25.700> taking<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.500> dozens<00:03:27.500> if<00:03:27.680> not

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
probably be taking a dozens if not

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.620 
probably be taking a dozens if not
hundreds<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.370> photos<00:03:28.519> to<00:03:28.850> get<00:03:29.000> one<00:03:29.239> good<00:03:29.480> one

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
hundreds of photos to get one good one

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.720 
hundreds of photos to get one good one
you<00:03:30.140> can<00:03:30.440> plan<00:03:30.769> out<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.070> shots<00:03:31.310> though<00:03:31.549> it's

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
you can plan out the shots though it's

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.310 
you can plan out the shots though it's
not<00:03:31.850> like<00:03:32.030> it's<00:03:32.209> all<00:03:32.390> completely<00:03:32.900> hit<00:03:33.200> and

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
not like it's all completely hit and

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.259 
not like it's all completely hit and
miss<00:03:33.440> you<00:03:33.620> can<00:03:33.769> plant<00:03:34.040> them<00:03:34.130> out<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.519> you<00:03:35.120> can

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
miss you can plant them out and you can

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.810 
miss you can plant them out and you can
get<00:03:35.890> consistent<00:03:36.890> good<00:03:37.100> results<00:03:37.549> if<00:03:37.640> you<00:03:37.700> know

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820

color<00:05:13.610> of<00:05:13.880> course<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.510> it<00:05:15.350> will<00:05:15.500> always<00:05:15.740> be

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
color of course and it will always be

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.160 
color of course and it will always be
consistent<00:05:17.750> just<00:05:18.080> like<00:05:18.200> that<00:05:18.380> um<00:05:20.170> here's

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
consistent just like that um here's

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.650 
consistent just like that um here's
another<00:05:21.410> example<00:05:21.560> I<00:05:22.010> took<00:05:22.250> I<00:05:22.520> blew<00:05:23.420> out<00:05:23.630> the
