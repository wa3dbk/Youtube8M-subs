pixel<00:00:19.060> art<00:00:19.150> for<00:00:19.390> you<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:20.619> um<00:00:21.010> I'm<00:00:21.550> gonna<00:00:21.910> talk

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
pixel art for you so um I'm gonna talk

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.330 
pixel art for you so um I'm gonna talk
through<00:00:22.570> how<00:00:22.779> many<00:00:22.990> blocks<00:00:23.200> into<00:00:23.529> place<00:00:23.619> and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
through how many blocks into place and

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.360 
through how many blocks into place and
etc<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.840> start<00:00:26.440> this<00:00:26.650> fix<00:00:26.860> what<00:00:27.039> you<00:00:27.130> need<00:00:27.280> to

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.370 
etc so start this fix what you need to

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.320 
etc so start this fix what you need to
place<00:00:27.850> one<00:00:28.240> block<00:00:28.770> on<00:00:29.770> the<00:00:29.920> ground<00:00:30.190> yeah<00:00:31.090> then

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
place one block on the ground yeah then

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.170 
place one block on the ground yeah then
wait<00:00:31.720> up<00:00:32.230> so<00:00:32.890> one<00:00:33.100> block<00:00:33.340> there<00:00:33.640> they<00:00:33.910> want<00:00:34.090> to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
wait up so one block there they want to

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.040 
wait up so one block there they want to
go<00:00:34.239> diagonal<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:37.510> diagonal<00:00:38.340> 36<00:00:40.050> more

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
go diagonal for diagonal 36 more

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.150 
go diagonal for diagonal 36 more
diagonal<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.920> like<00:00:45.250> that<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.620> then<00:00:47.800> you<00:00:48.070> want

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
diagonal so like that and then you want

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.130 
diagonal so like that and then you want
to<00:00:48.280> come<00:00:49.470> one<00:00:50.470> more<00:00:50.710> so<00:00:51.040> one<00:00:51.670> two<00:00:52.149> three<00:00:52.180> four

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
to come one more so one two three four

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.569 
to come one more so one two three four
five<00:00:53.880> like<00:00:54.880> that<00:00:55.829> all<00:00:56.829> right<00:00:57.040> after<00:00:57.370> that<00:00:57.460> you

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
five like that all right after that you

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.610 
five like that all right after that you
want<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:57.760> go<00:00:57.820> diagonal<00:00:58.540> one<00:00:58.989> then<00:00:59.559> up<00:00:59.739> to<00:01:00.540> then

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
want to go diagonal one then up to then

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.320 
want to go diagonal one then up to then
across<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.969> two<00:01:04.390> three<00:01:05.020> four<00:01:05.500> five<00:01:06.330> across

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
across one two three four five across

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.050 
across one two three four five across
five<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:08.020> make<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.229> first<00:01:08.259> like<00:01:08.800> arm<00:01:09.100> I'm

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
five to make the first like arm I'm

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.499 
five to make the first like arm I'm
doing<00:01:10.450> this<00:01:11.020> in<00:01:11.259> red<00:01:11.530> just<00:01:12.130> for<00:01:12.280> an<00:01:12.340> example<00:01:12.509> so

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
doing this in red just for an example so

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.590 
doing this in red just for an example so
you<00:01:14.409> can<00:01:15.040> use<00:01:15.190> whatever<00:01:15.310> color<00:01:15.820> we<00:01:15.880> would<00:01:16.360> like

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
you can use whatever color we would like

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:27.440 
you can use whatever color we would like
um<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.950> your<00:01:18.220> place<00:01:21.659> 123456<00:01:22.659> up<00:01:22.960> then

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.140 

123456789<00:01:29.310> across<00:01:32.010> all<00:01:33.010> right<00:01:33.250> after<00:01:34.000> that

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
123456789 across all right after that

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.710 
123456789 across all right after that
you<00:01:34.240> want<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.450> go<00:01:34.600> one<00:01:35.159> two<00:01:36.159> three<00:01:37.090> diagonal

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
you want to go one two three diagonal

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.480 
you want to go one two three diagonal
and<00:01:38.710> miss<00:01:39.040> diagonal<00:01:39.670> here<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:41.470> might<00:01:41.619> go<00:01:41.770> 1<00:01:42.130> 2

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
and miss diagonal here you might go 1 2

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:51.899 
and miss diagonal here you might go 1 2

will<00:02:01.659> come<00:02:01.869> down<00:02:02.290> diagonal<00:02:02.970> 12<00:02:04.470> lot<00:02:06.090> okay<00:02:08.519> all

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
will come down diagonal 12 lot okay all

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.199 
will come down diagonal 12 lot okay all
right<00:02:09.729> now<00:02:10.690> come<00:02:10.899> across<00:02:11.170> one<00:02:11.500> two<00:02:11.980> three<00:02:12.640> four

want<00:02:53.980> on<00:02:54.980> my<00:02:55.040> one<00:02:55.370> in<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.580> background<00:02:56.000> i<00:02:56.180> have

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
want on my one in the background i have

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.780 
want on my one in the background i have
done<00:02:56.959> read<00:02:57.230> that<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.680> can<00:02:57.890> jump<00:02:58.430> will<00:02:58.640> do

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
done read that you can jump will do

so it's need to fill all of it in um
with<00:03:09.800> me<00:03:09.980> our<00:03:10.100> background<00:03:10.700> but<00:03:10.970> um<00:03:12.580> you've

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
with me our background but um you've

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.750 
with me our background but um you've
just<00:03:13.760> gotta<00:03:13.970> if<00:03:14.720> you<00:03:15.650> basically<00:03:16.280> just<00:03:16.459> gotta
