00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.660 
evenly and slowly through you really
want<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.439> focus<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> curls<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.520> this

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
want to focus on the curls because this

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.460 
want to focus on the curls because this
hairstyle<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.210> definitely<00:01:21.840> about<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.200> curls

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
hairstyle is definitely about the curls

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.940 
hairstyle is definitely about the curls
and<00:01:22.649> less<00:01:22.890> about<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.190> actual<00:01:23.700> hairstyle<00:01:24.950> so

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and less about the actual hairstyle so

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.620 
and less about the actual hairstyle so
just<00:01:26.159> repeat<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.490> process<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.240> bottom

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
just repeat that process for the bottom

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.789 
just repeat that process for the bottom
part<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.930> your<00:01:28.170> curls<00:01:28.409> should<00:01:28.590> come<00:01:28.770> out

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
part and your curls should come out

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.160 
part and your curls should come out
something<00:01:29.399> like<00:01:29.580> this<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.090> now<00:01:30.899> you<00:01:30.930> just

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
something like this and now you just

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.779 
something like this and now you just
want<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> take<00:01:31.649> down<00:01:31.830> that<00:01:32.009> hair<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.340> top<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
want to take down that hair on top and

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.359 
want to take down that hair on top and
resection<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.899> you<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.619> middle<00:01:35.100> part

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
resection it so you have the middle part

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.320 
resection it so you have the middle part
down<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.670> free<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.509> work<00:01:36.689> with<00:01:38.060> don't<00:01:39.060> worry

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
down and free to work with don't worry

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.609 
down and free to work with don't worry
if<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.539> don't<00:01:39.659> get<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> curls<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.409> first

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
if you don't get the curls the first

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.200 
if you don't get the curls the first
time<00:01:40.830> around<00:01:40.950> they<00:01:41.310> are<00:01:41.429> a<00:01:41.490> little<00:01:42.000> bit

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
time around they are a little bit

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.359 
time around they are a little bit
confusing<00:01:42.690> when<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.050> explain<00:01:43.560> them<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.220> once

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
you are getting the curls down we're

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.550 
you are getting the curls down we're
going<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.819> switch<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.240> up<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.289> middle

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
going to switch it up so for the middle

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.169 
going to switch it up so for the middle
and<00:01:58.740> top<00:01:58.890> sections<00:01:59.429> what<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.700> want<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.940> do<00:02:00.060> is

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
and top sections what you want to do is

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:01.789 
and top sections what you want to do is
clamp<00:02:00.479> down<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> straightener<00:02:01.170> wrap<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
clamp down the straightener wrap the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.289 
clamp down the straightener wrap the
hair<00:02:01.979> around<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.490> then<00:02:02.640> rotate<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
hair around but then rotate the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.699 
hair around but then rotate the
straightener<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.959> hair<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.259> coming<00:02:04.590> out

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
straightener so the hair is coming out

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:06.889 
straightener so the hair is coming out
of<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> bottom<00:02:05.159> instead<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.060> top<00:02:06.179> so<00:02:06.810> you

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
of the bottom instead of the top so you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.570 
of the bottom instead of the top so you
get<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.080> full<00:02:07.440> rotation<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:08.100> there<00:02:08.280> which<00:02:08.429> will

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
get a full rotation in there which will

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.400 
get a full rotation in there which will
make<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.940> curls<00:02:09.209> definitely<00:02:09.780> tighter<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:10.319> a

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
make the curls definitely tighter and a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.330 
make the curls definitely tighter and a
lot<00:02:10.619> more<00:02:10.649> bouncy<00:02:12.290> this<00:02:13.290> process<00:02:13.739> will<00:02:13.920> create

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
lot more bouncy this process will create

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.340 
lot more bouncy this process will create
a<00:02:14.400> really<00:02:14.850> cool<00:02:14.910> effect<00:02:15.390> because<00:02:16.079> you<00:02:16.200> get

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
a really cool effect because you get

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.960 
a really cool effect because you get
tighter<00:02:16.620> curls<00:02:16.950> on<00:02:17.070> top<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.519> looser<00:02:17.790> on<00:02:17.820> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
tighter curls on top of looser on the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.640 
tighter curls on top of looser on the
bottom<00:02:18.299> so<00:02:18.750> let's<00:02:18.930> see<00:02:19.079> that<00:02:19.230> one<00:02:19.440> more<00:02:19.500> time

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
bottom so let's see that one more time

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.870 
bottom so let's see that one more time
so<00:02:20.070> I'm<00:02:20.310> going<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.519> clamp<00:02:20.670> down<00:02:20.850> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
so I'm going to clamp down the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.460 
so I'm going to clamp down the
straightener<00:02:21.450> OOP<00:02:21.870> clamp<00:02:22.290> down<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
straightener OOP clamp down the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.530 
straightener OOP clamp down the
straightener<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.040> then<00:02:23.670> spin<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.329> hair

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
straightener and then spin the hair

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.060 
straightener and then spin the hair
around<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.140> then<00:02:25.260> rotate<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.650> straightener

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
around and then rotate the straightener

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.620 
around and then rotate the straightener
so<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.370> actually<00:02:26.700> hanging<00:02:27.120> out<00:02:27.329> the<00:02:27.480> bottom

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
so it's actually hanging out the bottom

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.559 
so it's actually hanging out the bottom
and<00:02:28.079> then<00:02:28.470> pull<00:02:28.680> evenly<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.400> slowly<00:02:29.700> through

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.289 

if<00:02:34.930> your<00:02:35.860> curls<00:02:36.159> don't<00:02:36.400> feel<00:02:36.579> springy<00:02:37.030> or

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
if your curls don't feel springy or

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.630 
if your curls don't feel springy or
bouncy<00:02:37.750> which<00:02:37.959> is<00:02:38.110> always<00:02:38.620> not<00:02:38.829> good<00:02:39.099> what

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
bouncy which is always not good what

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.369 
bouncy which is always not good what
helps<00:02:39.969> is<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.180> after<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:40.900> curl<00:02:41.140> with<00:02:41.290> the

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
helps is to after you curl with the

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.050 
helps is to after you curl with the
strainer<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.739> kind<00:02:42.099> of<00:02:42.159> twist<00:02:42.489> it<00:02:42.609> around<00:02:42.760> your

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
strainer to kind of twist it around your

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.699 
strainer to kind of twist it around your
finger<00:02:43.359> in<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.569> direction<00:02:43.719> that<00:02:44.049> it<00:02:44.230> goes<00:02:44.379> and

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
finger in the direction that it goes and

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.410 
finger in the direction that it goes and
it<00:02:44.950> kind<00:02:45.129> of<00:02:45.189> lightens<00:02:45.519> it<00:02:45.760> up<00:02:45.879> and<00:02:46.090> helps<00:02:46.329> it

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
it kind of lightens it up and helps it

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.970 
it kind of lightens it up and helps it
just<00:02:46.599> kind<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:46.900> spring<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.409> little<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.829> gives

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
just kind of spring a little and gives

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.099 
just kind of spring a little and gives
it<00:02:48.099> a<00:02:48.129> little<00:02:48.310> more<00:02:48.549> bounce<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.599> all<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.959> want

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
it a little more bounce so all you want

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.020 
it a little more bounce so all you want
to<00:02:50.170> do<00:02:50.260> is<00:02:50.469> repeat<00:02:51.159> this<00:02:51.310> same<00:02:51.519> process<00:02:51.579> for

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
to do is repeat this same process for

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.569 
to do is repeat this same process for
the<00:02:52.239> entire<00:02:52.629> middle<00:02:53.019> section<00:02:53.409> and<00:02:53.530> just<00:02:54.430> as<00:02:54.549> a

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
the entire middle section and just as a

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:55.890 
the entire middle section and just as a
sneak<00:02:54.849> peak<00:02:55.060> we're<00:02:55.239> going<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.450> be<00:02:55.540> doing<00:02:55.780> the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
sneak peak we're going to be doing the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.860 
sneak peak we're going to be doing the
exact<00:02:56.230> same<00:02:56.439> thing<00:02:56.680> for<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.950> top<00:02:57.099> section<00:03:00.870> so

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
exact same thing for the top section so

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.780 
exact same thing for the top section so
right<00:03:02.200> after<00:03:02.379> I'm<00:03:02.739> finished<00:03:03.189> curling<00:03:03.549> this

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
right after I'm finished curling this

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.849

lot of shorter layers in my hair that

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.339 
lot of shorter layers in my hair that
are<00:03:12.189> about<00:03:12.430> chin<00:03:13.090> length<00:03:13.329> so<00:03:13.900> as<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.049> can<00:03:14.200> see

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
are about chin length so as you can see

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.539 
are about chin length so as you can see
the<00:03:14.470> curls<00:03:14.709> really<00:03:15.069> spring<00:03:15.549> up<00:03:15.669> which<00:03:15.879> I<00:03:16.000> love

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
the curls really spring up which I love

the curls really spring up which I love
so<00:03:18.549> tada<00:03:18.909> this<00:03:19.419> is<00:03:19.569> what<00:03:19.720> your<00:03:19.840> hair<00:03:20.019> should

comb just to give it a little bit of

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.449 
comb just to give it a little bit of
volume<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:44.109> doesn't<00:03:44.709> have<00:03:44.829> to<00:03:44.919> be<00:03:45.040> too<00:03:45.280> much

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
that the teasing doesn't create a lot of

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.479 
that the teasing doesn't create a lot of
frizziness<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:53.049> it<00:03:53.379> looks<00:03:53.620> pretty<00:03:53.979> smooth<00:03:54.280> so

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
frizziness and it looks pretty smooth so

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.699 
frizziness and it looks pretty smooth so
just<00:03:54.699> brush<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.150> out<00:03:55.269> really<00:03:56.079> gently<00:03:56.530> and

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709
