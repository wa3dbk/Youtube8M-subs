00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
you do not latch the hook on the actual

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.210 
you do not latch the hook on the actual
braid<00:01:48.990> I'm<00:01:49.289> about<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.590> point<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> actual

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
braid I'm about to point to the actual

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.440 
braid I'm about to point to the actual
break<00:01:50.399> don't<00:01:50.579> latch<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.180> hook<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.420> that

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
break don't latch the hook on that

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.870 
break don't latch the hook on that

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
twist hair you're gonna divide it up

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.090 
twist hair you're gonna divide it up
until<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.289> get<00:02:01.439> something<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.950> looks

doing that all the way back get the best
results<00:02:41.459> with<00:02:41.519> this<00:02:41.790> if<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.540> braid<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.140> you

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
wherever you're going to put the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.069 
wherever you're going to put the
invisible<00:02:54.060> part<00:02:54.209> make<00:02:54.480> sure<00:02:54.660> it's<00:02:54.810> not<00:02:54.959> as

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
invisible part make sure it's not as

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.390 
invisible part make sure it's not as
tight<00:02:55.260> as<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.560> rest<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.799> your<00:02:55.950> braids

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
tight as the rest of your braids

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.539 
tight as the rest of your braids
it<00:02:56.459> just<00:02:56.760> looks<00:02:56.910> way<00:02:57.090> better<00:02:57.269> when<00:02:57.569> it's

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
it just looks way better when it's

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.340 
it just looks way better when it's
looser<00:02:59.549> in<00:02:59.790> my<00:03:00.389> opinion<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.989> don't<00:03:01.109> have<00:03:01.230> to

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
looser in my opinion you don't have to

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.920 
looser in my opinion you don't have to
do<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.829> but<00:03:02.069> in<00:03:02.280> my<00:03:02.400> opinion<00:03:02.760> that's<00:03:02.910> what<00:03:03.900> I

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
do that but in my opinion that's what I

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.770 
do that but in my opinion that's what I
do<00:03:04.079> and<00:03:05.299> that's<00:03:06.299> basically<00:03:06.600> what<00:03:06.750> you're

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
do and that's basically what you're

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.110 
do and that's basically what you're
going<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.049> do<00:03:07.139> that's<00:03:07.319> it<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:08.850> just<00:03:08.970> keep

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
going to do that's it you just keep

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.460 
going to do that's it you just keep
