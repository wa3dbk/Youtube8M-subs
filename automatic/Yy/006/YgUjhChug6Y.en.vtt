introduce you to our machine Slayer and
this<00:00:30.570> machine<00:00:30.929> was<00:00:31.050> designed<00:00:31.790> about<00:00:33.500> six

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
this machine was designed about six

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.620 
this machine was designed about six
years<00:00:34.710> ago<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:35.250> started<00:00:35.460> rd<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.450> machine

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
years ago we started rd on this machine

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.060 
years ago we started rd on this machine
and<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:38.100> reason<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.520> started<00:00:38.790> was<00:00:39.620> my<00:00:40.620> family

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
and the reason we started was my family

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.060 
and the reason we started was my family
my<00:00:41.280> brothers<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.610> myself<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:43.070> coffee

my brothers and myself are coffee

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.600 
my brothers and myself are coffee
roasters<00:00:44.610> from<00:00:44.910> Calgary<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.890> we<00:00:46.890> had<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
roasters from Calgary and we had a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.690 
roasters from Calgary and we had a
desire<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.870> make<00:00:49.079> coffee<00:00:49.649> better<00:00:50.219> than<00:00:50.579> we

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
desire to make coffee better than we

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.850 
desire to make coffee better than we
could<00:00:50.820> make<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.239> standard<00:00:52.110> espresso<00:00:52.469> machines

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
could make on standard espresso machines

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.830 
could make on standard espresso machines
the<00:00:53.579> biggest<00:00:53.879> thing<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.090> standard<00:00:54.510> espresso

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the biggest thing on standard espresso

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.709 
the biggest thing on standard espresso
machines<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.820> extract<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> espresso<00:00:57.480> at

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
machines as you extract the espresso at

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.970 
machines as you extract the espresso at
only<00:00:58.350> nine<00:00:58.559> bars<00:00:58.859> what<00:00:59.850> Slayer<00:01:00.180> we've<00:01:00.980> found

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
only nine bars what Slayer we've found

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.950 
only nine bars what Slayer we've found
out<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:03.030> get<00:01:03.420> more<00:01:03.719> from

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
out that you can actually get more from

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.700 
out that you can actually get more from
that<00:01:03.989> coffee<00:01:04.439> by<00:01:05.220> having<00:01:06.090> two<00:01:06.360> stages<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that coffee by having two stages in the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.340 
that coffee by having two stages in the
extraction<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> first<00:01:09.780> stage<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
extraction and in the first stage of the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.800 
extraction and in the first stage of the
extraction<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.979> call<00:01:11.159> pre<00:01:11.460> brew<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
extraction I call pre brew and in the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.140 
extraction I call pre brew and in the
pre<00:01:12.990> brew<00:01:13.200> phase<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> very<00:01:14.490> restricted

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
pre brew phase we have a very restricted

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.469 
pre brew phase we have a very restricted
slow<00:01:16.250> infusion<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> water<00:01:17.970> into<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
slow infusion of the water into the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.020 
slow infusion of the water into the
coffee<00:01:18.720> once<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> saturation<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
coffee once we see the saturation on the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.789 
coffee once we see the saturation on the
bottom<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> basket<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:22.409> move<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
bottom of the basket we move the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.170 
bottom of the basket we move the
actuator<00:01:23.220> over<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> full<00:01:23.939> pressure

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
actuator over to the full pressure

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.780 
actuator over to the full pressure
position<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.799> where<00:01:25.920> we're<00:01:26.100> going

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
position and this is where we're going

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.120 
position and this is where we're going
to<00:01:26.939> actually<00:01:27.119> extract<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.900> espresso<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:29.009> is

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
to actually extract the espresso this is

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.170 
to actually extract the espresso this is
a<00:01:29.159> very<00:01:29.189> similar<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.320> what<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.470> do<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:32.180> Pemex

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
a very similar to what we do on Pemex

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.390 
a very similar to what we do on Pemex
and<00:01:33.509> other<00:01:34.049> pour-over<00:01:34.409> methods<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.159> coffee

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and other pour-over methods of coffee

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.780 
and other pour-over methods of coffee
where<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:35.970> where<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.689> slowly<00:01:37.140> add<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.920> small

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
where we where we slowly add a small

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.420 
where we where we slowly add a small
amount<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.240> water<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> coffee<00:01:40.430> before

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
amount of water to the coffee before

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.160 
amount of water to the coffee before
brewing<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.180> that's<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> same<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:42.840> Slayer

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
brewing and that's the same with Slayer

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.230 
brewing and that's the same with Slayer
essentially<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.040> are<00:01:44.130> doing<00:01:44.310> when<00:01:45.090> we're

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
essentially what we are doing when we're

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.300 
essentially what we are doing when we're
in<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> pre<00:01:45.689> brew<00:01:45.930> position<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.890> slowly

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
in the pre brew position is just slowly

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.340 
in the pre brew position is just slowly
adding<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.000> water<00:01:48.180> waiting<00:01:48.990> for<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
adding the water waiting for the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.310 
adding the water waiting for the
saturation<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.759> appear<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.750> bottom<00:01:52.079> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
saturation to appear on the bottom of

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.960 
saturation to appear on the bottom of
the<00:01:52.439> Porta<00:01:52.710> filter<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.610> at<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.909> point

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the Porta filter and it's at that point

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.700 
the Porta filter and it's at that point
that<00:01:54.390> we're<00:01:54.570> going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.750> kick<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.140> full

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
that we're going to kick in full

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.109 
that we're going to kick in full
pressure<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.399> I'm<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.729> give<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
pressure so I'm going to just give you a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.930 
pressure so I'm going to just give you a
little<00:01:57.180> demonstration<00:01:57.420> right<00:01:58.229> now

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.390 

so<00:02:03.540> we<00:02:04.050> move<00:02:04.230> the<00:02:04.380> actuator<00:02:04.800> into<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.160> middle

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
so we move the actuator into the middle

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.990 
so we move the actuator into the middle
and<00:02:05.930> now<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.590> water<00:02:07.830> is<00:02:08.070> flowing<00:02:08.400> slowly

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
and now the the water is flowing slowly

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.940 
and now the the water is flowing slowly
into<00:02:09.900> the<00:02:09.930> coffee<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.560> something<00:02:10.890> that's

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
into the coffee this is something that's

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.580 
into the coffee this is something that's
very<00:02:11.040> important<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.420> slower<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.110> water<00:02:13.320> goes

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
very important the slower the water goes

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.890 
very important the slower the water goes
into<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.980> coffee<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.670> finer<00:02:15.060> we<00:02:15.540> have<00:02:15.750> to

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
into the coffee the finer we have to

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.660 
into the coffee the finer we have to
grind<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:17.010> espresso<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.060> when<00:02:18.210> that<00:02:18.240> happens

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.690 

when<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.849> happens<00:02:22.329> we<00:02:23.200> have<00:02:23.230> much<00:02:24.040> smaller

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
when that happens we have much smaller

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.240 
when that happens we have much smaller
particle<00:02:25.329> sizes<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.260> what<00:02:26.769> we're<00:02:26.920> going<00:02:27.099> to

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
particle sizes and what we're going to

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.339 
particle sizes and what we're going to
do<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:27.670> extract<00:02:27.939> more<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.569> oils<00:02:28.930> out<00:02:29.140> of

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
do is extract more of the oils out of

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.520 
do is extract more of the oils out of
the<00:02:29.409> espresso<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.900> increases<00:02:32.379> the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
the espresso that increases the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.800 
the espresso that increases the
mouthfeel<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:34.420> also<00:02:34.750> reduces<00:02:34.930> bitterness<00:02:36.810> and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
mouthfeel it also reduces bitterness and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.630 
mouthfeel it also reduces bitterness and
you<00:02:37.930> end<00:02:38.109> up<00:02:38.200> with<00:02:38.319> a<00:02:38.379> sweeter<00:02:38.799> more<00:02:39.129> balanced

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
you end up with a sweeter more balanced

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.599 
you end up with a sweeter more balanced
espresso<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:41.590> more<00:02:41.769> pleasant<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.280> drink

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
espresso that is more pleasant to drink

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:46.500 
espresso that is more pleasant to drink
and<00:02:43.409> when<00:02:44.409> you<00:02:44.530> add<00:02:44.709> milk<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.159> this<00:02:45.430> coffee<00:02:45.700> it

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
and when you add milk to this coffee it

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.720 
and when you add milk to this coffee it
is<00:02:46.720> also<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.079> much<00:02:47.349> more<00:02:47.530> enjoyable<00:02:47.730> beverage

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
is also a much more enjoyable beverage

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.449
