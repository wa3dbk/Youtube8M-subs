00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.140 
will be warm I'm a little bit lucky I am
a<00:03:50.019> little<00:03:50.350> bit<00:03:50.530> lucky<00:03:50.920> because<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.880> weather

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
a little bit lucky because the weather

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.540 
a little bit lucky because the weather
in<00:03:52.390> Denmark<00:03:52.810> isn't<00:03:53.290> really<00:03:53.890> that<00:03:54.100> more<00:03:54.459> in

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
in Denmark isn't really that more in

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.660 
in Denmark isn't really that more in
most<00:03:54.730> days<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.780> can<00:03:56.170> actually<00:03:56.320> I<00:03:56.800> can

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
most days so I can actually I can

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.430 
most days so I can actually I can
actually<00:03:58.000> still<00:03:58.510> wear<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.750> saying<00:03:59.140> that<00:03:59.410> I

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
actually still wear it saying that I

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.090 
actually still wear it saying that I
wear<00:04:00.070> it<00:04:00.220> at<00:04:00.340> spring<00:04:00.700> or<00:04:00.910> so<00:04:01.269> but<00:04:02.170> yeah<00:04:02.530> as<00:04:02.860> you

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
wear it at spring or so but yeah as you

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.940 
wear it at spring or so but yeah as you
can<00:04:03.130> see<00:04:03.489> they<00:04:04.480> are<00:04:04.510> very<00:04:04.840> thin<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:05.500> try<00:04:05.890> to

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
can see they are very thin I try to

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.890 
can see they are very thin I try to
avoid<00:04:06.220> that<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:06.970> can<00:04:07.209> see<00:04:07.390> through<00:04:07.630> them

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
avoid that you can see through them

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.550 
avoid that you can see through them
because<00:04:08.050> otherwise<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:09.010> need<00:04:09.190> to

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
because otherwise I need to

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.830 
because otherwise I need to
under<00:04:10.010> it<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.610> will<00:04:10.760> still<00:04:11.030> be<00:04:11.060> warm<00:04:11.450> so

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
under it and it will still be warm so

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.080 
under it and it will still be warm so
definitely<00:04:12.560> go<00:04:12.890> after<00:04:13.250> something<00:04:13.520> that<00:04:13.730> you

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
definitely go after something that you

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.940 
definitely go after something that you
don't<00:04:14.450> need<00:04:14.599> to<00:04:14.810> wear<00:04:14.959> something<00:04:15.200> under<00:04:15.650> and

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
don't need to wear something under and

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.250 
don't need to wear something under and
you<00:04:16.400> will<00:04:16.519> be<00:04:16.639> good<00:04:16.940> wearing<00:04:17.239> those<00:04:17.570> with<00:04:17.900> some

you will be good wearing those with some

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.530 
you will be good wearing those with some
white<00:04:18.470> pants<00:04:18.859> or<00:04:19.220> a<00:04:19.459> skirt<00:04:19.489> or<00:04:20.030> whatever<00:04:20.359> you

Tunnock's and they will be great with
some<00:05:09.740> pants<00:05:10.190> they<00:05:11.150> are<00:05:11.330> you<00:05:12.050> know<00:05:12.139> just<00:05:12.169> like

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
some pants they are you know just like

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.550 
some pants they are you know just like
big<00:05:12.710> button<00:05:13.130> downs<00:05:13.580> but<00:05:14.140> maybe<00:05:15.140> this<00:05:15.320> is<00:05:15.410> more

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
big button downs but maybe this is more

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.880 
big button downs but maybe this is more
like<00:05:15.740> a<00:05:15.770> button-up<00:05:16.300> but<00:05:17.300> a<00:05:17.690> bit<00:05:18.050> longer<00:05:18.320> so

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
like a button-up but a bit longer so

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.620 
like a button-up but a bit longer so
it's<00:05:19.100> not<00:05:19.340> really<00:05:19.669> that<00:05:19.729> big<00:05:20.060> difference<00:05:20.479> if

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
it's not really that big difference if

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.930 
it's not really that big difference if
you<00:05:20.750> want<00:05:20.960> some<00:05:21.229> more<00:05:21.680> coverage<00:05:22.130> something<00:05:22.850> a

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
you want some more coverage something a

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.450 
you want some more coverage something a
bit<00:05:23.120> longer<00:05:23.330> then<00:05:23.690> definitely<00:05:23.900> go<00:05:24.320> for<00:05:24.460> tonics

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
bit longer then definitely go for tonics

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.180 
bit longer then definitely go for tonics
still<00:05:26.150> stay<00:05:26.870> away<00:05:27.110> from<00:05:27.169> the<00:05:27.560> super<00:05:27.890> super

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
still stay away from the super super

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.070 
still stay away from the super super
white<00:05:28.430> ones<00:05:28.700> because<00:05:29.150> they<00:05:29.750> will<00:05:29.930> be

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
white ones because they will be

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.350 
white ones because they will be
see-through<00:05:30.620> and<00:05:30.919> you<00:05:31.160> want<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:31.669> avoid<00:05:31.910> that

see-through and you want to avoid that

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.320 
see-through and you want to avoid that
so<00:05:32.900> go<00:05:33.680> for<00:05:33.950> the<00:05:34.039> color<00:05:34.310> it<00:05:34.490> once<00:05:34.760> and<00:05:35.060> again

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
so go for the color it once and again

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.080 
so go for the color it once and again
color<00:05:35.780> is<00:05:36.050> colors<00:05:36.800> are<00:05:37.039> beautiful<00:05:37.280> something

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090
