00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.470
 continuation to the small antec test series 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:12.360
 after the flagship nineteen acts 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:17.070
 and the mini itx housing esk 600 now 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:21.090
 the gx 500 is a cheap mainstream 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.560
 housing in midi tower format is for 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.560
 around 50 euros offered 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:53.190
 and what it can offer for this price 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:55.820
 we show in the video that is gx 500 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.190
 visually a thoroughly pleasing housing 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.449
 especially the subtle front carries her 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.460
 Part to be easy on each 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.770
 rounded off in the lower area with the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.650
 Great match that the optional 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.750
 Front fan places hidden in the upper 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.540
 area with the external drive 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.140
 places striking as there is not only 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.780
 two 5.25 inch drives places but 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.170
 even a three and a half inch drive 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:30.030
 place external of it otherwise both 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:33.060
 Most heusen extinct connections 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.020
 and control elements we find in 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.400
 Cover area easily accessible here in front 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.009
 and there is then the same from one 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.200
 big plus point for the price range 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.920
 but very remarkable there is one 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.369
 fan control two channels with jallohs 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.040
 job and heinz setting respectively exist 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.020
 also two fast usb 3.0 ports 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.299
 also not self-evident and 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.380
 we see here in the back of the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:07.439
 Lids that there are two 120 mm fans 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.569
 pre-assembled right in the lid are the 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.090
 is also remarkable dust filter 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.120
 missing in the lid area as well as 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.590
 here for the optional side panel 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.239
 fan place the third pre-assembled 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.739
 fan then sits here on the back wall 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.400
 otherwise I see classical composition 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.290
 There is no big surprise 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.010
 Schmahl guessed the cable passages 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.489
 but you will probably need less yes 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.250
 At least here for the power supply, there are 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.450
 then sometimes a dust filter that is 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.099
 of course at the place also 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.110
 more important than just in the lid 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:53.300
 The sides are beautiful with the pension 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.300
 kept screwed 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.440
 As the material is concerned, one may there 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.280
 Of course no miracles 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.799
 expect 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.530
 Of course the whole thing is not extreme 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.069
 torsion resistant the housing also right 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.709
 have easily guessed the good 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:15.019
 equipment I probably need 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.819
 save a bit on the material 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:21.060
 even the interior is not 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:24.060
 particularly elaborately designed conspicuous 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.989
 for example, that the expansion cards 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.579
 places here are obscured by such blinds 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.079
 will still have to break out the 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.079
 then not usable again 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.769
 little effort now also the tray 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.849
 after all, with recesses for the 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.370
 processor cooler assembly and for the 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.200
 cable management but any rubber 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.269
 you can not do that right now 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.370
 expect 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.889
 also the space between tray and the 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.109
 back silk is part 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.519
 manageable space for 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.900
 lay the cable 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.489
 So you have not been positive 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.950
 in contrast to that the optical 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.959
 Drives apparently mounted without tools 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.629
 become 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:16.079
 otherwise then drive places for 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:19.680
 hard drives down here and a single one 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:23.639
 SDD drive space on top of the cage 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.860
 on it this construction with the missing 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.900
 of course, the middle hdd cage has the 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.410
 advantage that the expansion cards here 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.599
 with pure guess you can there so 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.460
 Corresponding place has short to 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:39.360
 Hard disk mounting is available here 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.460
 simply drive the drives 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.510
 just get trapped there and then 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.050
 pushed into it 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.590
 However, decoupling rubber is missing 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.090
 So this feature is called comfort feature 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.570
 then you have to cut something 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.240
 do 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.510
 for that I see that it is for the 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.060
 front fan also dust filter is so 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.149
 at least the most important air intakes 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:09.219
 are protected accordingly 

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:11.249
 yes the gx 500 is a thoroughly pleasing 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.520
 midi tower with some 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:14.349
 equipment features in the 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.529
 not priced anything but 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:21.069
 Of course, of course, too 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:23.020
 with some austerity measures in relation to 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:25.300
 the material thickness in relation to the 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.059
 slotblende in relation to the 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.099
 interior design like the whole 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:31.319
 housing proven and then in practice 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.449
 like, for example, this one 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:36.819
 fan control then affects the find 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.459
 We will still be out for the test until then 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:42.749
 here our first impression unpacked 

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:42.749
 and touched video
