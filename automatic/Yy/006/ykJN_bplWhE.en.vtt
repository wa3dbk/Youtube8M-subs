00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
 and move it to a reservation in the country of 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.330
 do not 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.850
 before the repeated claims and requests 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.100
 of environmental groups so that the bear 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.620
 polar arturo has moved to canada 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.220
 the provincial government agreed to 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.050
 in a month the zoo will be visited by 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.330
 specialists from the north country this 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.330
 started in January when the bear dies 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.580
 polar winner in buenos aires we started 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.440
 is moved not only with people from 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.270
 Mendoza but with people from Buenos Aires 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.090
 of the sun or of colonies or of knowing of 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.640
 she and good the same people that we 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.610
 follow on the page on facebook took us 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.579
 to submit two petitions that are already 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.489
 presented with signature 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.339
 and good to see the reality of the polar bear 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.809
 Here in Mendoza, you can not believe that 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.250
 there is a polar bear mendoza 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.140
 our goal is for people to come 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.839
 from canada that specialist in bears 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.460
 there are not polar and what good that 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.829
 make an evaluation to the bear to see if 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.269
 can really travel web can pass 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.010
 that the bear is not in good condition 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.229
 can not travel for veterinarians 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.810
 of the zoo that look after the polar bear 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.119
 They argue that it is not advisable 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.640
 possible transfer of arturo to canada 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.729
 because the conditions of moving it is very 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.340
 risky this room is adapted 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.100
 obviously to lower temperatures 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.200
 of our summer in mendoza has 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.720
 quite high temperatures then 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.840
 is this suitable for the animal 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.690
 be in good condition your bedroom 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.119
 has two air conditioning equipment 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.539
 that work at a temperature of 16 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.179
 degrees centigrade the beach of 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.619
 exhibition has two medium fabrics 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.840
 shadow at this moment there is only one 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.939
 because the previous one broke the wind 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.489
 zonda that will be placed in the 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.020
 next few days without going into controversy 

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:50.719
 a possible arrival 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.039
 and Canadian veterinarians and a possible 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:57.259
 transfer this would affect the animal 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:02.299
 that the colleagues come does not go to 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:04.939
 accept transfer your health and transfer 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.670
 from your manager and there is always a risk of 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.250
 a manager is more today at the moment if one 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.860
 I would like to do a checkup on an animal 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.140
 like this one where you have to submit it to what 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.480
 better to a chemical containment the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.510
 chemical containment comes to in this in 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.420
 this species to a deep plane of 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.110
 sedation or anesthesia 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.890
 obviously he has his risk 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.890
 We speak
