00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hey people welcome to one 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.849
 new video from for free ski and today 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.280
 Let's take a look at the marca tue f12 etf 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.259
 So extended power frame 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.210
 We look at each other and this bond is 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.130
 even if she is good, how about the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.590
 how does it look with the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.869
 power transmission off and of course one 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.800
 end really sums up this bond 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.800
 or not 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.460
 At first you have to say this bond 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.590
 is really an amazing success 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.660
 market made it is now the bond 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.940
 from the year 13 14 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.519
 this bond absolutely combines the 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.739
 vaart performance with tours possibility 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.820
 that is, it is an intermediate one 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:56.120
 from nature and the brand duke because 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.040
 we have with the etf the extended 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.430
 powder frame an insane 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.320
 transferring power at once 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.610
 the width of the power frame we see 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.649
 us always the comparison the normal 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.940
 brand duke without the power frame and 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:15.140
 of course, the incredibly broad 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.060
 screw distance front and rear 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.130
 it is a crazy man 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.300
 advantage therefore there is maximum 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.220
 power transmission 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.860
 the fair value is from four to twelve 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.929
 as well as front and back and it one 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.909
 very clear security bond that is 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.520
 It always triggers perfect because we 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.979
 also have this slide plate in the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.560
 front button area was us crazy 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.090
 Much brings the first departure 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.310
 really they go 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.439
 insanely good off when driving down 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.100
 you can not complain it's all 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.100
 adjustable 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.020
 then for adjustability or 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.720
 compatibility with shoes and 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.060
 Technology means as much as any shoe 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.460
 happen because we can once the 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.160
 height this sledge through here in front 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.810
 a screw disguise and of course 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.470
 also the length through the screw 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.630
 that means everyone can do this 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.700
 fit and it fits everyone 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.400
 shoe on it no matter if now an alpine ski 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.850
 has or has a tour book with rock 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.500
 soul is every shoe on it then fits 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.100
 Of course, what are we interested in 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.320
 most 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.450
 how does she go on tour? 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.310
 the weight and the bond really 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.020
 for what your departure performance 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.090
 offers really insane equal zivi about 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.770
 2,200 grams per pro so not pro 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.060
 bond but both together me 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.590
 stay the weight now 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.630
 but this is not what it is 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.790
 of course we have white hearts 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.490
 again sharp braking must be at 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.320
 marca quite clearly how it looks with the 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.930
 Change to the geo mode they have here 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.180
 as a lever must we press 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.950
 Some people might say this lever 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.620
 that we crappy 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.239
 you have to get out of bond in the 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.000
 touring or back in the morning 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.680
 change but normally you pull anyway 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.700
 the ski out at slopes of the ski 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.650
 withdraw 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.590
 That's why I can not find it now 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.180
 counterpoint to the bond of the great 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.720
 advantage with this lever it the binding 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.440
 slips four on her sled 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.290
 centimeters to the rear 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.330
 that is to go on tour it is better 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.970
 if the bond is far behind 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.709
 once for tips or for others 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.660
 things just to get around it's better 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.850
 if the ski is short in the back and 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.760
 This will allow us 4 cm further forward 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.489
 drive as we go clearer plus for the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.220
 brand tour then we come to the 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.140
 Steighilfe Steigungshilfe has three levels 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.060
 once at zero degrees that means we have 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.890
 no help once to seven degrees 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.810
 and once to 13 degrees 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.820
 All in all, I have to say that is 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.910
 bond insanely good if you still 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.230
 ask to bond 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.300
 then just write down the go 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.530
 comments and if you like them 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.270
 I have thumbs up and not 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.410
 forget to subscribe until the next one 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.410
 time with freeskiers
