00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.219
 post ag is biological to stress 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.710
 In the first place it is important to understand 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.770
 the factors that determine a 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.230
 stress situation in an organism this 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.720
 it does not mean only the pathology 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.180
 psychiatric we know but 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.900
 multiple stimuli that they perceive as 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.150
 harmful or threatening 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.190
 some of these stimuli capable of 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.890
 generate stress 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.330
 damages an organism such as injuries 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.330
 for diseases 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.480
 I change the plastic in the environment like 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.200
 natural disasters or sudden changes 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.200
 a thorn 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.140
 fasting of an individual or 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.140
 inability to communicate with others 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.089
 environmental stimuli harmful or not 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.660
 perceptions of threats from those 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.060
 that occur in an instance 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.640
 competitive to those who can 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.640
 really generate a threat to die 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.230
 social factors such as competitiveness 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.600
 hostility 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.970
 etc 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.009
 and frustration or inability to meet 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.009
 objectives or meet needs 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.060
 in front of one more presto 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.490
 the organism generates an answer that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.159
 involves two pathways with hormonal effect 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.609
 and nervous 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.789
 these are the axis and position your cardinal 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:46.700
 I have lucra pituitary hypothalamus and the 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:50.060
 adrenal angula on this path the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.829
 hypothalamus activates the pituitary gland 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.439
 it would have signals to the glands 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.549
 adrenal glands so that this secret of 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.480
 two types of glucocorticoid hormones and 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.090
 adrenalin 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.670
 with another part the nervous system 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.700
 vegetative the system is activated 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.700
 sympathetic by action of the hypothalamus 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.140
 this relates to the functions 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.200
 vital and involuntary 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.450
 and in this case he will act activating 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.550
 alert functions and what is called 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.550
 a fight or running response 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.130
 3 a syndrome of 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.730
 adaptation that is put to the symptoms 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:44.670
 peaks physiological sex in three stages the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.670
 resistance and exhaustion alarm 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.420
 the alarm phase is triggered as 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.840
 first response to a stimulus 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.959
 to the kid 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.180
 includes symptoms such as an increase 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.650
 in heart rate and capacity 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.379
 respiratory 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.930
 and a redistribution of blood for 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.500
 prioritize vital functions and 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.680
 muscular 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.740
 a mobilization of the immune system for 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.020
 defend yourself very possible for all as and 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.650
 Dilation of the pupils among others 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.650
 visible signs 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.800
 you have to see it persists you go in 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.410
 a resistance phase in this the 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.380
 organism tries to recover from the effort 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.850
 performed during the alarm stage by 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.160
 what disappears in many of the 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.680
 visible symptoms and hormones 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.900
 released by pituitary hypothalamus and 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.740
 adrenal glands come back to 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.740
 normal levels 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.630
 in case the damages are obtained by 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.150
 a long time 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.480
 the organism reaches a phase of 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.180
 exhaustion this happens when the 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.340
 resources available to the Agency 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.080
 become insufficient to respond to 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.320
 latest 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.860
 due to the sustained effort they are produced 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.540
 important changes in some tissues 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.940
 often generating pathologies 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.820
 main 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.040
 this is accompanied by the appearance of a 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.020
 psychological illness is already 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.980
 combination is called disease 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.980
 psychosomatic
