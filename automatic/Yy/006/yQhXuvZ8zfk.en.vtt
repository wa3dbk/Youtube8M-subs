00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.710 
does each River have to have lighthouses
for<00:03:44.319> boats<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:45.519> come<00:03:45.730> through<00:03:46.060> here<00:03:46.330> which

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
for boats that come through here which

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.660 
for boats that come through here which
we<00:03:46.840> get<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:46.989> lot<00:03:47.170> of<00:03:47.200> boats<00:03:47.440> we<00:03:47.650> get<00:03:47.799> gateway

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
we get a lot of boats we get gateway

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.809 
we get a lot of boats we get gateway
Clippers<00:03:49.060> we<00:03:49.599> get<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:50.379> think<00:03:51.129> the<00:03:51.340> Titanic

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
Clippers we get I think the Titanic

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.660 
Clippers we get I think the Titanic
stroll<00:03:52.209> through<00:03:52.239> here<00:03:52.599> once<00:03:53.010> before<00:03:54.010> it<00:03:54.459> was

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
stroll through here once before it was

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.479 
stroll through here once before it was
faithful<00:03:56.069> crash<00:03:58.560> but<00:03:59.560> we<00:03:59.860> can<00:04:00.010> actually<00:04:00.190> go

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
faithful crash but we can actually go

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.229 
faithful crash but we can actually go
into<00:04:00.730> these<00:04:00.880> lighthouses<00:04:01.329> and<00:04:01.630> see<00:04:02.910> all<00:04:03.910> the

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
into these lighthouses and see all the

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.030 
into these lighthouses and see all the
boat<00:04:04.420> traffic<00:04:04.780> going<00:04:05.140> through<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:05.920> can

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
boat traffic going through so you can

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.410 
boat traffic going through so you can
follow<00:04:06.280> me<00:04:06.489> we'll<00:04:06.700> go<00:04:07.349> up<00:04:08.349> in<00:04:08.590> here<00:04:09.420> actually

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
follow me we'll go up in here actually

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:27.659 
follow me we'll go up in here actually
just<00:04:10.629> put<00:04:10.780> these<00:04:10.900> here<00:04:11.819> before<00:04:12.819> I<00:04:13.200> graduated

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.430 

okay<00:04:28.669> so<00:04:29.860> can't<00:04:30.860> go<00:04:30.949> in<00:04:31.100> these<00:04:32.350> like<00:04:33.350> I

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
okay so can't go in these like I

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.210 
okay so can't go in these like I
originally<00:04:33.919> thought

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
originally thought

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.189 
originally thought
probably<00:04:34.610> because<00:04:35.030> every<00:04:35.389> I<00:04:35.600> did<00:04:35.990> actually

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
probably because every I did actually

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.330 
probably because every I did actually
hear<00:04:36.500> a<00:04:36.530> story<00:04:36.770> of<00:04:37.870> James<00:04:38.870> Duda<00:04:39.410> games<00:04:40.040> Duda

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
hear a story of James Duda games Duda

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.400 
hear a story of James Duda games Duda
actually<00:04:40.729> climbed<00:04:41.030> up<00:04:41.330> these<00:04:41.570> one<00:04:42.380> night

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
actually climbed up these one night

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.330 
actually climbed up these one night
drunkenly<00:04:43.100> and<00:04:43.550> Oh<00:04:44.240> Boff<00:04:44.800> broke<00:04:45.800> both<00:04:45.979> his<00:04:46.130> leg

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
drunkenly and Oh Boff broke both his leg

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.340 
drunkenly and Oh Boff broke both his leg
didn't<00:04:46.699> die<00:04:46.850> because<00:04:47.389> they're<00:04:47.750> obviously<00:04:48.080> not

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
didn't die because they're obviously not

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:55.379 
didn't die because they're obviously not
that<00:04:48.590> hot<00:04:49.750> okay<00:04:50.750> so<00:04:50.810> we<00:04:51.290> can't<00:04:51.470> go<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.650> nose<00:04:52.389> so

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
that hot okay so we can't go the nose so

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:01.750 
that hot okay so we can't go the nose so
on<00:04:56.389> with<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.080> tour

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.560 

right<00:05:02.760> this<00:05:03.210> is<00:05:04.130> man<00:05:05.130> Greenough<00:05:05.580> library

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
right this is man Greenough library

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:14.059 
right this is man Greenough library
I<00:05:09.830> think<00:05:10.830> there's<00:05:11.040> books<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.580> stuff<00:05:11.820> in<00:05:12.000> here

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 
I think there's books and stuff in here

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.109 
I think there's books and stuff in here
not<00:05:14.610> sure<00:05:14.849> that<00:05:15.119> don't<00:05:15.509> quote<00:05:15.659> me<00:05:15.839> on<00:05:15.869> there

00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:17.119 
not sure that don't quote me on there

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:20.890 
not sure that don't quote me on there
just<00:05:18.119> got<00:05:18.240> a<00:05:18.270> nice<00:05:18.479> little<00:05:19.460> floorboard

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
just got a nice little floorboard

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.209 
just got a nice little floorboard
because<00:05:21.900> every<00:05:22.139> library<00:05:22.619> needs<00:05:22.830> a

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
because every library needs a

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:29.420 
because every library needs a
sport<00:05:25.610> temperature<00:05:28.129> they're<00:05:29.129> kind<00:05:29.369> of

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
sport temperature they're kind of

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.920 
sport temperature they're kind of
cheatin<00:05:29.939> they're<00:05:30.210> kind<00:05:30.389> of<00:05:30.449> stealing<00:05:30.689> off<00:05:30.839> the

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
cheatin they're kind of stealing off the

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.429 
cheatin they're kind of stealing off the
banks<00:05:31.259> because<00:05:31.529> banks<00:05:31.559> are<00:05:32.129> usually<00:05:32.550> known

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:34.439 
banks because banks are usually known

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:36.739 
banks because banks are usually known
let's<00:05:34.919> actually<00:05:35.069> go<00:05:35.369> in<00:05:35.580> to<00:05:35.849> the<00:05:36.269> mandarina

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:36.749 
let's actually go in to the mandarina

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:39.889 
let's actually go in to the mandarina
library<00:05:37.349> and<00:05:37.739> see<00:05:38.039> what<00:05:38.699> we<00:05:38.789> can<00:05:38.879> find<00:05:39.119> in

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:39.899 
library and see what we can find in

00:05:39.899 --> 00:06:49.900 
library and see what we can find in
there<00:05:40.169> there's<00:05:40.499> books<00:05:40.769> and<00:05:41.129> stuff

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.860 

you<00:06:50.910> don't<00:06:51.060> want<00:06:51.180> to<00:06:51.240> have<00:06:51.330> your<00:06:51.450> voice<00:06:51.600> up

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
you don't want to have your voice up

00:06:51.870 --> 00:07:05.010 
you don't want to have your voice up
here

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.080
