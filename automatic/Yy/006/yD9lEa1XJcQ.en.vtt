00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.460 
game and no a goal a goal and a half
every<00:01:12.030> game<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:12.720> go<00:01:12.840> i<00:01:12.869> can't<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.380> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
every game there we go i can't get it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.679 
every game there we go i can't get it
right<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.920> he's<00:01:14.130> not<00:01:14.310> doing<00:01:14.580> too<00:01:14.610> badly<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.420> as

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
right so he's not doing too badly but as

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.969 
right so he's not doing too badly but as
you<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.869> see<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.170> took<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.500> lead<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:16.830> that

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
you can see we took the lead with that

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.380 
you can see we took the lead with that
penalty<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.580> they're<00:01:17.700> not<00:01:17.790> very<00:01:18.060> quickly

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
that had to change in the second half so

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.729 
that had to change in the second half so

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
into play and we were relatively eager

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.790 
into play and we were relatively eager
