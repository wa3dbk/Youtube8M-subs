00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720 

I<00:00:00.079> think<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.350> think<00:00:01.949> I<00:00:02.040> know<00:00:02.100> where<00:00:02.399> all<00:00:02.429> the

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
I think I think I know where all the

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.269 
I think I think I know where all the
secret<00:00:03.149> areas<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:03.780> enemies<00:00:04.500> are<00:00:04.710> in<00:00:04.920> this<00:00:05.069> one

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
secret areas and enemies are in this one

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.120 
secret areas and enemies are in this one
I<00:00:05.490> just<00:00:06.060> think<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:06.450> don't<00:00:06.629> know<00:00:06.779> where<00:00:07.020> all<00:00:07.980> the

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
I just think I don't know where all the

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.129 
I just think I don't know where all the
pickup's<00:00:08.429> are<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.269> think<00:00:09.840> there's<00:00:09.960> like<00:00:09.990> a

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
pickup's are I think there's like a

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.629 
pickup's are I think there's like a
couple<00:00:10.349> pick<00:00:10.650> up<00:00:10.800> so<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:11.010> don't<00:00:11.219> know<00:00:11.490> where

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
couple pick up so you don't know where

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.820 
couple pick up so you don't know where
they<00:00:11.730> are<00:00:11.759> so<00:00:12.420> I'm<00:00:13.019> probably<00:00:13.320> not<00:00:13.469> gonna<00:00:13.620> get<00:00:13.799> a

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
they are so I'm probably not gonna get a

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.259 
they are so I'm probably not gonna get a
hundred<00:00:13.980> percent<00:00:14.130> everything<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:14.910> level

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
hundred percent everything in this level

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.670 
hundred percent everything in this level
I'm<00:00:15.780> probably<00:00:15.929> gonna<00:00:16.139> get<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.379> hundred<00:00:16.529> percent

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
I'm probably gonna get a hundred percent

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:31.880 
I'm probably gonna get a hundred percent
enemies<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.850> areas<00:00:18.740> though<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:30.289> anyway<00:00:31.289> like

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
enemies and areas though so anyway like

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.400 
enemies and areas though so anyway like
I<00:00:32.009> said<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.340> levels<00:00:32.700> lon<00:00:32.940> we're<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.020> only

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
I said this levels lon we're like only

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.209 
I said this levels lon we're like only
about<00:00:34.620> halfway<00:00:34.860> done<00:00:35.190> right<00:00:35.430> now<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> think

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
about halfway done right now I think

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.650 
about halfway done right now I think
maybe<00:00:38.219> maybe<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.850> little<00:00:39.030> more<00:00:39.270> than<00:00:39.329> halfway

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
maybe maybe a little more than halfway

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.900 
maybe maybe a little more than halfway
and<00:00:40.410> i'm<00:00:40.649> not<00:00:40.829> sure<00:00:43.190> i've<00:00:44.190> actually<00:00:44.700> only

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
and i'm not sure i've actually only

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.740 
and i'm not sure i've actually only
beaten<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.059> game<00:00:48.410> twice<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.469> my<00:00:50.309> life<00:00:50.750> and

so<00:02:39.670> here<00:02:40.000> we<00:02:40.120> are<00:02:40.530> tumbling

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.610 

tumbling<00:02:44.569> is<00:02:44.719> the<00:02:44.870> quickest<00:02:45.260> way<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.469> get

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
tumbling is the quickest way to get

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.089 
tumbling is the quickest way to get
anywhere<00:02:46.599> even<00:02:47.599> in<00:02:47.689> real<00:02:47.870> life<00:02:48.079> if<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:49.069> break

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
anywhere even in real life if you break

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.339 
anywhere even in real life if you break
up<00:02:49.340> here<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:49.939> go<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.390> right<00:02:50.569> another

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
up here and go to the right another

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.750 
up here and go to the right another
