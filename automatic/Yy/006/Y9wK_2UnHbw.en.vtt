00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.880 
is from New York so her area code is
like<00:01:13.939> 913<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.360> something<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.409> instead<00:01:16.830> of

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
like 913 or something and so instead of

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.969 
like 913 or something and so instead of

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
puts in 911 and doesn't even realize it

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.700
