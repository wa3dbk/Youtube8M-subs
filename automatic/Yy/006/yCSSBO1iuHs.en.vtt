00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
hole such as this one here then

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.390 
hole such as this one here then
you<00:02:10.719> stick<00:02:10.959> a<00:02:10.989> cloth<00:02:11.469> or<00:02:11.709> something<00:02:11.859> over<00:02:12.189> the

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
top then the water evaporates out of the

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.390 
top then the water evaporates out of the
ground<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.469> collects<00:02:17.469> in<00:02:17.680> over<00:02:17.920> little<00:02:18.159> pool

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
ground and collects in over little pool

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.239 
ground and collects in over little pool
down<00:02:18.730> at<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:18.969> bottom<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.540> can<00:02:19.719> drink<00:02:20.249> so
