00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
had a problem of contaminated water

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.100 
had a problem of contaminated water
since<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.699> time<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.359> accident<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:04.049> 2011

since the time of the accident in 2011
and<00:01:07.110> not<00:01:07.439> only<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.950> water<00:01:08.159> that's<00:01:08.430> needed<00:01:08.850> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and not only the water that's needed to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.929 
and not only the water that's needed to
fool<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.600> molten<00:01:10.590> fuel<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.280> reactors

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
fool the molten fuel and the reactors

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.740 
fool the molten fuel and the reactors
but<00:01:12.600> also<00:01:12.810> all<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.490> rain<00:01:14.760> water<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.450> storm

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
but also all of the rain water and storm

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.690 
but also all of the rain water and storm
water<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.860> has<00:01:17.100> been<00:01:17.400> getting

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
water and so on that has been getting

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.880 
water and so on that has been getting
into<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.240> reactors<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.080> contacting<00:01:19.740> with

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
into the reactors and contacting with

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.969 
into the reactors and contacting with
units<00:01:20.340> off<00:01:20.580> they've<00:01:21.180> got<00:01:21.450> about<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.979> thousand

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
units off they've got about a thousand

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.179 
units off they've got about a thousand
tanks<00:01:23.220> with<00:01:24.030> contaminated<00:01:24.869> water<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.680> site

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
tanks with contaminated water on site

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.969 
tanks with contaminated water on site
some<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.270> these<00:01:27.390> tanks<00:01:27.810> are<00:01:27.960> leaking<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.740> of

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
some of these tanks are leaking and of

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.940 
some of these tanks are leaking and of
course<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.369> site<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.820> contaminated<00:01:30.000> from<00:01:30.950> so

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
course the site is contaminated from so

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.850 
course the site is contaminated from so
loud<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.520> leaking<00:01:32.970> water<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.860> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
loud and leaking water and so on the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.249 
loud and leaking water and so on the
latest<00:01:35.159> problem<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.329> asking<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.960> about

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
latest problem that you asking you about

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.289 
latest problem that you asking you about
arose<00:01:38.250> when<00:01:38.850> there<00:01:39.060> was<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> taxi<00:01:39.810> last<00:01:40.350> week

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
arose when there was a taxi last week

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.429 
arose when there was a taxi last week
with<00:01:42.299> which<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.850> there<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.090> very<00:01:45.600> severe<00:01:45.960> storm

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
with which is there a very severe storm

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.740 
with which is there a very severe storm
and<00:01:46.680> dumped<00:01:47.369> an<00:01:47.490> enormous<00:01:48.000> amount<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.450> rain

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and dumped an enormous amount of rain

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.410 
and dumped an enormous amount of rain
and<00:01:49.110> what<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.470> has<00:01:49.680> done<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> areas

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and what that has done is in the areas

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.210 
and what that has done is in the areas
that<00:01:51.450> are<00:01:51.720> highly<00:01:52.049> contaminated<00:01:52.500> with

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
that are highly contaminated with

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.760 
that are highly contaminated with
leaking<00:01:53.579> water<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.689> was<00:01:54.840> contained<00:01:55.439> by

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
leaking water that was contained by

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.959 
leaking water that was contained by
berms<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.579> barriers<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:59.280> containment

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
berms and barriers that containment

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.270 
berms and barriers that containment
basically<00:02:00.899> got<00:02:01.110> over<00:02:01.439> talked<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:02.219> we

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
basically got over talked and now we

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.810 
basically got over talked and now we
have<00:02:02.990> quite<00:02:03.990> contaminated<00:02:04.740> water<00:02:04.979> that's

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
have quite contaminated water that's

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.749 
have quite contaminated water that's
flowing<00:02:06.560> off<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.860> other<00:02:08.009> parts<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.520> site

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
flowing off to other parts of the site

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.550 
flowing off to other parts of the site
and<00:02:08.970> into<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> ocean<00:02:09.629> contaminated<00:02:10.349> water

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
and into the ocean contaminated water

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.670 
and into the ocean contaminated water
that's<00:02:10.860> flowing<00:02:10.950> into<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.610> ocean<00:02:11.970> every<00:02:12.330> day

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
that's flowing into the ocean every day

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.660 
that's flowing into the ocean every day
a<00:02:13.329> apart<00:02:14.329> from<00:02:14.659> the<00:02:15.290> severe<00:02:15.829> weather<00:02:16.010> events

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
a apart from the severe weather events

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.910 
a apart from the severe weather events
so<00:02:16.849> this<00:02:17.150> adds<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.989> contamination<00:02:18.769> has

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
so this adds to the contamination has

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.550 
so this adds to the contamination has
this<00:02:19.849> raised<00:02:20.269> further<00:02:20.569> questions<00:02:21.109> about<00:02:21.409> the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
this raised further questions about the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.119 
this raised further questions about the
management<00:02:21.859> of<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.129> cleanup<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:24.129> the

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
management of the cleanup and the the

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.270 
management of the cleanup and the the
way<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.670> TEPCO<00:02:26.060> as<00:02:26.299> was<00:02:26.540> approaching<00:02:26.989> it

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
way that TEPCO as was approaching it

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.440 
way that TEPCO as was approaching it
well<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:28.310> think<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.790> management<00:02:29.359> of

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
well I think the management of

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.569 
well I think the management of
contaminated<00:02:30.049> water<00:02:30.079> has<00:02:30.650> been<00:02:31.159> deficient

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
contaminated water has been deficient

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.020 
contaminated water has been deficient
from<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.269> beginning<00:02:32.980> for<00:02:33.980> some<00:02:34.159> of<00:02:34.250> us<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.730> was

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
from the beginning for some of us it was

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.879 
from the beginning for some of us it was
apparent<00:02:35.750> back<00:02:36.170> then<00:02:36.530> in<00:02:37.150> 2011<00:02:38.409> that<00:02:39.409> it<00:02:39.680> was

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:39.889 
apparent back then in 2011 that it was

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:44.099 
apparent back then in 2011 that it was
not<00:02:40.189> such<00:02:40.519> a<00:02:40.549> good<00:02:40.790> idea<00:02:40.939> to<00:02:42.010> accumulate

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
not such a good idea to accumulate

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.479 
not such a good idea to accumulate
meaning<00:02:45.109> the<00:02:45.230> grounds<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.739> contaminated

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
meaning the grounds of contaminated

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.170 
meaning the grounds of contaminated
water<00:02:46.659> on<00:02:47.659> site<00:02:48.109> I<00:02:48.409> would<00:02:49.250> suggest<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:49.939> back

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
water on site I would suggest it back

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.289 
water on site I would suggest it back
then<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:51.040> they<00:02:52.040> should<00:02:52.280> buy<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.519> supertanker

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
then that they should buy a supertanker

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.899 
then that they should buy a supertanker
and<00:02:53.720> put<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.530> water<00:02:54.769> in<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.069> super<00:02:55.459> tanker

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
and put the water in the super tanker

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.929 
and put the water in the super tanker
and<00:02:56.090> have<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.200> sent<00:02:57.980> elsewhere<00:02:58.579> for

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
and have it sent elsewhere for

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.199 
and have it sent elsewhere for
filtration<00:02:59.359> or<00:02:59.930> rather<00:03:00.919> than<00:03:01.280> storing<00:03:01.669> so

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
situation of water is going to be very

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.880 
situation of water is going to be very
difficult<00:04:41.080> many<00:04:42.080> of<00:04:42.260> these<00:04:42.380> workers<00:04:42.680> have

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
difficult many of these workers have

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.180 
difficult many of these workers have

the<00:04:48.950> area<00:04:48.980> many<00:04:49.580> of<00:04:49.760> them<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:50.620> they<00:04:51.620> can't<00:04:51.860> go

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
the area many of them and they can't go

back<00:04:52.220> to<00:04:52.430> their<00:04:52.580> houses<00:04:52.790> so<00:04:53.450> they<00:04:53.480> are<00:04:53.720> in

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
back to their houses so they are in

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.440 
back to their houses so they are in
temporal<00:04:54.380> temporary<00:04:55.280> housing<00:04:55.730> and<00:04:55.910> so<00:04:56.060> on<00:04:56.180> so

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
difficult than many of them don't appear

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.310 
difficult than many of them don't appear
to<00:05:00.590> be<00:05:00.830> even<00:05:01.400> very<00:05:01.790> well-paid<00:05:02.570> as<00:05:02.900> they<00:05:03.260> should

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
to be even very well-paid as they should

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.430 
to be even very well-paid as they should
be<00:05:03.800> for<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:04.310> kind<00:05:04.550> of<00:05:04.640> work<00:05:04.700> they<00:05:04.880> are<00:05:05.060> doing

and finally there's a typhoon that may

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.450 
and finally there's a typhoon that may
make<00:05:09.050> landfall<00:05:09.500> this<00:05:10.040> week<00:05:10.310> in<00:05:10.610> in<00:05:11.120> Japan<00:05:12.460> does

this raise further concerns and what

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.590 
this raise further concerns and what
does<00:05:15.980> the<00:05:16.100> future<00:05:16.250> look<00:05:16.460> like<00:05:16.670> for<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.330> for

does the future look like for the for

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.870 
does the future look like for the for
the<00:05:17.630> cleanup<00:05:17.930> of<00:05:18.170> this<00:05:18.380> massive<00:05:18.950> radioactive

the cleanup of this massive radioactive

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.630 
the cleanup of this massive radioactive
sighs<00:05:20.890> when<00:05:21.890> this<00:05:22.070> holds<00:05:22.430> that<00:05:22.580> the

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
sighs when this holds that the

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.640 
sighs when this holds that the
structures<00:05:23.270> will<00:05:23.540> hold<00:05:23.810> up<00:05:24.050> because<00:05:24.470> the

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
structures will hold up because the

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.030 
structures will hold up because the
structures<00:05:25.250> are<00:05:26.030> better<00:05:26.450> be<00:05:26.750> built<00:05:27.170> to

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
structures are better be built to

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.820 
structures are better be built to

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
accident from becoming much worse so

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.740 
accident from becoming much worse so
there's<00:05:39.500> a<00:05:39.590> currency<00:05:40.460> severe<00:05:41.060> problem<00:05:41.600> of

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
there's a currency severe problem of

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.360 
there's a currency severe problem of
course<00:05:41.930> with<00:05:42.080> all<00:05:42.380> the<00:05:42.590> contaminated<00:05:43.340> water

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
course with all the contaminated water

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.150 
course with all the contaminated water
leaks<00:05:43.970> and<00:05:44.180> so<00:05:44.360> on<00:05:44.450> but<00:05:45.380> there's<00:05:45.860> much<00:05:46.100> more

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
leaks and so on but there's much more

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.760 
leaks and so on but there's much more
radioactivity<00:05:47.030> inside<00:05:47.660> the<00:05:47.870> reactors<00:05:48.560> and

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
radioactivity inside the reactors and

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.280 
radioactivity inside the reactors and
the<00:05:48.860> spent<00:05:49.130> fuel<00:05:49.190> pools<00:05:49.670> and<00:05:50.060> so<00:05:50.660> what<00:05:50.780> happens

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
the spent fuel pools and so what happens

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.250 
the spent fuel pools and so what happens
with<00:05:52.160> with<00:05:52.700> all<00:05:53.000> these<00:05:53.240> storms<00:05:53.870> of<00:05:54.080> where

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
with with all these storms of where

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.810 
with with all these storms of where
storms<00:05:54.590> type<00:05:54.950> things<00:05:55.250> and<00:05:55.430> so<00:05:55.670> on<00:05:55.820> is<00:05:56.770> that

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
storms type things and so on is that

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.190 
storms type things and so on is that
definitely<00:05:58.820> the<00:05:59.030> same<00:05:59.240> thing<00:05:59.780> essentially

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
definitely the same thing essentially

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.950 
definitely the same thing essentially
the<00:06:00.470> hurricane<00:06:00.920> is<00:06:01.870> that<00:06:03.130> there's<00:06:04.130> a<00:06:04.250> risk<00:06:04.550> of

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
the hurricane is that there's a risk of

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.770 
the hurricane is that there's a risk of
that<00:06:05.960> there<00:06:06.260> will<00:06:06.470> be<00:06:06.730> much<00:06:07.730> much<00:06:08.060> more<00:06:08.330> severe

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
that there will be much much more severe

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.840 
that there will be much much more severe
spread<00:06:09.140> of<00:06:09.320> contamination<00:06:09.950> thank<00:06:10.400> you<00:06:10.550> but

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
spread of contamination thank you but

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.870 
spread of contamination thank you but
that<00:06:11.060> does<00:06:11.300> not<00:06:11.330> see<00:06:11.840> can<00:06:12.080> happen<00:06:12.560> so<00:06:13.550> far<00:06:13.850> but

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
that does not see can happen so far but

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.570 
that does not see can happen so far but
the<00:06:14.660> longer<00:06:15.020> it<00:06:15.110> goes<00:06:15.140> on<00:06:15.470> of<00:06:15.710> course<00:06:15.740> the<00:06:16.160> them

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
the longer it goes on of course the them

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.500 
the longer it goes on of course the them
the<00:06:17.360> greater<00:06:18.290> the<00:06:18.500> risk<00:06:19.210> thank<00:06:20.210> you<00:06:20.300> so<00:06:20.390> much
