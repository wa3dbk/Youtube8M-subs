00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.600
 or the copy of the greeting 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.460
 in this opportunity I want to show you 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.550
 a sculpture of poseidÃ³n that I am 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.380
 ending 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.260
 that has about a height of about 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:22.310
 four centimeters and in this video 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.130
 I want to show you how I will finish it 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.830
 I left the face for the last and certain 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.620
 small details that are what lead to 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.439
 presentation 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.870
 pleases the figure 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.149
 with the face 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.270
 I would like to reorder it with a burin of 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.390
 point to give me the depth 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.390
 required 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.080
 to the same 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.579
 This step is obviously one of the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.790
 more delicate because the expression of 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.200
 face is what will let us appreciate 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.280
 a pretty sculpture 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.280
 with spatula 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.250
 I also work the face to whoever is 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.230
 at this moment I am 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.930
 making the fall of the eyes 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.690
 giving them depth to get me out 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.190
 the cheekbones 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.350
 and later with a soldering iron 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.490
 I'm having will be to give 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.490
 nose protrusion 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.509
 and here with them I avoid 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.640
 of having to shut up from the side 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.310
 upper part of the nose up to 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.840
 cheekbones since I always save 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.790
 quite a way at this time also 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.200
 with the cau 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.830
 the mustache I give height to the mustache and 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.120
 signs to go seeing how I am 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.120
 creating the expression of the face 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.690
 The usefulness of the soldering iron is very important 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.690
 because it allows us 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.700
 in certain opportunities 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.870
 repair where we go 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.459
 removed will be 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.459
 that must remain in the figure 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.460
 so 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.870
 in this way 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.870
 I can show you 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.930
 how is it going on in my face in this 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.930
 step of the making of this sculpture 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.180
 here we can appreciate the cheekbones 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.050
 eyebrows nose 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.450
 boat 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.930
 obviously we need to spend a lot more 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.909
 the head because it is very thick 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.909
 and then at this time 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.490
 precisely 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.490
 with the spatulas 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.940
 I'm thinning my hair 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.040
 the sides so I can go 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.590
 most suitable proportion 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.450
 the head with reference to the body 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.200
 obviously he shows us all the work 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.200
 I'm working on 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.069
 if it is not already this moment, I am 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.470
 showing how how are you already creating 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.680
 practically 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.739
 You can finish it 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.430
 so we can appreciate our image 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.430
 backwards 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.300
 and there 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.340
 in front 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.620
 and dimensions that can be seen in 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.620
 the screen 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.260
 This was our result once 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:16.090
 based on gold 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.090
 it was weighing 30 grams 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.770
 does not have at this time still its 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.759
 trident then the tip of the step in 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.759
 material apart 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.979
 thank you very much for your attention 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.060
 and I hope to be able to collaborate in this type of 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.259
 jobs 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.259
 later thanks
