you<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.200> before<00:01:49.649> with<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.860> other<00:01:49.979> one

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
you so I think before with the other one

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.280 
you so I think before with the other one
if<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.610> had<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.060> block<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.899> wood<00:01:52.049> there

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
if you just had the block of wood there

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.440 
if you just had the block of wood there

as you've just got the wood in your
venturi<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.250> then<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.030> say<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
venturi and then you say one of the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.780 
venturi and then you say one of the
crafty<00:02:03.960> silver<00:02:04.290> wooden<00:02:04.469> pickaxe<00:02:04.740> BAM<00:02:05.310> it'll

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
crafty silver wooden pickaxe BAM it'll

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.969 
crafty silver wooden pickaxe BAM it'll
do<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.930> what<00:02:07.140> will<00:02:07.229> actually<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.619> it'll

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
do that but what will actually do it'll

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.440 
do that but what will actually do it'll
then<00:02:08.129> break<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.550> down<00:02:08.640> into<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.060> whatever<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
then break it down into the whatever the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.600 
then break it down into the whatever the
wood<00:02:09.660> was<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.140> also<00:02:10.619> leave<00:02:10.830> sticks<00:02:11.190> as<00:02:11.370> well

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
wood was and also leave sticks as well

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.850 
wood was and also leave sticks as well
so<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.420> really<00:02:12.840> breaks<00:02:13.050> down<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.500> mates

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
so it really breaks down to mates

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.850 
so it really breaks down to mates
so<00:02:14.430> cool<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.940> actually<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.330> little<00:02:15.510> bit<00:02:15.600> more

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
so cool it actually is a little bit more

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.910 
so cool it actually is a little bit more
