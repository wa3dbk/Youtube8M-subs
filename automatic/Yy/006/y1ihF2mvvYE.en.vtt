00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.369
 we need osobuco here there are four 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.140
 pieces can be one per person or if 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:26.270
 you eat a lot like me two for beard flour 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.619

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:39.010
 of extra virgin olive we put 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.290
 an express pot on it was fed 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.260
 on both sides by the face and by the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.000
 face by now what we do is pass it 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.040
 by arjen while we're going to go through 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.680
 flour we do not give maximum power the 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.690
 pot and we're going to take about 3 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.370
 spoonfuls of olive oil we already have the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.140
 hot oil and what we're going to do 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:04.479
 is to get the process done with everyone 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:12.420

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.659

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.710

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.710

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:49.289
 time has passed 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:54.360
 we put out the fire just down the 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:56.990
 prey this is the look of the ovules and 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.210
