00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.340 

let's<00:00:01.140> take<00:00:01.319> a<00:00:01.350> look<00:00:01.620> at<00:00:01.709> these<00:00:01.829> new<00:00:02.100> LEDs

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:03.350 
let's take a look at these new LEDs

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.539 
let's take a look at these new LEDs
think<00:00:04.350> they're<00:00:04.500> for<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.740> car<00:00:05.040> when<00:00:05.310> I<00:00:05.339> just

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
think they're for a car when I just

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.169 
think they're for a car when I just
bought<00:00:05.759> them<00:00:05.910> because<00:00:06.870> they<00:00:07.140> were<00:00:07.200> cheap

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:08.179 
bought them because they were cheap

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.430 
bought them because they were cheap
let's<00:00:09.179> power<00:00:09.420> one<00:00:09.660> up<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:09.900> see<00:00:09.990> what<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.290> looks

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
let's power one up and see what it looks

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:21.400 
let's power one up and see what it looks
like<00:00:17.779> there<00:00:18.779> guys<00:00:19.020> are<00:00:19.230> starting<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.529> light<00:00:19.710> up

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
like there guys are starting to light up

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:29.000 
like there guys are starting to light up
wow<00:00:22.410> that's<00:00:23.010> neat<00:00:23.340> oh<00:00:27.439> wow<00:00:28.439> that's<00:00:28.859> pretty

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
wow that's neat oh wow that's pretty

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.410 
wow that's neat oh wow that's pretty
bright<00:00:29.460> that's<00:00:30.060> it

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
bright that's it

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.569 
bright that's it
can<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.050> go<00:00:31.140> brighter<00:00:31.380> yeah<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.130> can<00:00:32.430> go<00:00:32.550> a

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
can you go brighter yeah I can go a

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.130 
can you go brighter yeah I can go a
little<00:00:32.700> bright<00:00:34.969> whoa<00:00:36.000> look<00:00:36.510> how<00:00:36.690> much<00:00:36.899> light

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
little bright whoa look how much light

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.069 
little bright whoa look how much light
that<00:00:37.170> puts<00:00:37.559> out<00:00:38.000> it's<00:00:39.000> at<00:00:39.149> 12<00:00:39.480> volts

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
that puts out it's at 12 volts

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.850 
that puts out it's at 12 volts
I<00:00:40.110> feel<00:00:40.649> point<00:00:41.070> 2<00:00:41.250> amps<00:00:41.550> yes<00:00:41.700> not<00:00:41.969> worn<00:00:42.450> yeah

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
I feel point 2 amps yes not worn yeah

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.170 
I feel point 2 amps yes not worn yeah
it's<00:00:43.860> only<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.309> hmm<00:00:45.300> there's<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.110> little<00:00:46.320> warm

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
it's only up hmm there's a little warm

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.850 
it's only up hmm there's a little warm
it's<00:00:48.180> only<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.420> point<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.989> an<00:00:49.200> shake<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.620> off<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
it's only a point to an shake it off a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.139 
it's only a point to an shake it off a
little<00:00:50.070> bit<00:00:50.190> more<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.430> bet<00:00:52.489> no<00:00:53.489> because<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.120> you

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
little bit more I bet no because if you

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.420 
little bit more I bet no because if you
accidentally<00:00:54.719> turn<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.530> knob<00:00:55.770> too<00:00:56.070> much<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
accidentally turn this knob too much I

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.920 
accidentally turn this knob too much I
don't<00:00:56.489> know<00:00:56.640> how<00:00:56.789> much<00:00:56.969> current<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.750> is

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
don't know how much current this is

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.049 
don't know how much current this is
rated<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.410> didn't<00:00:59.160> come<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.430> any<00:00:59.460> specs

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
rated for didn't come with any specs

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.960 
rated for didn't come with any specs
woah<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.649> bright<00:01:03.320> but<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.830> want<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> keep<00:01:05.729> it

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
woah that's bright but I want to keep it

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.340 
woah that's bright but I want to keep it
well<00:01:06.390> below<00:01:06.810> half<00:01:07.110> an<00:01:07.320> amp<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:11.990> battery<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.200> get

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
well below half an amp a battery can get

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.760 
well below half an amp a battery can get
up<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> 14<00:01:14.070> volts<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.610> don't<00:01:14.820> know<00:01:15.710> this<00:01:16.710> is

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
up to 14 volts so I don't know this is

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.280 
up to 14 volts so I don't know this is
rated<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.549> them<00:01:17.729> whoa<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
rated for them whoa see that the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.510 
rated for them whoa see that the
currents<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.860> up<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.159> high<00:01:20.340> right<00:01:20.549> now

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
currents going up so high right now

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.890 
currents going up so high right now
usually<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.729> means<00:01:23.759> you're<00:01:24.540> getting<00:01:24.720> close

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
usually that means you're getting close

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.109 
usually that means you're getting close
to<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.350> max<00:01:25.590> when<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.280> little<00:01:26.580> bit<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.790> voltage

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
to the max when a little bit of voltage

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.569 
to the max when a little bit of voltage
increases<00:01:27.659> their<00:01:27.810> current<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> lot<00:01:28.320> cut<00:01:29.220> right

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
increases their current a lot cut right

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.460 
increases their current a lot cut right
down<00:01:30.350> well<00:01:32.869> that's<00:01:33.869> pretty<00:01:34.200> cool<00:01:36.290> what<00:01:37.290> are<00:01:37.320> we

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
down well that's pretty cool what are we

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.219 
down well that's pretty cool what are we
going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> use<00:01:37.860> these<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.400> now<00:01:39.299> these<00:01:39.540> these

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
going to use these for now these these

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.830 
going to use these for now these these
are<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.680> even<00:01:41.040> I've<00:01:41.610> got<00:01:41.880> 100<00:01:42.299> watt<00:01:42.450> super

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
are not even I've got 100 watt super

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.870 
are not even I've got 100 watt super
brights<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:45.630> we're<00:01:45.810> about<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.049> test<00:01:46.380> out

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.440 

sure<00:01:51.620> you<00:01:52.620> have<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.800> go<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.190> way<00:01:53.400> I<00:01:53.580> know<00:01:56.450> make

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
sure you have to go that way I know make

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.510 
sure you have to go that way I know make
sure<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.750> turn<00:01:57.900> it<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.170> right<00:01:58.320> way<00:02:01.520> keep

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
sure you turn it the right way keep

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.340 
sure you turn it the right way keep
going<00:02:02.850> keep<00:02:03.090> going<00:02:08.000> all<00:02:09.000> right<00:02:09.270> let's<00:02:09.990> turn<00:02:10.170> it

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
going keep going all right let's turn it

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.170 
going keep going all right let's turn it
off<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.800> get<00:02:11.610> let's<00:02:12.120> get<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.330> super<00:02:12.720> bright<00:02:12.900> out
