00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
bit more pluck and prominence I can't

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.360 
bit more pluck and prominence I can't
argue<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.350> some<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.710> the<00:03:12.770> grooves<00:03:13.040> on<00:03:13.250> this

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.310 
argue that some of the grooves on this
album<00:03:13.490> are<00:03:13.700> some<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.150> band's<00:03:14.450> best<00:03:14.960> and
