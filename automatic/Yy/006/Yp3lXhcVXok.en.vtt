00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.070 
of break it down how we approach
different<00:00:28.560> Lakes<00:00:28.820> all<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.000> tactics<00:00:30.240> involved

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
different Lakes all the tactics involved

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.200 
different Lakes all the tactics involved
in<00:00:31.199> starting<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.679> lake<00:00:31.859> from<00:00:32.160> start<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.610> finish

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
in starting a lake from start to finish

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.959 
in starting a lake from start to finish
and<00:00:33.739> we've<00:00:34.739> still<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.280> yet<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> fish

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
and we've still have yet to have a fish

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.760 
and we've still have yet to have a fish
out<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:37.380> know<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.559> isn't

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
out of here so you know this isn't

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.350 
out of here so you know this isn't
something<00:00:38.070> that's<00:00:38.219> gonna<00:00:38.460> take<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.850> day<00:00:38.969> or<00:00:39.329> two

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
something that's gonna take a day or two

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.530 
something that's gonna take a day or two
days<00:00:39.719> time<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.920> effort<00:00:41.190> goes<00:00:41.250> into<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.420> know

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
days time and effort goes into you know

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.600 
days time and effort goes into you know
finding<00:00:43.020> different<00:00:43.230> lakes<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:44.370> one's

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
finding different lakes this one's

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.920 
finding different lakes this one's
definitely<00:00:44.820> not<00:00:45.180> one<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:45.719> really

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
definitely not one that we really

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.470 
definitely not one that we really
discovered<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.700> friend<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.329> mine

times<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:51.590> we're<00:00:52.590> both<00:00:52.770> within<00:00:53.039> driving

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
times and we're both within driving

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.369 
times and we're both within driving
range<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.940> here<00:00:54.120> that's<00:00:54.360> not<00:00:54.510> insanely<00:00:54.899> far<00:00:55.260> to

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
range in here that's not insanely far to

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.549 
range in here that's not insanely far to
go<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.940> we're<00:00:56.940> both<00:00:57.149> probably<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.230> couple

kind of invent our own and that way we

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.100 
kind of invent our own and that way we
can<00:02:05.100> kind<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.370> see<00:02:05.550> what's<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.940> lake

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
know obviously figure out a lake that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.210 
know obviously figure out a lake that
you<00:02:12.180> think<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.660> has<00:02:12.900> good<00:02:13.140> potential<00:02:13.560> and

you take a marker float out there you
can<00:05:20.430> pinpoint<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.630> exact<00:05:22.080> spots<00:05:22.410> in<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.710> map

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
can pinpoint the exact spots in the map

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.010 
can pinpoint the exact spots in the map
here<00:05:23.130> so<00:05:23.340> that<00:05:23.880> way<00:05:24.030> if<00:05:24.360> we're<00:05:24.570> looking<00:05:24.720> at<00:05:24.960> the

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
here so that way if we're looking at the

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.350 
here so that way if we're looking at the
map<00:05:25.200> I<00:05:25.380> can<00:05:25.560> tell<00:05:25.710> right<00:05:25.860> away<00:05:26.030> okay<00:05:27.030> let's<00:05:27.240> say

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
map I can tell right away okay let's say

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.870 
map I can tell right away okay let's say
over<00:05:27.450> here<00:05:27.660> has<00:05:27.870> a<00:05:27.900> drop-off<00:05:28.410> and<00:05:28.740> here<00:05:29.100> is<00:05:29.340> the

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
over here has a drop-off and here is the

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.150 
over here has a drop-off and here is the
shallow<00:05:30.120> over<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.630> way<00:05:30.810> well<00:05:31.470> we<00:05:31.740> probably

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
shallow over that way well we probably

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.740 
shallow over that way well we probably
want<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:32.550> fish<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:32.820> drop-off<00:05:33.270> that<00:05:33.510> way<00:05:33.600> it's

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
want to fish the drop-off that way it's

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.140 
want to fish the drop-off that way it's
a<00:05:33.810> better<00:05:33.990> feature<00:05:34.639> say<00:05:35.639> right<00:05:35.850> off<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.030> bat

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
a better feature say right off the bat

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.270 
a better feature say right off the bat
I'm<00:05:36.479> looking<00:05:36.720> at<00:05:36.780> the<00:05:36.840> map<00:05:37.050> I<00:05:37.350> can<00:05:37.650> see<00:05:37.950> kind<00:05:38.220> of

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
I'm looking at the map I can see kind of

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.180 
I'm looking at the map I can see kind of
a<00:05:38.370> 45-degree<00:05:39.180> angle<00:05:39.210> that<00:05:39.600> way

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
a 45-degree angle that way

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.469 
a 45-degree angle that way
there<00:05:41.190> should<00:05:41.370> be<00:05:41.400> drops<00:05:41.820> so<00:05:41.970> taking<00:05:42.240> out<00:05:42.360> the

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
there should be drops so taking out the

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.029 
there should be drops so taking out the
marker<00:05:42.870> you<00:05:42.900> can<00:05:43.169> find<00:05:43.410> that<00:05:43.530> spot<00:05:43.830> really

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
marker you can find that spot really

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.060 
marker you can find that spot really
easily<00:05:44.550> instead<00:05:45.389> of<00:05:45.479> sitting<00:05:45.720> here<00:05:45.750> for<00:05:46.229> maybe

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
easily instead of sitting here for maybe

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.890 
easily instead of sitting here for maybe
an<00:05:47.220> hour<00:05:47.340> too<00:05:47.820> or<00:05:48.060> you<00:05:48.210> know<00:05:48.270> however<00:05:48.479> long<00:05:48.630> you

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
an hour too or you know however long you

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.480 
an hour too or you know however long you
obviously<00:05:49.260> you<00:05:49.320> want<00:05:49.470> to<00:05:49.530> take<00:05:49.740> doing<00:05:50.340> a

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
obviously you want to take doing a

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.610 
obviously you want to take doing a
marker<00:05:50.849> on<00:05:50.880> a<00:05:51.090> spot<00:05:51.419> instead<00:05:52.139> of<00:05:52.289> going<00:05:52.470> the

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
marker on a spot instead of going the

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.040 
marker on a spot instead of going the
entire<00:05:52.710> length<00:05:53.220> of<00:05:53.460> this<00:05:53.669> I<00:05:53.910> know<00:05:54.450> right<00:05:54.660> right

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
entire length of this I know right right

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.810 
entire length of this I know right right
away<00:05:55.260> where<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:55.710> pinpoint<00:05:56.310> and<00:05:56.580> where<00:05:56.700> to

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
away where to pinpoint and where to

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.480 
away where to pinpoint and where to
start<00:05:57.090> my<00:05:57.270> location<00:05:57.660> and<00:05:58.110> going<00:05:59.010> off<00:05:59.160> the<00:05:59.310> map

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
start my location and going off the map

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.580 
start my location and going off the map
you<00:05:59.700> can<00:05:59.849> tell<00:06:00.120> yeah<00:06:00.750> right<00:06:00.990> rest<00:06:01.349> of<00:06:01.470> this

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
you can tell yeah right rest of this

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.140 
you can tell yeah right rest of this
might<00:06:01.770> be<00:06:01.800> shallow<00:06:02.220> said<00:06:02.669> that<00:06:02.789> might<00:06:02.940> not<00:06:03.120> be

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
might be shallow said that might not be

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.500 
might be shallow said that might not be
the<00:06:03.360> best<00:06:03.479> place<00:06:03.780> to<00:06:03.810> target<00:06:04.110> really<00:06:05.510> will

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
the best place to target really will

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.180 
the best place to target really will
show<00:06:06.690> you<00:06:06.750> a<00:06:06.870> few<00:06:07.110> areas<00:06:07.470> on<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:07.680> map<00:06:07.860> here<00:06:08.130> in

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
show you a few areas on the map here in

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.730 
show you a few areas on the map here in
a<00:06:08.250> minute

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
a minute

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.400 
a minute
but<00:06:09.190> yeah<00:06:09.669> definitely<00:06:09.880> map<00:06:10.360> will<00:06:10.599> help<00:06:10.840> to

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
but yeah definitely map will help to

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.350 
but yeah definitely map will help to
improve<00:06:11.500> where<00:06:12.009> to<00:06:12.099> even<00:06:12.190> begin<00:06:12.759> a<00:06:12.910> starting

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
improve where to even begin a starting

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.469 
improve where to even begin a starting
point<00:06:13.710> myself<00:06:14.710> I<00:06:15.250> like<00:06:15.699> to<00:06:15.849> fish<00:06:16.090> the<00:06:16.270> main

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
point myself I like to fish the main

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.270 
point myself I like to fish the main
lake<00:06:16.720> a<00:06:16.960> lot<00:06:17.380> of<00:06:17.470> times<00:06:17.650> I<00:06:17.830> know<00:06:17.860> a<00:06:17.979> lot<00:06:18.190> of

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
lake a lot of times I know a lot of

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.370 
lake a lot of times I know a lot of
people<00:06:18.520> fish<00:06:18.759> the<00:06:18.970> back<00:06:19.150> coves<00:06:19.479> where<00:06:20.259> you

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
people fish the back coves where you

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.409 
people fish the back coves where you
limit<00:06:20.710> yourself<00:06:20.860> to<00:06:21.280> how<00:06:21.550> many<00:06:21.729> fish<00:06:22.030> come<00:06:22.300> in

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
limit yourself to how many fish come in

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.089 
limit yourself to how many fish come in
and<00:06:22.569> out<00:06:22.690> of<00:06:22.840> there<00:06:23.020> you're<00:06:23.470> only<00:06:23.560> relying<00:06:23.800> on

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
and out of there you're only relying on

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:26.129 
and out of there you're only relying on
the<00:06:24.220> fish<00:06:24.430> to<00:06:24.610> come<00:06:24.639> in<00:06:24.970> whereas<00:06:25.660> if<00:06:25.780> you<00:06:25.900> fish

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
the fish to come in whereas if you fish

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.170 
the fish to come in whereas if you fish
a<00:06:26.169> main<00:06:26.470> lake<00:06:26.710> like<00:06:27.280> right<00:06:27.460> from<00:06:27.699> so<00:06:27.940> you<00:06:28.060> have

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
a main lake like right from so you have

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.270 
a main lake like right from so you have
them<00:06:28.300> mainly<00:06:28.479> you<00:06:28.840> have<00:06:28.960> a<00:06:29.229> possibility<00:06:30.069> of

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
them mainly you have a possibility of

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.580 
them mainly you have a possibility of
coming<00:06:30.669> to<00:06:30.789> the<00:06:30.880> right<00:06:31.060> the<00:06:31.630> left<00:06:31.810> and<00:06:32.139> towards

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
coming to the right the left and towards

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.260 
coming to the right the left and towards
you<00:06:32.680> so<00:06:32.889> you<00:06:32.949> have<00:06:33.099> three<00:06:33.340> possibilities<00:06:33.849> of

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
you so you have three possibilities of

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.240 
you so you have three possibilities of
fish<00:06:34.449> coming<00:06:34.810> into<00:06:34.960> you<00:06:35.199> and<00:06:35.740> basically<00:06:36.069> if

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
fish coming into you and basically if

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.629 
fish coming into you and basically if
you<00:06:36.400> find<00:06:36.669> some<00:06:37.509> cover<00:06:38.190> you<00:06:39.190> know<00:06:39.250> in<00:06:39.340> the<00:06:39.430> form

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
you find some cover you know in the form

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.520 
you find some cover you know in the form
of<00:06:39.789> a<00:06:39.880> drop-off<00:06:40.389> or<00:06:40.720> a<00:06:40.780> tree<00:06:41.020> in<00:06:41.080> the<00:06:41.169> water

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
of a drop-off or a tree in the water

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.379 
of a drop-off or a tree in the water
that's<00:06:41.979> excellent<00:06:42.460> you<00:06:42.580> know<00:06:42.610> you're<00:06:42.940> right

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
that's excellent you know you're right

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:44.640 
that's excellent you know you're right
off<00:06:43.509> the<00:06:43.630> bat<00:06:43.810> you<00:06:43.930> know<00:06:43.960> fish<00:06:44.319> you're<00:06:44.500> gonna

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
off the bat you know fish you're gonna

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.129 
off the bat you know fish you're gonna
be<00:06:45.340> coming<00:06:45.669> there<00:06:45.849> so<00:06:46.539> let's<00:06:46.720> go<00:06:46.870> and<00:06:46.990> check

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:47.139 
be coming there so let's go and check

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:48.899 
be coming there so let's go and check
this<00:06:47.289> map<00:06:47.560> out<00:06:47.800> on<00:06:47.979> the<00:06:48.069> table<00:06:48.490> and<00:06:48.550> we'll<00:06:48.729> kind

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:48.909 
this map out on the table and we'll kind

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.180 
this map out on the table and we'll kind
of<00:06:48.970> show<00:06:49.150> you<00:06:49.210> how<00:06:49.449> we<00:06:49.509> get<00:06:50.409> started<00:06:50.650> to<00:06:51.009> look

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
of show you how we get started to look

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.249
