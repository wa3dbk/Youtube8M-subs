00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 My son was great because I did not have 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.980
 competent doctor does not cite the 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:11.639
 catering did not mistake the samu took 45 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.230
 minutes, where he listened, but despite 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.480
 It took time and it went very well. 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.460
 answered by the doctors in the mouth 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.070
 the samu's tutor gave me all the attention 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.310
 The world only has to thank them. 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.439
 because as I did not have a hospital here 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.180
 a competent physician to attend to my 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.980
 son was transferred to london 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.650

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.719
 of morality cosmetic luthor one hour and 15 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.390
 minutes to save his life 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.910
 it was open to the curb without anesthesia 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.890
 To answer just for you, you do not know. 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.320
 did not manage to survive 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.809
 because here with the doctor there was 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.850
 attended by a specialist out there 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.180
 The doctor there told me that you have 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.670
 It has been well attended in the hospital to roll 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.710
 here address go through surgery and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.280
 would have survived he died for 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.379
 bullet 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.020
 He died because he was poorly attended. 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.399
 because he lost a lot of blood a lot 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.309
 blood by not having a competent doctor 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.860
 in the hospital to answer I did not treat 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.920
 no product no one bad in the hospital 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.720
 because employees are not to blame 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.760
 Because the day of voting arrives 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.200
 jonny boy at the door from door to door 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.390
 ask for a vote 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.000
 We need a mother when we need it. 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.680
 I've never had anyone's help 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.409
 I've worked my whole life to create my 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.960
 son alone and he had the defect 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.909
 He had but we all have no one. 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.829
 the right to take the life of my son 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.350
 only that my vengeance waits on jesus 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.189
 Christ, because he is my revenge and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.299
 I ask you in the name of Jesus to change you 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.210
 this in rolândia 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.360
 because we need unpaid health 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.250
 taxes are charged high tax 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.869
 someone has to be responsible for a 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.869
 decent hospital care 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.009
 if the mayors do not do something 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.110
 that will hit and if the higher authority is 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.880
 That's what I said, the rebel and 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.570
 I voted that my son was very poorly 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.079
 attended 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.210
 the piauí is what the boy the boys who 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.470
 they did it I know who I am, I know where 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.370
 lives 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.890
 I only wish for him that God covers them and 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.989
 I do not want them in the car that they 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.450
 They did it for me, I do not want 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.940
 Feel what I 'm feeling today. 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.420
 I'm standing because my Jesus has 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.769
 supporting my Jesus the fate of those 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.959
 faces that I'm not a very woman 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.959
 I hope that one of them
