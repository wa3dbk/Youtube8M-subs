00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 to begin by proposing the round of 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.460
 departure which consists of a first rank 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.610
 of bardot which you will have cut 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.610
 paws 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.420
 the starting rank must exceed 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.670
 the 6 mm eave juxtaposing bars 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.740
 so without the state knows how to use all 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.600
 galvanized 17 gauge with a head of 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.550
 knot mm for all models of bardos 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.770
 everything must be long enough for everything 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.150
 just crossed the plywood the nails 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.530
 will be longer when you put the 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.870
 layer of bards over the old 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.220
 pumice layer and the nocs just at 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.470
 above the left band until 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.550
 that the head is flush with the surface 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.989
 then installed the first rank of 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.059
 bardos over the starting line 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.559
 you can install the shingles in 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.420
 moving from one end to the other 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.710
 from the roof or two water edges in you 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.579
 recalling, however, 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.579
 shingles at each row 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.670
 you can also pulled lines of 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.229
 vertical reference like this one for 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.680
 facilitate the shift of shingles to 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.680
 every rank 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.060
 install the fans of you in them 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.060
 sticky like this 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.450
 for the ridge and the cutting edges 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.890
 shingles in three equal parts 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.540
 tie the umbrella at its center to 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.490
 have equal parts of pure to 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.730
 granules on either side of the fact or 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.080
 from the red 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.910
 start from the bottom of an edge or 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.920
 the opposite end of the fact in 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.600
 dominate and lay the ridge 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.780
 overlapping in order to have 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.400
 a pure or about 14 cm cloud and the 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.560
 ridge with a nail on each side to 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.870
 15 cm from the bottom of the office and two 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.130
 centimeters and a half of each flank he 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.000
 will only remain to install the 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.750
 metal suns 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.750
 where it is necessary 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.860
 for valleys install a non metal 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.570
 corrosive specifically designed for this 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.590
 application 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:13.420
 make sure that it is well adapted to 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.520
 the valley angle point out that a 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.950
 self-adhesive waterproofing membrane 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.000
 already been installed in the valley 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.830
 it will provide protection 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.080
 optimal and eliminate the risks of 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.370
 condensation louis the piece of metal in 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.770
 place with some nails on the 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.270
 membrane install the shingles on a 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.070
 May 1st feels first you can 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.990
 cut into banknotes the upper corner of the 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.390
 last bardot of everyone like this for 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.350
 facilitate flow of water 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.940
 complete the installation of the shingles 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.350
 on the first front slope of 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.090
 start installing shingles 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.800
 on the second one does not nail and not the 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.450
 shingles in the valley use rather 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.990
 of the stick to fix the shingles 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.990
