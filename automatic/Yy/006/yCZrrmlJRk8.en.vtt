this<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.799> one<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.100> reasons<00:03:44.400> why<00:03:44.519> we<00:03:44.700> do

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
this is one of the reasons why we do

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.030

growing and part of my growing process

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.130 
growing and part of my growing process
is<00:05:09.490> shooting<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.090> JPEG<00:05:10.540> so<00:05:10.720> I<00:05:10.780> can<00:05:10.960> see

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
is shooting a JPEG so I can see

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.900 
is shooting a JPEG so I can see
instantly<00:05:11.530> both<00:05:11.800> before<00:05:12.040> I<00:05:12.250> shoot<00:05:12.490> it<00:05:12.640> as<00:05:12.760> well

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
with the quality so that just takes the

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.280 
with the quality so that just takes the
whole<00:05:43.270> quality<00:05:43.690> thing<00:05:43.870> and<00:05:43.990> throws<00:05:44.140> it<00:05:44.260> right

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
whole quality thing and throws it right

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.320 
whole quality thing and throws it right
out<00:05:44.530> the<00:05:44.650> window<00:05:44.770> there<00:05:45.370> are<00:05:45.400> times<00:05:46.000> when

out the window there are times when
we're<00:05:46.600> gonna<00:05:46.720> have<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.169> shoot<00:05:47.320> in<00:05:47.470> RAW<00:05:47.650> to<00:05:47.890> make

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
we're gonna have to shoot in RAW to make

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.920 
we're gonna have to shoot in RAW to make
a<00:05:48.070> big<00:05:48.340> big<00:05:48.550> print<00:05:48.850> and<00:05:49.060> I'll<00:05:49.360> probably<00:05:49.570> switch

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
a big big print and I'll probably switch

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.350 
a big big print and I'll probably switch
over<00:05:50.229> to<00:05:50.260> a<00:05:50.380> different<00:05:50.740> camera<00:05:50.950> so<00:05:51.310> argue<00:05:52.180> if

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
over to a different camera so argue if

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.060 
over to a different camera so argue if
you<00:05:52.510> want<00:05:52.720> to<00:05:52.900> about<00:05:53.110> this<00:05:53.229> JPEG<00:05:53.680> raw<00:05:53.710> thing

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
you want to about this JPEG raw thing

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.310 
you want to about this JPEG raw thing
which<00:05:54.220> is<00:05:54.340> ridiculous<00:05:54.910> but<00:05:55.120> if<00:05:55.660> you<00:05:56.020> need<00:05:56.290> a

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
which is ridiculous but if you need a

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.620 
which is ridiculous but if you need a

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
boost in confidence just shoot in JPEG

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.030 
boost in confidence just shoot in JPEG
right<00:05:58.960> not<00:05:59.140> that<00:05:59.290> I'm<00:05:59.380> the<00:05:59.470> most<00:05:59.590> confident

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
right not that I'm the most confident
