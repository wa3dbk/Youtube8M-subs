00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.090 

I'll<00:00:52.750> be<00:00:52.960> honest<00:00:53.260> I've<00:00:53.380> only<00:00:53.530> tried<00:00:53.710> this<00:00:53.950> with

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
I'll be honest I've only tried this with

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.670 
I'll be honest I've only tried this with
final<00:00:54.400> fantasy<00:00:54.430> 5<00:00:54.970> but<00:00:55.420> I'm<00:00:56.110> pretty<00:00:56.320> sure<00:00:56.440> the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
final fantasy 5 but I'm pretty sure the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:05.610 
final fantasy 5 but I'm pretty sure the
other<00:00:56.770> games<00:00:56.980> will<00:00:57.130> work<00:00:57.310> too

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.990 

that's<00:01:06.620> what<00:01:06.740> I<00:01:06.770> meant<00:01:06.860> by<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.070> lack<00:01:07.870> boy

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
that's what I meant by the lack boy

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.290 
that's what I meant by the lack boy
don't<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:11.090> get<00:01:11.240> it<00:01:11.330> loaded<00:01:11.480> up<00:01:11.720> I<00:01:13.060> was<00:01:14.060> playing

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
don't you get it loaded up I was playing

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:23.470 
don't you get it loaded up I was playing
it<00:01:14.390> earlier<00:01:14.660> is<00:01:14.840> just<00:01:15.080> fine

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:31.330 

okay<00:01:24.410> maybe<00:01:24.710> some<00:01:25.010> major<00:01:25.220> lag

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.630 

anyways<00:01:32.090> that's<00:01:32.240> how<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:32.479> do<00:01:32.659> it<00:01:33.640> just

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
anyways that's how you do it just

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.190 
anyways that's how you do it just
thought<00:01:34.789> i<00:01:34.850> would<00:01:34.939> also<00:01:35.179> throw<00:01:35.509> this<00:01:35.780> in<00:01:35.960> there

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
thought i would also throw this in there

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.499 
thought i would also throw this in there
that<00:01:36.530> if<00:01:36.829> you<00:01:37.009> hold<00:01:37.250> down<00:01:37.369> on<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.000> touch

that if you hold down on the touch

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.709 
that if you hold down on the touch
screen<00:01:39.340> then<00:01:40.340> it'll<00:01:40.609> load<00:01:40.759> up<00:01:40.969> your<00:01:41.000> PS<00:01:41.479> button
