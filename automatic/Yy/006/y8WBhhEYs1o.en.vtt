hi guys it's Ross hope you had a great
day<00:00:02.429> I<00:00:02.639> just<00:00:03.389> want<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.810> do<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.740> test<00:00:05.100> of

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
day I just want to do a test of

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.790 
day I just want to do a test of
something<00:00:05.580> oh<00:00:06.859> well<00:00:07.859> this<00:00:08.820> here<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.360> TDS<00:00:10.170> 3

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
something oh well this here is a TDS 3

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.390 
something oh well this here is a TDS 3
meter<00:00:11.389> now<00:00:12.389> what<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.660> does<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:14.450> it<00:00:15.450> measures

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
meter now what this does is it measures

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.540 
meter now what this does is it measures
parts-per-million

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
parts-per-million

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.650 
parts-per-million
in<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.690> water<00:00:18.840> by<00:00:19.170> these<00:00:19.410> two<00:00:20.000> electrodes<00:00:21.000> I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
in the water by these two electrodes I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.759 
in the water by these two electrodes I
thought<00:00:22.109> it'd<00:00:22.199> be<00:00:22.230> interesting

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
thought it'd be interesting

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.230 
thought it'd be interesting
plus<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.460> think<00:00:23.519> I've<00:00:23.699> said<00:00:23.880> before<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.150> was

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
plus I think I've said before I was

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.460 
plus I think I've said before I was
looking<00:00:24.539> at<00:00:24.630> um<00:00:24.840> making<00:00:25.619> colloidal<00:00:26.250> silver<00:00:27.470> so

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
looking at um making colloidal silver so

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.730 
looking at um making colloidal silver so
I<00:00:28.800> just<00:00:29.220> thought<00:00:29.310> I'd<00:00:29.460> test<00:00:29.730> out<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.260> the<00:00:31.260> TDS

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
I just thought I'd test out the the TDS

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.000 
I just thought I'd test out the the TDS
3<00:00:32.040> meter<00:00:32.279> um<00:00:32.910> if<00:00:33.510> you're<00:00:33.809> interested<00:00:34.010> feel

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
3 meter um if you're interested feel

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.250 
3 meter um if you're interested feel
free<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.309> watch<00:00:35.579> if<00:00:35.880> not<00:00:36.210> absolutely<00:00:37.020> no

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
free to watch if not absolutely no

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.310 
free to watch if not absolutely no
problem<00:00:38.510> right<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.570> I've<00:00:39.780> got<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.960> glass<00:00:40.140> of

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
problem right so I've got a glass of

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.380 
problem right so I've got a glass of
water<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:40.800> simple<00:00:41.579> first<00:00:43.550> press<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.270> off

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
water here simple first press on and off

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.639 
water here simple first press on and off
hill<00:00:46.379> equals<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.039> zero<00:00:51.079> you<00:00:52.079> hold<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.469> here

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
hill equals to zero you hold it in here

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.150 
hill equals to zero you hold it in here
for<00:00:52.770> about<00:00:52.980> 10<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.309> 20<00:00:53.579> seconds

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.950 

you<00:00:59.790> press<00:01:00.030> hold<00:01:04.520> all<00:01:05.520> right<00:01:05.690> let<00:01:06.690> me<00:01:06.750> shake

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you press hold all right let me shake

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.130 
you press hold all right let me shake
off<00:01:07.140> Oh<00:01:08.810> triumphing<00:01:12.260> 276<00:01:13.260> parts<00:01:13.650> per<00:01:13.830> million

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
off Oh triumphing 276 parts per million

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.250 
off Oh triumphing 276 parts per million
so<00:01:16.140> that's<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.500> normal<00:01:16.830> water<00:01:17.010> upstairs<00:01:18.260> now

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
so that's just normal water upstairs now

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.900 
so that's just normal water upstairs now
interestingly<00:01:19.620> this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.340> upstairs<00:01:20.640> water

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
interestingly this is the upstairs water

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.480 
interestingly this is the upstairs water
when<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.870> tested<00:01:22.260> it<00:01:22.350> downstairs<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.220> measures

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
when I tested it downstairs it measures

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.440 
when I tested it downstairs it measures
at<00:01:24.350> 150<00:01:25.350> parts<00:01:25.590> per<00:01:25.710> million<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.460> somewhere<00:01:26.880> 20

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
at 150 parts per million so somewhere 20

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.620 
at 150 parts per million so somewhere 20
parts<00:01:27.720> per<00:01:27.780> million<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.380> being<00:01:28.530> added<00:01:29.360> wait<00:01:30.360> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
parts per million is being added wait a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.130 
parts per million is being added wait a
second

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
second

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.270 
second
anyway<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.360> prove<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.830> working

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
anyway so just to prove that is working

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.920 
anyway so just to prove that is working
I'm<00:01:36.270> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.510> do<00:01:37.009> is<00:01:38.009> I'm<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.430> add<00:01:38.930> some

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
I'm going to do is I'm going to add some

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.130 
I'm going to do is I'm going to add some
salt<00:01:40.550> now<00:01:41.550> obviously<00:01:41.820> salt<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.300> soluble<00:01:42.660> so<00:01:43.080> it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
salt now obviously salt is soluble so it

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.370 
salt now obviously salt is soluble so it
will<00:01:43.350> become<00:01:44.570> sort<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:45.750> one<00:01:46.020> with<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
will become sort of as one with the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.180 
will become sort of as one with the
water<00:01:47.060> as<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.330> solves<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.330> theory<00:01:52.190> well

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
water as it solves so in theory well

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.499 
water as it solves so in theory well
customize<00:01:54.060> out<00:01:54.450> um<00:01:55.040> in<00:01:56.040> theory<00:01:56.630> now<00:01:57.830> that<00:01:58.830> all

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
customize out um in theory now that all

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.780 
customize out um in theory now that all
steak<00:02:00.509> right<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.470> theory<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.340> should<00:02:02.400> now

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
steak right in theory this should now

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:12.490 
steak right in theory this should now
have<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.240> higher<00:02:03.569> ppm<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.319> that<00:02:04.500> was<00:02:04.640> 271<00:02:05.640> before

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.100 

sorry<00:02:13.500> 171<00:02:14.310> right<00:02:15.300> now<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.600> problem<00:02:15.930> I'm

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
sorry 171 right now the problem I'm

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.510 
sorry 171 right now the problem I'm
having<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.500> have<00:02:16.650> actually<00:02:16.830> stirred<00:02:17.280> that

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
having is I have actually stirred that

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:32.110 
having is I have actually stirred that
so<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:19.310> sort<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.340> fluctuating<00:02:20.850> any

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:43.020 

right

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:51.910 

all<00:02:44.030> right<00:02:48.310> 368<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:50.270> I've<00:02:50.510> added<00:02:50.750> say<00:02:51.590> if<00:02:51.740> that

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
all right 368 so I've added say if that

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.280 
all right 368 so I've added say if that
was<00:02:52.070> 100<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:53.050> sorry<00:02:54.050> -<00:02:54.290> what<00:02:54.530> was<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:56.260> 271<00:02:57.260> I

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
was 100 and sorry - what was it 271 I

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:05.350 
was 100 and sorry - what was it 271 I
think<00:02:59.770> I've<00:03:00.770> added<00:03:00.950> 90<00:03:02.830> of<00:03:03.830> 1893<00:03:04.610> parts<00:03:05.240> per

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
think I've added 90 of 1893 parts per

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.710 
think I've added 90 of 1893 parts per
million<00:03:06.340> correct<00:03:07.340> me<00:03:07.430> if<00:03:07.520> I'm<00:03:07.640> wrong<00:03:07.690> no<00:03:08.690> I

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
million correct me if I'm wrong no I

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.720 
million correct me if I'm wrong no I
haven't<00:03:08.900> no<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.140> haven't<00:03:09.380> I've<00:03:09.500> done<00:03:09.680> added<00:03:10.250> 90

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
haven't no I haven't I've done added 90

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.910 
haven't no I haven't I've done added 90
I<00:03:11.620> can<00:03:12.620> well<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:12.950> first<00:03:13.130> figure<00:03:13.280> was<00:03:13.490> was<00:03:13.640> it

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
I can well the first figure was was it

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
I can well the first figure was was it
181<00:03:15.920> I'm<00:03:16.220> not<00:03:16.580> sure<00:03:16.760> anyway<00:03:17.390> it's<00:03:18.200> it's<00:03:18.500> higher

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
181 I'm not sure anyway it's it's higher

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.340 
181 I'm not sure anyway it's it's higher
so<00:03:19.940> just<00:03:20.270> to<00:03:20.330> prove<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.600> works<00:03:20.750> there<00:03:21.080> you<00:03:21.170> go

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
so just to prove it works there you go

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.770 
so just to prove it works there you go
