let's just talk about this knife for a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.219 
let's just talk about this knife for a
little<00:01:46.560> while<00:01:47.119> it's<00:01:48.119> got<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.509> spidey<00:01:48.990> hole

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
little while it's got the spidey hole

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.039 
little while it's got the spidey hole
for<00:01:49.740> opening<00:01:50.119> but<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.180> think<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:51.630> purely

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
for opening but I think that's purely

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.960 
for opening but I think that's purely
ceremonial<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.100> traditional<00:01:53.790> because

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
ceremonial and traditional because

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.270 
ceremonial and traditional because
you're<00:01:54.960> not<00:01:55.110> able<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.439> really<00:01:55.770> open<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.159> like

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
you're not able to really open it like

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.490 
you're not able to really open it like

good I kind of you know get the old
fingernail<00:03:10.030> test<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.599> it<00:03:10.690> seemed<00:03:10.900> pretty

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
fingernail test and it seemed pretty

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.660

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
sharp but let's just take a look at how

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.000 
sharp but let's just take a look at how
it's<00:03:12.819> gonna<00:03:12.940> cut<00:03:13.209> some<00:03:13.390> paper<00:03:13.829> foam<00:03:14.829> book

it's gonna cut some paper foam book
paper<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.840> it's<00:03:16.840> doing<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.079> pretty<00:03:17.260> good<00:03:17.349> job

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
paper and it's doing a pretty good job

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.729 
paper and it's doing a pretty good job
just<00:03:18.370> flying<00:03:18.579> right<00:03:18.760> through<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:19.120> so<00:03:19.739> doesn't

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
just flying right through it so doesn't

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.920 
just flying right through it so doesn't
disappoint<00:03:21.100> that's<00:03:21.790> pretty<00:03:22.540> on<00:03:22.630> par<00:03:22.870> with

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
disappoint that's pretty on par with
