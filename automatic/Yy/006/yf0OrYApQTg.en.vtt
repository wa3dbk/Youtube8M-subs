00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 are my fourth Olympic games ' I have 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.460
 what to say came with an experience 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.040
 behind that many do not have and well there 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.799
 than trying to take advantage of all 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.220
 these experiences to be able to finally give 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.980
 my maximum on the day of the race but 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.689
 the media often hang you 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.220
 medals before what is it is not necessary 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.439
 be realistic that the medal is 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.990
 possible but you have to leave you have to know 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.380
 also that the medals are faces that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.649
 we all fight for it and good 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.480
 because it depends many times of the day 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.960
 many times there are external conditions 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.790
 that we do not have the power to control them 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.340
 like meteorology and everything so 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.739
 we always hope that the competitions 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.920
 so be regular for all 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.930
 improve vancouver always positive but 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.449
 I have to say that to get to about 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.460
 Olympic Games I am going to 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.829
 fight for a medal and that's what 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.469
 I would really like especially this 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.239
 year I have had better results in 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.210
 descent than in supergiant 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.159
 It must be said that the supergiant has 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.990
 the difficulty of not trying the 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.659
 track before nor do we have workouts 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.970
 Officials before the competition day 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.860
 as is the batch descent so 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.750
 so much there is always much more risk of 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.119
 that the day of the race as they are committed 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.570
 more mistakes or we can even get out 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.299
 of the plot those have been until now 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.179
 The reasons are therefore clearer for the 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:34.390
 that have not had good results in 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:36.250
 supergiant but I know that if the 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.080
 whole round race because I think that 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.080
 I can get good results like 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.630
 the decline is very positive that there is a 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.640
 large number of winter athletes 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.159
 that we can access these games 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.409
 Olympic Games' means that the work 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.959
 it's being done back then it works 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.209
 even being in a situation now 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.939
 same as critical from what is the 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:00.610
 country what can I say to young people 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.890
 is that they try to get the most out of it 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.319
 of the experience of what it entails 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.689
 these olympic games and follow 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.549
 working to be able to reach a day 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.299
 then to the Olympic games with these 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.299
 real options
