00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.120
 how are you doing and today we have a 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.339
 classic dessert that you like from the most 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.830
 small to the older ones we are going to 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:11.080
 start by heating the oven to 180 degrees 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.490
 it's very important so we have the oven 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.519
 hot when we put the cake 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.519
 inside here we have the ingredients 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.060
 we want important tulip sugar 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:24.939
 yolks lemon juice lemon zest 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.679
 we have the flour we have a little bit of 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.769
 yeast a little sugar vanilla 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.330
 dow then we have egg whites for 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.579
 beat them to the point of snow and for 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.489
 We also have a tulip very 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:42.329
 necessary icing sugar lemon juice and 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.329
 milk we started very important tulip 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.990
 we add tulip in the bowl we need 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.990
 add the sugar 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.079
 and we are going to beat it beats that remain 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.079
 spongy 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.460
 then we begin to add the rest 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.400
 of the ingredients we continue to add 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.850
 the egg yolks and we continue 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.850
 beating 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.890
 and then we will add the rest of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.900
 the ingredients 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.900
 there must be a homogeneous mass 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.210
 we stopped 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.210
 and now let's add the lemon juice 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.640
 the lemon skin 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.460
 we continue beating 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.710
 we stop again and now we will add the 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.630
 flour together with the yeast 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.700
 and if we like a little sugar 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:52.289
 vanilla dow we mix it a little bit 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.680
 Now we add the flour little by little 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:58.990
 inside the mass 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.990
 we beat a little we booked half 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.189
 always at moderate speed 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.540
 very creamy 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.880
 we stopped 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.880
 we add the rest of the flour 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.300
 and we continue beating 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.540
 we continue and we are going to beat the whites of 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.630
 egg to the point of snow we put the 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.220
 clear in the bowl 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.440
 and what we 're going to do is we're going to 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.220
 beat with the electric mixer to 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.220
 big speed 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.150
 we already have the clear beaten to the point of 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.390
 snow 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.549
 and we see it when the mass is 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.980
 practically totally solid and it 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.290
 Hold on the spoon now let's 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.230
 mix the egg whites with the dough 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.950
 tulip eggs flour and sugar 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.060
 then what we do is we take 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.360
 a language and we are adding the whites 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.360
 little by little 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.980
 it is important that we be careful 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.380
 because we have to keep the air that 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.040
 we have in the clear 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.040
 we mix 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.280
 always little by little 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.450
 we already have the mass well mixed 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.099
 homogeneous 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.650
 remember that tulip provides us 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.109
 ease to mix and then in the 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.469
 cake juiciness flavor and fluffiness 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:54.930
 we take a mold and it is important that 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:57.980
 we have the inside of the mold with a 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.980
 little tulip 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.659
 the next step we are going to introduce the 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.659
 mass inside the mold 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:19.739
 once well distributed we are going to bake it 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.739
 at 180 degrees for 35 minutes 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.510
 we take it out of the oven and there we have a 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.540
 cake with a lot of juicy flavor and 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.740
 spongy thanks to tulip next 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.819
 let's make the class 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:48.590
 tulip a spoonful in this case 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:48.590
 then add the milk 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.620
 once we have milk and tulip 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.930
 perfectly fused we will add the 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.570
 sugar 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.180
 we heat it slightly and finally 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.180
 we will add the lemon juice 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.470
 once we have added lemon juice 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:12.690
 What we will do is remove it from the fire and 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.690
 we'll let it cool 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.699
 we already have the cold garbage we have 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.710
 beaten so that the dough is 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.780
 perfectly opaque and what we are going to 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.229
 to do is we're going to spread it over 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.229
 from the cake 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:32.669
 so that it is well distributed 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.150
 and finally there we have the cake of 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.199
 lemon 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.199
 thank you very much for following us
