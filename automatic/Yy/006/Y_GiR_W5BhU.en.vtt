show<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.660> quickly<00:01:00.870> looks<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.500> on

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
show you what it quickly looks like on

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.229 
show you what it quickly looks like on
this<00:01:01.859> map<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:02.670> actually<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.030> nice

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
this map and it's actually really nice

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.789 
this map and it's actually really nice
it's<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.229> know<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
it's just so you know it's a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.219 
it's just so you know it's a
bloodthirsty<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.240> lot<00:01:06.630> people<00:01:06.869> don't<00:01:06.900> know

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
bloodthirsty as a lot people don't know

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.330 
bloodthirsty as a lot people don't know
you<00:01:07.350> know<00:01:07.380> I've<00:01:07.500> made<00:01:07.650> quite<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.070> few<00:01:08.100> videos

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
you know I've made quite a few videos

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.310 
you know I've made quite a few videos
about<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.670> now<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.330> five<00:01:09.720> kill<00:01:10.049> streak

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
about this now is a five kill streak

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.740 
about this now is a five kill streak
without<00:01:10.530> dying<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.390> need<00:01:12.450> 10<00:01:12.689> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
without dying so you just need 10 of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.660 
without dying so you just need 10 of
those<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.200> are<00:01:13.320> fairly<00:01:13.530> simple<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.159> think

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
those which are fairly simple I think

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.340 
those which are fairly simple I think
can<00:01:14.820> actually<00:01:15.150> get<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> coupling<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:16.080> you

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
can actually get like a coupling if you

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.580 
can actually get like a coupling if you
get<00:01:16.530> kills<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.240> house<00:01:18.930> tour<00:01:19.140> missile<00:01:19.470> all

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
get kills up to a house tour missile all

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.219 
get kills up to a house tour missile all
along<00:01:19.950> along<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:21.210> line<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.900> then<00:01:22.110> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
along along that line to you then you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.530 
along along that line to you then you
can<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:23.009> also<00:01:23.549> counts<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.119> kills<00:01:24.299> from<00:01:24.390> that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
can that also counts the kills from that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.520 
can that also counts the kills from that
horse<00:01:24.689> account<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.229> there<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.920> will<00:01:26.070> be

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
horse account and there it will be

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.499 
horse account and there it will be
you'll<00:01:28.530> get<00:01:28.650> gold<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.909> Scorpion

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
you'll get gold so this is the Scorpion

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.020 
you'll get gold so this is the Scorpion
