00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.760
 hello to all today the central 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.240
 gas that will introduce you to the shark 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.240
 van thai 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.780
 if the design of this new sharks does not 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.250
 you is no stranger it's because the 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.710
 wind times is closely derived from the 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.810
 nano an enveloping jet urban outlet in 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.369
 2013 and the biggest difference between 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.380
 both of them therefore relates to the chin guard of 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.900
 Wind protection times that allows it 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.189
 to access the status of integral 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.050
 externally we find the same hull 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.220
 rounded to the harmonious line but the 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.290
 new chin guard leakage comes him 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.060
 to give an even more futuristic look in 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.070
 more energize her look she protects 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.680
 effectively the lower face in case of 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.450
 fall but without hindering the visibility the 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.560
 wind times is so very protective 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.450
 by limiting the feeling of confinement 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.540
 that we can have in an integral more 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.980
 classic the imposing screen it contributes 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.290
 also because it allows a very wide 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.610
 vision in height and on the sides and 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.590
 if he receives only one treatment 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.150
 anti uv and anti-scratch it is in 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.100
 revenge equipped with an air intake for 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.630
 limit the appearance of bus and its 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.070
 handling is not complicated and we 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.540
 can even remove it completely if we 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.040
 the desire 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.720
 inside the fiber foams 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.490
 natural bamboo procura support 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.439
 convincing but mostly offers a very 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.030
 good cheek comfort as well as the 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.470
 headdress disassembles itself entirely for 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.749
 make cleaning easier 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.460
 as for the nano the wind times is 

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:18.710
 equipped with a removable sun visor 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.530
 is easy to handle thanks to 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.640
 lever located on the left of the helmet 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.439
 we also find on the top of the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.140
 hull a ventilation and a loop 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.399
 micrometric to close the chinstrap 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.560
 level size and color the leaf 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.939
 does not exist night in maths or in 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.109
 decoration and it is available from xs to xl 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.700
 to conclude we can say that the 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:39.979
 leaf is not a helmet that offers 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.719
 both an integral protection but 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.789
 with a general feeling closer to the 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.909
 jet the perfect tool to crisscross the 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.960
 city or go for a ride on the road 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.090
 here you know now all 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.530
 the details of the shark sale times thanks to 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.329
 all of us having watched and for 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.899
 other videos about the helmet universe 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.899
