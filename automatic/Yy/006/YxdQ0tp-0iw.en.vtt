GSA for a long time but just some
impressions<00:00:38.250> one<00:00:38.460> thing<00:00:38.699> that's<00:00:38.850> really<00:00:39.000> neat

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
impressions one thing that's really neat

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.299 
impressions one thing that's really neat
is<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.750> your<00:00:39.960> air<00:00:40.170> intake<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.980> call<00:00:41.190> them

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
is you have your air intake I call them

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.729 
is you have your air intake I call them
gills<00:00:41.580> but<00:00:42.360> your<00:00:42.480> air<00:00:42.629> intake<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:43.290> your<00:00:43.470> air

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
gills but your air intake for your air

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.790 
gills but your air intake for your air
filter<00:00:44.280> right<00:00:45.150> here<00:00:45.540> on<00:00:45.750> both<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.199> right<00:00:46.440> side

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
filter right here on both the right side

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.860 
filter right here on both the right side
and<00:00:47.129> then<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.370> other<00:00:47.550> side<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.660> nice

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and then the other side so it's a nice

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.530 
and then the other side so it's a nice
high<00:00:49.410> air<00:00:50.100> intake<00:00:50.640> snorkel<00:00:51.180> which<00:00:51.299> is<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.510> think

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
high air intake snorkel which is I think

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.899 
high air intake snorkel which is I think
is<00:00:51.839> great<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.350> water<00:00:52.559> crossings<00:00:53.190> another

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
is great for water crossings another

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.490 
is great for water crossings another
unique<00:00:54.239> thing<00:00:54.299> that<00:00:54.900> I<00:00:54.930> think<00:00:55.080> you'll<00:00:55.350> notice

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
unique thing that I think you'll notice

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.070 
unique thing that I think you'll notice
off<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:55.920> bat<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.250> there's<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.540> one<00:00:57.540> screw<00:00:57.930> that

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
off the bat is there's a one screw that

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.859 
off the bat is there's a one screw that
has<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.680> door<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.129> opens<00:00:59.820> if<00:01:00.479> you<00:01:00.540> look

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:00.869 
has this door that opens if you look

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:02.570 
has this door that opens if you look
inside<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.650> actually<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.280> your

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
inside here you actually have your

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.899 
inside here you actually have your
coolant<00:01:03.089> level<00:01:03.659> register<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.190> is<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
coolant level register and this is the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.240 
coolant level register and this is the
cover<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.630> covers<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.409> fill<00:01:07.650> valve<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.159> if

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
cover that covers the fill valve so if

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.890 
cover that covers the fill valve so if
you<00:01:08.340> need<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.580> add<00:01:08.729> coolant<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.630> remove

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
you need to add coolant you just remove

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.050 
you need to add coolant you just remove
this<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.320> bolt<00:01:10.560> pull<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.340> off<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.939> think

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
this one bolt pull this off I think

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.490 
this one bolt pull this off I think
that's<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.390> really<00:01:12.630> neat<00:01:12.780> innovative<00:01:13.260> thing

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
