00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
all right today we are going to have a

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.039 
all right today we are going to have a
look<00:00:02.340> at<00:00:02.460> making<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.790> budget<00:00:03.120> yoke<00:00:03.659> for<00:00:04.020> a

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
look at making a budget yoke for a

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.039 
look at making a budget yoke for a
strongman<00:00:04.560> training<00:00:05.569> put<00:00:06.569> together<00:00:06.720> out<00:00:07.020> a

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
strongman training put together out a

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.110 
strongman training put together out a
few<00:00:07.319> things<00:00:07.589> you<00:00:07.770> can<00:00:07.890> just<00:00:08.069> buy<00:00:08.309> from<00:00:09.059> a

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
few things you can just buy from a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.790 
few things you can just buy from a
hardware<00:00:09.389> store<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.780> from<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.230> climbing<00:00:10.590> store

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
hardware store and from a climbing store

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.730 
hardware store and from a climbing store
so<00:00:11.639> you'll<00:00:11.790> see<00:00:12.000> here<00:00:12.330> I'm<00:00:13.080> making<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.530> couple

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
so you'll see here I'm making a couple

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.670 
so you'll see here I'm making a couple
of<00:00:13.860> loading<00:00:14.190> pins<00:00:14.429> out<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.759> some<00:00:15.680> climbers

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
of loading pins out of some climbers

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.279 
of loading pins out of some climbers
tape<00:00:18.260> and<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.529> couple<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:20.010> barbell<00:00:20.609> ends

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
tape and a couple of barbell ends

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.570 
tape and a couple of barbell ends
alternatively<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.560> can<00:00:22.710> use<00:00:23.070> things<00:00:23.400> like

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
alternatively you can use things like

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.970 
alternatively you can use things like
the<00:00:23.880> iron<00:00:24.060> mind<00:00:24.830> loading<00:00:25.830> pins<00:00:27.619> in<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.740> case

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the iron mind loading pins in this case

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.910 
the iron mind loading pins in this case
I'm<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.400> threading<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.179> washer<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.380> then<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
I'm just threading a washer and then a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.940 
I'm just threading a washer and then a
bolt<00:00:32.390> onto<00:00:34.040> 25<00:00:35.040> millimeter<00:00:35.610> wide<00:00:36.950> climbers

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
bolt onto 25 millimeter wide climbers

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.060 
bolt onto 25 millimeter wide climbers
tube<00:00:38.250> which<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.489> extremely<00:00:39.149> strong<00:00:39.450> stuff<00:00:40.070> so

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
tube which is extremely strong stuff so

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.440 
tube which is extremely strong stuff so
we're<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.219> threading<00:00:41.640> those<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:42.030> there<00:00:42.239> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
we're just threading those on there to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.340 
we're just threading those on there to
provide<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:43.430> stop<00:00:44.450> that'll<00:00:45.450> go<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.600> inside<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
provide a stop that'll go up inside the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.740 
provide a stop that'll go up inside the
barber<00:00:46.710> lens<00:00:46.920> then<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.850> tying<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.239> not<00:00:48.450> off

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
barber lens then just tying it not off

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.330 
barber lens then just tying it not off
in<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> climbing<00:00:50.430> tape<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.800> jams<00:00:53.129> up

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
in the climbing tape so that it jams up

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.799 
in the climbing tape so that it jams up
inside<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:56.059> climbing<00:00:57.059> tape<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.570> costs

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
inside and climbing tape and it costs

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.220 
inside and climbing tape and it costs
about<00:00:58.070> $3<00:00:59.070> $4<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> meter<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.090> you'll<00:01:00.960> need

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
about $3 $4 a meter and you'll need

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.130 
about $3 $4 a meter and you'll need
about<00:01:03.379> 6<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.769> 7<00:01:05.010> meters<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.760> make<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.930> yoke

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
about 6 to 7 meters to make the the yoke

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.950 
about 6 to 7 meters to make the the yoke
like<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:09.210> once<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.479> get<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> knot<00:01:09.840> in

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
like this so once you get the knot in

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.330 
like this so once you get the knot in
there<00:01:10.400> you<00:01:11.400> see<00:01:12.590> nothing<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> bolt<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.189> nut

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
there you see nothing the bolt the nut

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.880 
there you see nothing the bolt the nut
in<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> washer<00:01:15.200> sitting<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:16.830> we

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
in the washer sitting there and then we

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.969 
in the washer sitting there and then we
just<00:01:16.920> pull<00:01:17.280> those<00:01:17.490> through<00:01:18.500> they<00:01:19.500> give<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.710> jam

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
just pull those through they give a jam

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.670 
just pull those through they give a jam
up<00:01:20.159> inside<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> end<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.909> barbell<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.869> now

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
up inside the end of the barbell and now

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.270 
up inside the end of the barbell and now
I'm<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.930> put<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.200> knot<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
I'm just going to put a knot in the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.550 
I'm just going to put a knot in the
other<00:01:26.490> end<00:01:26.729> leaving<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.330> loop<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.140> I've<00:01:28.259> doubled

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
other end leaving a loop so I've doubled

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.499 
other end leaving a loop so I've doubled
it<00:01:28.650> over<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.939> quick<00:01:30.119> thumb<00:01:30.450> knot<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:33.299> once

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
it over just a quick thumb knot and once

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.499 
it over just a quick thumb knot and once
I'm<00:01:33.689> finished<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:36.290> I'll<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:38.509> loading

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
I'm finished that I'll have a loading

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.069 
I'm finished that I'll have a loading
pin<00:01:39.689> which<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:40.259> attach<00:01:40.970> to<00:01:41.970> my<00:01:42.180> my

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
pin which I can then attach to my my

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.710 
pin which I can then attach to my my
yoke<00:01:43.350> with<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> carabiner<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.420> also<00:01:45.540> use

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
yoke with a carabiner and I can also use

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.499 
yoke with a carabiner and I can also use
this<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.189> things<00:01:47.189> are<00:01:47.369> rolling<00:01:47.520> thunder'<00:01:48.270> or

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
this for things are rolling thunder' or

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.950 
this for things are rolling thunder' or
weighted<00:01:48.869> chin-ups<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.360> we<00:01:51.360> also<00:01:51.479> use<00:01:51.780> those

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
weighted chin-ups and we also use those

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.319 
weighted chin-ups and we also use those
same<00:01:52.229> barbell<00:01:52.710> ends<00:01:52.979> as<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.399> stone<00:01:53.729> simulator

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
same barbell ends as the stone simulator

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.120 
same barbell ends as the stone simulator
in<00:01:54.630> our<00:01:54.840> gym<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:56.130> very<00:01:56.460> cheap<00:01:56.700> very<00:01:57.030> versatile

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
in our gym so very cheap very versatile

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.780 
in our gym so very cheap very versatile
yeah<00:01:59.130> when<00:01:59.250> you're<00:01:59.369> working<00:01:59.610> with<00:01:59.729> this

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
yeah when you're working with this

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.130 
yeah when you're working with this
climbers<00:02:00.240> tape<00:02:00.450> you've<00:02:00.659> got<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.840> make<00:02:00.930> sure

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
climbers tape you've got to make sure

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
climbers tape you've got to make sure
that<00:02:01.380> when<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.829> cut<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.250> seal<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.210> ends

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
that when you cut it you seal the ends

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.810 
that when you cut it you seal the ends
off<00:02:03.600> by<00:02:03.990> melting<00:02:04.890> them<00:02:05.250> with<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.579> cigarette

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
off by melting them with a cigarette

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.570 
off by melting them with a cigarette
lighter<00:02:06.290> so<00:02:07.290> now<00:02:07.469> what<00:02:07.590> I'm<00:02:07.710> doing<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:08.160> making

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
lighter so now what I'm doing is making

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.130 
lighter so now what I'm doing is making
the<00:02:09.239> longest<00:02:10.170> slings<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.489> long<00:02:11.730> loops

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the longest slings the long loops

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.800 
the longest slings the long loops
to<00:02:13.380> attach<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.710> loading<00:02:14.220> pins<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.670> our<00:02:14.850> yoke

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
to attach the loading pins to our yoke

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.280 
to attach the loading pins to our yoke
crossbar<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:18.360> way<00:02:18.480> we<00:02:18.540> do<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.870> with

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
crossbar and the way we do this is with

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.680 
crossbar and the way we do this is with
a<00:02:19.350> special<00:02:19.710> knot<00:02:20.010> called<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.280> tape<00:02:20.550> knot<00:02:20.850> which

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
a special knot called a tape knot which

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.540 
a special knot called a tape knot which
I'll<00:02:21.960> try<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.410> film<00:02:22.710> in<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.190> little<00:02:23.400> more

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
I'll try and film in a little more

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.230 
I'll try and film in a little more
detail<00:02:23.970> later<00:02:24.780> on<00:02:25.400> it's<00:02:26.400> very<00:02:26.640> important<00:02:27.090> when

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
detail later on it's very important when

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.090 
detail later on it's very important when
you're<00:02:27.330> using<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:28.020> climbers<00:02:28.320> tape<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.890> you

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
you're using this climbers tape that you

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.100 
you're using this climbers tape that you
you<00:02:29.520> do<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.150> knots<00:02:30.330> properly<00:02:30.720> because

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
you do the the knots properly because

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.950 
you do the the knots properly because
the<00:02:32.100> tapes<00:02:32.340> quite<00:02:32.640> slippery<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.390> some

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
the tapes quite slippery and some

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.110 
the tapes quite slippery and some
ordinary<00:02:34.320> knots<00:02:34.680> have<00:02:35.460> a<00:02:35.490> habit<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.850> working

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
ordinary knots have a habit of working

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.199 
ordinary knots have a habit of working
loose<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.080> there's<00:02:37.700> there's<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.790> few<00:02:38.970> specific

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
loose so there's there's a few specific

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.400 
loose so there's there's a few specific
knots<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:39.959> use<00:02:40.110> for<00:02:40.260> that

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
knots you can use for that

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.250 
knots you can use for that
and<00:02:41.720> these<00:02:42.720> slings<00:02:43.200> again<00:02:44.330> multi-purpose<00:02:45.330> not

you've<00:03:00.840> taken<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.250> knot<00:03:02.250> out<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.959> they<00:03:03.959> can

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
you've taken the knot out and they can

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.360 
you've taken the knot out and they can
be<00:03:04.260> used<00:03:04.470> for<00:03:04.739> things<00:03:05.130> like<00:03:07.100> catchers<00:03:08.100> in

safety racks for daisy chain things

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.620 
safety racks for daisy chain things
there's<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.290> wide<00:03:13.770> variety<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.190> uses<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:14.820> now

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
there's a wide variety of uses so now

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.780 
there's a wide variety of uses so now
I'm<00:03:15.870> doing<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.770> actually<00:03:17.010> one<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.160> my<00:03:17.250> my

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
I'm doing this is actually one of my my

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.420 
I'm doing this is actually one of my my
sort<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.150> cheap<00:03:18.390> dodgy<00:03:18.980> farmers<00:03:19.980> walk<00:03:20.160> bars

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
sort of cheap dodgy farmers walk bars

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.920 
sort of cheap dodgy farmers walk bars
and<00:03:23.209> simply<00:03:24.590> pass<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.890> loop<00:03:26.370> around<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.720> bar

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
and simply pass the loop around the bar

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.140 
and simply pass the loop around the bar
then<00:03:28.230> run<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.530> back<00:03:28.709> through<00:03:28.920> itself<00:03:29.150> to

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
then run it back through itself to

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.250 
then run it back through itself to
attach<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:32.190> bar<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.750> this<00:03:33.870> is<00:03:33.989> simply

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
attach it to the bar and this is simply

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:42.110 
attach it to the bar and this is simply
a<00:03:35.390> 15<00:03:36.390> mil<00:03:36.600> steel<00:03:37.500> pipe<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:40.670> you<00:03:41.670> could<00:03:41.880> use<00:03:42.090> a

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
a 15 mil steel pipe and you could use a

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.740 
a 15 mil steel pipe and you could use a
regular<00:03:42.540> Olympic<00:03:43.080> bar<00:03:43.260> for<00:03:43.500> this<00:03:43.590> as<00:03:43.769> well

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
regular Olympic bar for this as well

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.970 
regular Olympic bar for this as well
with<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.840> regular<00:03:46.110> limply<00:03:46.410> Olympic<00:03:46.830> bar

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
with the regular limply Olympic bar

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.670 
with the regular limply Olympic bar
you've<00:03:47.640> also<00:03:47.820> got<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.360> if<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.080> put<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.320> inside

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
you've also got the if you put it inside

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.270 
you've also got the if you put it inside
the<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.400> loading<00:03:50.760> sleeves<00:03:51.030> that'll<00:03:51.360> stop<00:03:51.630> the

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
the the loading sleeves that'll stop the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.440 
the the loading sleeves that'll stop the
slings<00:03:53.280> from<00:03:54.560> moving<00:03:55.560> out<00:03:56.269> towards<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.360> end

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
slings from moving out towards the end

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.690 
slings from moving out towards the end
of<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.570> bar<00:03:57.890> which<00:03:58.890> is<00:03:59.040> unlikely<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.580> happen

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
of the bar which is unlikely to happen

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.560 
of the bar which is unlikely to happen
because<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.600> weight<00:04:01.549> that<00:04:02.549> is<00:04:03.239> on<00:04:03.450> the

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
because that the weight that is on the

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.990 
because that the weight that is on the
lighting<00:04:03.870> pins<00:04:04.110> causes<00:04:04.920> those<00:04:05.100> those<00:04:05.760> knots

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
lighting pins causes those those knots

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.780 
lighting pins causes those those knots
to<00:04:06.180> jam<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:07.500> all<00:04:07.680> we've<00:04:07.830> got<00:04:08.010> here<00:04:08.310> is<00:04:08.400> I've

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
to jam so all we've got here is I've

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.960 
to jam so all we've got here is I've
just<00:04:08.820> thrown<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.180> couple<00:04:09.360> of<00:04:09.540> 25<00:04:10.230> kilo<00:04:10.970> bumpers

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
just thrown a couple of 25 kilo bumpers

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.660 
just thrown a couple of 25 kilo bumpers
on<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.390> I'm<00:04:12.750> using<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.380> couple<00:04:13.860> of<00:04:13.950> carabiners

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
on and I'm using a couple of carabiners

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.860 
on and I'm using a couple of carabiners
from<00:04:15.660> rock<00:04:15.810> climbing<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:17.000> attach<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.510> loading

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
from rock climbing to attach the loading

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.659 
from rock climbing to attach the loading
pin<00:04:19.079> pins<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.250> slings<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:22.400> here<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.460> is<00:04:23.520> in

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
pin pins to the slings and here it is in

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.990 
pin pins to the slings and here it is in
action

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.490 

so<00:04:28.000> it's<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.150> little<00:04:28.270> different<00:04:28.539> to<00:04:28.960> a<00:04:28.990> regular

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
so it's a little different to a regular

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.580 
so it's a little different to a regular
strongman<00:04:29.919> yoke<00:04:30.220> I<00:04:30.850> actually<00:04:31.840> found<00:04:32.289> when<00:04:32.500> I

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
strongman yoke I actually found when I

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.999 
strongman yoke I actually found when I
was<00:04:32.680> using<00:04:32.860> this<00:04:33.539> that<00:04:34.539> it's<00:04:34.870> very<00:04:35.710> very

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
was using this that it's very very

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.620 
was using this that it's very very
difficult<00:04:36.220> because<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.940> weights<00:04:37.180> can<00:04:37.449> move

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
difficult because the weights can move

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.010 
difficult because the weights can move
independently<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:39.430> can't<00:04:39.669> really<00:04:39.849> brace<00:04:40.240> the

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
independently you can't really brace the

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.249 
independently you can't really brace the
weights<00:04:41.259> with<00:04:41.560> your<00:04:41.770> arms<00:04:42.039> like<00:04:42.190> you<00:04:42.280> can<00:04:42.490> in<00:04:42.669> a

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
weights with your arms like you can in a

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.800 
weights with your arms like you can in a
normal<00:04:44.259> yoke<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:46.180> see<00:04:46.449> there<00:04:46.630> I've<00:04:46.780> just

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
normal yoke you see there I've just

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.710 
normal yoke you see there I've just
added<00:04:47.229> a<00:04:47.289> couple<00:04:47.319> of<00:04:48.060> barbell<00:04:49.060> collars<00:04:49.449> to<00:04:49.630> the

outside the pipe just stop the this
things<00:04:54.430> from<00:04:54.639> falling<00:04:54.970> off<00:04:57.150> this<00:04:58.150> time

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
things from falling off this time

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.650 
things from falling off this time
through<00:04:58.720> I've<00:04:58.840> loaded<00:04:59.830> it<00:05:00.039> up<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.430> that<00:05:00.660> 75

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
through I've loaded it up to that 75

through I've loaded it up to that 75
kilos<00:05:02.080> aside<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:05.590> you<00:05:05.830> can<00:05:06.009> see<00:05:06.220> there<00:05:06.430> the

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
kilos aside and you can see there the

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.870 
kilos aside and you can see there the
core<00:05:06.789> working<00:05:07.060> very<00:05:07.509> very<00:05:07.690> hard<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:12.370> so<00:05:12.759> this

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
core working very very hard and so this

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.850 
core working very very hard and so this
is<00:05:12.970> not<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.120> complete<00:05:13.509> substitute<00:05:13.810> for<00:05:14.530> the
