00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.519
 hello people drivers drivers 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:10.260
 Well, who signed up about the suprotec 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:14.700
 Now I will show 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.670
 maybe I will try to prove how 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:23.359
 I can show that my automatic box 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:27.599
 she basically does not want to be repaired 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.609
 because it is not yet sick but with 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.160
 the first to the second is weaker there 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.110
 hand over she has a jerk 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.380
 Well, that is, slippage can be so 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.780
 say when between the first 2 switches 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.969
 I will now put the camera on 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.550
 dashboard i think maybe this 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.550
 will be noticeable 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.550
 we'll see 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.309
 here we go 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.970
 here is a little such jerk 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.910
 chiefly gas 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.910
 how to smoothly switch 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.069
 here we are just now got a cork I 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.749
 I know that you do not 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.749
 I myself will be checking 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.960
 sub Zero 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.760
 Now let's see how it will be when I am 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.760
 move smoothly 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.790
 you want me 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.890
 but 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.890
 on sport mode set 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:27.500
 well let's see I'm slow in the yard 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.500
 touches stopped drove 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.530

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:41.400

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.400
 touch 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.650
 on so weak is almost not felt 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:04.820
 well, just a little push like that get 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:08.770
 imperceptible from first to second remaining 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.770
 all speeds work fine for me 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.760
