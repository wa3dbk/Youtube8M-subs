00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.330
 throw throw sharp corners on 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:10.160
 just this and it should be so 8 seconds 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:21.720
 apartments left 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:24.150
 such a pause is higher franken but at 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.600
 the full we are on 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.960
 how to skip the last minute 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.790
 and people who was equal at least 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.900
 at least let's calculate this 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.489
 optimism is equal to drive income tax 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.380
 some fate is this one to us 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.020
 Robin Hoods and throw here this top 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.470
 point to santini basketball 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.040
 five by three played for throwing the puck well 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.180
 now how do you get yourself in the same pit 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.860
 Vasilevsky see for nothing time to lose 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.450
 then the Swedes played out great rags 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.700
 plainly not in the game yet 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.270
 Lincoln good transfer to the port of ladies 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.270
 scores 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.760
 Come on, we lose not the first time meaner 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.760
 will be 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.070
 Volga looks 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.990
 so she went see this one appeared and 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:19.299
 again it is 10 times forgiven 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.299
 rescued basil 3 1 2 passed 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.660
 Lanova favor team Sweden but here 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.020
 blame yourself that again gave 10 house 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.180
 the norm says to smash hitler 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.170
 one on one and the most so for 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.090
 but 4 it 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.369
 and scattered most of it 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:44.170
 subtlety the second time he went out 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:47.450
 one-on-one this time did not throw 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.109
 decided to play our goalkeeper and throw 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.109
 missed 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.440
 and now it will be quite difficult 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.620
 I at least do not understand very much will play again on 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.840
 close up and our everything lies yours 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:12.930
 Canadians love not seem a twinkle figure 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:18.240
 glee and his brother loses 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:22.260
 the drums hands it says the gobies have 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.720
 there is one first went well where are you lucky 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.910
 this link jump out of the corner 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.770
 considered a trademark now from 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.500
 the corner popped not igruha puck too 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.540
 not bad special rival of this between 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.100
 honestly i'm not even a very good kaganate client 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.590
 took off for 1 throws and she is the goalkeeper one 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.550
 goalkeeper made a mistake look throw with a very 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.740
 acute angle through the goalkeeper even to 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.650
 jumped the puck through it from the stick 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:54.210
 look and here it falls into a corner 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.340
 let another couple so fall to 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.340
 we absolutely will not mind 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.630
 3 2 1 all Sweden in the final we play 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.890
 tomorrow match for third place I think 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.710
 there were no swedes 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.880
 than for the fact that the fight began evil 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.880
 because all 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.560
 the hosts will not keep 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.790
 and be 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.260
 well, like this 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.079
 in this section, thank the national team 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.079
