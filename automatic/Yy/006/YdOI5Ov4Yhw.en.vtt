00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.539 

that'd<00:02:23.280> be<00:02:23.310> too<00:02:23.670> usually<00:02:23.819> goes<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.720> spring

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549

because<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.950> flash<00:02:44.160> TX<00:02:45.110> we<00:02:46.110> she<00:02:46.379> uses<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> lot

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
because the flash TX we she uses a lot

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.390 
because the flash TX we she uses a lot
of<00:02:47.370> power<00:02:48.060> for<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.510> batteries<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.500> up<00:02:49.739> switch

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
of power for the batteries so up switch

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:01.610 
of power for the batteries so up switch
other<00:02:50.609> one<00:02:51.920> switch<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.099> on
