00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.270 
machine so I can just demonstrate that
this<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.149> what<00:02:09.300> happens<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.929> download

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
this is what happens you can download

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.230 
this is what happens you can download
the<00:02:11.280> software<00:02:11.790> package

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
the software package

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.900 
the software package
and<00:02:13.960> then<00:02:14.110> once<00:02:14.290> we<00:02:14.440> try<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.650> run<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.700> then

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
and then once we try to run it and then

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.270 
and then once we try to run it and then
watch<00:02:16.180> any<00:02:16.390> TV<00:02:16.680> we're<00:02:17.680> gonna<00:02:17.770> get<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.070> bad

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
watch any TV we're gonna get the bad

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.370 
watch any TV we're gonna get the bad
news<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.850> we<00:02:18.970> can't<00:02:19.210> because<00:02:20.080> we're<00:02:20.260> not

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
news that we can't because we're not

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.410

inside<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.830> country<00:02:21.160> but<00:02:21.670> that's<00:02:22.060> all<00:02:22.300> going

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
inside the country but that's all going

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.950 
inside the country but that's all going
to<00:02:22.480> change<00:02:22.570> what's<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.260> VPN<00:02:23.590> starts<00:02:24.010> running
