00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.109
 how are you guys how are we with 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.160
 a laptop or laptop because a lot of people 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.799
 is having problems 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.760
 for example for many reasons 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:17.050
 example spills liquid on the keyboard 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.420
 it turns out that it says good look at the 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.630
 machine already turned on works perfect 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.849
 but some keys it turns out that 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.880
 They were damaged by the way in 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.570
 liquid problem because of the problem of 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:35.019
 that you spilled liquid you're going to have to 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.230
 buy another keyboard and good if you give 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.489
 account the equipment is working well 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.579
 but some keys are not going to 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.730
 work to solve this problem 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.899
 you would have to buy a new keyboard 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.289
 all the data 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.809
 - You can change the keyboard 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.730
 it disarmed up the keyboard is pulled out 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.510
 a pin there 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:02.470
 and we can buy another keyboard in case 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.989
 has damaged those keys on that keyboard by 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.450
 any reason for liquid because 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.330
 some keys do not work because 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.930
 the spacebar works the bosses 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:17.930
 the fabric l does not work anymore, not the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.330
 keyboard solution x 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.220
 usb 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:27.710
 see how easy a keyboard or well 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.049
 of large or 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.659
 I think I've seen more keyboards 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.670
 little ones that these more or less 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.930
 similar to laptop 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.619
 little one we put it here we are going to 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.619
 do the planned 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.640
 we would go here 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.790
 and we are going to plug it in by the usb 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.320
 sb ok 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.320
 we plugged it in by the usb 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.530
 just turned on you see it here that 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.530
 just turned on 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.810
 It is not 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.550
 we are giving the wings 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:19.380
 the uppercase lock keys 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.380
 and they perfectly work 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.860
 up there we are good alright look for 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.860
 example 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.900
 that the keyboard is that it does not work 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.880
 Here reason see here we are seeing that 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.690
 we can write 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.850
 it is but you are not seeing it because 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.000
 the camera is around here but I do not 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.320
 I confirm yes but for example look 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.700
 look come come see the keys like me 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.890
 I move look see the trash 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.310
 yes they are seeing it not the trash 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.069
 the people and it opens you saw it we give it 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.420
 for example 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.420
 and we close what is 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.000
 we can write see how easy 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.130
 well you are not doing it but good 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.930
 the mandatory not once 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:20.730
 for example 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:24.349
 the tabulator for example we can go 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:28.049
 moving inside our laptop 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:31.349
 no need for this keyboard and 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.680
 together with this for usb is a 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:38.340
 good idea and we're not going either 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.220
 shell out very little money and the truth 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.940
 that looks for very little money we are going to 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:49.379
 have we will be able to handle our 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.989
 laptop or our laptop or our PC 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.780
 Laptop or our laptop without problem 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.810
 by means of 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.730
 the additional keyboard by usb look at me the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.520
 I've also seen like that, tiny by usb 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.520
 we would put it here and we would work 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:10.590
 perfectly with our with our 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:14.780
 laptop no or I can tell you 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.780
 which is the web a good idea 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.699
 you see that it perfectly opens 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.870
 perfectly here we see the light and it is 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.210
 and is picking up the stream of 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.360
 laptop watches how the light goes out 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.169
 when we take out the chimera 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.169
 again for you to see 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.320
 you see it went on and you're done there 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.320
 we would have 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:56.910
 perfect that's not good guys I hope 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.560
 that this video will be of help to many 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.300
 who ask me hey how does the 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.300
 problem that the keys in the 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.740
 laptop do not work me it got damaged because 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.360
 I spilled liquid 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.729
 He told me in the workshop that I'm going to 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.630
 buy another keyboard as solves this 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:17.020
 problem then look with a keyboard for 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:20.349
 usb and ready the chicken there is nothing more than 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.940
 scratch problem solved man more 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.530
 little one can be a keyboard like that 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.110
 we put it here and 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.060
 we perfectly connect them by usb 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.280
 our laptop and it's perfectly going to 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.430
 work or is there no more laps that 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:38.630
 give no more leaves to cut as the 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:41.360
 said no and I think good look come 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.770
 once we move through the inside 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:48.340
 our machine 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:51.419
 we perfectly close and there we are 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.419
 and we could write 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:00.080
 back we move by means of seeing 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.080
 once 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:04.490
 inside our hard drive 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.720
 we would avoid the bin easily and 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.560
 ready 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.060
 as I said 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:20.210
 an additional keyboard for usb and subject of 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.120
