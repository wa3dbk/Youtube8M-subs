00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
that this arm goes up and down as you

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.230 
that this arm goes up and down as you
can<00:01:54.090> see<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:55.500> also<00:01:55.829> swivels<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.729> right<00:01:56.969> and

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240

metal bar right here that's covered by a
plastic<00:02:14.590> coil<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:16.030> looks<00:02:16.239> like<00:02:16.390> it's<00:02:16.569> very

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
plastic coil it looks like it's very

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.780 
plastic coil it looks like it's very
durable<00:02:17.079> and<00:02:17.409> really<00:02:17.680> good<00:02:17.829> quality<00:02:18.069> I've

gone<00:02:19.000> ahead<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.390> clamped<00:02:20.049> this<00:02:20.230> onto<00:02:20.709> my<00:02:20.890> desk

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:21.219 
gone ahead and clamped this onto my desk

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.959 
gone ahead and clamped this onto my desk
and<00:02:21.579> it<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:21.879> has<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.269> little<00:02:23.969> unscrewing

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
and it just has this little unscrewing

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.569 
and it just has this little unscrewing
kind<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.840> thing<00:02:26.530> here<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.040> climbs<00:02:27.400> right

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
kind of thing here and it climbs right

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.880 
kind of thing here and it climbs right
onto<00:02:28.090> your<00:02:28.209> desk<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:28.930> once<00:02:29.230> it's<00:02:29.470> in<00:02:29.620> here

this<00:02:33.189> part<00:02:33.549> here<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:33.790> believe<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.209> think<00:02:34.269> it's

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
this part here I believe I think it's

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.080 
this part here I believe I think it's
made<00:02:35.470> out<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.650> some<00:02:35.950> kind<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.250> plastic<00:02:36.760> but

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
made out of some kind of plastic but

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.420 
made out of some kind of plastic but
this<00:02:37.269> part<00:02:37.569> here<00:02:37.780> looks<00:02:38.500> like<00:02:38.590> it's<00:02:39.010> made<00:02:39.280> out

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
this part here looks like it's made out

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.129 
this part here looks like it's made out
of<00:02:39.459> metal<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.389> know<00:02:40.510> this<00:02:40.689> is<00:02:40.840> going<00:02:41.049> to

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
of metal so you know this is going to

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.770 
of metal so you know this is going to
hold<00:02:41.319> and<00:02:41.560> it's<00:02:41.939> detachable<00:02:42.939> you<00:02:43.180> can<00:02:43.359> take<00:02:43.659> it

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
hold and it's detachable you can take it

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.869 
hold and it's detachable you can take it
apart<00:02:44.079> and<00:02:44.260> take<00:02:44.680> this<00:02:44.859> anywhere<00:02:45.310> with<00:02:45.609> you

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
practice hand I have tried plastic

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.830 
practice hand I have tried plastic
practice<00:03:00.340> hands<00:03:00.609> like<00:03:00.790> this<00:03:00.939> in<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.299> past<00:03:01.569> and

practice hands like this in the past and

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.860 
practice hands like this in the past and
the<00:03:02.019> fingers<00:03:02.439> were<00:03:02.889> so<00:03:03.310> stiff<00:03:03.760> you<00:03:04.480> could<00:03:04.689> not

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
the fingers were so stiff you could not

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.720 
the fingers were so stiff you could not
really<00:03:05.169> move<00:03:05.349> them<00:03:05.560> apart<00:03:05.680> at<00:03:06.129> all<00:03:06.280> well<00:03:06.579> this

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730

one<00:03:06.939> is<00:03:07.060> really<00:03:07.269> neat<00:03:07.510> because<00:03:07.689> the<00:03:07.959> fingers

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
one is really neat because the fingers

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.809 
one is really neat because the fingers
move<00:03:09.310> in<00:03:09.700> any<00:03:10.629> direction<00:03:11.189> it's<00:03:12.189> not<00:03:12.400> quite

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
move in any direction it's not quite

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.219 
move in any direction it's not quite
like<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.209> one<00:03:13.389> that<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.659> would<00:03:13.780> see<00:03:13.959> on<00:03:13.989> the

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:14.229 
like the one that you would see on the

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:18.509 
like the one that you would see on the
trainer<00:03:14.530> hand<00:03:14.829> which<00:03:15.040> has<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:16.409> joints<00:03:17.519> but

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
trainer hand which has the joints but

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.569 
trainer hand which has the joints but
it's<00:03:18.970> good<00:03:19.419> enough<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.260> bends<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.159> moves

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
it's good enough and it bends and moves

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.789 
it's good enough and it bends and moves
in<00:03:21.909> any<00:03:22.209> direction<00:03:22.629> that<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:23.049> want<00:03:23.229> it<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.620> so

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
of the way and bend it up and down like

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.939 
of the way and bend it up and down like
this<00:03:29.949> if<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.459> need<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.970> turn<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.449> hand<00:03:31.949> upside

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:32.949 
this if you need to turn the hand upside

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.089 
this if you need to turn the hand upside
down<00:03:33.220> all<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.639> have<00:03:33.819> to<00:03:34.030> do<00:03:34.180> is<00:03:34.389> just<00:03:34.659> simply

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
down all you have to do is just simply

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.569 
down all you have to do is just simply
turn<00:03:36.540> sort<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.629> just<00:03:37.840> one<00:03:38.019> screw<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:39.310> back<00:03:39.549> a

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
turn sort of just one screw the back a

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.149 
turn sort of just one screw the back a
little<00:03:39.909> bit<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.329> voila<00:03:41.169> you've<00:03:41.560> got<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.949> back

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
little bit and voila you've got the back

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.149 
little bit and voila you've got the back
side<00:03:42.819> of<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:43.209> hands<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.859> can<00:03:45.010> basically

side of the hands and you can basically

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:51.210 
side of the hands and you can basically
use<00:03:46.139> nail<00:03:47.139> tips<00:03:47.500> for<00:03:48.459> this<00:03:48.609> you<00:03:48.879> can<00:03:50.190> use<00:03:51.190> a

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
use nail tips for this you can use a

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.890 
use nail tips for this you can use a
little<00:03:51.549> plastic<00:03:51.819> nail<00:03:52.209> tip<00:03:52.449> and<00:03:52.629> apply<00:03:52.689> a
