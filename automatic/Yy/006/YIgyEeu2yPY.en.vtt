 so about batista70phone today I present to you 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.550
 the new glass films are 2 mm e 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:23.570
 half are in tempered glass and are 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.970
 fall and anti let's say fingerprints when 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.990
 you put them on the phone do not remain 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.300
 the fingerprints and does not send the 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.489
 phone we have for many models 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.559
 then find yourself in our shop you will see 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:41.360
 the complete list however we all say 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.340
 samsung all iphone g2 and others 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.430
 still models that you will see we have 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.230
 personally tested unfortunately there are 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.960
 a pair of iphone flew to the floor 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.590
 the film shattered the glass 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.480
 below it remained completely intact 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.739
 I have to say that I'm really great 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.439
 security now we'll show you how 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:08.170
 how to put them and the result 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.210
 ok to drop the work but then us 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.530
 we have the antistatic stick that goes 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.720
 well in this case you do n't need that 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.310
 he risks but without clean 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.950
 we speak the classic cake for 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.470
 remove the dust and then we have some 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.899
 adhesives to remove any residues 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.970
 are there are still dust of 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:37.780
 grains of anything else to move 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:40.600
 we start from a wipe very distal 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.360
 clean where the other poor is 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:56.170
 mix the poor robbery 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:02:01.170
 now let 's go the sticker the lens not 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.170
 injurious and with this to pass very slowly 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:16.780
 spray official so as to remove 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:19.410
 any residues have escaped away 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.410
 on the shields 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.880
 you didn't pass a story it seems 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:31.300
 collicola air and its own auction operation 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.970
 a room dedicated above all on 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:39.850
 white walter white we fail to 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:42.870
 see the edges of the film of the 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.870
 display and undress 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:04.360
 don't worry because it's not connected 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:08.890
 of roma shopper if by chance we are wrong 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.890
 we can limits the possible 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.150
 a gesture from the mine next to me 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.340
 in this case 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.360
 then there is this nation almost 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.160
 finished as I said before 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.510
 rest assured because it is not the usual 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.700
 in inverted commas one shot in the sense also 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.170
 if that is better if we can put to the 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.700
 first stroke though even if not there 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.100
 we succeed that we must remove to 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.990
 remit sometimes I am not there 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:04.160
 we have now polished problems 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.720
 obviously installed some small ones 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.610
 play a few millimeters per 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.190
 allow to put the covers for the house 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.860
 putting at pover overlaps was 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.560
 alzano instead is deliberately left 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.200
 a minimum of play on the surface of the 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.270
 display to allow precisely 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.110
 to the installation of covers as not 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.800
 then comes we will see 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:28.880
 here is what the result is 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.900
 should be finished we have nothing but 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.170
 perfect that the publisher if not ana ok 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.680
 let's take it you'll see how it goes 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.630
 ok let's see then with the cover one 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.170
 display brightness remains unchanged 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.230
 to the touch it is very little helped 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:51.590
 slips who you like to use it for that 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:59.150
 it slips really well now we estrange 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:05:03.320
 a photo here 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:06.700
 you see that it adheres well and does not affect 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.700
 on the display surface 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.850
 so only ended up it always seemed 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.820
 things more curious so indeed later 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:20.790
 the effect there and then above all part 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.590
 what luminous effect velvety effect 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.220
 involuntarily if in the ill-omened 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.710
 hypothesis falls on the face shatters 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.070
 all the film because I 'll put it on 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.970
 5 mm separated but the display remains 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.340
 intact 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.140
 what is perfect if you need it 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:42.390
 I find it we have for various models 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:46.530
 we have included most of it in his 5 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:50.760
 of the top range samsung apple oppo fans 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:53.430
 77 and we will see to expand the catalog neither 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.900
 of possible on what dogs can 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.940
 have thanks to lucio for the application 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.940
