00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello everyone with you again circle tv with you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.839
 with the company mail.ru present an overview 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.719
 on a new premium tank of the eighth level 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.059
 left this string was recently introduced into the game 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.190
 and its cost is 12,000 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.049
 half gold coins well and let's obo 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.590
 all in order , then we have him good 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.660
 well, first of all it is our weapon 105 and 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.730
 millimeter which has a decent 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.340
 alpha and good break through break through 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.619
 armor-piercing projectile is 235 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.240
 millimeters and for the eighth level these 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.250
 the performance is amazing 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.410
 break through the eight break through 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.969
 sevens and sixes of course 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.829
 Nines even make their way if 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.960
 you can try to punch in the head and 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.309
 a dozen but if you suddenly for some 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.660
 the enemy will not be missed 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.789
 breaking through at two hundred thirty five 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.160
 millimeters average you can charge 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.760
 golden shells that pierce as many as 300 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.010
 millimeters 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.379
 they can burn the ground through 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.199
 there is a tank and so we move on 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.719
 alpha strike 533 units I think 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.750
 good performance although I would like to 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.280
 higher but this gun is very accurate and in 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.920
 unlike the gun to erase in which 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.729
 alpha strike like a little bit higher she 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.070
 here it is very accurate with such precision 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.280
 you can target tanks for long distances 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.759
 distances and now it will be 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.479
 evidence like that I aim at vk 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.490
 3601 speech at a distance of 360 meters and at 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.710
 quite a scatter circle allows 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.869
 hit him exactly in the tower and finish off the enemy 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.869
 Well, minus the barrel in the game is always 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.329
 ok so go on to armor 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.189
 probably everyone thinks it's a heavy tank 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.320
 so he should have good armor 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.170
 Yes, and he goes like not very fast but 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.240
 alas , we only have armor in a mask 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.399
 towers and upper armor hull 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.040
 bottom armorlinist almost asks 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.710
 on departure well and the side armor of the tower and her 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.759
 all who feel like it too 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.670
 they are sewed 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.170
 with a break even from 150 millimeters as 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.299
 to me 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.070
 it seems and therefore substituted on this 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.110
 tank, certainly not worth it pretty 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.450
 big in size and get him not 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.229
 is labor but the cardboard tank itself 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.989
 we go further 3000 hit points we have but 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.360
 as if so look from the other side 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.980
 royal tiger 2 800 and that means 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.610
 that we have a very good indicator and 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.250
 hit points 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.200
 and in fact it is so let us not 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.630
 we can take a punch but we can take 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.420
 damage for allies because we have types 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.060
 very much though to abuse it 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.720
 you shouldn't exchange hip too and you always 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.120
 have time for this tank rather fri-sau but no 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.760
 tyazh it is a tank of the second line can be 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.590
 even 3 that can do damage but 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.290
 in melee clashes he is little 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.810
 effective also it is ineffective one 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.090
 on one mean its not the highest 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.739
 rate of fire for such damage then 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.739
 there is no damage per minute 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.230
 tall in simple words and so we go 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.690
 below what we see there is no armor and 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.090
 there is no speed as it turns out the tank is not 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.420
 very good rides 30 km per hour 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.390
 maximum speed Well, we can say that he 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.049
 very sluggish these 30 kilometers per hour 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.450
 gaining that is no armor no speed 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.370
 but there are great tools and you can 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.640
 Still, with confidence to say that this 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.769
 no longer heavy up the south tower in 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.900
 principle is very good but if you consider 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.480
 the fact that this tank is premium eighth 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.730
 level he must farm someone like 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.400
 wrote I think this tank will have to 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.049
 again if you need to earn credits and 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.239
 farms this tank principle pretty 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.660
 not bad by now i'm a little bit 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.239
 shoot and struck 3100 that no damage 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.140
 there is a strong performance for 8 not but it 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.420
 quite good 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.510
 time I angel my types of means was this 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.760
 combat useful think you agree with me 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.010
 well we are going we gave only two left 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.829
 the enemy and you can probably sum up 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.319
 the tank to the lion car is not the fastest 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.150
 and unarmored but has just 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.359
 stunning and a weapon that pierces 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.549
 all goals and generally ground through and have 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.920
 good damage from long distances with her 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.650
 very easy to hit and so this tank 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.930
 still not heavy but rather 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.879
 Fri-Sau I think this tank 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.010
 deserves its eighth level and its 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.829
 price of 12 and a half thousand gold coins 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.349
 repeat for all those who have not heard 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.440
 or just who wanted to know 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.539
 surely I did a little wrong 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.850
 12 line and thousands of its price and I think that 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.740
 for such a price the tank is very good 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.289
 at the eighth level he has the largest 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.300
 strength as I understand it and has 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.030
 great guns and what else do you need 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.199
 for a tank that is not very fast but 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.620
 can cause damage 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:37.720
 I think the tank is great so we look at 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.750
 pharma coefficients and I say goodbye to you 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.680
 you had a trick with you mail.ru 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.680
 bye everyone
