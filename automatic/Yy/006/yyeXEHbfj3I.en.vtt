00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.920
 Hello everyone and comment and good 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.570
 as I told you in the previous part 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.660
 well now we're round 53 going to 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.170
 start now the previous round I did what 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.300
 of the theme of the excavator 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.130
 come on I did not have titan and I had to go to 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.260
 the earth for all things and that 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.039
 well here we continue again in the round 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.259
 53 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.369
 I have left it without bullets I stay 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.929
 without ammunition 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.820
 and what I've done to leave a thriller and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.500
 I had to go to the box and throw it away 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.899
 and pull until other commanded the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.800
 Vouchers weapons only good these 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.290
 because aberration is not 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.300
 so as not to waste time more than nothing, no 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.130
 he has caught me okay so I have these 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.950
 only and good and I will continue to see 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.740
 where it lasts round 53 we go to 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.550
 start 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.550
 I hope you like it 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.240
 because I already here a few hours 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.840
 I'm going to do a little bit for you to see 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.729
 and then I'll cut 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.400
 and see if I follow later later 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.910
 again if I keep recording 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.020
 well then while regrouping the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.659
 zombies commented a little 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.570
 for white 2 we will take everything 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.280
 We also like the fact 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.679
 Single player strategy for 2 to 3 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.270
 for 4 that now I'm going to get out of 34 well 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.270
 get out of here from the black ops 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.550
 and good and also get on target 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.330
 we will also do 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.180
 I'll get out of things topics for example 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.980
 of the music of the maps 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.560
 of achievements that have also what 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.230
 I will try to do also to 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.940
 talk to everyone is good and can be good 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.390
 a little bit like to summarize what 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.460
 we go 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.950
 I say let's do because I will do it and 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.320
 I will also do it with another one between the coi and 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.280
 other colleagues who leave 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.280
 go putting 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.590
 killing here 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.710
 You have seen what happened before I 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.080
 shot and fired and I have not killed them 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.080
 you have to be very careful because there 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.790
 Sometimes that happens and as you get caught almost 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.790
 in a corner they can kill you fast 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.290
 well that's what he had said before 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.210
 I did not have ammunition and then I had 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.510
 I've left a trailer that's why it's always 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.550
 You'd better be left inside advisable to 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.850
 can pull the box and pick up again 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.030
 everything again we go then I have gone to the 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.920
 land 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.660
 I have gone to earth I have taken the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.520
 quick recharge I needed to sleep 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.220
 and then I have it ready for 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.920
 when I go to the next time 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.030
 If I need to catch they take me away if I 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.710
 cogiera si catch me on the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.710
 astronaut that I do not believe but 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.340
 here you can go through everything 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.640
 so I do not have the hole left either 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.950
 black then it would be nothing more than 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.490
 do then with this weapon continuously 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.170
 OK 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.340
 it's the only way I have left of 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.319
 keep going rounds and rounds and rondÃ³n 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.020
 and leave a call at the end and then 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.200
 leave the pulled 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.390
 the trolley 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.310
 and to the box again to pull again and 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.310
 pull until it comes out again 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.830
 a little bit of that 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.110
 so keep watching 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.140
 for unbelievers is that for those who 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.260
 they say nothing because they eat you they take out nothing 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.070
 more than short rounds do not strategy 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.070
 in long rounds 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.710
 only pulls out for the round 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:10.700
 the short here you have here you have 253 that 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.239
 I'm still like a lion 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.530
 and good to see what lasted good people 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.900
 I hope you liked it like I did 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.010
 is liking to me and good is that 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.680
 keep watching videos 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.240
 to see if more people are still suffering 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:31.260
 because I know you're liking good come 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.260
 I hope you liked it and see you later
