00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.830
 hello dear friends glad 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.959
 welcome you to our channel 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:20.480
 in today's video I would like to 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:22.550
 talk to a satellite company or 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.680
 satellite company 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.070
 trichologist services 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.640
 does this mean the time company tricolor 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.630
 announced that packages optima 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.270
 basic package in general they close 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.820
 they will no longer exist and 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.039
 some people started mean in 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.719
 Particularly, I really began to disappear 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.140
 free channels were not connected 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.019
 basic package on my receivers at the cottage 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.969
 and one day I discovered that 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:57.550
 I started to disappear channels you gtrk 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:02.780
 such as Russia 24 and Russia 2 Russia 1 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:05.870
 that means I thought maybe I don’t 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.140
 installed update updated receiver in 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.970
 Generally when any manipulations that 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.370
 I produced with them did not help I 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.790
 contacted the operator what did he tell me 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.950
 operator we know nothing in our 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.390
 the news channel you have there 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.820
 the very first night reported that the packages 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.010
 basic and optimum package will no longer be 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.780
 exist 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.550
 despite the fact that when we when i 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.950
 I bought this receiver right here 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.870
 promised almost for life these 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.240
 twelve or thirteen free 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.080
 channels there only drink and receiver and here 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.150
 in your life 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.500
 the channel here means camera operator 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.330
 we know nothing we are sure of you 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.120
 notified and unilaterally 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.590
 we stop action of these packages what 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.720
 happens next if you have 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.470
 the receiver is old like mine 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.050
 old receiver quite a long time ago 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.050
 means 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.240
 when paying for a package of one, I can not them 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.210
 to use fully why 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.170
 what it works only takes 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.520
 image format mpa-2 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.260
 most channels are incoming to me 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.650
 the majority can be 30 percent 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.440
 channel included in the package single broadcasts 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.050
 mp4 and hd 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.680
 here it is t2 broadcast fifty two channels 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.580
 which were included in the package optimum this we 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.060
 remember not all 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.940
 some of them are already in mp4 here and 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.730
 in fact it turns out that paying one thousand 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:41.820
 two hundred a year for a single package I get 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.120
 then defective not so let's say 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.920
 inferior 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.000
 no matter how fully I can view 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.330
 what I paid further means well and how 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.980
 why I decided to shoot this video I 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.800
 I understand perfectly that most 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.200
 Russians and so let's say not everyone can afford 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.340
 to allow the majority, not all, not all but 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.340
 most can not afford 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.410
 pay for this satellite tv 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.080
 there is money, let it not be so 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.280
 large 1200 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.260
 Well, as if, but many are not receivers 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.510
 hockey player stood with the base pack on 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.460
 somewhere else and pay there big 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.350
 sums for looking there five 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:27.230
 once a year makes no sense here and 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.410
 what is the way out i found for 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.260
 I bought myself an ordinary console 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.540
 digital television 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.610
 bye digital tv coverage now 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.970
 there is almost everywhere even my 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.970
 most distant points here bought to them 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.020
 you but as a special antenna all 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.630
 It cost me 1800 rubles and in general 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.790
 now I’m kinda sure that I don’t 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.130
 I have to pay 1200 I have the same 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.520
 the most there are even more I have 20 channels 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.240
 our region broadcasts 20 to new from the front 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:06.020
 in this story here these channels are you gtrk 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:09.010
 home yet some kind of children's channel here 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.900
 and in general I solved this problem 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.390
 digital tv receiver you can 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.800
 buy absolutely in any store 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.739
 audio video equipment 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.490
 Here's the way you do not need to take the most 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.590
 simple here it is but if you want with 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.650
 some kind of super mega features there i'm not 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.220
 I know you can take more expensive here but I 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.410
 tricolor decided so and I refused so I 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.160
 I do not call for this but I did 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.350
 because 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.360
 a company that does this here 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.820
 with our clients that is when we 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.230
 they bought the receiver there they are us manager 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.360
 then promised me that I will have 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.390
 life package this free 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.630
 10 channels for free which 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.760
 five of them catch on the usual antenna 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.860
 Essentials that you can simply put on 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.870
 the roof but I think that all the same we live 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.300
 21st century to expose whale antenna 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:05.340
 pull there a 20 meter but does not have 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:07.410
 sense here but means tricolor in principle 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.460
 Russian company works in 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.160
 Russian spirit 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.970
 any any russian company probably 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.640
 she has more goal to earn 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:21.330
 loan excess profits 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:25.680
 than somehow coexist there peacefully 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.630
 with the population of the russian federation i 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.460
 would like to thank you for watching 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.360
 forget to like and subscribe 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.360
