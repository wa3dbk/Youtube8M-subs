 quality minarelli that very fast 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.080

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.870

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.349
 very simple Verona 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.749
 let's remember that eyebrows must follow the believe basic limitations of 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:41.260
 sex 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.099
 that one cannot continue so simple by chance 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.990
 rather if you doubt the DVDs and the beautician 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.009
 I can still say these very simple emule then 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:55.619
 super helminths you should start here the biancone the valprint nose 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.299

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.649

 so i'm pretty fair 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:27.189
 then with regards to the angle the highest album of the eyebrow 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:28.969
 keep this in mind 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.229

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.709
