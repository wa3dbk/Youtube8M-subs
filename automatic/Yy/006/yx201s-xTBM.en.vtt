00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.890
 Jesus proposed a parable to demonstrate the occurrence of false 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.359
 Christians within a Christian community 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:11.599
 This parable is the parable of the wheat tares. 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:18.289
 in this parable the first one laid the good seed and is the word of God in the 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.820
 its correct form 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.980
 and then released in July if the altered word of God 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.320
 such a correct word is represented by Christian messengers 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.739
 I swore is represented by those who be sold at the price practiced in freedom 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.590
 both the player and the virus looks like 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.170
 except for one detail 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.400
 the game does not have the bulky wheat grain 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.550
 and in this the difference said 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.750
 live example to run 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.060
 when they grow together the wheat and the chaff are like 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.950
 so the difference is easily detected only when the wheat is 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.730
 ready for harvest 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.040
 the reapers observes that the possible wheat filled breaths rushed and 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.210
 consistent 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.680
 while July with the first markets and veterans 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.040
 and light cob easily brittle 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.120
 massari are very similar 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.530
 this parable spoken by Jesus she 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.380
 It is very significant that wheat has large and heavy seeds. 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.240
 seed the word of god 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.610
 but many consider that the word of God is the god of spirit of life 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.510
 but in reality the word of God is much more than mere graphic symbols 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.900
 placed in the book 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.270
 so the book quotes that in the beginning there is the word and the word was with 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.230
 God 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.770
 he was in the beginning with God 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.530
 jesus is the word of god 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.679
 To Your Ear Customer 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.679
 are the various characteristics of jesus 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.530
 joy to passess longsuffering kindness to goodness and faithfulness 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.990
 ah championship decision 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.259
 when your client has a firm substance 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.819
 characteristics it is part of a wheat ear 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.440
 but when buried once in a while 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.689
 is part of this event July 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.960
 conjur is similar to the live 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.839
 moreover the experience did not avenge 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:28.819
 we must understand that only the angels can describe who the jury was 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:29.699
 triple 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:34.339
 we can only visualize actions that are pertinent to July 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:37.059
 or fruits does not avenge 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.229
 for example imagine two individuals said Christians 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.899
 an excited talking to all 30 and says he likes them all 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:52.229
 would be on the next but we did not visit having to pass any food difficulties 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:53.529
 for the hungry 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:58.569
 the other lives happily and in certain people with difficulties and leads 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.479
 food for the hungry 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.380
 bearing the first or is a July 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.169
 or owns a seed not to avenge 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.729
 already the second one has a wheat seed with the
