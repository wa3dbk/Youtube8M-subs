the<00:01:14.130> market<00:01:14.490> sells<00:01:14.759> off<00:01:15.029> we<00:01:15.749> have<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.289> see<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
the market sells off we have to see a

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.429 
the market sells off we have to see a
technical<00:01:18.119> approach<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.869> look<00:01:19.229> at<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
technical approach and look at a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.859 
technical approach and look at a
technical<00:01:20.249> technical<00:01:20.819> approach<00:01:21.359> to<00:01:21.630> get<00:01:21.749> an

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
technical technical approach to get an

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.899 
technical technical approach to get an
idea<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.229> targets<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.099> where<00:01:23.279> that<00:01:23.459> market

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
idea of targets of where that market

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.029 
idea of targets of where that market
might<00:01:24.149> sell<00:01:24.450> off<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.929> so<00:01:25.499> what<00:01:25.889> are<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
might sell off to so what are you

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.429 
might sell off to so what are you
looking<00:01:26.219> at<00:01:26.520> now<00:01:26.880> next<00:01:27.539> for<00:01:27.719> the<00:01:27.749> next<00:01:28.079> level

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
looking at now next for the next level

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.370 
looking at now next for the next level
of<00:01:28.560> support<00:01:28.799> well<00:01:29.609> we<00:01:29.819> broke<00:01:30.119> 1580<00:01:30.929> so<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
of support well we broke 1580 so the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.019 
of support well we broke 1580 so the
next<00:01:31.740> level<00:01:32.069> is<00:01:32.249> going<00:01:32.399> to<00:01:32.669> be<00:01:33.409> 1534<00:01:34.789> 1534<00:01:35.789> was

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:36.029 
next level is going to be 1534 1534 was

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.389 
next level is going to be 1534 1534 was
the<00:01:36.240> low<00:01:36.419> that<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.749> hit<00:01:36.929> on<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.289> last<00:01:37.560> dip<00:01:37.979> if

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
the low that it hit on this last dip if

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.879 
the low that it hit on this last dip if
it<00:01:38.909> holds<00:01:39.119> support<00:01:39.659> there<00:01:39.990> then<00:01:40.499> we'll<00:01:40.740> go

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:40.889 
it holds support there then we'll go

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:43.789 
it holds support there then we'll go
into<00:01:40.919> an<00:01:41.249> extended<00:01:41.609> rally<00:01:41.999> if<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.450> cannot<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
into an extended rally if it cannot the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.849

bullish<00:01:49.349> argument<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.369> how<00:01:50.579> high<00:01:50.909> can<00:01:51.299> go<00:01:51.479> go

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:51.989 
bullish argument just how high can go go

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:55.309 
bullish argument just how high can go go
in<00:01:52.409> 2012<00:01:53.369> well<00:01:53.880> I'm<00:01:54.090> projecting<00:01:54.359> that<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.169> will

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
in 2012 well I'm projecting that it will

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.859 
in 2012 well I'm projecting that it will
make<00:01:55.499> a<00:01:55.709> new<00:01:56.249> record<00:01:56.729> high<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.419> our<00:01:57.630> old

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
make a new record high and our old

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.239 
make a new record high and our old
record<00:01:58.259> high<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.469> year<00:01:58.679> was<00:01:59.069> nineteen

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.249 
record high this year was nineteen

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:02.029 
record high this year was nineteen
twenty<00:01:59.880> I'm<00:02:00.059> looking<00:02:00.869> for<00:02:01.200> two<00:02:01.559> thousand

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
twenty I'm looking for two thousand

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.750 
twenty I'm looking for two thousand

next year and the next rally and then

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.580 
next year and the next rally and then
you<00:02:07.090> say<00:02:07.330> we're<00:02:07.600> going<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:07.810> see<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:07.960> correction

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
you say we're going to see a correction

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.520 
you say we're going to see a correction
that<00:02:09.010> is<00:02:09.220> correct<00:02:09.550> yes<00:02:09.850> why<00:02:10.240> is<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.540> well<00:02:11.350> the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
that is correct yes why is that well the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.050 
that is correct yes why is that well the
markets<00:02:11.920> don't<00:02:12.130> tend<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.430> move<00:02:12.550> straight<00:02:12.850> up

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
markets don't tend to move straight up

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.940 
markets don't tend to move straight up
or<00:02:13.240> straight<00:02:13.270> down<00:02:13.720> we<00:02:14.350> can<00:02:14.560> look<00:02:14.710> at<00:02:14.830> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
or straight down we can look at the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.160 
or straight down we can look at the
fundamentals<00:02:15.730> involved<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.270> right<00:02:16.480> now<00:02:16.690> one

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
fundamentals involved in right now one

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.230 
fundamentals involved in right now one
of<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.410> main<00:02:17.620> targets<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.520> strong<00:02:18.850> US

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
of the main targets is that strong US

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.900 
of the main targets is that strong US
dollar<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.170> fact<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:21.250> consumer

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
dollar and the fact that the consumer

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.760 
dollar and the fact that the consumer
confidence<00:02:22.210> is<00:02:22.630> gone<00:02:22.810> back<00:02:23.020> up<00:02:23.050> in<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.410> United

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
confidence is gone back up in the United

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.980 
confidence is gone back up in the United
States<00:02:23.800> but<00:02:24.790> irregardless<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.660> what<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
States but irregardless of what the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.380 
States but irregardless of what the
fundamentals<00:02:26.230> behind<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.310> there<00:02:27.730> seems<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.150> be

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
fundamentals behind it there seems to be

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.780 
fundamentals behind it there seems to be
a<00:02:28.420> pattern<00:02:28.960> or<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.440> natural<00:02:30.160> cycle<00:02:30.640> in<00:02:30.760> which

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
a pattern or a natural cycle in which

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.210 
a pattern or a natural cycle in which
gold<00:02:31.180> has<00:02:31.450> been<00:02:31.480> moving<00:02:32.050> if<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.740> chart<00:02:33.070> it

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
gold has been moving if you chart it

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.040 
gold has been moving if you chart it
over<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.640> last<00:02:33.880> eight<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.360> ten<00:02:34.600> years<00:02:34.840> so

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
over the last eight to ten years so

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.630 
over the last eight to ten years so
essentially<00:02:35.500> you're<00:02:35.830> using<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.370> combination

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
essentially you're using a combination

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.210 
essentially you're using a combination
of<00:02:37.090> fundamental<00:02:38.020> analysis<00:02:38.590> by<00:02:38.740> following<00:02:39.100> the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
of fundamental analysis by following the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.980 
of fundamental analysis by following the
trends<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.880> then<00:02:40.060> you're<00:02:40.240> charting<00:02:40.570> these

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
trends and then you're charting these

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.340 
trends and then you're charting these
moves<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:41.710> you're<00:02:41.860> just<00:02:41.980> analyzing<00:02:42.460> what

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
moves and so you're just analyzing what

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.480 
moves and so you're just analyzing what
exactly<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.380> look<00:02:44.590> at<00:02:44.680> myself<00:02:44.830> as<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.220> hybrid

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
exactly I look at myself as a hybrid

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.370 
exactly I look at myself as a hybrid
technician<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:46.480> then<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:46.960> look<00:02:47.170> at<00:02:47.290> the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
technician and then I look at the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.280 
technician and then I look at the
fundamentals<00:02:48.100> for<00:02:48.340> my<00:02:48.580> underlying<00:02:49.420> bias<00:02:49.900> and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
fundamentals for my underlying bias and

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.680 
fundamentals for my underlying bias and
my<00:02:50.740> underlying<00:02:51.130> by<00:02:51.400> us<00:02:51.580> right<00:02:51.790> now<00:02:51.820> in<00:02:52.150> gold<00:02:52.420> is

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
my underlying by us right now in gold is

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.470 
my underlying by us right now in gold is
bullish<00:02:53.110> but<00:02:53.980> in<00:02:54.460> terms<00:02:54.760> of<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.030> peaks<00:02:55.270> and

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
bullish but in terms of the peaks and

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.750 
bullish but in terms of the peaks and
valleys<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:56.080> ebbs<00:02:56.290> info<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:56.920> need<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.520> look<00:02:57.640> at

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
valleys the ebbs info I need to look at

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.270 
valleys the ebbs info I need to look at
my<00:02:57.910> charts<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:59.110> technical<00:02:59.740> aspect<00:03:00.130> to

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
my charts and the technical aspect to

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.190 
my charts and the technical aspect to
look<00:03:00.490> at<00:03:00.640> where<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.970> market<00:03:01.270> might<00:03:01.420> go<00:03:01.570> to<00:03:01.630> so

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
look at where the market might go to so

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.720 
look at where the market might go to so
you<00:03:02.260> do<00:03:02.500> think<00:03:02.740> two<00:03:03.040> thousand<00:03:03.340> dollars<00:03:03.610> an

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
you do think two thousand dollars an

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.580 
you do think two thousand dollars an
ounce<00:03:03.880> is<00:03:04.150> easily<00:03:04.630> achievable<00:03:04.959> in<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.380> first

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
ounce is easily achievable in the first

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.380 
ounce is easily achievable in the first
six<00:03:05.800> months<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.280> next<00:03:06.580> year<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:06.970> don't<00:03:07.270> know

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
six months of next year I don't know

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.910 
six months of next year I don't know
about<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.720> first<00:03:08.020> six<00:03:08.260> months<00:03:08.440> but<00:03:08.650> i<00:03:08.709> would

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
about the first six months but i would

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.320 
about the first six months but i would
say<00:03:09.130> bye<00:03:09.459> no<00:03:10.209> i<00:03:10.239> would<00:03:10.630> say<00:03:10.810> by<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:10.989> end<00:03:11.140> of

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
say bye no i would say by the end of

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.990 
say bye no i would say by the end of
2012<00:03:13.330> we<00:03:13.690> should<00:03:13.989> see<00:03:14.739> our<00:03:14.980> rally<00:03:15.459> peak<00:03:15.820> out

2012 we should see our rally peak out

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.270 
2012 we should see our rally peak out
because<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.930> rallies<00:03:17.320> we've<00:03:17.560> seen<00:03:17.860> over<00:03:17.890> the

because the rallies we've seen over the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.490 
because the rallies we've seen over the
last<00:03:18.459> three<00:03:18.880> years<00:03:18.940> have<00:03:19.360> peak<00:03:19.630> between<00:03:19.959> well

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
years how do you see silver a lot of

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.100 
years how do you see silver a lot of
people<00:03:27.130> call<00:03:27.550> it<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.820> poor<00:03:28.180> man's<00:03:28.390> gold<00:03:28.750> do

going<00:04:18.290> well<00:04:18.829> you<00:04:19.100> know<00:04:19.220> i<00:04:19.430> think<00:04:19.459> that<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.150> will

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
going well you know i think that it will

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.379 
going well you know i think that it will
probably<00:04:20.769> find<00:04:21.769> support<00:04:22.430> at<00:04:22.580> a<00:04:22.669> hundred<00:04:23.060> and

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
probably find support at a hundred and

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.260 
probably find support at a hundred and
begin<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:23.990> trade<00:04:24.410> off<00:04:24.560> of<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:25.270> fundamental

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
begin to trade off of that fundamental

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.120 
begin to trade off of that fundamental
