00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello friends today we are going to do the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.300
 notes corresponding to the scale of do 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.630
 greater and are the following first we go 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:18.100
 to see the theory observe the blackboard 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:21.130
 we have note 2 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.660
 you have to cover all the holes and 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.760
 blow slowly 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:31.080
 the note re 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:34.720
 we cover all except the last hole 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.530
 we blow slowly 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.960
 note me 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.800
 we cover all but the last two 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.050
 holes we blow slowly 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.390
 note 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.160
 we cover everything except the last three 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.180
 holes are left open 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.970
 we blow slowly 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.370
 the sun note 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.670
 the last four remain open 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.040
 holes 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.120
 we blow space not felling 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.030
 the last five are open 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:15.040
 holes 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.460
 we blow slowly 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.500
 it is not like that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.130
 Nothing known to us 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.350
 we leave open 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.530
 the last six holes 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.260
 has opened the last six holes and 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.610
 we blow space 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:43.040
 and the noticed that has a tilde is a 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.370
 symbol to differentiate it from this 2 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.370
 with a Latin 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.890
 the position is already known 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.520
 and we blow half strong 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.520
 very well 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:03.220
 let's go then now to do 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.870
 practice with our plant 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.870
 note 2 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.210
 re 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.650
 me 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.470
 fa 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.400
 Sun 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.180
 to 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.710
 yes 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.580
 or not 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.890
 repeating 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.720
 noticed 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.470
 yes 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.030
 me 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.600
 fa 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.060
 Sun 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.920
 the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.920
 yes and no 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.850
 continued 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.260
 the notes corresponding to the scale 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.260
 Middle finger 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.549
 notes corresponding to the scale of do 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.549
 higher 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.659
 are the following 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:32.380
 notes corresponding to the scale of do 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.380
 greater are the following 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.959
 in ascending form notes 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.959
 corresponding to the scale of C major 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.129
 we descend 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.080
 we go up and down 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.590
 once again 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.609
 ascend and descend notes 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.199
 corresponding 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.199
 at the finger scale 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.369
 notes corresponding to the scale of do 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.419
 higher 

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:41.419
 ascending and descending 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.380
 do not forget friends that you have to 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.120
 follow 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.560
 slowly learning the sound of each 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.560
 note 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.460
 reviewing the material well do not forget 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.400
 that note 2 should be blow slowly 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.330
 do not 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:20.530
 Slowly grab space 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:24.310
 one more time and we are already finishing with 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.800
 this part of recognizing and 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.110
 execute therefore the corresponding notes 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.780
 to the scale of C major and we are going to 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:37.600
 allow to make many melodies 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.600
 then with this we said goodbye 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:54.080
 notes corresponding to the scale of do 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:57.529
 going up and down to see if 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.589
 you can do several several 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:03.680
 exercises or this exercise can 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:04.960
 do several times go up and down many 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.080
 times 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:15.249
 at the beginning they can pronounce the name 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:17.200
 and then execute the note example 2 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:19.020
 king 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.720
 to me 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.350
 fa 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.040
 Sun 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.480
 the 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.080
 yes 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.080
 two 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:34.749
 then that is very important so that 

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:38.169
 memorize in the positions we finish 

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:41.429
 with the scale corresponding to 2 major 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.429
 ascending and descending 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.660
 thank you very much
