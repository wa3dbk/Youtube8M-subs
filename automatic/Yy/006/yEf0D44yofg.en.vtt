disappointment<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.590> Hulkenberg<00:00:47.039> which<00:00:47.250> I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
disappointment for Hulkenberg which I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.160

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
looked like he did also make a mistake

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.330 
looked like he did also make a mistake
previously<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:53.570> in<00:04:54.200> q2<00:04:54.740> but<00:04:54.950> there<00:04:55.100> were<00:04:55.310> a

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
previously and in q2 but there were a

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.520 
previously and in q2 but there were a
lot<00:04:55.580> of<00:04:55.610> mistakes<00:04:55.880> happening<00:04:56.600> and<00:04:56.870> Hulkenberg

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
lot of mistakes happening and Hulkenberg

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
as well and yeah it just seemed really

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.290 
as well and yeah it just seemed really
bizarre<00:05:00.650> to<00:05:01.070> see<00:05:01.250> so<00:05:01.880> many<00:05:02.030> mistakes

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
bizarre to see so many mistakes

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.040 
bizarre to see so many mistakes
happening<00:05:03.110> and<00:05:03.290> but<00:05:04.250> then<00:05:04.460> you<00:05:04.880> know<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:05.750> kind

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
happening and but then you know it kind

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.680 
happening and but then you know it kind
of<00:05:06.170> I<00:05:06.290> guess<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:07.120> kind<00:05:08.120> of<00:05:08.180> all<00:05:08.300> kind<00:05:08.510> of<00:05:08.570> came

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
of I guess and kind of all kind of came

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.440 
of I guess and kind of all kind of came
together<00:05:08.930> for<00:05:09.170> rare<00:05:09.710> Rosberg<00:05:10.580> in<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:10.970> end<00:05:11.120> so

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
together for rare Rosberg in the end so

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.230 
together for rare Rosberg in the end so
rosberg<00:05:11.980> starts<00:05:12.980> first<00:05:13.670> followed<00:05:14.210> by

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
rosberg starts first followed by

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.770 
rosberg starts first followed by
