00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.949 
are still working and you can replace
any<00:03:51.000> discs<00:03:55.400> so<00:03:56.400> it's<00:03:56.640> pretty<00:03:56.909> pretty<00:03:57.239> easy<00:03:57.599> I

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
any discs so it's pretty pretty easy I

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.140 
any discs so it's pretty pretty easy I
don't<00:03:58.440> know<00:03:58.590> why<00:03:59.099> people<00:03:59.129> have<00:03:59.610> so<00:04:00.000> much

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
don't know why people have so much

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.460 
don't know why people have so much
problems<00:04:00.750> with<00:04:01.079> installing<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:02.959> but<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:04.079> I've

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
problems with installing it but I I've

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.080 
problems with installing it but I I've
changed<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:06.500> description<00:04:07.500> because<00:04:08.090> they

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
changed the description because they

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:17.270 
changed the description because they
made<00:04:09.299> another<00:04:09.870> folder<00:04:10.379> for<00:04:10.620> placing<00:04:11.579> discs

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.760 

I<00:04:17.310> will<00:04:17.970> show<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.450> in<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.840> other<00:04:18.870> video<00:04:19.320> here

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.440 

again<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:23.100> don't<00:04:23.250> have<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.610> watch<00:04:23.820> this<00:04:24.150> if

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
again you don't have to watch this if

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.660 
again you don't have to watch this if
you're<00:04:24.630> already<00:04:24.960> installing<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:26.340> thing<00:04:26.520> I

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
you're already installing the thing I

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:35.920 
you're already installing the thing I
done<00:04:27.390> before<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:28.170> know

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.720 

it's<00:04:36.440> just<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.740> old<00:04:36.919> video<00:04:37.430> that<00:04:37.730> I<00:04:37.850> made<00:04:39.730> it's

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
it's just the old video that I made it's

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.570 
it's just the old video that I made it's
still<00:04:41.000> working<00:04:41.510> it's<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:42.110> same<00:04:42.350> thing<00:04:43.340> but

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
still working it's the same thing but

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.469 
still working it's the same thing but
the<00:04:44.510> difference<00:04:44.540> is<00:04:45.229> that<00:04:48.910> when<00:04:49.910> creating<00:04:50.180> a

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
the difference is that when creating a

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:59.579 
the difference is that when creating a
new<00:04:50.660> folder<00:04:51.669> right

00:04:59.579 --> 00:04:59.589 

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:02.099 

in<00:05:00.099> standup<00:05:00.519> instead<00:05:00.999> of<00:05:01.149> creating<00:05:01.959> a<00:05:02.079> new

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:02.109 
in standup instead of creating a new

00:05:02.109 --> 00:05:05.819 
in standup instead of creating a new
folder<00:05:03.009> called<00:05:03.719> we<00:05:04.719> coach<00:05:04.959> only<00:05:05.529> you<00:05:05.619> have<00:05:05.799> to

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:05.829 
folder called we coach only you have to

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:12.689 
folder called we coach only you have to
make<00:05:06.099> a<00:05:06.129> sound<00:05:06.579> folder<00:05:07.209> as<00:05:08.049> well<00:05:11.339> you<00:05:12.339> see<00:05:12.549> it's

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
make a sound folder as well you see it's

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.659 
make a sound folder as well you see it's
this<00:05:13.509> is<00:05:13.689> called<00:05:13.959> assets<00:05:14.559> minecraft<00:05:15.099> week<00:05:15.429> on

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
this is called assets minecraft week on

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.389 
this is called assets minecraft week on
