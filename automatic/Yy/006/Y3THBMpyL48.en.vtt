00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
to do that just because the piece is

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.080 
to do that just because the piece is
going<00:01:27.300> to<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.510> very<00:01:27.750> heavy<00:01:28.050> and<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:29.250> temporary

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
for the piece to fall off the handle

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.630 
for the piece to fall off the handle
hard<00:01:47.430> you're<00:01:47.610> working<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:49.430> it's<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.550> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
hard you're working on so it's going to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.580 
hard you're working on so it's going to
be<00:01:50.759> heavy<00:01:50.970> really<00:01:51.690> putting<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.050> lot<00:01:52.080> of<00:01:52.229> stress

be heavy really putting a lot of stress
on<00:01:52.830> it

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
on it

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.410 
on it
maybe<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:55.380> whole<00:01:56.130> seals<00:01:56.550> not<00:01:56.789> what<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.210> want

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
maybe the whole seals not what you want

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.190 
maybe the whole seals not what you want
and<00:01:57.660> it's<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> hot<00:01:59.039> seal<00:01:59.660> the<00:02:00.660> harp<00:02:00.899> seals

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and it's for a hot seal the harp seals

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.770 
and it's for a hot seal the harp seals
made<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:02.550> like<00:02:02.759> any<00:02:03.119> other<00:02:03.330> part<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.720> the

made just like any other part of the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.530 
made just like any other part of the
piece<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.890> we<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.340> half<00:02:05.700> those<00:02:05.940> both<00:02:06.660> sides

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
piece can we get half those both sides

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.540 
piece can we get half those both sides
heated<00:02:09.540> up<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:10.050> working<00:02:10.860> temperatures<00:02:11.370> when

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
heated up to working temperatures when

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.310 
heated up to working temperatures when
you<00:02:11.670> attach<00:02:11.970> them<00:02:12.210> so<00:02:12.420> that's<00:02:12.630> what<00:02:12.840> fuses

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
you attach them so that's what fuses

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.440 
you attach them so that's what fuses
together<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> glass<00:02:14.490> becomes<00:02:15.200> one<00:02:16.200> piece

tickle it up to one spot and then as it
cools<00:03:05.639> down<00:03:05.819> this<00:03:06.359> is<00:03:06.599> it<00:03:06.750> starting<00:03:07.109> to<00:03:07.139> change

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
cools down this is it starting to change

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.750 
cools down this is it starting to change
from<00:03:07.980> red<00:03:08.189> hot<00:03:09.889> when<00:03:10.889> I<00:03:10.980> press<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.489> into<00:03:11.609> the

from red hot when I press it into the

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.059 
from red hot when I press it into the
piece<00:03:13.010> rotated<00:03:14.010> keep<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.459> centered<00:03:15.349> and<00:03:16.349> let

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
piece rotated keep it centered and let

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.559 
piece rotated keep it centered and let
it<00:03:17.189> harden<00:03:18.739> okay<00:03:19.769> stiff<00:03:20.310> enough<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.879> that's

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
it harden okay stiff enough and that's

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.449 
it harden okay stiff enough and that's
the<00:03:21.780> cold<00:03:22.049> seal<00:03:22.409> now<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.799> can<00:03:22.980> come<00:03:23.129> over<00:03:23.189> to

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
the cold seal now I can come over to

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.940 
the cold seal now I can come over to
this<00:03:23.609> side<00:03:23.939> switch<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.049> around<00:03:25.139> during<00:03:25.709> this

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
piece but you tap on a penny rod gets

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.679 
piece but you tap on a penny rod gets
into<00:03:56.159> vibration<00:03:56.760> up<00:03:56.909> the<00:03:57.060> rod<00:03:57.269> through<00:03:57.599> the

into vibration up the rod through the
Cofield<00:03:58.319> and<00:03:58.500> breaks<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:58.889> loose

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.840 

and<00:04:10.870> while<00:04:11.140> you<00:04:11.380> can't<00:04:11.710> really<00:04:11.980> see<00:04:12.370> very<00:04:12.400> well

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
and while you can't really see very well

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.850 
and while you can't really see very well
on<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.090> camera<00:04:13.330> is<00:04:13.750> where<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.440> country<00:04:14.830> was

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
on the camera is where the country was

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.970 
on the camera is where the country was
attached<00:04:15.430> inside<00:04:15.760> there<00:04:16.330> Italy<00:04:17.290> is<00:04:17.440> a<00:04:17.470> small

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
attached inside there Italy is a small

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.080 
attached inside there Italy is a small
sharp<00:04:18.820> piece<00:04:19.360> of<00:04:19.570> glass<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.380> you<00:04:20.970> need<00:04:21.970> to

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
sharp piece of glass and you need to

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.900 
sharp piece of glass and you need to
come<00:04:22.300> back<00:04:22.480> and<00:04:22.540> fire<00:04:23.080> polish<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.680> down<00:04:24.600> okay

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
come back and fire polish that down okay

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.970 
come back and fire polish that down okay
and<00:04:27.910> that's<00:04:28.090> about<00:04:28.240> it<00:04:28.570> for<00:04:28.810> coal<00:04:29.110> see<00:04:29.410> now<00:04:29.740> I

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
and that's about it for coal see now I

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.510 
and that's about it for coal see now I
will<00:04:30.310> tell<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.610> also<00:04:31.350> if<00:04:32.350> you<00:04:32.500> decide<00:04:32.620> a<00:04:33.160> piece

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
will tell you also if you decide a piece

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.400 
will tell you also if you decide a piece
like<00:04:33.730> this<00:04:33.790> if<00:04:34.210> you<00:04:34.300> want<00:04:34.480> to<00:04:34.540> use<00:04:34.720> a<00:04:34.750> hot<00:04:35.050> seal

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
like this if you want to use a hot seal

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.620 
like this if you want to use a hot seal
then<00:04:36.190> go<00:04:36.430> ahead<00:04:36.670> and<00:04:36.790> heat<00:04:36.940> them<00:04:37.060> both<00:04:37.240> up<00:04:37.480> to

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
then go ahead and heat them both up to

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.400 
then go ahead and heat them both up to
red-hot<00:04:39.510> but<00:04:40.510> then<00:04:40.750> one<00:04:41.020> of<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.200> little

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
red-hot but then one of the little

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.380 
red-hot but then one of the little
sticks<00:04:41.680> that<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:41.980> do<00:04:42.040> when<00:04:42.490> I<00:04:42.520> enter<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:42.970> attach

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
sticks that I do when I enter I attach

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.260 
sticks that I do when I enter I attach
it<00:04:43.980> but<00:04:44.980> I<00:04:45.070> know<00:04:45.130> I'm<00:04:45.370> going<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.580> burn<00:04:45.790> that<00:04:46.000> off

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
it but I know I'm going to burn that off

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.920 
it but I know I'm going to burn that off
later<00:04:46.600> as<00:04:47.260> I<00:04:47.530> pull<00:04:47.890> it<00:04:48.040> down<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:48.730> a<00:04:48.930> smaller

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
later as I pull it down to a smaller

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
later as I pull it down to a smaller
diameter<00:04:50.230> inside<00:04:52.350> now<00:04:53.350> that<00:04:53.500> would<00:04:53.620> be<00:04:53.650> Road

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
diameter inside now that would be Road

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.100 
diameter inside now that would be Road
thickness<00:04:54.400> I<00:04:54.580> had<00:04:54.790> another<00:04:55.000> cut<00:04:55.330> off<00:04:55.480> in<00:04:55.870> there

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
thickness I had another cut off in there

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.670 
thickness I had another cut off in there
with<00:04:56.230> me<00:04:58.020> now<00:04:59.020> inside<00:04:59.560> there<00:04:59.920> I<00:05:01.320> think<00:05:02.320> you<00:05:02.470> can

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
with me now inside there I think you can

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.030 
with me now inside there I think you can
see<00:05:02.950> I<00:05:03.630> pulled<00:05:04.630> the<00:05:04.900> country<00:05:05.500> road<00:05:05.710> down

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
see I pulled the country road down

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.820 
see I pulled the country road down
through<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.640> diameter<00:05:07.210> down<00:05:07.420> that<00:05:07.660> inside<00:05:08.050> so

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
through the diameter down that inside so

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.320 
through the diameter down that inside so
when<00:05:08.980> I<00:05:09.070> get<00:05:09.250> around<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.670> one<00:05:09.820> they<00:05:09.970> cut<00:05:10.180> that

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
when I get around the one they cut that

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.820 
when I get around the one they cut that
off<00:05:10.510> in<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.780> flames<00:05:11.050> but<00:05:11.260> I'm<00:05:11.410> not<00:05:11.560> gonna<00:05:11.710> be

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
off in the flames but I'm not gonna be

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.170 
off in the flames but I'm not gonna be
able<00:05:11.890> to<00:05:12.010> break<00:05:12.190> it<00:05:12.340> off<00:05:12.460> not<00:05:12.700> happening

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
able to break it off not happening

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.370 
able to break it off not happening
that's<00:05:13.450> it<00:05:13.690> let's<00:05:14.560> say<00:05:15.450> hot<00:05:16.450> steel<00:05:16.840> one<00:05:17.140> piece

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
that's it let's say hot steel one piece

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.740 
that's it let's say hot steel one piece
of<00:05:17.560> glass<00:05:17.680> deal<00:05:18.220> but<00:05:19.060> when<00:05:19.210> I<00:05:19.240> get<00:05:19.330> ready<00:05:19.570> to

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
of glass deal but when I get ready to

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.120 
of glass deal but when I get ready to
remove<00:05:19.900> that<00:05:20.230> I'm<00:05:20.320> gonna<00:05:20.470> have<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.740> burn<00:05:20.920> it

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
remove that I'm gonna have to burn it

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.250 
remove that I'm gonna have to burn it
off<00:05:21.280> and<00:05:21.610> by<00:05:21.730> reducing<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.510> diameter<00:05:22.720> in

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
off and by reducing the diameter in

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.100 
off and by reducing the diameter in
there<00:05:23.470> I<00:05:24.810> think

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
there I think

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.710 
there I think
burn<00:05:26.650> that<00:05:26.830> off<00:05:26.890> a<00:05:27.070> lot<00:05:27.340> easier<00:05:30.420> anyway<00:05:31.420> I<00:05:31.450> hope

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
burn that off a lot easier anyway I hope

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.930 
burn that off a lot easier anyway I hope
