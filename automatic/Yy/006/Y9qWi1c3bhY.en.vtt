it's a hdmi so it's only 30 frames per

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.249 
it's a hdmi so it's only 30 frames per
second<00:01:29.310> maximum<00:01:29.550> left<00:01:29.880> 60<00:01:30.330> yeah<00:01:30.660> this<00:01:31.020> right

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
second maximum left 60 yeah this right

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.440 
second maximum left 60 yeah this right
moment<00:01:31.649> yes<00:01:31.830> so<00:01:32.190> after<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.640> 60<00:01:32.940> frames<00:01:33.390> per

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
moment yes so after you do 60 frames per

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.830 
moment yes so after you do 60 frames per
second<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:33.869> okay<00:01:34.430> yeah<00:01:35.430> maybe<00:01:35.700> maybe<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
second with okay yeah maybe maybe the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.280 
second with okay yeah maybe maybe the
requires<00:01:37.170> additional<00:01:37.670> standard<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
requires additional standard and

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.220 
requires additional standard and
we<00:01:39.860> can<00:01:40.040> input<00:01:40.460> any<00:01:40.670> additional<00:01:41.390> but<00:01:41.840> as<00:01:42.110> it

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
we can input any additional but as it

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.080 
we can input any additional but as it
since<00:01:42.440> this<00:01:42.560> is<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.740> prototype<00:01:43.040> within<00:01:44.000> the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
since this is a prototype within the

medieval<00:01:44.420> hdmi<00:01:45.140> 1.5<00:01:45.740> Orson<00:01:46.280> that's<00:01:46.490> correct

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
medieval hdmi 1.5 Orson that's correct

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.930 
medieval hdmi 1.5 Orson that's correct
maybe<00:01:47.450> still<00:01:48.020> just<00:01:48.230> using<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.680> 1.4<00:01:49.250> but<00:01:49.850> this

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
maybe still just using the 1.4 but this

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.700 
maybe still just using the 1.4 but this
is<00:01:50.090> 30<00:01:50.330> frame<00:01:50.570> per<00:01:50.600> second<00:01:50.990> lives<00:01:51.200> over<00:01:51.620> here

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
is 30 frame per second lives over here

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.280 
is 30 frame per second lives over here
that's<00:01:52.220> correct<00:01:52.460> right<00:01:52.760> so<00:01:53.750> how<00:01:53.900> soon<00:01:54.080> can<00:01:54.230> we

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
that's correct right so how soon can we

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.190 
that's correct right so how soon can we
hopefully<00:01:55.280> by<00:01:55.490> this<00:01:55.550> we<00:01:56.480> are<00:01:56.600> now<00:01:56.780> in<00:01:56.810> ternary

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
hopefully by this we are now in ternary

kind of have to think about that not
many<00:02:31.910> things<00:02:32.180> rather<00:02:32.780> than<00:02:32.930> not<00:02:33.530> just<00:02:33.770> only

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
many things rather than not just only

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.810 
many things rather than not just only
the<00:02:34.100> trip<00:02:34.790> but<00:02:35.000> also<00:02:35.150> what<00:02:35.630> else<00:02:35.810> ah<00:02:36.080> maybe<00:02:36.980> to

the trip but also what else ah maybe to

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.710 
the trip but also what else ah maybe to
create<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.660> best<00:02:38.989> performance<00:02:39.290> we<00:02:40.720> consider

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
create the best performance we consider

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.870 
create the best performance we consider
not<00:02:42.050> only<00:02:42.080> cheap<00:02:42.530> but<00:02:42.709> also<00:02:42.920> other<00:02:43.310> frame<00:02:43.700> like

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
not only cheap but also other frame like

not only cheap but also other frame like
a<00:02:43.910> lens<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:45.010> mechanical<00:02:46.010> things<00:02:46.280> as<00:02:46.519> well<00:02:46.760> so
