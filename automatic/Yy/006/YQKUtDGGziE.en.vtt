now it's really get a full benefit of
doing<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:58.950> pull<00:00:59.160> down<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.520> want<00:00:59.640> to

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
doing that up pull down you want to

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.580 
doing that up pull down you want to
focus<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.180> squeezing<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.020> center<00:01:01.380> of<00:01:01.470> your

focus on squeezing the center of your

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.800 
focus on squeezing the center of your
back<00:01:01.770> too<00:01:02.580> many<00:01:02.760> people<00:01:03.060> focus<00:01:03.450> on<00:01:03.540> just

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
back too many people focus on just

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.870 
back too many people focus on just
putting<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.980> their<00:01:05.160> arms<00:01:05.520> engaging

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
putting it down with their arms engaging

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060 
putting it down with their arms engaging

all of their biceps than their lat
and<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> key<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.910> is<00:01:09.210> keep<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> chip

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and the key to this is keep the chip

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.560 
and the key to this is keep the chip
directly<00:01:10.470> about<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.250> line<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.790> pull<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.390> that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
directly about that line up pull so that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.050 
directly about that line up pull so that
the<00:01:12.660> back<00:01:12.840> muscles<00:01:13.290> are<00:01:13.440> squeezing<00:01:14.160> as<00:01:14.490> you

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the back muscles are squeezing as you

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.520 
the back muscles are squeezing as you
bring<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.360> bar<00:01:15.600> down<00:01:15.870> now<00:01:16.260> the<00:01:16.320> bar

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
bring that bar down now the bar

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.800 
bring that bar down now the bar
shouldn't<00:01:16.920> touch<00:01:17.070> your<00:01:17.310> chest<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.600> as

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.750 

really<00:02:38.620> filling<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:38.980> one<00:02:39.130> it's<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.490> great

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
really filling that one it's a great

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.180 
really filling that one it's a great
exercise<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.690> do<00:02:40.960> and<00:02:41.200> also<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.620> variant<00:02:42.040> by

exercise to do and also a variant by
switching<00:02:42.640> left<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.390> right<00:02:43.570> I've<00:02:44.050> only<00:02:44.230> done

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
switching left to right I've only done

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.260 
switching left to right I've only done
an<00:02:44.620> example<00:02:45.130> here<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.310> make<00:02:45.610> sure<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.910> do<00:02:46.030> both

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
an example here so make sure you do both

bilaterally<00:02:51.420> one<00:02:52.420> side<00:02:52.690> at<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.960> time<00:02:53.050> you<00:02:53.410> can

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
bilaterally one side at a time you can

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.110 
bilaterally one side at a time you can
really<00:02:53.680> focus<00:02:53.860> on<00:02:54.220> gun<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.760> little<00:02:55.030> bit

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
really focus on gun that little bit

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.510 
really focus on gun that little bit
extra<00:02:55.270> range<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.410> motion<00:02:56.770> to<00:02:56.950> really<00:02:57.280> hit<00:02:57.460> that

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
extra range of motion to really hit that

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.400 
extra range of motion to really hit that
muscle<00:02:58.000> hard<00:02:58.210> and<00:02:58.450> increase<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.260> weight

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
muscle hard and increase the weight

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.710 
muscle hard and increase the weight
again<00:03:00.100> it's<00:03:00.250> only<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.490> small<00:03:00.670> step<00:03:01.060> up<00:03:01.300> that<00:03:01.600> you

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
again it's only a small step up that you

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
weight is going to be which is my body

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.750 
weight is going to be which is my body
weight<00:04:08.320> so<00:04:08.830> look<00:04:08.950> when<00:04:09.130> I<00:04:09.160> pull<00:04:09.520> my<00:04:09.610> body

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
weight so look when I pull my body

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.940 
weight so look when I pull my body
weight<00:04:10.000> up<00:04:10.240> it's<00:04:10.990> the<00:04:11.200> back<00:04:11.440> that's<00:04:11.770> really

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
weight up it's the back that's really

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.040 
weight up it's the back that's really
engaging<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.820> lifting<00:04:13.300> up<00:04:13.420> not<00:04:13.660> my<00:04:13.810> arms

engaging and lifting up not my arms

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:39.830 
engaging and lifting up not my arms
again<00:04:14.170> so<00:04:14.620> let's<00:04:14.860> get<00:04:14.980> to<00:04:15.160> it

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.450 

just<00:04:40.840> that's<00:04:41.020> simple<00:04:41.560> changing<00:04:42.190> up<00:04:42.310> the

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
just that's simple changing up the

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.029 
just that's simple changing up the
handgrip<00:04:42.940> from<00:04:43.210> an<00:04:43.419> overhand<00:04:44.380> wider<00:04:44.770> grip

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.540 
handgrip from an overhand wider grip
that<00:04:45.639> neutral<00:04:46.180> now<00:04:47.039> really<00:04:48.039> can<00:04:48.190> make<00:04:48.340> a<00:04:48.370> big

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
that neutral now really can make a big

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.550 
that neutral now really can make a big
difference<00:04:48.580> in<00:04:49.060> how<00:04:49.599> you<00:04:49.660> engaged<00:04:50.169> in<00:04:50.380> how<00:04:50.500> you

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
difference in how you engaged in how you

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.499 
difference in how you engaged in how you
work<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.979> back<00:04:51.160> you<00:04:51.340> really<00:04:51.460> do<00:04:51.639> feel<00:04:51.789> it<00:04:52.030> in

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
work the back you really do feel it in

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.540 
work the back you really do feel it in
the<00:04:52.630> inner<00:04:52.900> portion<00:04:53.110> here<00:04:53.889> which<00:04:54.099> will<00:04:54.400> help

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
the inner portion here which will help
