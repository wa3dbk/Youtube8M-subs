00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
but imagine if you only had the use of

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.730 
but imagine if you only had the use of
one<00:01:47.520> hand<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.180> what<00:01:48.840> happens<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> piece

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
one hand and what happens to the piece

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740 
one hand and what happens to the piece
of<00:01:49.920> bread<00:01:50.159> when<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.790> only<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> use<00:01:51.570> of

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
of bread when you only have the use of

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.510 
of bread when you only have the use of
one<00:01:51.899> hand<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.380> sliding<00:01:53.009> all<00:01:53.130> over<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.430> place

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
going to build a sandwich that I could

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.469 
going to build a sandwich that I could

use just one hand here and you can see

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.740 
use just one hand here and you can see
that<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.560> mayonnaise<00:02:02.090> spreads<00:02:03.090> without<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
bread sliding all over and this doesn't

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.900 
bread sliding all over and this doesn't
look<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.560> would<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.979> expensive<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.759> mean

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
look like it would be expensive I mean

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.400 
look like it would be expensive I mean
it<00:02:08.970> looks<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.509> would<00:02:09.569> probably

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
it looks like it would probably

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.230 
it looks like it would probably
a<00:02:11.090> $9.95<00:02:12.090> item<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:13.340> for<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.610> now<00:02:14.790> let's<00:02:15.090> say

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
to well let's just build our sandwich

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.600 
to well let's just build our sandwich
here<00:03:10.110> real<00:03:10.290> quickly<00:03:13.040> but<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.070> know<00:03:14.370> for

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
here real quickly but you know for

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.890 
here real quickly but you know for
example<00:03:14.700> look<00:03:15.209> at<00:03:15.270> that<00:03:15.420> if<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.630> wanted<00:03:15.840> to

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
definitely much more elaborate than say

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.130
