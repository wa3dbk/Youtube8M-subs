first<00:00:04.500> things<00:00:04.770> we<00:00:05.009> must<00:00:05.189> take<00:00:05.340> into

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:05.550 
first things we must take into

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.610 
first things we must take into
consideration<00:00:06.330> okay

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
consideration okay

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.709 
consideration okay
gathering<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.190> sandbags<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.969> the<00:00:09.240> sand<00:00:09.480> how

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
gathering the sandbags and the sand how

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.170 
gathering the sandbags and the sand how
we<00:00:09.780> actually<00:00:10.049> filled<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.680> sandbag<00:00:11.129> two<00:00:12.090> of

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.180 
we actually filled the sandbag two of

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.029 
we actually filled the sandbag two of
the<00:00:12.240> most<00:00:12.420> common<00:00:12.719> mistakes<00:00:13.110> when<00:00:13.619> filling<00:00:13.980> a

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:14.039 
the most common mistakes when filling a

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.640 
the most common mistakes when filling a
sandbag<00:00:14.459> is<00:00:14.670> one<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.240> overfill<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.750> only<00:00:16.500> fill

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
sandbag is one you overfill it only fill

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.370 
sandbag is one you overfill it only fill
the<00:00:16.740> sandbag<00:00:17.190> half-full<00:00:18.000> okay<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.050> when<00:00:19.289> we

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
the sandbag half-full okay so when we

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.950 
the sandbag half-full okay so when we
actually<00:00:19.470> tie<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.179> it'll<00:00:21.179> give<00:00:21.300> us<00:00:21.330> room<00:00:21.689> to

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
actually tie it it'll give us room to

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.730 
actually tie it it'll give us room to
move<00:00:22.439> maneuver<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.919> sand<00:00:23.749> sandbag<00:00:24.749> is<00:00:25.499> tied

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
move maneuver the sand sandbag is tied

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.710 
move maneuver the sand sandbag is tied
at<00:00:25.919> the<00:00:25.980> top<00:00:26.220> not<00:00:26.789> at<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> bottom<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.570> don't

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
at the top not at the bottom we don't

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.050 
at the top not at the bottom we don't
want<00:00:27.839> to<00:00:27.900> compress<00:00:28.169> the<00:00:28.320> sound<00:00:28.560> too<00:00:28.710> much<00:00:29.060> most

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
want to compress the sound too much most

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.909 
want to compress the sound too much most
sandbags<00:00:30.539> actually<00:00:30.869> come<00:00:31.050> with<00:00:31.079> a<00:00:31.230> tie<00:00:31.409> fix<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
sandbags actually come with a tie fix to

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.510 
sandbags actually come with a tie fix to
them<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:33.000> use<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:34.100> another<00:00:35.100> way<00:00:35.220> the<00:00:35.340> tire

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
them so use that another way the tire

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.990 
them so use that another way the tire
sandbag<00:00:36.770> is<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:38.190> using<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.820> cable<00:00:39.360> tie

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
sandbag is actually using a cable tie

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.880 
sandbag is actually using a cable tie
again<00:00:43.580> close<00:00:44.580> to<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> top<00:00:48.470> and<00:00:49.470> this<00:00:49.710> will

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
again close to the top and this will

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.380 
again close to the top and this will
allow<00:00:50.010> plenty<00:00:50.490> of<00:00:50.580> movement<00:00:50.790> for<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.150> sand

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
allow plenty of movement for the sand

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:02.510 
allow plenty of movement for the sand
when<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:51.810> can<00:00:51.930> press<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.200> down<00:00:52.320> later

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.730 

okay<00:01:03.600> stand<00:01:04.600> on<00:01:04.720> it<00:01:04.840> walk<00:01:04.989> it<00:01:05.020> in

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.080 

we<00:01:08.740> had<00:01:08.890> firefighters<00:01:09.520> standing<00:01:09.880> on<00:01:09.970> the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
we had firefighters standing on the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.580 
we had firefighters standing on the
badge<00:01:10.270> which<00:01:10.510> is<00:01:10.660> compressing<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.320> sand

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
badge which is compressing the sand

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.530 
badge which is compressing the sand
along<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.040> sand<00:01:12.250> Bank<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:12.760> forming<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.360> good

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
along the sand Bank and forming a good

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.310 
along the sand Bank and forming a good
seal<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.020> ground<00:01:14.940> once<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.120> doorway<00:01:16.480> has

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
seal to the ground once the doorway has

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.900 
seal to the ground once the doorway has
been<00:01:17.530> covered<00:01:17.920> on<00:01:18.070> top<00:01:18.490> of<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.640> polythene

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
been covered on top of the polythene

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.300 
been covered on top of the polythene
sheet<00:01:19.390> we<00:01:20.230> were<00:01:20.320> able<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.680> lift<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.010> polythene

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
sheet we were able to lift the polythene

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.330 
sheet we were able to lift the polythene
sheet<00:01:21.700> over<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.510> initial<00:01:22.660> sandbags<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.620> then

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
sheet over the initial sandbags and then

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.510 
sheet over the initial sandbags and then
continue<00:01:24.910> sandbagging<00:01:25.660> up<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:26.770> is<00:01:26.920> important

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
continue sandbagging up it is important

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.270 
continue sandbagging up it is important
that<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:29.170> sandbags<00:01:29.710> are<00:01:29.920> built<00:01:30.100> like<00:01:30.250> a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
that the sandbags are built like a

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.120 
that the sandbags are built like a
pyramid<00:01:30.820> okay<00:01:31.810> so<00:01:32.170> we<00:01:32.320> start<00:01:32.830> at<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:32.979> bottom

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
pyramid okay so we start at the bottom

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.940 
pyramid okay so we start at the bottom
and<00:01:33.520> we<00:01:34.000> build<00:01:34.270> up<00:01:34.500> that's<00:01:35.500> giving<00:01:35.830> it

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
and we build up that's giving it

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.700 
and we build up that's giving it
strength<00:01:36.720> once<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.869> salvaged<00:01:38.229> sheet<00:01:38.350> is<00:01:38.470> over

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
strength once the salvaged sheet is over

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.690 
strength once the salvaged sheet is over
the<00:01:38.830> top<00:01:39.210> we've<00:01:40.210> got<00:01:40.360> a<00:01:40.390> good<00:01:40.570> seal<00:01:41.400> don't<00:01:42.400> be<00:01:42.670> a

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
the top we've got a good seal don't be a

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.490 
the top we've got a good seal don't be a
worried<00:01:43.300> if<00:01:43.510> you<00:01:43.690> haven't<00:01:43.930> got<00:01:44.020> enough<00:01:44.200> sand

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
worried if you haven't got enough sand

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.660 
worried if you haven't got enough sand
or<00:01:44.740> sandbags

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
or sandbags

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.630 
or sandbags
the<00:01:45.850> other<00:01:46.000> option<00:01:46.479> are<00:01:47.200> plastic<00:01:47.800> bags<00:01:48.040> filled

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
the other option are plastic bags filled

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.090 
the other option are plastic bags filled

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
that would that'll be just as effective

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
you can sandbag as well and you can rest

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.910 
you can sandbag as well and you can rest
