you<00:02:10.790> have<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.120> take<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.480> out<00:02:11.600> of<00:02:11.630> me<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:11.990> then

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
you have to take it out of me and then

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.070 
you have to take it out of me and then
apply<00:02:13.100> it<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.220> function<00:02:13.490> or<00:02:13.910> dysfunction<00:02:14.630> so

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
apply it to function or dysfunction so

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.130 
apply it to function or dysfunction so
it's<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.980> resource<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.400> will<00:02:16.910> benefit<00:02:17.600> me<00:02:17.900> and

for you to take all the skills you've
learned<00:03:37.430> in<00:03:37.640> your<00:03:37.670> first<00:03:37.910> year<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.300> apply

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
learned in your first year and apply

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.380 
learned in your first year and apply
them<00:03:39.020> in<00:03:39.140> one<00:03:39.380> setting<00:03:39.680> so<00:03:40.190> basically<00:03:41.180> what

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
them in one setting so basically what

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.880 
them in one setting so basically what
you<00:03:41.510> do<00:03:41.660> is<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.110> pick<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.320> patient

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
you do is you pick a patient

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.410 
you do is you pick a patient
you<00:03:43.100> basically<00:03:43.489> plan<00:03:43.880> what<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.090> want<00:03:44.239> to<00:03:44.300> do

you basically plan what you want to do
and<00:03:44.630> pick<00:03:44.840> occupation<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:45.739> then<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:46.220> dress

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
and pick occupation and then you dress

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.009 
and pick occupation and then you dress
up<00:03:46.550> like<00:03:46.580> that<00:03:46.850> patient<00:03:47.209> for<00:03:47.420> instance<00:03:47.720> I've

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
up like that patient for instance I've

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.170 
up like that patient for instance I've
been<00:03:48.260> Nicki<00:03:48.530> Minaj<00:03:48.800> Rosie<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.610> Riveter<00:03:49.940> and

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
we have kinesiology lecture and lab on

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.210 
we have kinesiology lecture and lab on
Tuesdays<00:04:33.460> where<00:04:34.360> we<00:04:34.480> learn<00:04:34.690> about<00:04:35.220> specific

Tuesdays where we learn about specific

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.280 
Tuesdays where we learn about specific
chapters<00:04:36.640> like<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.270> knee<00:04:37.450> or<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.840> hip<00:04:38.080> and

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
chapters like the knee or the hip and

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.430 
chapters like the knee or the hip and
then<00:04:38.790> after<00:04:39.790> we<00:04:40.150> have<00:04:40.180> lecture<00:04:40.900> we<00:04:41.020> have<00:04:41.200> lab

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.860 
then after we have lecture we have lab
where<00:04:42.010> we<00:04:42.040> learn<00:04:42.400> about<00:04:42.670> the<00:04:43.120> bony<00:04:43.300> landmarks

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
where we learn about the bony landmarks

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.810 
where we learn about the bony landmarks
and<00:04:44.140> the<00:04:44.440> muscles<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:44.980> how<00:04:45.100> to<00:04:45.160> palpate<00:04:45.610> those

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
and the muscles and how to palpate those

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.510 
and the muscles and how to palpate those
our<00:04:46.390> group<00:04:46.720> has<00:04:46.960> made<00:04:47.320> Friday's<00:04:47.860> palp<00:04:48.190> Friday

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
our group has made Friday's palp Friday

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.920 
our group has made Friday's palp Friday
so<00:04:48.640> we<00:04:48.940> all<00:04:49.030> come<00:04:49.240> in<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.450> groups<00:04:49.690> and
