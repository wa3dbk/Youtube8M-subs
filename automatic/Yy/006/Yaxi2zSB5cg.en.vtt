 the image of the intention 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.940
 but to get the television 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.540
 He does have an optical cable to play the sound of the floors to one

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.480
 from the parents 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.770
 if you have 3d blu ray player and 3d tv 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.510
 then you will have to make additional settings 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.090
