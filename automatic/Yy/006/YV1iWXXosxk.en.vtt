00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.910
 how about friends how are you welcome to the 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.980
 Today's map this time is a map 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.100
 special because he sent it to me 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.760
 subscriber here I'm pointing it says 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:25.300
 and I thought by grim that is his nickname 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.810
 name or I do not know the truth then in the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.119
 description will be your channel as he will 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.730
 has taken the trouble to make us a 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.010
 map with all the items that I know that they 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.370
 had brought one before but this one is 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.680
 better and more updated that is, it has more 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.039
 things everything we can find in 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.660
 this in this version of minecraft 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:50.000
 we will find it here 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.150
 it's a very useful map the truth and that's why 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.270
 I bring them and really many 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.260
 thanks to parga for doing it 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.440
 It's a three-story house 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.969
 with chests with their respective names 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.110
 of each and thought what happens that here not 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.110
 I finished loading this 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:15.970
 and then he has everything as you can see 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.250
 lava water 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.230
 he says he did this with the help of the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.510
 tutorial that I brought them how 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.110
 get the items how to get the 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.880
 mother clothes with the program east of 360 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.430
 revolution that some have problems 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.380
 with downloading it and that's why it does 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:38.490
 I went up a tutorial on how to do it 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:41.470
 so that they will be clearer and then 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.030
 I think it will help them a lot 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.630
 this map because it has absolutely 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.060
 everything has the bedrock has the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.579
 monsters spammers has everything 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.200
 and then really many thanks to 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.360
 Couple that I would have liked to do this 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.050
 video with him to come out here in 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:04.820
 video but the problem is that 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:07.040
 I live in europe and you are from mexico and your 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.860
 that is when I record the videos 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.650
 normally this day in the morning and 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.160
 she is at night or how they are 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.650
 sleeping 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.230
 and then it is impossible the truth is very 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.620
 complicated at night I almost can not 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.140
 and well you know if you have a map and 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.239
 you want to share it with others with 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.810
 we then agree 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.319
 to make the video together so that 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.810
 you appear in the video 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.849
 that way I would feel better because I 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.819
 would like them to appear here present in 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.920
 your maps and that and well I hope that 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.139
 you liked today's map again 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.530

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:52.140
