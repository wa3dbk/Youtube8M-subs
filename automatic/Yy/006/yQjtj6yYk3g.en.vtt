00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.110
 hello we continue in 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.219
 familiarize yourself with the intricacies of building and 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.949
 nail design 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.579
 very often you are probably watching videos 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.400
 pore buildup heard phrase standard 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.749
 prepare the nails to build 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.630
 today I will tell you what is it 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.550
 means 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.050
 they write us years first of all we 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.300
 handle pens 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:41.140
 concept to kill and besides ki 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.899
 all that bad there may be 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.679
 processed and inspected so as not to 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:51.039
 it was opened to the temple on the cuticle and 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:54.199
 skin was clean and good 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:57.530
 We begin nail processing with the fact that 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.640
 move the cuticle back with the pusher take the pusher 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.850
 and neatly 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.850
 move the cuticle 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.950
 clearing ahead if we leave 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.850
 the stereos here right here we will go 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.670
 deferment 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.670
 the material will move away from your nails 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:29.920
 we further produce yelled nail from 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.920
 set shall find squirrel abrasivity 180 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:48.320
 movement mine mine sawing 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.320
 nail surface 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.470
 carefully come fully cuticle 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.910
 if you are preparing a new one only 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.360
 nail file 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.030
 you need a blunt end like this 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.690
 clean the sinuses 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:24.170
 so that there would be no extra 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:31.239
 elements or a cuticle we go 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:37.580
 use the device to file a free edge 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:40.760
 I remove the excess and choose the corners here in 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.560
 these places that we became a forum in 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.260
 there were no gaps of buttons and dash 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.730
 filing free edge symmetrically 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.959
 so that the form was comfortable 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.959
 prune with substitution 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:05.480
 we cover the surface only slightly 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.480
 not drunk the war with the subway in the world and 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.420
 we pass by the apparatus 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:26.680
 clear the sinuses of all places where the nail file 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.680
 not suitable choose three 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.810
 we work with a nozzle 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.810
 surface 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.810
 we and sawed all the nails traced gone 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:56.150
 we do not remove the brush with the device 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.150
 dash remove excess with them and 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.709
 pass through the dehydrator on all the nails 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.550
 each stage of preparation can be made 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.050
 as 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.160
 consistently 1 nail that is immediately 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.329
 pushed back cuticle pollination 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.430
 conveyor method 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.100
 that is, first all 10 fingers 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.900
 move the cuticle back and then everything climbs 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.500
 couple prokidyvaem surface 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.639
 free edge and then all over 10 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.639
 are passed by the device

 gel or acrylic fruit ready for 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.030
 applying primer here we have prepared 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:24.430
 our nails to build up need now 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.949
 and gel nails to build up and acrylic 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.190
 the next video see how to put
