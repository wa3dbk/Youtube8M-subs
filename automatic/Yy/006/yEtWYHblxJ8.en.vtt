00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.870
 wrc is also such a series where each 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.790
 year a new part actually comes 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.710
 Did you call that is unfortunately too 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.060
 trust in the table or elsewhere 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.730
 further that you indeed said it michael 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.410
 Exactly I gambled I know it 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.670
 Predecessor not, however, I can 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.170
 say it is a lot of fun 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.500
 they probably have a little bit of 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.250
 Driven physics is more interesting for 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.619
 made simulation friends 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.309
 So if you help everyone , it matters 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.710
 already very nice 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.059
 I have her last year as Toni has her 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.989
 predecessors also tested there then 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.940
 I watched myself so 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.170
 he was also from the game player too 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.090
 relatively pleased 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.280
 but he did not find the guise as good 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.180
 and if I look at it that way then 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.309
 they are also divorcing a bit 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.010
 So it made see the vehicles 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.039
 very nice from where you most 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.500
 worked there names are the persons 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.420
 all the sponsors on the sides 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.430
 Everything looks a little polished 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.940
 better and the menus are also very good 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.940
 pretty 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.710
 as it is in the video 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.170
 the return game features were foreseen 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.030
 again, so there everyone looks 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.500
 what about codemasters but you are 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.910
 meanwhile also makes the whole thing 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.340
 also maybe more interesting for casual 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.280
 player the money yes to the racing game with 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.360
 the role to what I read it 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.860
 There is also a whole new career mode 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.540
 and the man almost as a youth driver 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.260
 city â€‹â€‹compatible exactly one begins 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.880
 junior wrc drives for other teams 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.430
 and then slowly work your way up 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.360
 the weekends are as well as right 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.610
 So with several stages over two days 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.340
 as soon as you become master in junior 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.380
 mini wrc rises to two and then three 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.250
 someday in the wrc and can 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.460
 to become world champion 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.140
 that sounds like about four 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.340
 take years until you somewhere up there 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.860
 is so about looks like here 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.940
 you can customize the car that is 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.490
 between two stages 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.840
 How to adjust the orientation of the car 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.160
 Change is similar and it is natural 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.530
 fix it when you get back a few 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.300
 Planten has striped that has already 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.360
 realistic claim then with 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.519
 tuning and alignments and damage 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.080
 repair and so yes exactly one can 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.510
 look at how the stages look like 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.549
 she also falls something or on sand or something 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.780
 play and of course if you are 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.410
 you can not fix everything 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.150
 repair 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.100
 Your technicians have a good time 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.019
 and depending on how everyday something 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.910
 is damaged and so repaired 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.019
 takes longer and maybe can 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.600
 you then no longer your body 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.870
 fix what you already have 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.260
 much more demanding than dirt 3 yes 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.120
 so much more sophisticated 3 the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.700
 Scenarios are very different here 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.260
 you can see a bit through the city 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.890
 and yes , of course , snow is back 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.480
 given 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.760
 different times of day are also 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.709
 new so you can during the day so 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.670
 sunset i drive 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.080
 believe here it is at the moment 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.880
 sunset so 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.230
 mood is very nice that mexico 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.030
 I think I'm the flag up there 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.740
 right through 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.940
 So look smart, I think 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.550
 Rally fans should be real now 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.660
 Mark if we're curious what uwe then 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.660
 under his test writes
