00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.119 
plan if you only have like to make phone
calls<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.289> will<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:55.590> work<00:00:55.770> because<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
calls this will not work because it

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.310 
calls this will not work because it
needs<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> network<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.570> register<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> sim

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
needs to network to register the sim

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.590 
needs to network to register the sim
that<00:00:59.039> that's<00:00:59.340> one<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.910> my<00:00:59.969> problems<00:01:00.149> right<00:01:00.420> now

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
that that's one of my problems right now

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.660 
that that's one of my problems right now
so<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.230> need<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> SIM<00:01:01.770> card<00:01:01.800> bought<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> SIM<00:01:02.640> card

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
so you need a SIM card bought a SIM card

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.140 
so you need a SIM card bought a SIM card
so<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.000> could<00:01:03.120> register<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.750> t-mobile<00:01:04.619> network

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
so I could register the t-mobile network

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.580 
so I could register the t-mobile network
but<00:01:06.150> since<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.510> don't<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> data<00:01:07.170> plan<00:01:07.260> on

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
but since I don't have a data plan on

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.840 
but since I don't have a data plan on
this<00:01:07.770> SIM<00:01:07.950> card<00:01:08.220> because<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.460> don't<00:01:08.640> really

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
this SIM card because I don't really

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.630 
this SIM card because I don't really
need<00:01:09.229> chemo<00:01:10.229> I'm<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:11.070> doing<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
need chemo I'm just doing this for the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.780 
need chemo I'm just doing this for the
video<00:01:11.869> then<00:01:12.950> you'll<00:01:13.950> see<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.280> mean<00:01:14.460> right

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
video then you'll see what I mean right

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.370 
video then you'll see what I mean right
away<00:01:14.820> when<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.210> put<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.509> SIM<00:01:15.689> card<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.080> connects

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
away when I put the SIM card it connects

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.080 
away when I put the SIM card it connects
to<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> network<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.100> I'll<00:01:17.610> get<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> voicemail

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
to the network and I'll get a voicemail

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.730 
to the network and I'll get a voicemail
from<00:01:18.810> t-mobile<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:21.210> idea<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.780> there<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.560> to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
from t-mobile the idea is there it is to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.330 
from t-mobile the idea is there it is to

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
voicemail

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.859 
voicemail
that<00:01:23.490> means<00:01:23.670> timo<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.150> active<00:01:24.509> right<00:01:24.689> there

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869

until you get this carrier option to

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.400 
until you get this carrier option to
stay<00:02:05.540> to<00:02:06.540> stay<00:02:06.570> there<00:02:07.110> there<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.619> is

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.140 

the<00:02:10.980> keeps<00:02:11.220> Deutsch<00:02:11.490> want<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> keep<00:02:11.850> doing

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.790 

takes<00:02:23.220> me<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> bunch<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.730> times

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
takes me a bunch of times

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.680 
takes me a bunch of times
but<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.920> does<00:02:26.100> work<00:02:26.550> here<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:26.940> could<00:02:27.240> get<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.510> in

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
but it does work here I could get it in

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:42.430 
but it does work here I could get it in
a<00:02:27.840> minute<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:40.050> idea<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.590> get<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.860> carrier

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
a minute the idea is to get that carrier

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
a minute the idea is to get that carrier
thing<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.650> stay<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.240> then<00:02:45.980> it's<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.190> glitch

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
thing to stay and then it's a glitch

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.250 
thing to stay and then it's a glitch
it's<00:02:47.700> not<00:02:47.820> an<00:02:47.940> official<00:02:48.390> unlock<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.080> why

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
it's not an official unlock this is why

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.860 
it's not an official unlock this is why
it's<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.650> I'm<00:02:50.640> doing<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.210> way<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:51.840> that

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
it's a I'm doing it this way so that

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:12.000 
it's a I'm doing it this way so that

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.410 
right now I throw it in the oven right
now<00:03:29.709> but<00:03:30.280> then<00:03:30.400> again<00:03:30.519> since<00:03:30.940> I<00:03:31.030> don't<00:03:31.180> have<00:03:31.390> a

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
now but then again since I don't have a

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.890 
now but then again since I don't have a
data<00:03:31.780> plan<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:33.430> will<00:03:33.640> not<00:03:33.790> get<00:03:34.269> any<00:03:34.450> networks
