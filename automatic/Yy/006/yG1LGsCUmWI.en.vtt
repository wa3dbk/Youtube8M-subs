what's<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:38.010> Italy<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:38.879> it

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
what's going on in Italy and what it

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.530

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
some some people in the poker world

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.640 
some some people in the poker world
think<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.600> Italian<00:02:22.050> players<00:02:22.320> are<00:02:22.620> very

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
think that the Italian players are very

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.190 
think that the Italian players are very
wild<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.790> hard<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.480> know<00:02:24.810> what<00:02:25.020> they're<00:02:25.170> doing

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
wild and hard to know what they're doing

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.080 
wild and hard to know what they're doing
sometimes<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:26.130> they're<00:02:26.280> playing<00:02:26.550> almost<00:02:26.790> a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
sometimes that they're playing almost a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.690 
sometimes that they're playing almost a
different<00:02:27.990> level<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.380> game<00:02:28.650> than<00:02:29.040> then<00:02:29.490> some

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
different level of game than then some

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.580 
different level of game than then some
of<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> other<00:02:29.960> styles<00:02:30.960> of<00:02:31.110> some<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.470> other

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
of the other styles of some of the other

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.920 
of the other styles of some of the other
countries<00:02:31.830> do<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.340> feel<00:02:32.580> like<00:02:32.820> your<00:02:33.360> style<00:02:33.720> is

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
countries do you feel like your style is

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.050 
countries do you feel like your style is
like<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:34.320> kind<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.740> just<00:02:35.280> crazy<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.820> hard<00:02:35.940> to

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
like this kind of just crazy and hard to

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.810 
like this kind of just crazy and hard to
know<00:02:36.240> well<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:36.990> think<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.650> depends<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.610> the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
know well I think that depends of the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.960 
know well I think that depends of the
table<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.420> don't<00:02:39.510> have<00:02:40.130> enormous<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.640> know<00:02:41.940> I

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
table I don't have enormous I you know I

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.150 
table I don't have enormous I you know I
depend<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.020> table<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.560> know<00:02:43.590> if<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:43.980> have<00:02:44.130> a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
depend of the table you know if I have a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.200 
depend of the table you know if I have a
easy<00:02:45.030> table<00:02:45.600> maybe<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.550> I<00:02:47.550> don't<00:02:47.880> take<00:02:48.030> too<00:02:48.180> much

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
easy table maybe I I don't take too much

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.980 
easy table maybe I I don't take too much
