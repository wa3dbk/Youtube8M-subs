the<00:01:36.220> balance<00:01:36.610> because<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.000> really<00:01:37.180> is<00:01:37.420> just

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
the balance because it really is just

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.330 
the balance because it really is just
it's<00:01:37.990> this<00:01:38.140> big<00:01:38.350> versus<00:01:38.740> small<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.100> David

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
it's this big versus small the David

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.070 
it's this big versus small the David
versus<00:01:39.610> Goliath<00:01:39.700> can<00:01:40.119> aspect<00:01:40.600> of<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:40.869> and

balancing<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:41.890> alone<00:01:42.850> is<00:01:43.030> hard<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.479> then

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
balancing that alone is hard and then

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.600 
balancing that alone is hard and then
once<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:44.229> get<00:01:44.380> into<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.650> levels<00:01:44.979> there's

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
once you get into the levels there's

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.550 
once you get into the levels there's
areas<00:01:45.940> of<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.090> levels<00:01:46.360> where<00:01:46.510> only<00:01:47.050> pilots

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
areas of the levels where only pilots

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.620 
areas of the levels where only pilots
thrive<00:01:47.830> there's<00:01:48.130> areas<00:01:48.700> of<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.180> level<00:01:49.509> where

thrive there's areas of the level where

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.570 
thrive there's areas of the level where
Titans<00:01:50.140> are<00:01:50.320> kind<00:01:50.740> of<00:01:50.800> more<00:01:50.979> dominant<00:01:51.369> and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
Titans are kind of more dominant and

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.730 
Titans are kind of more dominant and
it's<00:01:52.000> so<00:01:52.300> it's<00:01:52.360> almost<00:01:52.660> two<00:01:53.080> levels<00:01:53.410> in<00:01:53.560> one

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
it's so it's almost two levels in one

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.120 
it's so it's almost two levels in one

way<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.460> levels<00:01:57.759> flow<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:59.229> way<00:01:59.350> the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
way the levels flow and the way the

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.530 
way the levels flow and the way the
gameplay<00:01:59.830> loop<00:02:00.040> kind<00:02:00.310> of<00:02:00.430> flows<00:02:00.640> so<00:02:00.970> it's<00:02:01.450> a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
gameplay loop kind of flows so it's a

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.810 
gameplay loop kind of flows so it's a
really<00:02:01.780> tough<00:02:02.560> thing<00:02:02.800> to<00:02:02.830> get<00:02:03.040> right<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.520> it

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
really tough thing to get right and it

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.520 
really tough thing to get right and it
took<00:02:03.940> us<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.119> long<00:02:04.300> time<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.630> really<00:02:04.960> nail<00:02:05.229> that

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
took us a long time to really nail that

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.070 
took us a long time to really nail that
kind<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:05.860> balance<00:02:06.220> on<00:02:06.610> foot<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.210> game<00:02:07.390> looks<00:02:07.930> a

kind of balance on foot the game looks a

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.139 
kind of balance on foot the game looks a
lot<00:02:08.229> like<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.500> futuristic<00:02:08.890> call<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.459> duty<00:02:09.729> you
