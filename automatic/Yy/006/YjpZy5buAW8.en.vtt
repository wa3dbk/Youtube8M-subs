another<00:00:37.590> fact<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.280> are<00:00:38.340> four

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
another fact is that there are four

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.340 
another fact is that there are four
types<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.059> applications<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.110> run<00:00:40.320> on

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
types of applications that can be run on

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.840 
types of applications that can be run on
the<00:00:40.559> Apple<00:00:40.829> watch<00:00:40.950> these<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:41.670> ways<00:00:41.820> that

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
the Apple watch these are ways that

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.850 
the Apple watch these are ways that
developers<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.629> optimize<00:00:43.200> content<00:00:43.649> for<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
developers can optimize content for a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.220 
developers can optimize content for a
specific<00:00:44.070> tasks<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.510> glances<00:00:46.020> which

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
specific tasks so we have glances which

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
specific tasks so we have glances which
are<00:00:46.379> designed<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> give<00:00:46.950> users<00:00:47.190> quick<00:00:47.610> read

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
are designed to give users quick read

allow that the next fact is that there

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.380 
allow that the next fact is that there
are<00:01:25.080> two<00:01:25.350> types<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.770> notifications<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:27.150> first

are two types of notifications the first

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390 
are two types of notifications the first
is<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> short<00:01:27.960> look<00:01:28.110> notification<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.220> is

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
is a short look notification and this is

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.370 
is a short look notification and this is
only<00:01:29.549> briefly<00:01:30.030> visible<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.810> lets<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.049> glance

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
installed on the phone in order for them

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.780 
installed on the phone in order for them
to<00:02:00.630> run<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> watch<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.250> because<00:02:02.549> for

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
to run on the watch this is because for

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.160 
to run on the watch this is because for
the<00:02:02.850> most<00:02:02.880> part<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.479> apps<00:02:03.630> are<00:02:03.810> actually

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the most part the apps are actually

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.200 
the most part the apps are actually
being<00:02:04.380> run<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.890> iPhone<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.790> watch<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
being run on the iPhone the watch in the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.880 
being run on the iPhone the watch in the
iphone<00:02:06.570> are<00:02:06.719> continually<00:02:07.290> talking<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.799> each

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
iphone are continually talking to each

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.440 
iphone are continually talking to each
other<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.399> must<00:02:08.640> have<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.910> iphone<00:02:09.239> with

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
other so you must have the iphone with

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.510 
other so you must have the iphone with
you<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:09.959> these<00:02:10.259> apps<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.739> run<00:02:10.979> but

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
you so that these apps can run but

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.130 
you so that these apps can run but
eventually<00:02:11.760> apple<00:02:12.330> says<00:02:12.540> there<00:02:12.750> will<00:02:12.870> be<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
eventually apple says there will be the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.790 
eventually apple says there will be the
full<00:02:13.349> ability

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
full ability

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.230

for full native watch apps to be

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.450 
for full native watch apps to be
installed<00:02:15.690> lastly<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:16.980> there's<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.220> whole

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460
