00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.279
 good friends welcome to this next 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:09.010
 video tutorial in which there was 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.950
 promised the games that we're going to 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.750
 put now and an extra that comes 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.870
 being in the update to the choco 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.420
 break 3.2 which is the last one that will 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.760
 to be unfortunately charged 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.450
 hopefully and it is not true but there it says 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.160
 final so let's continue 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.190
 these files but they are going to 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.630
 download the links of that position and a 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.730
 link to the post to download the choco 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.180
 break basically does not have to be from 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.830
 post 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.570
 The chocÃ³ break can be downloaded from 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.070
 the other place there is no problem 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.290
 update will always be the same 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.450
 but good here is we go with the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.130
 games first the dead space as 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.660
 we can see it divided into two parts by 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:52.080
 their weight the others do not and now the first thing 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.510
 how do I know how this is done how do they get 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.220
 basically it's easy that we have the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.160
 binder 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.370
 and here we have it we have the apk and 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.830
 we have the data does that are these 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.270
 well first to know that in the case 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.310
 of you as it is the first time that what 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.710
 they are going to do first what they have 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.890
 what to do is installed in it applies a 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.530
 time is talavera pk open it should say 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.900
 they need 2s and so on 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.580
 they close the apk they go to applications 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.070
 enforcement services and force the 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.520
 Forum detention is detention already 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.740
 closes the application and on its and its 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.080
 phone are going to your files in this 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.820
 case there was going to be a new folder in 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.100
 the case of assassin written the folder 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.430
 it's going to be called gameloft let's make a 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.430
 example 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.409
 this folder is going to be created in your 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.170
 phone 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.789
 a great in the critical actions and within 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.609
 from that folder this is going to be in the root 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.929
 of the sd do not worry once inside 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.149
 from that folder then you are going to 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.380
 grab this data I do not know whether to say well 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.450
 how is the folder because that's how 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.929
 I put on everyone as well as they are going to 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.929
 happen here 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.490
 yesterday canceled 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:12.560
 and once this is done and can start 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.480
 play already have the data sd installed 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.060
 in the right place and in basically 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.370
 birds without street and asphalt are 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.230
 gameloft these are easy to do what 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.440
 same with the ace when requesting in the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.090
 attack and the data in this case the alpha 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.990
 they are passed to the same folder of actions 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.030
 that because they are from gameloft well there is another 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.910
 different thing in the case of what 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.910
 is still the good fish this is a 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.790
 little bit different we open ourselves the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.760
 fish we install fish 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.870
 and if we install the apk if we want the 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.579
 we run if there is no problem well but 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.019
 I imagine that if we have to run to 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.049
 so I say no problem the 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.959
 thing not well and we wait for the fish and this 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.760
 folder is different let's go to the 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.670
 folder that is called let's go to the other 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.760
 example the default phone that was 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.769
 a folder called android 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.430
 between that folder we're going to open it going to 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.450
 have another folder 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.689
 that is called data that is the data and 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.519
 inside that folder android data we're going 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:21.060
 to put what data are coming 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.340
 sd of the fish here we are going to put it once 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.510
 and insert the data there we can already 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.970
 take normal weight there is no problem 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.980
 well now in the case of how it came 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.470
 saying of the space 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.800
 well there is a folder in the root that 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.800
 is going to create 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.630
 we discovered after going to a 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.989
 similar folder will create me a 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.370
 dj or folder that says the same thing but 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.290
 here we have it as we can see here the 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.450
 we have 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.030
 or create the folder or simply install 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.730
 in the apec and the data is passed 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.420
 directly to the root of the sd and it's 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.120
 all friends 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.370
 APK and we expect another headquarters 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.430
 its corresponding place in this case and 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.650
 I explained how they are in others and then in 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.659
 the case after as he said right now 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.450
 we just passed the cd data or the 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:14.420
 folder of her and just as it is to the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.970
 memory of the sda well now we go to the 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.229
 next that is the last one in this case 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.020
 it would be the two games and the emulator and 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:26.970
 here I have left two games to sin 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.120
 of rap many know him and fruit ninja 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.710
 version but that's solution install and 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.110
 there is no problem do not worry 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.470
 they go to the s of no to the phone like this 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.470
 no problem 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.070
 emulators good here we have the 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.240
 following mulares that has been well 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.940
 I go to neo geo nintendo sega genesis and 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.890
 super nintendo well in the case of 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.340
 wit game is a bit particular not 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.810
 all games are compatible we are 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.760
 looking and this avoids with those I put 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.280
 parents neo bomberman which left me 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.820
 strangely work what we see and 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.350

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.600
 Now putting the look is not 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.430
 running in this emulator but hey 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.700
 this is in the case of that emulator 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.310
 ok now we go to the next step or what 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.370
