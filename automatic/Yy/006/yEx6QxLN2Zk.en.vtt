 I'm a bruno teacher to make a brief 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.250
 comment from today's enem proof 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.619
 themes were addressed this year at 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.189
 frontier but were working during 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.440
 every year with the third year with the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 however the 2nd year in pre entrance exam 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.670
 finally with all our students who can 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.469
 to have this proof has more in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.510
 fell in the test of that year as per 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.460
 example, Brazilian agriculture with a 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.629
 topic that was quoted food 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.399
 transgenic themes that are touched is 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.469
 routinely daily a means of 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.559
 communication in which it was addressed in the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.469
 class environmental impact problems 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.340
 environmental impact on our 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.800
 waters 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.260
 our population ideology was the theme 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.200
 also addressed this year fell the pyramid 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.760
 population on Saturday's test 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.920
 and this evidence and this child and 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.200
 population was commented two days ago 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.750
 behind our globalization review was 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.490
 the theme also commented on the proof of enem 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.009
 the Brazilian economy was also a theme 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.380
 was addressed and we made a point of doing 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.680
 a comment on physical geography also 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.460
 put to test types of rock 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.079
 relief structure is mineral resources 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.259
 crystalline structures that were themes 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.479
 massively approached by us in the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.250
 class is the student the contact left the test 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.250
 today with the conscience of duty 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.409
 quiet of fulfilled themes were 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.360
 addressed were put to the test were 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.700
 placed in our simulations were 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.040
 placed in our reviews in our 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.560
 student today is had the opportunity to 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.600
 put their knowledge into practice 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.710
 for you would make contact 2012 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.079
 A good hug, everything will work out. 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.350
 Right for us 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:06.479
 Hello asked Professor cícero Satuba 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.970
 of the contact history team 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:15.350
 in my name and in the name of my companions 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.290
 edson luiz andré sesa boy juliano melo 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.810
 to make a rapid analysis of the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.610
 today's test on the first day of the race 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.670
 of the national examination 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.580
 a proof that the team analyzed a lot 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.900
 good proof within our 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.310
 expectations 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:39.110
 a contextualized proof is a proof that 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:42.320
 citing some examples, he did not 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.080
 like the era vargas né fell in an analysis 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.580
 material in the presentation of the 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.980
 test points 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.770
 two questions about it 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.400
 I was particularly drawn to the issue 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.390
 that approached the São Paulo revolution of 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.990
 1932 known as the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.200
 constitutionalist 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.270
 also highlight a theme that has been 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.230
 much addressed by the entire team to the 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.680
 throughout the year 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.660
 the truth commission established in the 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.680
 first half of 2012 during the 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.300
 government 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.310
 to investigate alleged crimes 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.450
 committed by public officials during the 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.430
 military dictatorship 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.370
 the commission of truth was not the theme 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.870
 specific issue but the issue of 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:30.080
 raised the issue was the theme 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.160
 rather the pseudo suicide 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.670
 suicide of journalist vladimir herzog 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.850
 175 1985 is the false suicide indeed 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.410
 was killed under torture of 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.810
 public officials during the period 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:49.910
 authorities also reminded that the 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:52.610
 evidence brought themes in the 60s the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.250
 movement of the counterculture movement 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.030
 of the Vietnam War is a 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.519
 which brought to the forefront the 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.250
 pacifist movement in the united states 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.040
 nor of the civil rights of blacks 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.209
 movement led by pastor martin 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.900
 luther king 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:15.470
 in this same context it is 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.979
 characterization an issue that addressed 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.150
 the liberation process of India 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.400
 non-violence captained 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.509
 mahatma gandhi a matter of empire 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.690
 Roman 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:31.630
 within what was previously expected to be common 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.259
 Julian Melo and emphasized along with 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.990
 the staff did not go very well with this it is 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:40.240
 contextualized is brought many images 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.430
 many illustrations in some of the 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.800
 questions was not necessary if a 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.350
 deep knowledge on the subject was 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.380
 more than a matter of pure and simple 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.020
 interpretation then we understand talk 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.060
 I'm speaking for the team that was a 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.490
 proof within expectations 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.699
 in the analysis of the team a proof that in 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.889
 many aspects is was much better in the 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.280
 that in the last two years in particular 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.050
 compared to last year's enem in 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.800
 nape of the story 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.840
 rest is waiting for everyone tomorrow 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.449
 can be operated as well as 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.010
 we believe that the beast contact was 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.910
 well today 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:26.050
 My hug embrace the entire team 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.300
 history of the college and course contact and 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.020
 I wish everyone good luck in proof 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.539
 tomorrow 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.389
 hoping everyone will perform well 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:37.570
 nor so that in the end we can celebrate 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:41.250
 together approval embrace cícero Satuba
