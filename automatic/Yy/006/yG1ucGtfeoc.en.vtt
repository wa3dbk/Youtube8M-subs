00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.650 
figure out the fitness thing you know I
have<00:00:47.489> loads<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.850> fitness<00:00:48.149> cars<00:00:48.390> i<00:00:48.510> could

have loads of fitness cars i could
probably<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.020> put<00:00:49.200> fitness<00:00:49.469> cards<00:00:49.739> every

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
time and not have to worry cuz right now

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.510 
time and not have to worry cuz right now
i'm<00:00:52.020> rotating<00:00:52.230> between<00:00:52.530> two<00:00:52.860> teams<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.309> for

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.029 
i'm rotating between two teams just for
fitness<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:54.840> think<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.140> 3<00:00:55.500> 4<00:00:55.770> 12

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039

fitness but I really think that 3 4 12
and<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.300> 443<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.289> don't<00:00:58.530> fit<00:00:58.770> my<00:00:58.949> play<00:00:59.190> style

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and the 443 just don't fit my play style

even<00:01:02.430> with<00:01:02.940> low<00:01:03.090> chemistry<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.780> shouldn't<00:01:04.140> be

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
even with low chemistry I shouldn't be

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.050 
even with low chemistry I shouldn't be
losing<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.680> way<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> can't<00:01:05.309> defend<00:01:05.760> with

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
into the back of the net i believe at

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.910 
into the back of the net i believe at
this<00:01:36.509> point<00:01:36.600> i<00:01:36.840> was<00:01:36.960> down<00:01:37.140> three<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
this point i was down three now and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.350 
this point i was down three now and
that's<00:01:38.280> when<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.490> was<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.700> man<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.000> got<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.240> get

that's when I was like man I got to get

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.359 
that's when I was like man I got to get
it<00:01:39.479> together<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.229> scored<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.250> with

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it together so I scored one here with

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.069 
it together so I scored one here with
Roberto<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.090> funny<00:01:42.270> because<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.659> always

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
Roberto and it's funny because I always

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.080 
Roberto and it's funny because I always
seem<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.500> go<00:01:43.649> behind<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.520> series<00:01:44.759> and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
seem to go behind in this series and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.850 
seem to go behind in this series and
then<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.170> towards<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.470> end<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.799> game

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
then I and towards the end of the game

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.499 
then I and towards the end of the game
I'm<00:01:47.159> able<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.460> score<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.759> bunch<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.119> goals<00:01:48.329> I'm

just thinking why cannot do this in the
beginning<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.369> has<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.759> be<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> formations

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600

thought<00:03:05.580> arsenal<00:03:06.240> had<00:03:06.360> no<00:03:06.570> chance<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.410> they

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
thought arsenal had no chance and they

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.920 
thought arsenal had no chance and they
destroyed<00:03:07.890> by<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.820> actually<00:03:09.120> think<00:03:09.300> Arsenal

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
destroyed by I actually think Arsenal

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.780 
destroyed by I actually think Arsenal
played<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> very<00:03:10.800> very<00:03:11.100> good<00:03:11.340> game<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:11.730> know

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
played a very very good game I know

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.450 
played a very very good game I know
Byron<00:03:12.120> had<00:03:12.390> some<00:03:12.570> chances<00:03:13.020> um<00:03:13.290> but<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.130> think

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
Byron had some chances um but I think

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.000 
Byron had some chances um but I think
Arsenal<00:03:14.880> played<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:16.260> know<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.410> really<00:03:16.740> really

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
Arsenal played you know a really really

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.830 
Arsenal played you know a really really
good<00:03:17.220> game<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.640> bit<00:03:17.850> unlucky<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.450> not<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.810> not

liga easily honestly they had that one
goal<00:03:31.320> lead<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.560> thought<00:03:31.860> they<00:03:31.920> were<00:03:32.010> gonna<00:03:32.100> go

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
goal lead I thought they were gonna go

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.490 
goal lead I thought they were gonna go
there<00:03:32.640> Molly<00:03:33.480> go<00:03:33.660> was<00:03:33.780> gonna<00:03:33.960> push<00:03:34.170> forward

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
there Molly go was gonna push forward

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.350 
there Molly go was gonna push forward
and<00:03:34.560> Porter<00:03:34.920> was<00:03:35.010> gonna<00:03:35.190> destroy<00:03:35.340> them<00:03:35.730> but<00:03:35.940> no

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
and Porter was gonna destroy them but no

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.450 
and Porter was gonna destroy them but no
fourth<00:03:36.780> was<00:03:37.020> out<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.590> teams<00:03:38.040> i<00:03:38.220> thought

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
fourth was out so the teams i thought

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.610 
fourth was out so the teams i thought
we're<00:03:38.610> gonna<00:03:38.700> go<00:03:38.940> through<00:03:39.260> didn't<00:03:40.260> go<00:03:40.350> through

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
we're gonna go through didn't go through

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.980 
we're gonna go through didn't go through
so<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:41.130> thought<00:03:41.880> Byron<00:03:42.330> would<00:03:42.480> pull<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.810> off<00:03:42.960> but

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
so I thought Byron would pull it off but

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.780 
so I thought Byron would pull it off but
I<00:03:43.290> thought<00:03:43.530> Arsenal<00:03:43.920> was<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.100> better<00:03:44.280> team<00:03:44.370> so

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
I thought Arsenal was the better team so

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.730 
I thought Arsenal was the better team so
you<00:03:45.660> know<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.840> only<00:03:46.020> team<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.440> thought

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
you know the only team that I thought

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.990 
you know the only team that I thought

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
would go through did go through and that

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.200 
would go through did go through and that
