00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:07.880
 Hi, welcome to another video of the last 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.670
 turn 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.160
 we made the reflective bands and now 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.620
 let's continue our bodywork 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.289
 after pasting the stickers that part 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.590
 is ready then just do another part 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:25.310
 exactly the same and then make two 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.859
 smaller parts and now let's fold to 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.529
 power to paste into our database 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.629
 these pieces have the same height as the piece 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:41.630
 smaller is 10 inches long 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:44.420
 and it does not need to have side flaps and 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.420
 Now that we've doubled, let's finally paste. 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.760
 the sides of our body begin 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.710
 by the smaller parties so as not to be 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.010
 space left at the end 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.559
 this part is easy only for 5 and 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.989
 leave well aligned already calculated for 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.600
 remaining 1 to 2 millimeters on each side 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.320
 ie the body has to be smaller 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.320
 that the base 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.310
 after that with one of the smaller pieces 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.409
 let's paste one side is just pass glue 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.570
 and adjusting at the base 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.570
 after pressing until dry 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.920
 ae 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.250
 and I 'll go when the other side does not 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:23.140
 you need to wait to dry one side 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:25.269
 to paste the other and now let's close 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.060
 our body with the last part 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.890
 glue on the side waters and the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.260
 small part flap 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.489
 if the calculations are correct, 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.489
 Engage right 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.230
 It's getting cool, baby. 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.700
 But we're not going to stop yet. 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.920
 some details 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.959
 Let's make some little things to give. 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.569
 strengthening our structure 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.420
 get those works of black paper that 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.640
 I know you did not throw it away and let's go 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.030
 make a rectangle of eight centimeters 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.819
 length by 2.7 in height which is the 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.269
 height of our body 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.220
 well mark one centimeter and 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.890
 brings vertical lines 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.480
 then we will remember in our parts 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.480
 will be two centimeters each 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.420
 mark with force only the middle lines 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:41.190
 that's where we'll double after and now it 's 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.190
 only cut according to the video 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.250
 it's just double and we have our 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.409
 We will now paste one into 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:13.849
 each corner to reinforce and give a 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:16.549
 better finish for me stay 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.810
 pressing until you 're fine just do 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.810
 this in the four fields 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.789
 is getting better but we need to strengthen 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.030
 more and for this I will use in mdf of three 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.940
 mm 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.220
 I liked these pieces with 2 millimeters 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.099
 less than the pieces of paper 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.610
 It is important to leave this gap for 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:19.280
 the mdf pieces fit into the 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.020
 smaller parts must be 8 millimeters 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.330
 less than paper 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.330
 then just glue and press 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:25.260
 a tip put clothespins 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:29.060
 so you do not have to hold on and 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.060
 Do not let your wife see this. 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:50.089
 and so we end this part if you 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.999
 liked where to leave anyway she is 

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:55.999
 ready to use in the next video, let's go 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:07:00.460
 put a tarp to stay more way 

00:06:55.999 --> 00:07:00.460
 Thank you for watching and see you next time.
