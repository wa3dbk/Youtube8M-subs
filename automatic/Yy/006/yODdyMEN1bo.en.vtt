the<00:02:33.640> bike<00:02:33.880> is<00:02:34.090> faster<00:02:34.570> than<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.870> plane<00:02:35.080> that's

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
the bike is faster than the plane that's

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.040 
the bike is faster than the plane that's
the<00:02:35.620> logic<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:36.070> this<00:02:36.220> game<00:02:36.489> no<00:02:36.850> Adele<00:02:37.750> go<00:02:37.900> oh

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
the logic of this game no Adele go oh

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.610 
the logic of this game no Adele go oh
crap<00:02:38.290> okay<00:02:39.600> yeah<00:02:40.600> it<00:02:40.959> does<00:02:41.140> remind<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.560> is

alright there we go guess who's gonna
fall<00:02:53.769> from<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.100> plane

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
fall from the plane

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.030 
fall from the plane

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
guess who's gonna fall from the plane

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.979 
guess who's gonna fall from the plane
guess<00:02:57.040> who<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.400> won<00:02:58.030> with<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.209> pistol<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.780> have

so<00:03:05.140> yeah<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.590> how<00:03:05.709> you<00:03:05.769> get<00:03:05.920> in<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.130> plane

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
so yeah this is how you get in a plane

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.039 
so yeah this is how you get in a plane
I'm<00:03:06.459> inside<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.760> plane<00:03:06.970> right<00:03:07.120> now<00:03:07.269> that's

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
I'm inside a plane right now that's

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:08.720 
I'm inside a plane right now that's
pretty<00:03:08.260> cool

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
pretty cool

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.860 
pretty cool
that's<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.880> only<00:03:10.090> plane<00:03:10.269> that<00:03:10.299> takes<00:03:10.600> off<00:03:10.750> in

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
that's the only plane that takes off in

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.460 
that's the only plane that takes off in
the<00:03:10.959> whole<00:03:11.079> entire<00:03:11.200> GTA<00:03:11.769> 4<00:03:12.400> series<00:03:13.060> okay<00:03:13.660> there

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470

the whole entire GTA 4 series okay there
is<00:03:14.680> no<00:03:14.739> other<00:03:15.549> plane<00:03:16.090> that's<00:03:16.299> gonna<00:03:16.450> take<00:03:16.660> off

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
is no other plane that's gonna take off

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.310 
is no other plane that's gonna take off
like<00:03:17.650> literally<00:03:18.930> except<00:03:19.930> if<00:03:20.019> you<00:03:20.079> had<00:03:20.200> them

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
how did he is he an engineer or

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.690 
how did he is he an engineer or
something

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700

so yeah

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:11.009 
so yeah
the<00:04:03.120> planes<00:04:03.330> gonna<00:04:03.480> blow<00:04:03.660> up<00:04:03.810> obviously

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
plane that's how you got in a plane in

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.900 
plane that's how you got in a plane in
this<00:04:15.800> scheme<00:04:16.040> that's<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.340> only<00:04:16.639> plane<00:04:16.880> that

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
this scheme that's the only plane that

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.689 
this scheme that's the only plane that
you<00:04:17.209> will<00:04:17.329> be<00:04:17.449> able<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.720> get<00:04:18.109> in<00:04:18.290> and<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:19.519> whole
