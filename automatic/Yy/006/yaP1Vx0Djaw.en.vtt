00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.440
 because david geeks from the espresso and 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.220
 I'll be that little today too 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.540
 imagine a machine 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.160
 Although that is the nespresso view milk 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.620
 So each of the nms press knows what 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.500
 It's just an espresso machine 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.300
 which has an additional device then that 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.109
 milk can foam once that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.560
 Enro press that the device is easy 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.369
 firmly fixed and here you can me 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.580
 pour in 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.340
 then I come to this time also 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.530
 rheumatism or just warm 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.820
 wants milk, there are all without 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.250
 the grooves then you want easy 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.829
 foamed up to have warmed up that 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.660
 then just come in up here 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:47.100
 so networked filled in there and if 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.120
 you look purely here you have two 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.079
 fill up maxima once 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.629
 and wants to 120 millimeters for the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.160
 milk foam and the top at 240 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.230
 Milliliters is for the hot milk 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.000
 that is, if you dare have me 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.739
 did not want to be so cold for your strength 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.680
 close 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.960
 Just use the user then yes 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.900
 of course the nespresso and you can 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.920
 See who the aero press pulls here 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.930
 once put on the lid and on 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.350
 that's it when you look at it all 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.280
 Look closer as you can see it back here 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.680
 the water tank is the whole flexible 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.049
 attached so you can turn so you can 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.420
 if you want the water tank 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.380
 have left and then theirs 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.820
 presidents depending on this missed that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.460
 nice at dynatrace of course that it 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.649
 just has little time and you just 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.729
 only swell espresso or latte 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.860
 macchiato wants to have 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.729
 An optimal machine is and had 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.030
 the capsule here 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.600
 I have here the Massai is a 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:00.299
 Delicious plate coffee is easy 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:03.590
 a glass down here you can see three 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:09.210
 grad espresso ristretto and the lungau 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:12.420
 I would like to have nespresso now 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.360
 It will not be like that 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.160
 not quite as loud but I have 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.819
 Immediately my espresso I do not have to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.640
 long in the work with the pace 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:26.240
 press and watch the proof and 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.140
 so what all that much from very fast 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.390
 I already want an espresso 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:42.290
 now have frothed milk 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:44.240
 if I want the club- them and feel 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.970
 here once me one I have now 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:51.920
 just the only true I'm 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.750
 already many have a pure and that 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.150
 great in the e they can not press 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.330
 only the milk would be on or lather 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.890
 and get warm milk but 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.720
 if he pressed this button longer 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.700
 Hold things when you are ten seconds 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.770
 I hold it for a long while then I look 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.250
 I even feel cold on the pretty cool 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.240
 made 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.670
 yes, that's all 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.070
 a press cheers very nice 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.870
 device is very suitable for people who stop 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.090
 Do not wait long for the coffee in the morning 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.680
 want to wait but quickly yours 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.300
 They do not want espresso 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.880
 want to decrease traffic with them 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:34.310
 paint and then an espresso machine too 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.800
 give or great in science 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.590
 ostrich with which one but then 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.930
 must count is just rubbish so one 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.230
 Here is the container for 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.420
 capsules capsules remain over 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.310
 Scenario capsules must be disposed of 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.340
 and of course you have to get new capsule 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:57.170
 and you have one for each coffee 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.040
 That's why I 'm happy to send you a capsule 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.780
 because some try 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.570
 But if you have more coffee today 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.540
 drinks then the whole thing is also very 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.370
 quickly over and you have to 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.950
 a coffee and you have to say 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.930
 be careful if you have so much for 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.430
 it has to spend the coffee it is for 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.989
 an industrially produced coffee 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.270
 a very good coffee that you have to say 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.550
 that really kept it out like that 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.560
 you made the coffee well but he did 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.790
 costs just synonymous and produced just 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.170
 garbage so everyone has to do it for themselves 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.590
 decide if you want that 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.260
 I think the coffee tastes good 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.630
 made a coffee for tomorrow 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.120
 drink like this, I have now 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.660
 slightly increased so warm i go i 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.660
 just with it 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.720
 wonderful that was a tip of 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.260
 me at the europreis clean the 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.210
 after that relatively fast especially if 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.190
 her then again after me new 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.530
 already or by that it will be 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.410
 it can become warm down below easily 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.590
 install or not others but one 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.020
 Stock and form the after a time 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.670
 the rent that was david for the press 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.250
 Nevertheless there are questions have reported 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.930
 simply says commented video tells us 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.970
 what eva nespresso you hold yourself 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.070
 one has made itself experience but 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.430
 comments are otherwise subscribed 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.470
 us what I just remembered me 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.720
 should be a relative in the espresso 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:30.530
 fast short cable you have it 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:33.530
 That's why the socket should be 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.000
 otherwise the problem is that the 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.270
 somewhere at the top must have 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.460
 or an extension must be for the 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.460
 espresso espresso until next time
