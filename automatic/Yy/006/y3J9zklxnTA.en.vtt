00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.829
 that something turned out it seems to me that 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.079

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.310
 there is no need to bend how interesting and how 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.040
 we only need paper strips 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.509
 different lengths and widths 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:17.300
 scissors glue and felt - tip pens 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.060

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:34.090
 paper with glue its ends to get 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:38.210
 little ring like that 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.470
 banish row ring turned and now 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.979
 we glue the strips together 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:48.080
 smaller shorter but the same width still 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:50.380
 one little ring and glue it to the big 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:57.770
 the ring 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:02:01.549
 that's what we got 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.979
 and how to make a cat out of this paper 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.200

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.860

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.860
 we are sitting 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.670

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.430
 others glue in front 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.530

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.910
 out of paper and stick them to the top 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.910

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.670
 the cat's tail and the triangles have become ears 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.900

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.900
