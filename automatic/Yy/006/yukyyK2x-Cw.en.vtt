00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello I will therefore introduce you the 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.469
 new rapid fire ps4 here in 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.390
 the occurrence the led indicator model that 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.519
 you can find for sale on our 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.139
 website 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.720
 it is different from the model 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.419
 classic by the fact that installs 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.099
 suge a module of 4 leds that you 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.630
 so in the course of game of 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.839
 know exactly what mode you 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.390
 in addition you have here a small 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.430
 button installed six names that you 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.309
 will enable or disable 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.590
 modes so there use remains when 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.180
 even simple enough so you just 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.760
 simply to press the small 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.620
 bottom button here so we will activate 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.690
 the rapid fire by pressing r1 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.340
 so you see right away at the little 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.480
 she red daube that lights up so 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.490
 which tells you that you are at home 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.050
 april fire month so you can well 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.580
 course if you want that but other 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.820
 monks to press the little button 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.579
 we go here so activate the pampering and 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.260
 so we see there the doran game that comes 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.160
 to light up for cindy claude rochon 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.579
 is active 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.909
 if you want so changed so the sub 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.890
 fashion 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.710
 so that's the same principle you press 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.069
 on the little button so the wanted was 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.170
 pressed the button and you will see 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:18.499
 So debt blinking for you 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.189
 indicate on what mode you are 

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:26.399
 so there we were in mode 2 and there 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.139
 it will flash under mode 3 so here 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.969
 you still see enough 

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:32.670
 simple so if you want to switch so 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.679
 the rapid fire so to nkembo nothing more 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.719
 simple for pressing the small button 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.850
 underneath you press a d-pad at 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.469
 left and so you see the mode 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.689
 high hacking went off 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.899
 so the month of akiyo here does not require 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.100
 not to activate rapid fire since 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.229
 the option is already cumulated on the model 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.850
 which words are so after so if you 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.020
 so want to disable the mode a nothing 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.189
 simpler to press the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.170
 button to press the pad and in 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.479
 your model your fashion by the rapid 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.409
 fire it was a bear is disabled so 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.170
 the other choice is the same thing 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.120
 to support your tone underneath you 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.670
 remember the roundabout 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.160
 so it was a pretty qualitative product 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.040
 in the sense that you can in the process of 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.200
 part change very quickly mode 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.600
 and therefore allow you to be more 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.580
 responsive at the level of the different notes 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.750
 that you have here is so you are 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.060
 wish a very good part with 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.840
 this joystick and then for next 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.840
 explanatory videos
