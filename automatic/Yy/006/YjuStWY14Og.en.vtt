00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 guys, hello everyone, bread with you today 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.450
 I would like to say one thing so 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.519
 like past my video by about 12 caused 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.070
 people have wild bad court and we started 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.590
 write supposedly I stole the spligatiel but who 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.900
 watching my channel i think knows what 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.820
 video I published once a week 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.640
 that is, I have been preparing a guide all week 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.619
 remove the material I write the script and about 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 video will climb I did not know anything and 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.880
 learned only when you wrote me 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.820
 in a comment so guys sorry 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.830
 maybe to you grieve someone offended but guide 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.290
 which I have been doing for a week I 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.420
 I will lay out well, and today, guys, as you understood 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.210
 from the description we will focus on assault 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.579
 Aek 971 rifles I want to say right away 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.829
 what is the best assault rifle 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.890
 for short distances in my opinion 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.750
 since this is a quick-fire and accurate with 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.539
 small scatter and not very big 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.780
 recoil as well as the most convenient front sight in 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.090
 the game I think everyone knows that AEK-971 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.640
 This Russian machine and in a series of games 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.590
 battlefield he found not the first time and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.629
 to be precise he was present 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.640
 where battlefield bad company 2 was 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.890
 one of the most unique trunks in 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.780
 its uniqueness was that 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.119
 he had permanent damage 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.400
 also he attended battlefield 3 by 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.040
 my opinion he was there very hard 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.229
 appeals but he was very cool 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.570
 reload animation well and respectively 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.340
 in battlefield 4 where it's just perfect 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.080
 trunk for close range in my 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.140
 he is much better than the battlefield 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.579
 3 as it is easier to learn and to 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.990
 combined with low recoil and 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.090
 rate of nine hundred shots 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.280
 per minute just become a machine for 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.799
 kill someone can argue with me 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.320
 After all, the nut is not the fastest barrel 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.939
 in the assault rifle class you still have 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.700
 and with its rate of fire in 1000 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.770
 shots per minute but he's at times worse like that 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.140
 like pretty big scatter and 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.390
 dedication and yes store twenty six 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.920
 cartridges are no good at all 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.170
 let's consider as usual 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.149
 characteristics of our trunk damage 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.100
 maximum 25 is applied at a distance 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.670
 up to eight meters minimum 18 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.340
 applied at a distance of 55 meters 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.560
 recharge full is 3060 and 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.130
 seconds tactical recharge amount 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.590
 2 point three seconds but now he 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.569
 the biggest minus 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.030
 AEK-971 This is his recharge in discharge 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.780
 full recharge it is absolute 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.550
 record holder 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.130
 she is the longest in the class of ground attack 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.770
 screws and tactical reloading too 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.569
 one of the longest you are very good 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.580
 advice reload when you have left 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.800
 one two patrons is just required 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.069
 for AEK-971 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.920
 recoil horizontal to the left 0.15 recoil 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.080
 at right 0.4 and vertical return 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.600
 is 0.38 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.130
 you can even not look at the numbers when 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.500
 you imagine to this trunk you 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.980
 understand that recoil is not important here 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.200
 but the most important feature of AEK-971 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.330
 this is his wild rate of nine hundred 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.239
 shots per minute and shop which 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.489
 holds up to 30 rounds but what 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.769
 we take from the modules at sight take 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.709
 any neighbor is the best for me 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.200
 our Russian cobra sight on 1 slot we 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.750
 take you can take any in my 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.640
 the case is a green facial or alsu + 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.220
 flashlight which reduces deterioration 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.560
 accuracy of 25 percent can blind 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.660
 enemy at medium distances on 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.190
 I will advise you to put the second slot 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.320
 muzzle brake which improves 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.410
 stability reduces its muzzle 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.420
 trunk up 25 percent but at the same time 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.910
 it reduce the accuracy of automatic 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.070
 fire 30 percent on the third slot 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.230
 take the ergonomic grip or 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.150
 tilting handle ergonomic 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.250
 handle improves hip shooting 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.520
 reduces the deterioration of accuracy when shooting 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.140
 in motion by 50 percent 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.750
 and the clone handle are meant to 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.880
 improve ergonomic weapons 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.810
 and improves control improve 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.240
 stability 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.570
 improves primary returns by 33 percent 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.030
 but in principle on this and all this with 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.430
 very suitable for closed map 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.040
 on operation locked up and for modes 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.690
 domination etim demage write to 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.400
 comments what do you think about it 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.800
 trunk and on what trunk do 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.110
 the next guide whose comment will collect 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.460
 more than all likes on that table I will 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.710
 do the next guide 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.900
 and subscribe to the channel put 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.390
 Like be sure to subscribe to twitter 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.520
