00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.600
Chicken soup

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.040
Hello my friends!

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.260
today we will prepare a chicken soup

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.600
don't forget that you don't need to be sick to prepare a soup

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.600
soups are rich in nutrition value, therefore essential for us

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.040
thus , we definitely need to add them in our nutritional program

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.240
after we clean and wash the chicken and the giblets also

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.740
now we are ready to put it in our pot

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.520
we will add it whole if the quantity we want to cook is for 3,4 or 5 people

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.920
but if we want a small quantity , for example a small child

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.840
we will use a small piece from the chicken

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.860
the piece will be either one thigh or a piece from the chest

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.640
we will cut with a knife here in the middle and again in the middle

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.960
and then we add one thigh,two or a thigh and chest

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.940
it depends

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.480
we will add also the giblets in the pot

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.200
which we can chop and put in our soup , or keep for another use

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.000
put a pot with clean water at the fire and add the chicken inside

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.060
also the giblets

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.820
close the lid and let it boil

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.420
during boiling will add some ingredients which will see along the way

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.140
after 20' minutes and when our chicken took a boil

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.160
we will add the salt,the pepper and this bunch

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.700
this is a bunch from aromatic vegetables

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.880
containing carrot , leek , celery and bay leaves

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.820
you will encounter this several times because it is a tool for us ,the cooks

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.820
with this we flavor the broth and the chicken that boils inside

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.300
anyone can easily prepare this and it's good to use it regularly

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.340
as i said after 20' minutes when you see that the chicken took a boil

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.440
first skim it using a skimmer

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.560
always when you skim , take a bowl with clean water to wash the skimmer

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.260
and start again , otherwise you will add the same scum on the surface

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.640
of course later we will drain the broth , but it is good to remove what you can now

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.060
now it's time to add the bunch with the aromatic vegetables

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.460
few pepper grains

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.740
also add some salt to the water, not to cook the chicken in plain unsalted water

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.820
later we will complement the flavor during cooking

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.660
after about an hour our chicken is ready!

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.800
we must boil the chicken to a point where we can remove the flesh from it

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.240
there is a practical way to understand when it is ready

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.900
lift the chicken a little and with a cloth try to rotate the bone in the thigh

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.920
if the bone rotates as you can see , means that is boiled and ready!

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.280
and now we can remove the bones from the chicken

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.240
now take the broth where we have boiled the chicken and drain it off to a clean pot

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.020
in the case of the chicken soup to boil the chicken properly

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.180
we used liquids , as much as to cover our chicken

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.060
but when we will prepare the soup we will not use all the amount of liquids

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.100
we will add liquids depending the portions we will prepare

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.860
for example, if you want to cook 4 servings we need about 1.5 liters of liquid

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.560
and inside this amount of liquids we will add the chicken,the rice,egg and lemon as you will see later on

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.460
this way remove the bones from the chicken

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.200
you can cut these meat pieces horizontally if you want

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.500
or you can cut into small cubes to be easier when we eat the soup

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.980
especially if they are young children , it is best to cut in small pieces

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.780
put the broth to boil slowly

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.000
now it's time to do the seasoning properly

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.540
ie add salt

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.100
we will try it later of course

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.400
we will add the pepper last because we will use also white pepper

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.220
add the chicken

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.080
which we have cut to smaller pieces

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.940
to take a last boil

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.600
if accidentally we have boil the chicken a little bit more , now we will add it later so as not to scatter

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.320
but if it is a point that can boil another 15-20 minutes , you will understand this when you remove the bones

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.300
then put it to boil with rice

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.200
then add the white rice

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.100
which we have put to soaked a bit in water

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.240
to tie our soup a bit more

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.640
and we will add little olive oil

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.320
Now, if our chicken happen to be a rustic chicken

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.700
that export its own fat , probably we will not need olive oil

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.300
ours wasn't exactly a rustic chicken so we strengthened it with olive oil

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.540
and let it boil for about 15-20' minutes

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
after 20 minutes of boiling , our rice is ready

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.800
and now it's time to do the last seasoning

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.620
after i have tried it earlier the soup needs a little more salt

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.200
when we make food preparation white colored , it is optimal to use white pepper

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:31.460
not to show the black pepper grains in our sauce,egg&amp;lemon and in general in our food preparations

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.440
always add the white pepper last in our food preparation

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.540
now it's time to prepare the egg&amp;lemon to tie our soup

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.120
in a bowl beat the egg yolks (only the yolks)

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.620
and this because the egg&amp;lemon is more resistant this way and mimimizes the risk of the egg separating

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.180
but if you use egg white you will maximize the risk of the egg separating

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.300
so add lemon slowly while beat the yolks

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.140
add also little corn flour inside

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:12.020
now add slowly from the soup into the egg&amp;lemon to preheat it

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.360
now we are ready to tie the soup , stir with a ladle

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.760
and add the egg&amp;lemon slowly in the soup while stir

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
the soup is ready for the serving!

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.120
as you can see is about time for lunch

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.420
the kids will be here soon from the school

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.940
and i hope my effort won't be wasted

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.560
my children are the most stringent judges

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.740
where i work in the hotel

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:49.220
while my clients say ,chef delicious flavours, homemade cooked

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.440
many times my children somewhere in secret were telling me

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.960
this should be done like this ,or do something else

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.700
so i have to be carefull :)

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.580
bon appetit!!!
