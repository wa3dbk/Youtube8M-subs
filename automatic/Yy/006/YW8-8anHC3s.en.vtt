00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.270

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.820
 here we are going to look for what is half 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.820
 of the tapes here and I have it marked 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.200
 with the pin we are simply going to paste 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.200
 the points 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.230

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.090
 the heat of the candle or of a lighter to 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.819
 that they look good, let's move on 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.310
 sewing 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.150
 that they take all the tapes so that they do not 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.519
 they are going to let go 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.610
 here we release our pin and 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:15.080
 we continue passing sewing 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:21.020
 here we have the bun we are going to pucker 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.020
 let's move the thread to the side 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.940

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.640

 if you want to leave it like this alone you can 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:46.430
 leave the bun so the only thing they are going to 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.430
 do is get thinner tape 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.630
 you always have to seal the tips going to 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.350
 have a little silicone placed 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.350
 in the middle 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.159
