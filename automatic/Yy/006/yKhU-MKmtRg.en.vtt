00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.429
 there are videos about the new things that have happened 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.839
 I'm also short and not especially the FaceTime percent 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:19.789
 specializing says about 30 days slicks to the rest so in the stage is Heiner 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.599

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.069
 all on the Macs they did not come really horny and percent 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.969

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.600
 but just click on the whole install it means you can with 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.800
 Really everyone is talking to people on the Mac again about the Mac then 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.930
 built him something of those 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.739
 or 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.999
 you make the whole thing too far away from a function way or from AMC 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.060
 and then it just needed to be phones though 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.060
 E-mail address I do not say now just how the whole thing works 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.360
 we start over FaceTime it is down here this logo i want the money 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.130

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.400
 20 barrels from Hellas Hitzfeld also do not see 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.230
 the program is not kept simple and percent here we are 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.390
 Favorite name call list have contacts 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.690
 and the maxon of a comment the former coach simply called us 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.690
 directly to 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.230
 Zolas connects archrival 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.690
 our damper and there is already some help 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.600
 and since the trip that works really really well and around with 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.250
 other 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.380
 Georg Michl summer easy shot opportunities 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.840
 we can rotate a screen 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.820
 that will also turn on your partner with old bags last received 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.440
 now the whole thing is remembered 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.610
 if you go for it 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.540
 and pour that automatically with that I find really cool 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.070
 yes of course a microphone mute that means he will not be me anymore 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.109
 open but hear 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:13.329
 Then, of course, finish Union RWO on the fret in fullscreen moss 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.260
 that is a bit we also information to the political misery already 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.639
 Upgrading now also has to be a good thing 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.099
 and that was the authenticity Tacke, there is not much left 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.139

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.719

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.129

 Ono 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.969
 I would not say that because we have the Price with old Baas 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:51.589
 could they give us the laptop 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.450

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.450
