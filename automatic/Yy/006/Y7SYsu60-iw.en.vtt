00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.509
 very welcome to a new video 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.550
 Part 2 of our series we want today 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.570
 tackle the subject of thrust 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.469
 three points to consider 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.809
 secondly, the technique of biomechanics 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:20.670
 the force-third, the agility to 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.960
 begin with technology okay all 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.240
 important for the firepower 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.740
 of course, that her knee clever 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.380
 waved and your Ausholbewegung 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.670
 is big enough if natural 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.590
 Bottom down does not have much 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.180
 acceleration and can not 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.410
 much power transferred to the ball 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.090
 therefore, once agility in the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.129
 thigh squats and also the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.640
 Reality in the hip important to look out for 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.840
 to be able to get 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.520
 for optimal acceleration 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.980
 do you need the maximum acceleration 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.039
 sweg and for that it is crucial that you 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.600
 when kneeling completely on the knee 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.950
 Angle is that angle complete 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.170
 small otherwise you will hide 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.780
 make the acceleration of the path small and 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.699
 then the hip to rotate drove from 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.699
 There then fire 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.390
 next part is a stick if you have the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.070
 wanted to hit ball and optimal power 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.230
 transferred from your body to the ball 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.760
 Of course, it is enormously important to want that 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.530
 The power is not just gifts 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.530
 but that we are strongly anchored here 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 since in your leg and the force 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.240
 from your swing while fixing can 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.240
 and broadcast on the ball 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.920
 why impulse transmission was so 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.050
 the stable set even more important that 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.420
 everything is stable, the belly must be firm 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.790
 be and then it comes in the end to 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.560
 an art whip beating to now 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.600
 to produce this bang 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.070
 we build in our entire body 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.200
 bow tension on that is now 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.759
 work only alone but it works 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.310
 or complete body together and indeed 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.080
 about the diagonal that is mostly 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.650
 when we shoot is our left arm 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.930
 ahead 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.210
 At first we are slightly over the ball 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.090
 have the arc tension in the direction 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.910
 and then with the ball 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.170
 we transmit the impulse and 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.430
 Bring the arc voltage to the other one 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.040
 direction that whip now 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.259
 strike must come to the ball then 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.330
 to meet optimally and one 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.509
 the real pounds rauszuhauen important the 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.630
 bow span from front to back and 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:18.140
 It is only with optimal power from the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.140
 belly and fixation in the leg 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.280
 to actually use your power now too 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.620
 Of course, training is enormously important 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.060
 to train the stomach so stable 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.260
 we already have the technology to hold 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.430
 have explained and all the best 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.470
 functionally leave 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.420
 that is working on the diagonal 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.790
 and we start with exercise number 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.070
 One thing makes the construction tighten the left one 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.470
 leg ran right arm goes outside 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.880
 on the left ankle and you see 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.140
 again we build this again 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.970
 German movement 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.860
 About the billowing tension of the belly of the 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.910
 firm bend works with the load 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.930
 high and best off and drove both 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.930
 shoulders off 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.280
 In any case, ten to 15 pieces and 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.610
 also the other side at least two 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.610
 sentences 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.640
 Ok Exercise 2 will get functional again 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.950
 It starts in the forearm base 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.770
 long levered the track forward 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.410
 so completely up with the exhalation 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.200
 we run diagonal ski so it is sick 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.870
 or other gorgeous to drink elbe 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.400
 and then make one breath very long 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.540
 keep stability 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.870
 exhale the belly station be fixed 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.430
 diagonal edge lead inhale opens 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.020
 always tries to put the basin on dishes 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.090
 let it go in the upper position 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.980
 Of course not trained again 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.860
 Huge in Rome and we also have to 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.830
 again about the diagonal our high 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.740
 can build tension best 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.940
 again ten to fifteen stupid or something 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.940
 much like go release 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.630
 ok last exercise again for strengthening 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.280
 the thigh nepal and on the 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.610
 Bollards transfer the power to 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.110
 can 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.270
 We start in a default step and 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.190
 At the same time move the poor 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.750
 to work on the diagonal again 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.750
 that is, if the left foot 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.560
 front is the right arm with the front yes 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.990
 and then with the exhalation, that's it 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.450
 pretending we pull up again 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.430
 back to a dynamic Hofstetten 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.480
 the team is very important to her 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:39.170
 The knee is stable with running and 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:42.440
 always take the names with you, too 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:46.300
 15 boys three sentences or like too 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.010
 more existed who needs it harder 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:54.010
 start with a small jump 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:56.120
 finish with off 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.510
 and then just becomes maximum power 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:04.660
 jump and the works over again 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.660
 the municipal smoking firm side
