00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.230
 Hey guys 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.279
 today is showing that it is a 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.130
 newly released cites skyline a great 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.029
 game for anyone who is a sin style fan 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.249
 city 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.390
 in it you will create and administer and give 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.919
 a city 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.749
 good as the title of the video already calls 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.899
 proto tutorial on how to create these 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:35.219
 road exits and exits 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.770
 I'll be showing if I'm already in the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.109
 start for those who are having difficulty in 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.750
 find it not b 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:47.149
 Meghan garish joy and to vote and 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.149
 doing this one here to show 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.649
 how is the process to build then 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.649
 that's right 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.890
 Good people, so here's the highway that 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.560
 the first thing you'll need 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.930
 this is what would be a ray and income that is 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.800
 the exit of the motorway 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.660
 so let's fight yes I'm using 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.960
 that this way of future to try 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:24.020
 make a little bit more cute 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.880
 be auto- roads the question but also 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.960
 you want to make gestures do not 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.120
 problem 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.720
 the first exit is normal you will see 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.390
 that she does not have van remembando also that 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.200
 the imperfect was invented to see that 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.170
 you want 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.540
 good now on this side here to go there 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.380
 where what to do with a ramp 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.560
 so let's click here it 's a series d 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.150
 I'll be squeezing the fish until the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.090
 moment with tightness did not dieting 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.900
 He raises the road then gives a 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:00.110
 I had it up and here we go 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.360
 try to take it easy from here because 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.259
 sometimes it turns red and sometimes 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.979
 that 's one thing I had one 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.929
 little problem until he pillar there 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.789
 note well the pillar's in the middle of 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.890
 road when what there are in 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.340
 up some road will not work 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:25.100
 so now the score is perfect year to 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:29.180
 pa help to them the law that we 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.530
 descending and beauty exit to the city 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.080
 where time 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.860
 now we are going to leave the city to 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.260
 motorways 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.180
 the process is almost the same as the team 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.250
 I'll leave it to call this nothing here. 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.250
 last is the staff that as technician 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.160
 So I said the pillars are better. 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.570
 you make the first exit to him and 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.660
 then see where you can go 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.960
 leave the hotel 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.140
 No one is free direct there I 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.940
 I got to call the city, even if I got a 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:09.390
 simple I hope now after 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:18.510
 explain that he had already been able to 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:27.209
 something like this can change the correct mode 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:35.209
 here then okay let's see this bridge 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:35.209
 in trying to remake not right not 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.680
 good is not going on here now given 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.170
 I was almost giving up 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.070
 It did not look pretty strange as 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.870
 the crazy crowd here but beauty is 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:13.470
 running not from really going 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.470
 work to get out of here is to be 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.370
 done right, now we meet people 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.830
 I'm leaving the industrial district . 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.180
 It's even one of the shows tips 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.090
 for you always call the district 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:39.160
 on the highway because 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:45.030
 a source of great walking to do 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.030
 a corner just for less signal has 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.940
 done so it's staff is full of out 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.250
 Let's see who this person is. 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.360
 the first used sail to enter the 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:00.960
 City 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:03.900
 painting the town O young here 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.530
 the criminal left and did the 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:14.130
 our wildest imprint with truck 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:17.510
 filed a fire will come out a 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.510
 tractor too 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.789
 So I guess that's it, everybody too. 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.860
 You can leave here, I'm recording a 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.840
 video also here for this clean 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.569
 Can you stop him, want to make one more? 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.060
 Big game and how are you doing there? 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.669
