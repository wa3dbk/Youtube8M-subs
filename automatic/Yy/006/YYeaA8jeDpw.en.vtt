safer walls we've improved really helps

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.189 
safer walls we've improved really helps
dissipate<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.939> energy<00:00:29.970> when<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> cars<00:00:30.869> hit

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
dissipate the energy when the cars hit

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.709 
dissipate the energy when the cars hit
but<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.040> safety<00:00:32.340> they<00:00:32.969> catch<00:00:33.270> fencing
