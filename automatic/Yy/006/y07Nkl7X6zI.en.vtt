the minor scales over them so I would

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.970 
the minor scales over them so I would
take<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.460> simple<00:00:24.240> phrase<00:00:24.630> from<00:00:25.170> from<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.680> scale

and move it chromatically along with the
chords<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.369> chords<00:00:29.730> move<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.240> quickly<00:00:30.539> that

chords the chords move so quickly that

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.340 
chords the chords move so quickly that
you<00:00:31.050> don't<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> lot<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.830> time<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:34.079> play

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
you don't have a lot of time to to play

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
then to F R to E flat then to D so I'll

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.579

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
just ran through those kind of quickly

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.710 
just ran through those kind of quickly
and<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.159> lands<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.759> the<00:01:05.880> D<00:01:06.030> minor<00:01:06.270> seven

major scale on any of that you know and
that's<00:01:40.289> just<00:01:40.500> something<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.920> become

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that's just something you become

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.550 
that's just something you become
familiar<00:01:41.429> with<00:01:41.789> your<00:01:42.600> different<00:01:42.960> scales<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
familiar with your different scales and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.190 
familiar with your different scales and
where<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.310> play<00:01:44.580> them<00:01:44.819> the<00:01:45.330> whole<00:01:45.569> idea<00:01:46.049> and

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
where you play them the whole idea and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.740 
where you play them the whole idea and
the<00:01:46.259> whole<00:01:46.409> concept<00:01:46.979> again<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.670> my<00:01:48.240> mind<00:01:48.270> is

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the whole concept again in my mind is

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.429 
the whole concept again in my mind is
that<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:50.220> learn<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.759> play<00:01:51.000> through<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.780> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
that we we learn to play through in and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.010 
that we we learn to play through in and
through<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.920> chords<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.299> song<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.810> along

through the chords in the song and along

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.590 
through the chords in the song and along
with<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.469> melody<00:01:55.680> line<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.420> then<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:57.509> you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
with the melody line and then if you

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.060 
with the melody line and then if you
want<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.840> go<00:01:57.930> outside<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.619> little<00:01:58.770> bit<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
want to go outside it a little bit you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.420
