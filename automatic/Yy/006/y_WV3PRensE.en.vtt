00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:06.167
 Hello, everyone! 

00:00:06.267 --> 00:00:12.567
 Today we are going to discuss with you a German 6th-order fighter Bf 109F "Friedrich" 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.400
 This aircraft is more advanced than the 5th-order Bf 109E 

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:33.833
 Even with the inventory configuration, Friedrich is much above its predecessor. 

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:39.933
 Its excellent high-altitude performance has become even better, and his rate of climb has also increased dramatically. 

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:44.200
 109F did not have a strong firepower at the beginning 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.433
 The only non-stock weapon is a 15 mm cannon, which is a continuation of the 109E. 

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:55.600
 However, if you develop a three-door 20 mm automatic gun, the durability is greatly improved. 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.467
 And the rate of fire is faster and more destructive 

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:02.267
 However, stronger firepower will reduce its mobility characteristics. 

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:05.500
 This is because the biplane gun became an off-machine weapon. 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.000
 Unlike the 109E, it is installed inside the wing. 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.733
 As a result, the top-level configuration of Friedrich is half a second slower than the top-level configuration of the predecessor. 

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:19.133
 The above is the difference between the two aircraft. 

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:24.167
 Now let's compare the 109F with the other 6th-order fighters. 

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:28.267
 Durability is simple, no other body can be studied 

00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:31.267
 However, Friedrich still has enough blood 

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:36.900
 Only three fighters - two American fighters and the Focke-Wulf A-5 - exceed 109F in durability 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.667
 Regardless of the configuration, the 109F has the best performance at high altitude. 

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:46.600
 Even American fighters are hard to match, let alone airplanes from other countries. 

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:50.067
 Firepower is another matter 

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:56.367
 Players can choose between two different weapons, each of which will greatly affect the speed of Friedrich. 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.100
 The first option is a machine gun with a 15 mm cannon 

00:02:01.267 --> 00:02:06.600
 When driving in this configuration, the 109F is also greatly improved in speed based on excellent high-altitude performance. 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.267
 This allows Friedrich to compete with P-51A and Yak-1M 

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:17.633
 However, players must cover enemy aircraft and fire at very close distances. 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.633
 The second option is the exact opposite 

00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:28.233
 Three 20 mm fast-fire guns give Friedrich the comminuted firepower of Fw.190A 

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:33.533
 However, in this configuration, the speed characteristics will be greatly reduced. 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.767
 Choosing those weapons does not have a big impact on mobility. 

00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:43.400
 In both configurations, Friedrich's maneuverability is slightly stronger than the A-5 and American fighters. 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.067
 But the second time with the Japanese and Soviet fighters 

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.300
 Contrast to this point, let's fight! 

00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:56.500
 If it is in the first place of the list, taking into account all the characteristics of the aircraft 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.267
 The best tactic is to adopt an "eagle style" 

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:02.600
 Players should climb to the optimum height 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.333
 Then fly over the battle zone to find the most vulnerable enemy aircraft 

00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:15.800
 Never try aggressive maneuvers because it loses all speed advantage 

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:21.600
 The only exception is the heavy fighter, you can fight against it at high altitude. 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.933
 The list of priority targets depends on the role of 109F in the battle. 

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:29.900
 You should try to shoot down the high-altitude opponent first. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.767
 Then there is a higher speed enemy plane 

00:03:32.867 --> 00:03:38.000
 Mobile but slow aircraft should be placed at the end of the priority list 

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:43.767
 Boom-zoom tactics are the best choice for Friedrich as long as they don't stay at low altitude for a long time. 

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:48.400
 Or use your own speed advantage to get rid of enemy groups 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.933
 Either return to the optimal height immediately 

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:56.700
 Next is advice on how to fight heavy fighters and attack aircraft. 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.700
 Although Friedrich has powerful weapons, it is still necessary to avoid a frontal attack. 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.567
 Some enemy aircraft may be equipped with very large caliber guns. 

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:10.333
 These cannons not only hit your engine, but also destroy it. 

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:14.533
 Sometimes you may also be at the bottom of the list 

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:19.167
 But even then, Friedrich can still prove who is the master of the sky 

00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:23.467
 Should be close to allies and avoid flying to very high altitudes 

00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:25.633
 Friedrich is a high-altitude aircraft 

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:30.000
 But there will be many other higher-order aircraft in the battle. 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.900
 But the tactics remain roughly the same 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.167
 Always avoid frontal attacks! 

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:38.300
 Let's summarize it: 

00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:44.133
 Messerschmitt 109 series aircraft vary widely 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.200
 Each aircraft has its own unique characteristics and behavior 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.900
 The same is true for Bf 109F 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.833
 Perhaps, some players will initially think that this aircraft is a transitional aircraft. 

00:04:53.933 --> 00:04:59.067
 But good pilots will realize later that the 109F is a versatile machine. 

00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:04.067
 You just have to choose the weapon setting that best suits your flight style. 

00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:05.567
 Try and experiment 

00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:08.300
 Friedrich will help you
