00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
in this video we are going to get like

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.020 
in this video we are going to get like
helping<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:10.520> understand<00:00:11.520> the<00:00:11.730> wiring

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
helping you understand the wiring

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.010 
helping you understand the wiring
diagram<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.260> working<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.770> this

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
diagram and the working of this

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.440 
diagram and the working of this
real-time<00:00:16.020> t60<00:00:16.890> biometric<00:00:17.550> time<00:00:18.000> again<00:00:18.300> this

real-time t60 biometric time again this

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.810 
real-time t60 biometric time again this
machine<00:00:18.750> with<00:00:18.900> access<00:00:19.230> control<00:00:19.520> this<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
machine with access control this is the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.580 
machine with access control this is the
attentional<00:00:21.330> access<00:00:21.630> control<00:00:21.930> device<00:00:22.259> this

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
attentional access control device this

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.109 
attentional access control device this
is<00:00:22.649> the<00:00:22.770> electromagnetic<00:00:23.310> log<00:00:23.700> and<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.000> is

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
is the electromagnetic log and this is

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.310 
is the electromagnetic log and this is
the<00:00:24.270> exit<00:00:24.660> push<00:00:24.840> button<00:00:26.360> all<00:00:27.360> three<00:00:28.079> things

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the exit push button all three things

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.620 
the exit push button all three things
are<00:00:28.470> being<00:00:28.919> used<00:00:29.040> together<00:00:29.399> then<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
are being used together then the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.770 
are being used together then the
employee<00:00:30.960> will<00:00:31.200> come<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.649> punch<00:00:31.860> his<00:00:32.040> finger

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
employee will come and punch his finger

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.319 
employee will come and punch his finger
this<00:00:33.780> lock<00:00:34.050> should<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:35.040> open<00:00:35.399> right<00:00:35.640> now<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.210> is

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
this lock should be open right now it is

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.000 
this lock should be open right now it is
not<00:00:38.330> and<00:00:39.330> the<00:00:39.570> example<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.260> am<00:00:40.320> employed<00:00:40.740> I<00:00:40.920> have

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
not and the example I am employed I have

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.460 
not and the example I am employed I have
adjusted<00:00:41.160> my<00:00:41.370> finger<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:41.970> machine<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:43.020> I

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
adjusted my finger on this machine and I

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.730 
adjusted my finger on this machine and I
am<00:00:43.530> punching<00:00:44.130> my<00:00:44.430> finger<00:00:44.840> now<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.590> is

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
am punching my finger now this is

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.530 
am punching my finger now this is
working

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.490 

again<00:00:50.070> there<00:00:51.070> is<00:00:51.190> a<00:00:51.220> little<00:00:51.550> light<00:00:51.760> over<00:00:51.970> there

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
again there is a little light over there

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.040 
again there is a little light over there
it<00:00:53.500> is<00:00:53.620> live<00:00:54.040> now<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.940> it<00:00:55.210> is<00:00:55.239> it<00:00:55.540> will<00:00:55.660> get<00:00:55.809> fun

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
it is live now and it is it will get fun

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.410 
it is live now and it is it will get fun
now<00:00:56.500> see<00:00:56.710> it<00:00:56.829> is<00:00:56.980> on<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:59.260> is<00:00:59.290> not<00:00:59.650> working<00:01:00.390> well

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
now see it is on it is not working well

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.399 
now see it is on it is not working well
pass<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.840> finger<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.760> is<00:01:03.820> on<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.690> light<00:01:05.229> is

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
pass the finger this is on the light is

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.899 
pass the finger this is on the light is
off<00:01:05.680> now<00:01:06.540> so

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.149 

when<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.540> log<00:01:10.720> will<00:01:10.900> release<00:01:11.200> anybody<00:01:11.799> can

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
when the log will release anybody can

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.200 
when the log will release anybody can
move<00:01:12.340> out<00:01:13.020> move<00:01:14.020> in<00:01:14.229> or<00:01:14.590> move<00:01:14.650> out<00:01:14.950> on<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.030> door

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
move out move in or move out on the door

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.950 
move out move in or move out on the door
and<00:01:16.930> when<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:19.150> is<00:01:19.509> the<00:01:19.600> active<00:01:19.840> push

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
and when the this is the active push

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.310 
and when the this is the active push
button<00:01:20.320> somebody<00:01:21.220> wants<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.549> come<00:01:21.820> out<00:01:21.909> of<00:01:21.970> the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
button somebody wants to come out of the

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.029
