00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:09.059
 the Bolivian bacupari known as the 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.950
 shot is an exotic fruit introduced 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.219
 recently in brazil 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.590
 relative of the native bacupari mirim 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.130
 it has a potential for cultivation 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.199
 commercial in santa catarina in the interior 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.140
 the municipality of camboriu for example 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.230
 Five-year plants are 5 to 6 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.840
 meters in height and diameter of 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.469
 four to five meters in conical shape 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.500
 with perennial leaves the fruits mature 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.600
 January and February one month after the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.440
 Bolivian bacupari grown in the state 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.430
 São Paulo and there are many advantages of this 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.829
 species in relation to the native bacupari 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.620
 larger fruit size average weight in 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.770
 two crops of three to four times greater 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.910
 than that of the native bacupari 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.460
 high pulp taste excellent and the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.860
 Bolivian bacupari is also less 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.080
 attacked by the fruit fly 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.689
 main pest of the coast 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.030
 this fruit multiplies by seeds 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.090
 with start of production in the fourth 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.650
 fifth year after transplantation 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.990
 we are doing a test of 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.810
 vegetative multiplication that would be the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.420
 kia and why it is causing hormones and 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.710
 and we have observed that the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.560
 main form of 80 around 80% of the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.360
 seed germination because it will put 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.240
 because we have not gotten in the three years 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.729
 practically zero because it is around 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.310
 5% melting silva in the literature that is 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.299
 to this plant basically with the following 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.049
 10 percent by and highlights a good 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.270
 index 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.100
 so we're giving more is the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.799
 multiplication today we intend to 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.750
 now it is already valid in the state in 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.640
 various coastal regions and also 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.340
 preliminary information that we have 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.969
 cold here it is not very tolerant 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.360
 cold 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.460
 then we will plant on the coast the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.399
 lower part but up to 500 meters 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.509
 our April idea to show the other 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.849
 shell thickness 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.290
 max as the bank looks pretty simple 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.769
 delivery 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.769
 it is not open it here 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.079
 the shell she has from 2 to 13 years old people 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.760
 got 52 6 million people 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:31.799
 while ours has 10 907 in the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.530
 property of Machiavellian valmir in 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:38.010
 camboriú to epagri has identified a 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.109
 fruitful species that existed in its 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.560
 property that had been planted by the 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:46.590
 previous owner a bolivian 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.950
 are 15 plants that have been accompanied 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.370
 annually by the research of epagri 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.010
 multiplication tests were done 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:00.180
 vegetative and seed production 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.760
 of the 2007/2008 2008 and 2009 crops did not 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.090
 were very encouraging but in the last 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.540
 harvest was obtained the highest production 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.709
 it is estimated that 2,000 to 3,000 fruits per 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.090
 plant 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:19.199
 this equates to a productivity of 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:22.139
 12,580 to 18 thousand 870 kilograms per hectare 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:26.430
 the fruit has to be the more 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:30.739
 sweeter and tastier orange 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.239
 initially is a green fruit in a 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.459
 small small né 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.459
 and this is the ripe fruit 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.940
 Can you make natura ice cream and 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.049
 You say the lady luiza your wife. 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:49.799
 did what made a liquor that stays very 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:53.989
 tasty liqueur to find a Czech occupation 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.989
 in the neighborhood kill and a bolivian
