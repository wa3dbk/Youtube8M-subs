lock up and I can say that they do log
of<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.440> bit<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.960> actually<00:01:03.960> made<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> lock-up

go away or go kind of a way by just
applying<00:01:09.450> my<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.170> new<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.240> was<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.570> first

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
applying my so new so that was the first

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.999 
applying my so new so that was the first
sold<00:01:13.020> 50<00:01:14.240> 4.96<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.780> will<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.320> three<00:01:16.740> souls

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
sold 50 4.96 and I will have three souls

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.280 
sold 50 4.96 and I will have three souls
in<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.340> video<00:01:17.790> normally<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.689> don't<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:19.080> mean<00:01:19.259> a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
in this video normally I don't do mean a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.890 
in this video normally I don't do mean a
three<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.369> thought<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.180> an<00:01:21.479> average<00:01:21.780> of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
three but I thought that an average of

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.980 
three but I thought that an average of
five<00:01:22.140> would<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.530> too<00:01:22.920> long<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:24.360> festival<00:01:24.750> will

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
five would be too long the festival will

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.170 
five would be too long the festival will
also<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.740> slow<00:01:25.950> soul<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.520> these<00:01:26.729> three

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
also be the slow soul of these three

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.880 
also be the slow soul of these three
souls<00:01:29.240> right<00:01:30.240> now<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.720> did<00:01:31.110> not<00:01:31.290> pay<00:01:31.590> too<00:01:31.650> much

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
souls right now I did not pay too much

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.569 
souls right now I did not pay too much
attention<00:01:32.250> into<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.920> adjusting<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.280> this

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
attention into the adjusting in this

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.969 
attention into the adjusting in this
megaman<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.720> tension<00:01:37.200> might<00:01:37.500> actually

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
megaman so the tension might actually

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.020 
megaman so the tension might actually
not<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.790> good<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:40.110> megamix<00:01:40.470> bed<00:01:41.030> it's

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
not be that good of the megamix bed it's

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.870 
not be that good of the megamix bed it's
good<00:01:42.299> enough<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.600> me<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.079> mean<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:44.189> do<00:01:44.640> these

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
good enough for me I mean I can do these

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.030 
good enough for me I mean I can do these
souls<00:01:45.149> with<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.780> badly<00:01:46.200> tension<00:01:46.619> mega<00:01:46.860> means

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040

see<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.320> i<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.649> find<00:01:55.680> some<00:01:56.159> much<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.700> i<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.229> get

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
see if i can find some much so i can get

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.580

the<00:01:58.619> lockups<00:01:59.189> away<00:01:59.729> that<00:02:00.689> would<00:02:00.899> be<00:02:01.110> very<00:02:01.140> very

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the lockups away that would be very very

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.370 
the lockups away that would be very very
cool<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:03.030> scrambles<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.630> there's<00:02:03.869> videos

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
cool the scrambles and there's videos

practice<00:02:06.630> with<00:02:06.810> hundred<00:02:07.170> rumbles<00:02:07.500> because<00:02:07.799> I

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
practice with hundred rumbles because I

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.520 
practice with hundred rumbles because I

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
don't like to use the computer scrambles

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.840 
don't like to use the computer scrambles
for<00:02:10.560> several<00:02:11.039> reasons<00:02:11.250> first<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.239> I

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
for several reasons first of all I

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.680 
for several reasons first of all I
totally<00:02:13.720> get<00:02:14.170> out<00:02:14.320> of<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.620> rhythm<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:16.240> feel

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
totally get out of the rhythm so I feel

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.040 
totally get out of the rhythm so I feel
like<00:02:16.870> it's<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.200> waste<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.500> time<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.190> do<00:02:18.490> it<00:02:18.670> I

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
like it's a waste of time to do it I

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.920 
like it's a waste of time to do it I
also<00:02:20.050> do<00:02:20.620> think<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.070> oh<00:02:21.520> this<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.270> teak<00:02:22.660> perm

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
also do think that oh this is teak perm

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.450 
also do think that oh this is teak perm
if<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.530> yet<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.720> also<00:02:25.720> think<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.460> when

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
if you yet I also think that you when

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.920 
if you yet I also think that you when
you<00:02:27.550> do<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.970> computer<00:02:28.360> scramblers<00:02:28.780> the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
you do the computer scramblers the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.930 
you do the computer scramblers the
scrambles<00:02:29.380> gets<00:02:29.590> kind<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.220> too<00:02:30.550> easy

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
scrambles gets kind of too easy

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.890 
scrambles gets kind of too easy
sometimes<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.940> can<00:02:34.090> also<00:02:34.240> happen<00:02:34.420> with

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
sometimes that can also happen with

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.930 
sometimes that can also happen with
hands<00:02:35.140> grumbles<00:02:35.590> but<00:02:35.800> if<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.040> see<00:02:36.370> some<00:02:36.580> obvious

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
hands grumbles but if I see some obvious

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.060 
hands grumbles but if I see some obvious
bugs<00:02:37.210> all<00:02:37.450> of<00:02:37.600> course<00:02:37.900> scramble<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.620> bit<00:02:38.680> more

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
bugs all of course scramble a bit more

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.980 
bugs all of course scramble a bit more
to<00:02:39.370> just<00:02:39.610> get<00:02:39.790> rid<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.000> those<00:02:40.270> blocks<00:02:40.720> because

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
to just get rid of those blocks because

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.660 
to just get rid of those blocks because
I<00:02:41.200> don't<00:02:41.380> like<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.740> have<00:02:42.040> blocks<00:02:42.340> everywhere

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
I don't like to have blocks everywhere

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.810 
I don't like to have blocks everywhere
when<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.180> start<00:02:43.510> us<00:02:43.600> all<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:45.070> is<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.670> reason

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
when I start us all that is the reason

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.750 
when I start us all that is the reason
why<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.240> do<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:47.110> as<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:48.100> can<00:02:48.220> see<00:02:48.370> in<00:02:48.430> this<00:02:48.550> all

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
why I do that as you can see in this all

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.520 
why I do that as you can see in this all
actually<00:02:49.120> started<00:02:49.600> with<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.900> mega<00:02:50.110> mega<00:02:50.290> on

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
actually started with the mega mega on

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.370 
actually started with the mega mega on
the<00:02:50.650> table<00:02:51.100> which<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.610> did<00:02:52.480> some<00:02:52.630> turns<00:02:52.900> before

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
the table which I did some turns before

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.010 
the table which I did some turns before
I<00:02:53.650> lift<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.400> up<00:02:54.550> which<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:55.180> normally<00:02:55.240> don't<00:02:55.690> do

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
I lift it up which I normally don't do

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.070 
I lift it up which I normally don't do
but<00:02:56.890> it<00:02:57.580> totally<00:02:57.940> worked<00:02:58.240> out<00:02:58.450> for<00:02:58.690> this<00:02:58.810> old

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
but it totally worked out for this old

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.820 
but it totally worked out for this old
as<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.220> will<00:03:01.120> notice<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:02.800> sub-50<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:05.530> hole

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
as you will notice it sub-50 this hole

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.770 
as you will notice it sub-50 this hole
is<00:03:06.100> up<00:03:06.310> 50<00:03:07.860> actually<00:03:08.860> recorded<00:03:09.640> these<00:03:09.850> Souls
