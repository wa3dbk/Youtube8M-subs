00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.940
 to cut from the brick dough sheets 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.830

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.170
 brick dough sheets first horizontal and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.660

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.579
 smoked ham in the oven 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.960
 Allow about 20 minutes to make them beautiful 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.270
 to get crispy 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.170
 the ham is ideal as a garnish on the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.460
 mash potato 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.460
 now we can start with the vegetables 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.760
 while the potatoes are the parsnips and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.059
 boil the sweet potatoes with garlic 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.469
 we make the pea puree 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.199
 stew the peas together with one 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.979
 chopped onion very briefly in the help of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.680

 spices with nutmeg pepper and salt 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.630
 Finally, we also puree the sweet 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.340
 potatoes and we season them 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.530
 with pepper and salt 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.090
 our 3 types of mash are ready now 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.920

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.340
 superficially thawed and pat dry 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.690

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.820

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.320

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.320
 continue cooking on a low heat 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.160
 to keep them warm, we wrap them 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.690
 afterwards in aluminum foil 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.520

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:08.180
 scrape off the roasting remains 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.920
