Washington Redskins it probably really
hurt<00:00:12.210> him<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.450> lot<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.809> year<00:00:12.870> considering

greg<00:00:19.350> robinson<00:00:19.710> go<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:21.119> rams<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.630> could

greg robinson go to the rams that could

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.500 
greg robinson go to the rams that could
have<00:00:21.840> gone<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.590> washington<00:00:23.010> redskins

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
have gone to the washington redskins

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.790 
have gone to the washington redskins
instead<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.689> did<00:00:24.840> not<00:00:24.960> happen<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.380> was<00:00:25.560> not

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
instead that did not happen that was not

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.429 
instead that did not happen that was not
the<00:00:25.980> case<00:00:26.330> but<00:00:27.330> overall<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.990> Washington

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
the case but overall the Washington

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.810 
the case but overall the Washington
Redskins<00:00:28.560> last<00:00:29.490> season<00:00:29.939> were<00:00:30.060> 313<00:00:31.040> rg3<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.430> 10

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
Redskins last season were 313 rg3 and 10

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.170 
Redskins last season were 313 rg3 and 10
that's<00:00:33.300> what<00:00:33.570> he<00:00:33.660> finished<00:00:33.989> as<00:00:34.550> theory<00:00:35.550> they

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that's what he finished as theory they

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.630 
that's what he finished as theory they
fired<00:00:36.899> Mike<00:00:37.260> Shanahan<00:00:37.710> good<00:00:37.980> move<00:00:38.160> there<00:00:38.399> he

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
fired Mike Shanahan good move there he

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.750 
fired Mike Shanahan good move there he
never<00:00:38.850> was<00:00:39.090> really<00:00:39.360> liked<00:00:39.930> rg3<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.190> begin<00:00:41.579> with

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
never was really liked rg3 to begin with

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.400 
never was really liked rg3 to begin with
so<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.450> probably<00:00:42.629> better<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.989> bring<00:00:43.230> in

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
so it's probably better to bring in

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.920 
so it's probably better to bring in
somebody<00:00:43.680> who<00:00:44.070> mean<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.940> actually<00:00:45.239> does<00:00:45.690> like

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
somebody who mean you actually does like

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.290 
somebody who mean you actually does like
rg3<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:47.489> who<00:00:47.610> they<00:00:47.730> brought<00:00:48.000> him<00:00:48.149> was

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
rg3 and in who they brought him was

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.729 
rg3 and in who they brought him was
actually<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> guy<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.870> wanted<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
actually the guy I wanted for the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.920 
actually the guy I wanted for the
Minnesota<00:00:50.100> Vikings<00:00:50.219> Jay<00:00:50.969> Gruden<00:00:51.449> they

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
Minnesota Vikings Jay Gruden they

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.540 
Minnesota Vikings Jay Gruden they
brought<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.260> Jay<00:00:52.500> Gruden<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.160> think<00:00:53.430> he's

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
brought in Jay Gruden and I think he's

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.939 
brought in Jay Gruden and I think he's
gonna<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.879> great<00:00:54.059> head<00:00:54.660> coach<00:00:54.899> there<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.230> an

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
offensive guy he's going to help out rg3

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.029 
offensive guy he's going to help out rg3
from<00:00:59.730> what<00:00:59.969> was<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> struggling<00:01:01.170> season<00:01:01.829> last

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
from what was a struggling season last

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.399 
from what was a struggling season last
year<00:01:02.219> they<00:01:03.210> decided<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.080> go<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
year they decided not to go with the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.469 
year they decided not to go with the
Kirk<00:01:04.589> Cousins<00:01:04.799> trade<00:01:05.339> I've<00:01:05.970> been<00:01:06.299> thinking

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
Kirk Cousins trade I've been thinking

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.780 
Kirk Cousins trade I've been thinking
for<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.840> long<00:01:06.900> time<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.320> go<00:01:07.470> with<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.790> but

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
for a long time to go with it but

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.580 
for a long time to go with it but
looking<00:01:09.090> back<00:01:09.119> at<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.630> that's<00:01:09.869> probably<00:01:10.380> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
looking back at it that's probably a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.910 
looking back at it that's probably a
good<00:01:10.650> move<00:01:11.040> for<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> Redskins<00:01:12.560> who<00:01:13.560> said<00:01:13.770> it's

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
good move for the Redskins who said it's

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.219 
good move for the Redskins who said it's
bad<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> good<00:01:14.850> backup<00:01:15.119> no<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
bad to have a good backup no one and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.469 
bad to have a good backup no one and
they<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.950> good<00:01:17.100> backup<00:01:17.479> although

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
they do have a good backup although

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.649 
they do have a good backup although
they've<00:01:18.689> had<00:01:18.869> Rex<00:01:19.140> Grossman<00:01:19.820> another<00:01:20.820> rg3<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
they've had Rex Grossman another rg3 the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.039 
they've had Rex Grossman another rg3 the
past<00:01:21.869> few<00:01:22.110> years<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:23.390> think<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.479> trust<00:01:24.810> her

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
past few years I think I trust her

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.010 
past few years I think I trust her
cousins<00:01:25.530> more<00:01:25.860> than<00:01:26.820> Rex<00:01:27.240> Grossman<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.869> now

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
cousins more than Rex Grossman and now

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.950 
cousins more than Rex Grossman and now
they<00:01:28.170> got<00:01:28.320> colt<00:01:28.590> mccoy<00:01:28.950> which<00:01:29.280> i<00:01:29.659> don't<00:01:30.659> know

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
they got colt mccoy which i don't know

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.039 
they got colt mccoy which i don't know
why<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.380> they<00:01:31.560> got<00:01:31.740> Colt<00:01:32.009> McCoy<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:33.930> have

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
why but they got Colt McCoy so they have

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.690 
why but they got Colt McCoy so they have
options<00:01:34.590> if<00:01:34.740> they<00:01:34.860> want<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> get<00:01:35.250> rid<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.460> Kirk

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
options if they want to get rid of Kirk

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.550 
options if they want to get rid of Kirk

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.160 
didn't have a first-round pick that's
pretty<00:02:41.860> good<00:02:42.160> now<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.240> franchise<00:02:43.750> don't<00:02:44.050> get

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
pretty good now this franchise don't get

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.760 
pretty good now this franchise don't get
me<00:02:44.290> wrong<00:02:44.440> this<00:02:45.130> draft<00:02:45.490> wasn't<00:02:45.940> spectacular

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
me wrong this draft wasn't spectacular

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.290 
me wrong this draft wasn't spectacular
but<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:48.010> second<00:02:48.490> and<00:02:48.610> third-round<00:02:48.970> picks

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
but the second and third-round picks

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.540 
but the second and third-round picks
really<00:02:50.170> made<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.560> good<00:02:50.740> draft<00:02:50.950> despite<00:02:51.250> not

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
really made it a good draft despite not

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.060 
really made it a good draft despite not
having<00:02:51.610> that<00:02:52.000> first<00:02:52.450> round<00:02:52.720> pick<00:02:52.990> I'm<00:02:53.830> not

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
having that first round pick I'm not

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.560 
having that first round pick I'm not
saying<00:02:54.280> this<00:02:54.460> is<00:02:54.610> one<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:54.970> better<00:02:55.150> drafts

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
saying this is one of the better drafts

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.440 
saying this is one of the better drafts
but<00:02:56.530> considering<00:02:57.040> what<00:02:57.070> they<00:02:57.310> had<00:02:57.550> they<00:02:58.270> did

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
but considering what they had they did

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.530 
but considering what they had they did
pretty<00:02:58.570> well<00:02:59.220> and<00:03:00.220> he<00:03:00.490> looked<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.790> next<00:03:01.090> season

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
pretty well and he looked to next season

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.010 
pretty well and he looked to next season

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
think that between the Giants and the

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.060 
think that between the Giants and the
Eagles<00:04:44.150> one<00:04:44.510> of<00:04:44.630> them<00:04:44.810> will<00:04:45.080> win<00:04:45.260> it<00:04:45.410> instead

Eagles one of them will win it instead
of<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.250> Redskins<00:04:46.820> but<00:04:47.810> nonetheless<00:04:48.020> the

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
of the Redskins but nonetheless the

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.140 
of the Redskins but nonetheless the
Redskins<00:04:48.890> should<00:04:49.100> do<00:04:49.250> well<00:04:49.460> this<00:04:49.640> year<00:04:49.700> and

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
Redskins should do well this year and

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.240 
Redskins should do well this year and
should<00:04:50.390> prove<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:50.930> they've<00:04:51.200> improved<00:04:51.860> that

Jay Gruden's a better head coach than

good move and despite not having a first
rounder<00:04:58.550> they<00:04:58.670> did<00:04:58.850> pretty<00:04:59.030> well<00:04:59.210> in<00:04:59.360> the

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
back to form but I don't think they're

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.630 
back to form but I don't think they're

NFC East champions at the end of the day

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.070 
NFC East champions at the end of the day
if<00:05:10.430> I<00:05:10.610> had<00:05:10.730> to<00:05:10.820> put<00:05:11.000> something<00:05:11.240> on<00:05:11.450> record<00:05:11.870> I

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
if I had to put something on record I

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.140 
if I had to put something on record I
probably<00:05:12.440> say<00:05:12.710> about<00:05:12.740> seven<00:05:13.280> or<00:05:13.370> eight<00:05:13.520> wins<00:05:13.820> I

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
probably say about seven or eight wins I

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.240 
probably say about seven or eight wins I
think<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:14.960> Redskins<00:05:15.350> have<00:05:15.530> what<00:05:15.740> it<00:05:15.830> takes<00:05:16.070> to

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
think the Redskins have what it takes to

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.670 
think the Redskins have what it takes to
do<00:05:16.400> that<00:05:16.810> but<00:05:17.810> at<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.080> end<00:05:18.110> of<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:18.320> day<00:05:18.500> I

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
do that but at the end of the day I

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.320 
do that but at the end of the day I
don't<00:05:19.130> think<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.460> Redskins<00:05:19.880> have<00:05:20.060> what<00:05:20.270> it

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
don't think the Redskins have what it

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.810 
don't think the Redskins have what it
takes<00:05:20.540> to<00:05:20.630> go<00:05:20.870> back<00:05:21.500> to<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.830> playoffs<00:05:22.040> as<00:05:22.460> NFC
