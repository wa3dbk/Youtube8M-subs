00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the techniques that I knew would work

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.679 
the techniques that I knew would work
because<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.790> had<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> lot<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.240> time<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.659> think

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
because I had a lot of time to think

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.740 
because I had a lot of time to think
about<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.729> about<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:51.060> know<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.210> started

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
about it and about you know I started

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.050 
about it and about you know I started
noticing<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.290> difference<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:52.950> one<00:01:53.700> day<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> was

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
noticing a difference but one day I was

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.760 
noticing a difference but one day I was
in<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.210> gym<00:01:54.450> app<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.049> know<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.409> after<00:01:55.560> we

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
in the gym app you know just after we

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.080 
in the gym app you know just after we
played<00:01:56.009> around<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.369> was<00:01:56.490> pretty<00:01:56.729> fresh<00:01:57.060> pretty

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
played around I was pretty fresh pretty

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.660 
played around I was pretty fresh pretty
warm<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.619> realized<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.280> could<00:01:59.520> do

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
warm and I realized that I could do

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.370 
warm and I realized that I could do
anything<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.420> wanted<00:02:00.600> what<00:02:00.899> I'd<00:02:00.990> done

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
anything I wanted what I'd done

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.469 
anything I wanted what I'd done
I<00:02:01.409> could<00:02:01.680> 360<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> could<00:02:02.670> come<00:02:02.850> from<00:02:02.939> outside<00:02:03.390> of

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
I could 360 I could come from outside of

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.510 
I could 360 I could come from outside of
the<00:02:03.570> paint<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.990> could<00:02:04.469> dunk<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.979> far<00:02:05.250> away

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
the paint I could dunk this far away

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.440 
the paint I could dunk this far away
from<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.850> free-throw<00:02:06.090> line

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
from the free-throw line

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.089 
from the free-throw line
never<00:02:06.630> got<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.840> free-throw<00:02:07.320> line<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:07.710> you

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
never got the free-throw line but you

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.070 
never got the free-throw line but you
know<00:02:08.160> I'm<00:02:08.250> six<00:02:08.550> foot<00:02:08.759> three<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:10.050> know

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
know I'm six foot three and you know

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.059 
know I'm six foot three and you know
there

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
there

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.559 
there
who<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.430> jump<00:02:11.459> higher<00:02:11.730> than<00:02:12.030> me<00:02:12.180> but<00:02:12.420> I've

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
who can jump higher than me but I've

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.080 
who can jump higher than me but I've
never<00:02:12.959> seen<00:02:13.409> results<00:02:13.650> like<00:02:14.159> that<00:02:14.189> before<00:02:14.579> and

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
never seen results like that before and

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.380 
never seen results like that before and
now<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:15.930> understand<00:02:16.650> what<00:02:16.829> had<00:02:16.980> happened<00:02:17.390> and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
now I understand what had happened and

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.729 
now I understand what had happened and
I'm<00:02:18.510> gonna<00:02:18.659> explain<00:02:19.049> to<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.439> little<00:02:19.620> bit

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
I'm gonna explain to you a little bit

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.309 
I'm gonna explain to you a little bit
about<00:02:19.920> how<00:02:20.219> the<00:02:20.280> program<00:02:20.760> works<00:02:21.049> see<00:02:22.049> what<00:02:22.079> I

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
about how the program works see what I

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.410 
about how the program works see what I
was<00:02:22.620> doing<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.159> what<00:02:23.219> you<00:02:23.519> may<00:02:23.700> be<00:02:23.760> doing<00:02:23.879> is

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
was doing and what you may be doing is

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.959 
was doing and what you may be doing is
you<00:02:24.989> might<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.200> training<00:02:25.650> your<00:02:25.859> butt<00:02:26.099> off<00:02:26.280> but

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:26.969 
you might be training your butt off but

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.210 
you might be training your butt off but
you<00:02:27.870> might<00:02:28.049> be<00:02:28.230> training<00:02:28.560> your<00:02:28.769> jumping

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
you might be training your jumping

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.830 
you might be training your jumping
endurance<00:02:29.670> for<00:02:30.180> instance<00:02:30.480> if<00:02:30.659> you're

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
endurance for instance if you're

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.050 
endurance for instance if you're
training<00:02:31.170> yourself<00:02:31.349> at<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.250> jumpring<00:02:32.760> level

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
training yourself at a jumpring level

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.270 
training yourself at a jumpring level
say<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.540> know<00:02:33.659> this<00:02:33.870> high<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.439> most<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.189> your

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
say you know this high and most of your

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.640 
say you know this high and most of your
training<00:02:35.609> occurs<00:02:36.030> at<00:02:36.299> this<00:02:36.480> level<00:02:37.019> you're

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
training occurs at this level you're

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.649 
training occurs at this level you're
basically<00:02:38.129> training<00:02:38.519> yourself<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.150> jump<00:02:39.510> at

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
basically training yourself to jump at

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.349 
basically training yourself to jump at
this<00:02:39.959> level<00:02:40.379> a<00:02:40.530> certain<00:02:40.709> amount<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.129> times<00:02:41.400> or

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
this level a certain amount of times or

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:43.940 
this level a certain amount of times or
in<00:02:42.540> other<00:02:42.689> words<00:02:42.930> you're<00:02:43.319> training<00:02:43.709> you're

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
in other words you're training you're

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.240 
in other words you're training you're
jumping<00:02:44.489> endurance<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:46.200> what<00:02:46.409> you<00:02:46.739> need<00:02:47.010> in

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
jumping endurance and what you need in

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.190 
jumping endurance and what you need in
order<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.519> jump<00:02:47.849> higher<00:02:48.120> than<00:02:48.150> anyone<00:02:48.750> else<00:02:48.959> or

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
order to jump higher than anyone else or

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.470 
order to jump higher than anyone else or
to<00:02:49.290> reach<00:02:49.470> your<00:02:49.769> physical<00:02:50.340> jumping<00:02:50.849> potential

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
to reach your physical jumping potential

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.619 
to reach your physical jumping potential
is<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.439> need<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:53.450> explosion<00:02:54.450> and

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
is you need to have explosion and

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.250 
is you need to have explosion and
explosions<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.159> created<00:02:56.669> in<00:02:56.790> two<00:02:57.000> ways

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
explosions and it is created in two ways

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.949 
explosions and it is created in two ways
the<00:02:58.260> combination<00:02:58.919> of<00:02:59.069> strength<00:02:59.639> and

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
the combination of strength and

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.050 
the combination of strength and
quickness<00:03:01.069> you<00:03:02.069> can<00:03:02.189> have<00:03:02.310> one<00:03:02.489> but<00:03:02.519> not<00:03:02.879> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
quickness you can have one but not the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.839 
quickness you can have one but not the
other<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.720> formula<00:03:04.409> will<00:03:04.739> not<00:03:04.769> work<00:03:05.159> but

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
other and the formula will not work but

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.229 
other and the formula will not work but
strength<00:03:06.540> plus<00:03:07.290> quickness<00:03:07.579> equals<00:03:08.579> explosion

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
strength plus quickness equals explosion

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.059 
strength plus quickness equals explosion
so<00:03:09.840> if<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.049> train<00:03:10.290> your<00:03:10.319> legs<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.799> react

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
so if you train your legs to react

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.610 
so if you train your legs to react
quickly<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.519> enter<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.930> move<00:03:13.379> their

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
quickly and enter and to move their

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.710 
quickly and enter and to move their
force<00:03:13.919> quickly<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:15.090> have<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.299> lot<00:03:15.569> of

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
force quickly and you have a lot of

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.659 
force quickly and you have a lot of
strength<00:03:16.139> then<00:03:16.799> you<00:03:16.919> have<00:03:17.069> explosion

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
strength then you have explosion

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.849 
strength then you have explosion
presence<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.629> body<00:03:18.870> builder<00:03:19.260> may<00:03:19.440> have<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.620> lot

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
presence a body builder may have a lot

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.809 
presence a body builder may have a lot
of<00:03:19.889> strength<00:03:20.459> they<00:03:20.669> may<00:03:20.879> be<00:03:20.940> able<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:22.680> know

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
of strength they may be able to you know

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.210 
of strength they may be able to you know
squat<00:03:23.819> a<00:03:23.849> thousand<00:03:24.720> pounds<00:03:25.229> but<00:03:25.889> they<00:03:26.010> have<00:03:26.099> to

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
squat a thousand pounds but they have to

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.490 
squat a thousand pounds but they have to
do<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.459> slowly<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.150> know<00:03:27.540> rise<00:03:27.810> up<00:03:28.109> and<00:03:28.290> down

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
do it slowly you know rise up and down

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.259 
do it slowly you know rise up and down
that's<00:03:28.919> not<00:03:29.220> going<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.430> create<00:03:29.669> explosion

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
that's not going to create explosion

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.300 
that's not going to create explosion
that's<00:03:30.870> not<00:03:31.169> going<00:03:31.379> to<00:03:31.470> create<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.769> vertical

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
that's not going to create a vertical

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.849 
that's not going to create a vertical
jump<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:33.750> what<00:03:33.900> our<00:03:33.989> program<00:03:34.379> does<00:03:34.409> is<00:03:34.620> it

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
jump so what our program does is it

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.039 
jump so what our program does is it
shows<00:03:35.069> you<00:03:35.310> what<00:03:36.060> training<00:03:36.419> exercise

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
shows you what training exercise

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.979 
shows you what training exercise
actually<00:03:37.500> train<00:03:38.190> your<00:03:38.220> explosion<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.419> not

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
actually train your explosion and not

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.960 
actually train your explosion and not
your<00:03:40.169> jumpring<00:03:40.530> endurance<00:03:40.979> I<00:03:41.220> really<00:03:41.819> hope

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
your jumpring endurance I really hope

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.449 
your jumpring endurance I really hope
you<00:03:42.090> understand<00:03:42.599> that<00:03:42.690> because<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:44.040> spent

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
you understand that because I spent

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.240 
you understand that because I spent
years<00:03:44.819> getting<00:03:45.150> mediocre<00:03:45.810> results<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.500> if<00:03:47.129> I

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
years getting mediocre results and if I

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.649 
years getting mediocre results and if I
would<00:03:47.400> have<00:03:47.430> been<00:03:47.609> doing<00:03:47.729> these<00:03:48.000> same<00:03:48.299> drills

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
would have been doing these same drills

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.649 
would have been doing these same drills
for<00:03:49.319> years<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.889> don't<00:03:50.849> know<00:03:50.909> what<00:03:51.090> level<00:03:51.239> I'd<00:03:51.510> be

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
for years I don't know what level I'd be

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.500 
for years I don't know what level I'd be
yet<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:51.989> now<00:03:52.889> I'm<00:03:53.069> at<00:03:53.159> a<00:03:53.190> level<00:03:53.609> where<00:03:53.819> you

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
yet and now I'm at a level where you

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
you were let's say you were a sprinter

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.590 
you were let's say you were a sprinter
and<00:04:47.350> you<00:04:47.590> ran<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.920> hundred<00:04:48.250> meter<00:04:48.550> dash<00:04:48.670> would

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
and you ran the hundred meter dash would

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.770 
and you ran the hundred meter dash would
you<00:04:49.780> train<00:04:50.140> sprinting<00:04:50.950> by<00:04:51.580> running<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.540> mile

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
you train sprinting by running the mile

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.770 
you train sprinting by running the mile
or<00:04:53.140> by<00:04:53.500> running<00:04:53.740> two<00:04:54.400> miles<00:04:54.700> no<00:04:55.390> because<00:04:55.750> that

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
or by running two miles no because that

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.660 
or by running two miles no because that
would<00:04:56.020> train<00:04:56.260> your<00:04:56.410> endurance<00:04:56.860> it's<00:04:57.460> a

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
would train your endurance it's a

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.510 
would train your endurance it's a
completely<00:04:58.540> different<00:04:59.110> type<00:04:59.590> of<00:04:59.620> muscle<00:05:00.340> and

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
completely different type of muscle and

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.310 
completely different type of muscle and
that's<00:05:01.060> not<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.600> muscle<00:05:01.930> you<00:05:02.020> want<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.230> be

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
that's not the muscle you want to be

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.680 
that's not the muscle you want to be
training<00:05:02.650> and<00:05:02.890> as<00:05:03.400> long<00:05:03.640> as<00:05:03.670> you<00:05:03.880> continue<00:05:04.660> to

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
training and as long as you continue to

training and as long as you continue to
train<00:05:05.320> your<00:05:05.650> jumping<00:05:06.070> endurance<00:05:06.640> you<00:05:07.330> are<00:05:07.450> not

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
train your jumping endurance you are not

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.170 
train your jumping endurance you are not
going<00:05:07.990> to<00:05:08.050> maximize<00:05:08.800> your<00:05:09.040> jumping<00:05:09.520> potential

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
going to maximize your jumping potential

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.840 
going to maximize your jumping potential
and<00:05:10.450> that's<00:05:11.020> what<00:05:11.200> you<00:05:11.350> need<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.680> do<00:05:11.830> so<00:05:12.640> all

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
and that's what you need to do so all

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.180 
and that's what you need to do so all
the<00:05:13.030> exercises<00:05:13.570> that<00:05:13.870> we<00:05:14.110> recommend<00:05:14.710> or<00:05:14.920> what

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
the exercises that we recommend or what

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.360 
the exercises that we recommend or what
we<00:05:15.370> call<00:05:15.660> explosion<00:05:16.660> exercises<00:05:17.590> they're<00:05:18.190> all

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
we call explosion exercises they're all

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.860 
we call explosion exercises they're all
exercises<00:05:19.090> that<00:05:19.180> are<00:05:19.270> going<00:05:19.360> to<00:05:19.420> teach<00:05:19.600> you<00:05:19.750> to

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
exercises that are going to teach you to

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.110 
exercises that are going to teach you to
push<00:05:20.110> your<00:05:20.260> potential<00:05:20.740> more<00:05:21.010> and<00:05:21.220> more<00:05:21.400> for

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
push your potential more and more for

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.400 
push your potential more and more for
instance<00:05:22.210> if<00:05:22.540> this<00:05:22.690> is<00:05:22.870> where<00:05:23.020> how<00:05:23.170> high<00:05:23.350> you

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
instance if this is where how high you

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.770 
instance if this is where how high you
can<00:05:23.710> jump<00:05:23.740> now<00:05:24.130> let's<00:05:24.520> say<00:05:24.730> it's<00:05:24.910> 18<00:05:25.450> inches

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
can jump now let's say it's 18 inches

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.350 
can jump now let's say it's 18 inches
and<00:05:26.050> if<00:05:26.950> your<00:05:27.160> training<00:05:27.460> teaches<00:05:27.970> you<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.150> jump

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
and if your training teaches you to jump

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.030 
and if your training teaches you to jump
a<00:05:28.480> little<00:05:28.630> higher<00:05:28.960> each<00:05:28.990> time<00:05:29.200> then<00:05:29.920> you're

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
a little higher each time then you're

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.380 
a little higher each time then you're
going<00:05:30.130> to<00:05:30.190> be<00:05:30.370> you're<00:05:31.180> going<00:05:31.210> to<00:05:31.330> be

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
going to be you're going to be

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.720 
going to be you're going to be
increasing<00:05:31.990> that<00:05:32.170> level<00:05:32.560> almost<00:05:33.190> each

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
increasing that level almost each

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.370 
increasing that level almost each
workout<00:05:34.150> each<00:05:34.450> week<00:05:34.750> you're<00:05:34.990> gonna<00:05:35.110> see

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
workout each week you're gonna see

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.200 
workout each week you're gonna see
slight<00:05:35.710> increases<00:05:36.280> and<00:05:36.490> that's<00:05:36.580> gonna<00:05:36.790> build

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
slight increases and that's gonna build

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.150 
slight increases and that's gonna build
up<00:05:37.420> into<00:05:37.720> a<00:05:37.750> point<00:05:38.020> where<00:05:38.650> you're<00:05:38.800> gonna<00:05:38.860> be

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
up into a point where you're gonna be

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.890 
up into a point where you're gonna be
you<00:05:39.490> know<00:05:39.610> warmed<00:05:40.030> up<00:05:40.180> or<00:05:40.450> you<00:05:40.630> know<00:05:40.720> you'll

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
just have played a game and you'll

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.730 
just have played a game and you'll
realize<00:05:43.000> now<00:05:43.510> you<00:05:43.570> can<00:05:43.930> jump<00:05:44.170> higher<00:05:44.440> than<00:05:44.470> you

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
realize now you can jump higher than you

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.720 
realize now you can jump higher than you
ever<00:05:45.040> have<00:05:45.370> been<00:05:45.490> able<00:05:45.640> to<00:05:45.910> before<00:05:47.460> so<00:05:48.460> once
