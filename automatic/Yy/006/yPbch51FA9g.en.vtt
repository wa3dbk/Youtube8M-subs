00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.480
 I'm probably gardening already 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.029
 twenty years with gardens Russia 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.150
 I met well the last three years I 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:27.740
 began to order seeds 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.259
 Russian gardens seedlings and so here we are 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.020
 make friends with them 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:35.960
 when i got a fresh directory with 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.030
 seeds became well , I got a choice only 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.570
 last year's seeds to order which 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.960
 There was a miracle tomatoes but saw in the catalog 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.359
 new series of crimson miracle that me 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.640
 very interested I decided to try 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.670
 ordered all five varieties at once 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.489
 which were offered there 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:00.440
 it turned out great 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:02.870
 unpretentious tomatoes are not afraid of any heat 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.900
 no cold because May was cold and 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.510
 Here is such a result was very 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.330
 nice enter visual example 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.760
 that tomatoes can cause everything on the branch 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.970
 one and all I never break 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.130
 green but I can say my only 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.460
 the secret is why they mature in my branch 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.400
 because I don't water them for a season with 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.189
 May month to today I watered 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.860
 your tomatoes twice a bucket 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:36.439

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.409
 keeps well this summer of course she doesn't 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.630
 kept the heat from the drought roots but in 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.020
 usually hot summer in this greenhouse is very 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.829
 hot she keeps protects the roots from the heat 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.430
 and at night the condensate hay rots gives 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:55.100
