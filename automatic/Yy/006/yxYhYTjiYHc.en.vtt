fly bass calm coming at you today with
just<00:00:09.889> a<00:00:10.010> little<00:00:10.690> tidbit<00:00:11.690> about<00:00:11.900> what<00:00:12.380> I<00:00:12.410> think

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
just a little tidbit about what I think

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.100 
just a little tidbit about what I think
is<00:00:12.980> probably<00:00:13.190> the<00:00:13.519> best<00:00:13.639> fly<00:00:14.090> that's<00:00:14.870> ever

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
is probably the best fly that's ever

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.100 
is probably the best fly that's ever
been<00:00:15.320> invented<00:00:16.029> and<00:00:17.029> I'm<00:00:17.330> talking<00:00:17.689> about<00:00:17.750> the

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
been invented and I'm talking about the

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.499 
been invented and I'm talking about the
wooly<00:00:18.320> bugger<00:00:18.619> you<00:00:18.920> know<00:00:19.279> it's<00:00:19.880> probably<00:00:20.180> the

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509 
wooly bugger you know it's probably the

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.960 
wooly bugger you know it's probably the
easiest<00:00:21.020> fly<00:00:21.650> to<00:00:21.710> tie<00:00:22.130> especially<00:00:22.669> for<00:00:22.849> those

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
easiest fly to tie especially for those

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.330 
easiest fly to tie especially for those
of<00:00:23.029> you<00:00:23.509> out<00:00:23.540> there<00:00:23.689> that<00:00:23.930> are<00:00:24.200> just<00:00:24.380> starting

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
of you out there that are just starting

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.960 
of you out there that are just starting
to<00:00:25.369> perfect<00:00:26.300> your<00:00:26.450> skills<00:00:26.869> should<00:00:27.110> we<00:00:27.259> say<00:00:27.500> it

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
to perfect your skills should we say it

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.010 
to perfect your skills should we say it
incorporates<00:00:28.970> a<00:00:29.119> lot<00:00:29.329> of<00:00:29.509> the<00:00:29.630> real<00:00:29.869> basic

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
incorporates a lot of the real basic

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.880 
incorporates a lot of the real basic
techniques<00:00:33.020> that<00:00:33.230> you're<00:00:33.380> gonna<00:00:33.530> want<00:00:33.829> to

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
techniques that you're gonna want to

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.490 
techniques that you're gonna want to
learn<00:00:34.100> as<00:00:34.340> you<00:00:34.550> start<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:35.120> tie<00:00:35.690> flies<00:00:35.929> but<00:00:36.410> it

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
learn as you start to tie flies but it

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.720 
learn as you start to tie flies but it
just<00:00:36.679> makes<00:00:37.039> starting<00:00:37.940> Thai<00:00:38.269> flying<00:00:38.890> a<00:00:39.890> lot

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
just makes starting Thai flying a lot

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.819 
just makes starting Thai flying a lot
easier<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:41.539> we're<00:00:42.140> gonna<00:00:42.230> talk<00:00:42.500> today<00:00:42.679> about

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
easier so we're gonna talk today about

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.529 
easier so we're gonna talk today about
some<00:00:43.370> different<00:00:43.730> ideas<00:00:44.120> that<00:00:44.269> you<00:00:44.390> might

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
some different ideas that you might

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:45.910 
some different ideas that you might
think<00:00:44.780> about<00:00:44.989> incorporating<00:00:45.289> into<00:00:45.829> your

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
think about incorporating into your

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.229 
think about incorporating into your
wooly<00:00:46.129> butters<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:46.670> I<00:00:46.760> would<00:00:46.910> highly

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
wooly butters and I would highly

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.000 
wooly butters and I would highly
recommend<00:00:47.269> that<00:00:47.899> you<00:00:48.170> spend<00:00:48.739> more<00:00:48.949> time

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
recommend that you spend more time

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.079 
recommend that you spend more time
experimenting<00:00:52.010> with<00:00:52.309> different<00:00:52.489> types<00:00:52.910> of

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
experimenting with different types of

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.989 
experimenting with different types of
wooly<00:00:53.300> buggers<00:00:54.219> than<00:00:55.219> trying<00:00:55.609> to<00:00:55.789> come<00:00:55.969> up

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:55.999 
wooly buggers than trying to come up

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:57.970 
wooly buggers than trying to come up
with<00:00:56.239> a<00:00:56.269> lot<00:00:56.449> of<00:00:56.480> different<00:00:57.019> offbeat<00:00:57.530> type<00:00:57.800> of

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
with a lot of different offbeat type of

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.500 
with a lot of different offbeat type of
patterns<00:00:58.339> because<00:00:58.699> if<00:00:58.850> you've<00:00:59.030> got<00:00:59.089> your

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
patterns because if you've got your

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.899 
patterns because if you've got your
different<00:01:00.440> water<00:01:00.739> columns<00:01:01.309> covered

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
arsenal covered let's talk about some of

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.859 
arsenal covered let's talk about some of
the<00:01:16.610> real<00:01:16.759> basic<00:01:17.030> ones<00:01:17.420> you<00:01:17.570> know<00:01:17.659> wooly

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
the real basic ones you know wooly

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.600 
the real basic ones you know wooly
buggers<00:01:18.290> have<00:01:18.439> been<00:01:18.590> around<00:01:18.799> for<00:01:19.040> a<00:01:19.070> long<00:01:19.219> time

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
buggers have been around for a long time

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.179 
buggers have been around for a long time
I<00:01:19.850> think<00:01:20.390> if<00:01:20.509> I<00:01:20.600> was<00:01:20.750> gonna<00:01:20.930> have<00:01:21.200> to<00:01:21.229> say<00:01:21.649> one

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
I think if I was gonna have to say one

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.219 
I think if I was gonna have to say one
fly<00:01:22.579> that<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.090> was<00:01:23.240> gonna<00:01:23.420> carry<00:01:23.719> with<00:01:23.990> me

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
fly that I was gonna carry with me

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.590 
fly that I was gonna carry with me
anywhere<00:01:25.070> in<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.340> world<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:25.939> fish<00:01:26.149> for<00:01:26.390> any

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
anywhere in the world to fish for any

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.810 
anywhere in the world to fish for any
kind<00:01:26.990> of<00:01:27.079> fish<00:01:27.320> it<00:01:27.890> would<00:01:28.070> be<00:01:28.219> a<00:01:28.250> wooly<00:01:28.490> bugger

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
kind of fish it would be a wooly bugger

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.030 
kind of fish it would be a wooly bugger
I<00:01:28.939> think<00:01:29.270> without<00:01:29.390> question<00:01:29.799> here's<00:01:30.799> some

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
I think without question here's some

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.810 
I think without question here's some
pretty<00:01:31.969> ugly<00:01:32.149> old<00:01:32.479> trout<00:01:32.899> ones<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.380> I<00:01:33.500> eye

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
pretty ugly old trout ones that I eye

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.639 
pretty ugly old trout ones that I eye
and<00:01:34.820> actually<00:01:35.810> these<00:01:35.930> would<00:01:36.079> work<00:01:36.110> for<00:01:36.380> small

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
and actually these would work for small

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.319 
and actually these would work for small
he's<00:01:36.829> doing<00:01:37.189> them<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.399> lot<00:01:37.549> of<00:01:37.579> other<00:01:37.759> types<00:01:38.090> of

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
he's doing them a lot of other types of

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.679 
he's doing them a lot of other types of
pan<00:01:38.869> fish<00:01:39.229> whatever<00:01:39.530> whatever<00:01:40.689> the

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
pan fish whatever whatever the

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.050 
pan fish whatever whatever the
difference<00:01:42.140> between<00:01:42.560> these<00:01:42.770> two<00:01:43.130> is<00:01:43.369> if<00:01:43.909> this

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
difference between these two is if this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.330 
difference between these two is if this
is<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.270> better<00:01:44.570> fly<00:01:44.899> not<00:01:45.469> just<00:01:45.770> because<00:01:46.130> it's

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
is a better fly not just because it's

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.120 
is a better fly not just because it's
really<00:01:46.640> ugly<00:01:46.789> but<00:01:47.539> most<00:01:48.289> of<00:01:48.409> them<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:48.710> I<00:01:48.740> tie

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
really ugly but most of them that I tie

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.099 
really ugly but most of them that I tie
are<00:01:49.189> very<00:01:49.640> ugly<00:01:49.820> because<00:01:50.119> I'm<00:01:50.420> not<00:01:50.600> that<00:01:50.869> great

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
are very ugly because I'm not that great

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.410 
are very ugly because I'm not that great
of<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.380> fly<00:01:51.590> tire<00:01:51.920> but<00:01:52.189> hey<00:01:52.490> who<00:01:52.759> cares<00:01:52.969> they

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
of a fly tire but hey who cares they

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.560 
of a fly tire but hey who cares they
work<00:01:54.310> this<00:01:55.310> one<00:01:55.520> is<00:01:55.729> lacking<00:01:55.969> something<00:01:56.450> it's

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
work this one is lacking something it's

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.919 
work this one is lacking something it's
lacking<00:01:56.780> flesh<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:58.369> I<00:01:58.490> think<00:01:58.759> that<00:01:59.000> one<00:01:59.840> of

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
lacking flesh and I think that one of

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.300 
lacking flesh and I think that one of
the<00:01:59.960> things<00:02:00.170> one<00:02:00.469> of<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.590> real<00:02:00.770> takeaways

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
the things one of the real takeaways

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.980 
the things one of the real takeaways
today<00:02:01.609> that<00:02:01.759> I<00:02:01.789> want<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.149> give<00:02:02.299> you<00:02:02.450> is<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.840> is

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
today that I want to give you is that is

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.690 
today that I want to give you is that is
that<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:04.159> essence<00:02:04.759> of<00:02:04.880> as<00:02:06.520> items<00:02:07.520> are

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
that the essence of as items are

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.850 
that the essence of as items are
floating<00:02:08.090> by<00:02:08.270> through<00:02:08.960> the<00:02:09.050> water<00:02:09.229> column<00:02:09.560> and

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
floating by through the water column and

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.260 
floating by through the water column and
the<00:02:09.950> fish<00:02:10.130> are<00:02:10.280> looking<00:02:10.610> at<00:02:10.759> these<00:02:10.940> things

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
the fish are looking at these things

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.710 
the fish are looking at these things
underwater<00:02:12.190> it's<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.550> it's<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.940> sparkle

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
underwater it's the it's the sparkle

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.640 
underwater it's the it's the sparkle
it's<00:02:15.320> some<00:02:15.860> sort<00:02:16.040> of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
it's some sort of

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.770 
it's some sort of
/or<00:02:17.159> luminescence<00:02:17.849> that<00:02:18.090> gives<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
/or luminescence that gives it the

/or luminescence that gives it the
lifelike<00:02:19.650> quality<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.640> many<00:02:20.819> cases<00:02:21.060> is

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
lifelike quality that in many cases is

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.030 
lifelike quality that in many cases is
gonna<00:02:21.689> make<00:02:21.870> them<00:02:22.110> take<00:02:22.409> a<00:02:22.439> look<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.860> maybe

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
gonna make them take a look and maybe

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.429 
gonna make them take a look and maybe

of<00:03:14.549> water<00:03:14.930> I've<00:03:15.930> been<00:03:16.139> experimenting<00:03:16.950> with

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
of water I've been experimenting with

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.679 
of water I've been experimenting with
different<00:03:17.519> types<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.879> crayfish<00:03:18.389> type

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:18.689 
different types of crayfish type

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.390 
different types of crayfish type
patterns<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.409> one<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.829> things<00:03:20.099> that<00:03:20.370> I

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
patterns and one of the things that I

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.330 
patterns and one of the things that I
found<00:03:20.819> is<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.419> that<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.900> can<00:03:22.109> spend<00:03:22.470> all

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
found is that is that you can spend all

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.439 
found is that is that you can spend all
day<00:03:23.810> tying<00:03:24.810> up<00:03:25.109> some<00:03:25.440> life<00:03:25.769> like<00:03:26.449> crayfish

day tying up some life like crayfish
type<00:03:27.750> patterns<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.470> these<00:03:28.889> actually<00:03:29.160> do<00:03:29.579> work

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
type patterns and these actually do work

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.379 
type patterns and these actually do work
okay<00:03:30.269> but<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:30.900> think<00:03:30.989> it's<00:03:31.319> overkill<00:03:32.930> excuse<00:03:33.930> me

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
but the fish told me otherwise and this

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.280 
but the fish told me otherwise and this
has<00:03:56.190> been<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.370> very<00:03:56.669> good<00:03:56.849> fly<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:58.139> the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
has been a very good fly in the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.140 
has been a very good fly in the
Mississippi<00:03:58.829> for<00:03:59.010> smallmouth<00:03:59.310> especially

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
Mississippi for smallmouth especially

Mississippi for smallmouth especially
and<00:04:01.049> I<00:04:01.139> would<00:04:01.290> suggest<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.739> you<00:04:01.829> might<00:04:02.099> give

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
and I would suggest that you might give

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.969 
and I would suggest that you might give
it<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.459> try<00:04:02.729> as<00:04:03.090> you're<00:04:03.389> wrapping<00:04:03.599> this<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:04.349> as

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
it a try as you're wrapping this and as

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.399 
it a try as you're wrapping this and as
what<00:04:05.549> I<00:04:05.579> do<00:04:05.699> is<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.090> wrap<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.479> marabou<00:04:06.780> on<00:04:07.109> but<00:04:07.379> I

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
what I do is I wrap the marabou on but I

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:08.839 
what I do is I wrap the marabou on but I
don't<00:04:07.530> cut<00:04:07.829> it<00:04:07.919> off<00:04:08.069> there<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.430> wrap<00:04:08.639> the

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
don't cut it off there and I wrap the

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.439 
don't cut it off there and I wrap the
stalk<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.419> the<00:04:09.449> marabou<00:04:09.840> forward<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:12.120> you

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
stalk of the marabou forward and you

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:13.819 
stalk of the marabou forward and you
actually<00:04:12.629> wind<00:04:13.049> up<00:04:13.229> with<00:04:13.440> something<00:04:13.709> that

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
actually wind up with something that

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.219 
actually wind up with something that
looks<00:04:14.010> like<00:04:14.190> this<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:15.150> instead<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:15.989> just

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
looks like this and instead of just

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.949 
looks like this and instead of just
instead<00:04:16.799> of<00:04:16.949> putting<00:04:17.190> on<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:18.419> orange<00:04:18.810> you

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
instead of putting on the the orange you

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.420 
instead of putting on the the orange you
can<00:04:18.989> just<00:04:19.380> put<00:04:19.560> on<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.680> couple<00:04:19.949> of<00:04:20.070> dumbbell

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
can just put on a couple of dumbbell

um<00:04:36.389> it<00:04:37.050> seems<00:04:37.500> like<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:38.009> marabou<00:04:38.370> tale<00:04:38.789> is

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
um it seems like the marabou tale is

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.020 
um it seems like the marabou tale is
typically<00:04:39.949> one<00:04:40.949> of<00:04:40.979> the<00:04:41.099> best<00:04:41.400> types<00:04:41.639> of<00:04:41.819> tale

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
hold its position like this and you can

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.260 
hold its position like this and you can
dart<00:05:25.530> that<00:05:25.710> thing<00:05:25.949> along<00:05:26.219> look<00:05:27.090> like<00:05:27.240> a

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
dart that thing along look like a

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.850 
dart that thing along look like a
feeding<00:05:27.690> min<00:05:27.840> or<00:05:27.960> probably<00:05:28.500> a<00:05:28.530> crayfish

movement<00:05:29.310> along<00:05:29.430> the<00:05:29.580> bottom<00:05:29.759> so<00:05:29.969> a<00:05:30.930> lot<00:05:31.349> of

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
movement along the bottom so a lot of

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.809 
movement along the bottom so a lot of
different<00:05:31.770> things<00:05:31.889> that<00:05:32.039> you<00:05:32.159> can<00:05:32.400> experiment

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:32.819 
different things that you can experiment

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:38.089 
different things that you can experiment
with<00:05:33.030> here<00:05:33.440> again<00:05:34.440> this<00:05:35.190> fly<00:05:35.759> here<00:05:36.440> is<00:05:37.440> largely

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
with here again this fly here is largely

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.370 
with here again this fly here is largely
unweighted<00:05:38.849> so<00:05:39.240> I<00:05:39.300> can<00:05:39.479> run<00:05:39.750> this<00:05:39.900> in<00:05:39.960> pretty

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
unweighted so I can run this in pretty

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.290 
unweighted so I can run this in pretty
shallow<00:05:40.620> water<00:05:41.009> I<00:05:41.280> wanted<00:05:42.000> to<00:05:42.060> put<00:05:42.180> a<00:05:42.210> little

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
shallow water I wanted to put a little

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.879 
shallow water I wanted to put a little
bit<00:05:42.389> more<00:05:42.509> weight<00:05:42.780> on<00:05:42.810> it<00:05:43.080> I'd<00:05:43.199> probably<00:05:43.229> wrap

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
bit more weight on it I'd probably wrap

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.070 
bit more weight on it I'd probably wrap
some<00:05:44.099> weight<00:05:44.279> along<00:05:44.699> the<00:05:44.940> hook<00:05:45.509> shank<00:05:45.750> and

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
some weight along the hook shank and

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.730 
some weight along the hook shank and
just<00:05:46.259> tie<00:05:46.440> it<00:05:46.500> in<00:05:46.680> with<00:05:46.710> some<00:05:46.979> LED<00:05:47.159> wrapping<00:05:47.610> I

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
just tie it in with some LED wrapping I

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.809 
just tie it in with some LED wrapping I
could<00:05:49.740> give<00:05:49.830> it<00:05:49.949> a<00:05:50.009> really<00:05:50.279> some<00:05:50.550> really<00:05:50.580> a

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:50.819 
could give it a really some really a

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:52.670 
could give it a really some really a
heavy<00:05:51.509> forward<00:05:52.080> weight<00:05:52.319> you<00:05:52.500> can<00:05:52.650> use

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
heavy forward weight you can use

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.279 
heavy forward weight you can use
dumbbell<00:05:53.219> eyes<00:05:53.419> I've<00:05:54.419> been<00:05:54.659> experimenting

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
dumbbell eyes I've been experimenting

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:01.640 
dumbbell eyes I've been experimenting
with<00:05:58.250> the<00:05:59.250> Coneheads<00:05:59.490> and<00:06:00.090> I'm<00:06:00.719> not<00:06:00.900> a<00:06:00.930> big<00:06:01.349> fan

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
with the Coneheads and I'm not a big fan

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.230 
with the Coneheads and I'm not a big fan
of<00:06:01.680> cone<00:06:01.979> heads<00:06:02.250> I've<00:06:02.400> caught<00:06:02.610> some<00:06:02.819> fish<00:06:03.000> on

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
of cone heads I've caught some fish on

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.899 
of cone heads I've caught some fish on
him<00:06:03.389> in<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:03.690> last<00:06:03.870> couple<00:06:04.080> years<00:06:04.669> some<00:06:05.669> of<00:06:05.789> you

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
him in the last couple years some of you

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:07.159 
him in the last couple years some of you
can<00:06:06.060> write<00:06:06.210> me<00:06:06.360> and<00:06:06.449> tell<00:06:06.479> you<00:06:06.659> tell<00:06:06.930> me<00:06:07.050> how

can write me and tell you tell me how
you've<00:06:07.289> done<00:06:07.469> with<00:06:07.650> them<00:06:07.800> I<00:06:07.919> think<00:06:08.069> they<00:06:08.400> work

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
you've done with them I think they work

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.399 
you've done with them I think they work
okay<00:06:08.819> and<00:06:09.060> they're<00:06:09.300> kind<00:06:09.509> of<00:06:09.569> a<00:06:09.659> quick<00:06:09.930> fix<00:06:10.229> in

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
okay and they're kind of a quick fix in

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.709 
okay and they're kind of a quick fix in

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
bit different look it also experiment

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.610 
bit different look it also experiment
with<00:06:30.389> some<00:06:30.569> of<00:06:30.599> the<00:06:30.779> new<00:06:30.930> materials<00:06:31.409> such<00:06:31.590> as

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
with some of the new materials such as

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.409 
with some of the new materials such as
the<00:06:31.919> estees<00:06:32.370> that<00:06:32.699> that<00:06:33.240> really<00:06:33.509> have<00:06:33.840> a<00:06:33.870> cool

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
the estees that that really have a cool

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.050 
the estees that that really have a cool
luminescence<00:06:37.009> opacity<00:06:38.009> to<00:06:38.190> them<00:06:38.370> almost<00:06:38.550> that

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
luminescence opacity to them almost that

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.330 
luminescence opacity to them almost that
really<00:06:39.570> give<00:06:40.020> off<00:06:40.199> the<00:06:40.500> essence<00:06:40.800> of

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
really give off the essence of

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.420 
really give off the essence of
an<00:06:41.460> essence<00:06:42.060> of<00:06:42.180> life<00:06:42.500> theoretically<00:06:43.500> I<00:06:43.800> think

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
an essence of life theoretically I think

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.310 
an essence of life theoretically I think
we're<00:06:44.640> we're<00:06:45.090> still<00:06:45.360> waiting<00:06:45.810> for<00:06:45.840> the<00:06:45.990> fish

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
we're we're still waiting for the fish

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.940 
we're we're still waiting for the fish
to<00:06:46.350> tell<00:06:46.800> us<00:06:47.840> how<00:06:48.840> some<00:06:49.140> of<00:06:49.170> these<00:06:49.350> materials

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
to tell us how some of these materials

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.430 
to tell us how some of these materials
really<00:06:50.280> work<00:06:50.490> but<00:06:51.330> certainly<00:06:52.080> you<00:06:52.200> want<00:06:52.290> to

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
really work but certainly you want to

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.380 
really work but certainly you want to
pick<00:06:52.590> up<00:06:52.740> different<00:06:53.160> colors<00:06:53.340> and<00:06:53.700> experiments

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:54.390 
pick up different colors and experiments

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.420 
pick up different colors and experiments
so<00:06:55.670> you<00:06:56.670> can<00:06:56.850> start<00:06:57.210> with<00:06:57.710> some<00:06:58.710> smaller<00:06:59.070> flies

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
so you can start with some smaller flies

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.220 
so you can start with some smaller flies
a<00:06:59.460> lot<00:06:59.760> of<00:07:00.060> flash<00:07:00.240> like<00:07:00.510> this<00:07:00.720> this<00:07:00.870> happens<00:07:01.170> to

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
a lot of flash like this this happens to

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.760 
a lot of flash like this this happens to
be<00:07:01.350> a<00:07:01.380> steelhead<00:07:01.680> fly<00:07:02.160> here<00:07:02.600> and<00:07:03.600> you<00:07:04.470> can<00:07:04.620> go

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
be a steelhead fly here and you can go

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.570 
be a steelhead fly here and you can go
big<00:07:05.190> and<00:07:05.520> ugly<00:07:06.240> and<00:07:06.810> heavy<00:07:07.530> if<00:07:07.830> you<00:07:08.280> need<00:07:08.460> to

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 
big and ugly and heavy if you need to

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.690 
big and ugly and heavy if you need to
get<00:07:08.730> down<00:07:08.940> into<00:07:09.210> a<00:07:09.300> corner<00:07:09.720> hole<00:07:10.430> but<00:07:11.430> I<00:07:11.490> just

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700 
get down into a corner hole but I just

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.310 
get down into a corner hole but I just
say<00:07:11.850> cornhole<00:07:12.420> I'm<00:07:12.690> at<00:07:13.350> corner<00:07:13.890> hole<00:07:14.490> and<00:07:15.450> you

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.320 
say cornhole I'm at corner hole and you

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.100 
say cornhole I'm at corner hole and you
can<00:07:16.530> you<00:07:17.250> can<00:07:17.280> really<00:07:18.270> probe<00:07:18.510> the<00:07:18.660> depths<00:07:18.990> with

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
can you can really probe the depths with

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.170 
can you can really probe the depths with
some<00:07:19.290> of<00:07:19.410> these<00:07:19.470> big<00:07:19.950> heavy<00:07:20.250> flies<00:07:20.610> like<00:07:20.820> this
