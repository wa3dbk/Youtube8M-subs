00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.240 
up come down you can see how easy this
would<00:02:09.860> be<00:02:10.660> here's<00:02:11.660> my<00:02:11.810> subject<00:02:12.319> if<00:02:12.920> I<00:02:12.980> want<00:02:13.160> to

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
would be here's my subject if I want to

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.520 
would be here's my subject if I want to
come<00:02:13.400> down<00:02:13.480> maybe<00:02:14.480> even<00:02:14.690> pull<00:02:14.930> back<00:02:15.170> just<00:02:15.379> a

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
come down maybe even pull back just a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.680 
come down maybe even pull back just a
little<00:02:15.560> bit<00:02:15.769> like<00:02:16.760> this<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.150> can<00:02:17.269> see<00:02:17.420> how<00:02:17.569> it

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
little bit like this you can see how it

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.800 
little bit like this you can see how it
rolls<00:02:17.959> super<00:02:18.590> super<00:02:19.040> smooth<00:02:19.480> now<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.629> would

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
rolls super super smooth now this would

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.030 
rolls super super smooth now this would
be<00:02:20.840> something<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.230> would<00:02:21.410> be<00:02:21.530> tough<00:02:21.739> to<00:02:21.769> do

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
be something that would be tough to do

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.520 
be something that would be tough to do
with<00:02:22.610> any<00:02:22.760> kind<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.090> Steadicam<00:02:23.599> or<00:02:24.230> anything

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
with any kind of Steadicam or anything

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.770 
with any kind of Steadicam or anything
else<00:02:24.860> but<00:02:25.220> not<00:02:25.340> with<00:02:25.519> a<00:02:25.550> carbon<00:02:25.940> XL<00:02:26.269> it's

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
else but not with a carbon XL it's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.540 
else but not with a carbon XL it's
extremely<00:02:27.319> lightweight<00:02:27.530> in<00:02:27.890> fact<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.310> could

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
extremely lightweight in fact I could

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.100 
extremely lightweight in fact I could
shoot<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:28.910> scene<00:02:29.209> with<00:02:29.420> one<00:02:29.629> hand<00:02:29.900> if<00:02:30.019> I

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
shoot that scene with one hand if I

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.110 
shoot that scene with one hand if I
really<00:02:30.349> wanted<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.680> you're<00:02:31.640> gonna<00:02:31.730> love<00:02:31.970> the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
really wanted to you're gonna love the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.300 
really wanted to you're gonna love the
way<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:32.360> moves<00:02:32.690> for<00:02:33.319> multi<00:02:33.650> axis<00:02:34.069> shots

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
way this moves for multi axis shots

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.339 
way this moves for multi axis shots
there's<00:02:34.819> nothing<00:02:35.360> better<00:02:35.569> than<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.140> carbon

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
there's nothing better than the carbon

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.830 
there's nothing better than the carbon
XL
