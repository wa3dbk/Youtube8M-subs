00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
and so I just I'm going to highlight a

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.120 
and so I just I'm going to highlight a
few<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.300> my<00:00:33.360> favorites<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.260> video<00:00:34.590> before

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
few of my favorites in this video before

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.280 
few of my favorites in this video before
getting<00:00:35.399> into<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.700> relaxer<00:00:36.120> review<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
getting into the relaxer review so the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.709 
getting into the relaxer review so the
basic<00:00:37.649> premise<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.460> entire<00:00:38.820> line<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.420> that

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
basic premise of the entire line is that

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.440 
basic premise of the entire line is that
they<00:00:40.260> are<00:00:40.559> protein<00:00:41.129> based<00:00:41.370> products<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.090> I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
they are protein based products and I

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.750 
they are protein based products and I
had<00:00:42.629> run<00:00:42.780> out<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.989> my<00:00:43.410> previous<00:00:43.710> protein<00:00:44.520> on

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
had run out of my previous protein on

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.549 
had run out of my previous protein on
conditioner<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.840> was<00:00:45.989> perfect<00:00:46.379> timing

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
conditioner so this was perfect timing

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.400 
conditioner so this was perfect timing
so<00:00:47.340> there<00:00:47.670> are<00:00:47.820> two<00:00:48.120> protein<00:00:48.629> conditioners<00:00:49.170> in

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
so there are two protein conditioners in

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.290 
so there are two protein conditioners in
the<00:00:49.530> line<00:00:49.710> or<00:00:50.010> deep<00:00:50.520> conditioner<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.090> should

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
the line or deep conditioner I should

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.569 
the line or deep conditioner I should
say<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.289> says<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.010> anti<00:00:53.399> breakage

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
say this one says it's the anti breakage

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.880 
say this one says it's the anti breakage
detangling<00:00:54.390> conditioner<00:00:54.570> comes<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.410> jar<00:00:55.440> I
