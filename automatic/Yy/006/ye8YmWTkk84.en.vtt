okay<00:00:16.420> so<00:00:16.480> we've<00:00:16.570> had<00:00:16.660> a<00:00:16.720> look<00:00:16.869> at<00:00:16.930> the<00:00:17.020> deck

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
okay so we've had a look at the deck

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.689 
okay so we've had a look at the deck
assembly<00:00:17.560> controls<00:00:17.949> will<00:00:18.160> now<00:00:18.279> have<00:00:18.490> a<00:00:18.520> look

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
assembly controls will now have a look

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.609 
assembly controls will now have a look
at<00:00:18.910> a<00:00:19.000> channel<00:00:19.210> strip<00:00:19.360> so<00:00:20.289> I'm<00:00:20.380> just<00:00:20.500> gonna

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
at a channel strip so I'm just gonna

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.300 
at a channel strip so I'm just gonna
start<00:00:21.250> transport<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:23.320> the<00:00:23.410> channel<00:00:23.619> strip<00:00:23.860> is

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
start transport so the channel strip is

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.640 
start transport so the channel strip is
laid<00:00:24.579> out<00:00:24.610> very<00:00:24.970> much<00:00:25.029> like<00:00:25.329> a<00:00:25.509> mixer<00:00:26.020> at<00:00:26.590> the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
laid out very much like a mixer at the

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.010 
laid out very much like a mixer at the
very<00:00:26.859> top<00:00:27.009> we've<00:00:27.189> got<00:00:27.219> FX<00:00:27.849> 1<00:00:28.059> and<00:00:28.239> FX<00:00:28.390> 2<00:00:28.750> assign

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
very top we've got FX 1 and FX 2 assign

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.569 
very top we've got FX 1 and FX 2 assign
buttons<00:00:29.349> which<00:00:29.529> I'll<00:00:29.649> discuss<00:00:30.040> in<00:00:30.369> a<00:00:30.489> little

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
buttons which I'll discuss in a little

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.869 
buttons which I'll discuss in a little
while<00:00:30.899> we<00:00:31.899> have<00:00:32.020> a<00:00:32.050> level<00:00:32.349> control<00:00:32.739> 3<00:00:33.250> band<00:00:33.430> EQ

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
while we have a level control 3 band EQ

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.920 
while we have a level control 3 band EQ
channel<00:00:34.660> metering<00:00:35.520> cross<00:00:36.520> fader<00:00:36.760> sine<00:00:37.090> q<00:00:37.690> and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
channel metering cross fader sine q and

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.130 
channel metering cross fader sine q and
then<00:00:38.399> channel<00:00:39.399> fader<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:40.840> first<00:00:41.020> thing

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
then channel fader so the first thing

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.689 
then channel fader so the first thing
I'm<00:00:41.199> going<00:00:41.289> to<00:00:41.350> do<00:00:41.500> is<00:00:41.739> because<00:00:42.309> we've<00:00:42.460> got<00:00:42.579> the

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
I'm going to do is because we've got the

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.180 
I'm going to do is because we've got the
channel<00:00:43.530> meters<00:00:44.530> I'm<00:00:44.710> just<00:00:44.860> gonna<00:00:44.950> bring<00:00:45.070> up

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
channel meters I'm just gonna bring up

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.639 
channel meters I'm just gonna bring up
my<00:00:45.280> level<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:47.079> around<00:00:47.350> 0<00:00:47.680> dB<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.440> I<00:00:50.500> know<00:00:50.620> that

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
my level to around 0 dB so I know that

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.729 
my level to around 0 dB so I know that
I've<00:00:50.829> got<00:00:50.980> my<00:00:51.100> audio<00:00:51.399> coming<00:00:51.760> through<00:00:52.000> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
I've got my audio coming through and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.229 
I've got my audio coming through and
then<00:00:53.739> I'm<00:00:54.010> just<00:00:54.310> bring<00:00:54.820> my<00:00:54.940> fader<00:00:55.180> up<00:00:57.239> so

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
then I'm just bring my fader up so

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.219 
then I'm just bring my fader up so
obviously<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.720> cross<00:00:58.899> fader<00:00:59.110> sign<00:00:59.380> is<00:00:59.590> XY<00:01:04.229> it

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
obviously the cross fader sign is XY it

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.780 
obviously the cross fader sign is XY it
will<00:01:05.379> be<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.530> cross<00:01:05.740> fader<00:01:05.979> a<00:01:06.280> sine<00:01:06.520> curve

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
will be a cross fader a sine curve

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:16.099 
will be a cross fader a sine curve
within<00:01:07.119> the<00:01:07.240> software<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.840> EQ<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:14.020> total<00:01:14.560> kill

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:16.109 
within the software the EQ is total kill

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:22.529 
within the software the EQ is total kill
to<00:01:17.109> either<00:01:17.319> plus<00:01:18.039> 6<00:01:19.350> or<00:01:20.350> plus<00:01:21.340> 12<00:01:21.639> again<00:01:22.060> you

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
to either plus 6 or plus 12 again you

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:23.940 
to either plus 6 or plus 12 again you
can<00:01:22.689> set<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:22.990> up<00:01:23.020> in<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.289> setup<00:01:23.590> screen<00:01:23.679> if

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
can set that up in the setup screen if

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.169 
can set that up in the setup screen if
you<00:01:24.039> refer<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.579> user<00:01:24.729> guide<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.880> cube<00:01:28.090> but

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
you refer to the user guide the cube but

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.059 
you refer to the user guide the cube but
Gnostic<00:01:28.569> user<00:01:28.810> channel<00:01:29.259> we<00:01:29.799> have<00:01:29.859> a<00:01:29.950> quick

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
Gnostic user channel we have a quick

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.849 
Gnostic user channel we have a quick
look<00:01:30.219> at<00:01:30.310> our<00:01:30.399> cueing<00:01:31.179> section<00:01:31.630> basically<00:01:32.560> we

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
look at our cueing section basically we

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.679 
look at our cueing section basically we
have<00:01:33.009> a<00:01:33.039> headphone<00:01:33.429> control<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.270> we<00:01:34.509> have<00:01:34.659> a

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
have a headphone control and we have a

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.469 
have a headphone control and we have a
split<00:01:34.990> cue<00:01:35.319> so<00:01:36.310> when<00:01:36.490> we're<00:01:36.639> in<00:01:36.759> split<00:01:37.029> Q<00:01:37.270> mode

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
split cue so when we're in split Q mode

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.019 
split cue so when we're in split Q mode
we<00:01:38.229> basically<00:01:38.560> get<00:01:38.829> the<00:01:38.979> cute<00:01:39.279> signal<00:01:39.670> in<00:01:39.819> the

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:40.029 
we basically get the cute signal in the

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:42.660 
we basically get the cute signal in the
left<00:01:40.329> ear<00:01:40.509> piece<00:01:40.810> whilst<00:01:41.560> we<00:01:41.770> get<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.189> main

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
left ear piece whilst we get the main

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.699 
left ear piece whilst we get the main
mixed<00:01:42.999> signal<00:01:43.270> in<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.719> right<00:01:45.569> and<00:01:46.709> the

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
mixed signal in the right and the

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:51.809 
mixed signal in the right and the
channel<00:01:48.009> fader<00:01:48.219> as<00:01:48.549> we<00:01:49.509> would<00:01:49.630> expect<00:01:50.819> another

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
channel fader as we would expect another

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.609 
channel fader as we would expect another
feature<00:01:52.119> we've<00:01:52.359> got<00:01:52.630> with<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.959> zone<00:01:53.139> DX<00:01:53.469> is

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
feature we've got with the zone DX is

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.620 
feature we've got with the zone DX is
that<00:01:53.740> we<00:01:53.829> can<00:01:53.979> take<00:01:54.130> external<00:01:54.729> input<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.419> run

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
that we can take external input and run

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.289 
that we can take external input and run
them<00:01:55.840> through<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:56.229> Dex<00:01:56.729> as<00:01:57.729> a<00:01:57.789> demonstration

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
them through the Dex as a demonstration

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.760 
them through the Dex as a demonstration
I'll<00:01:58.599> do<00:01:58.689> this<00:01:58.869> on<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.289> channel<00:01:59.560> that's

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
I'll do this on the channel that's

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.539 
I'll do this on the channel that's
currently<00:02:00.099> playing<00:02:01.560> if<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.679> press<00:02:02.950> down<00:02:02.979> shift

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
currently playing if I press down shift

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.789 
currently playing if I press down shift
and<00:02:03.789> hit<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.270> Q<00:02:04.479> button<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:05.109> see<00:02:05.319> the<00:02:05.439> Q<00:02:05.619> goes

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
and hit the Q button you see the Q goes

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.520 
and hit the Q button you see the Q goes
orange<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.369> if<00:02:07.179> you<00:02:07.270> look<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.929> waveform<00:02:08.410> in

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
orange and if you look the waveform in

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.280 
orange and if you look the waveform in
software<00:02:08.890> has<00:02:09.160> gone<00:02:09.369> gray<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:10.660> is<00:02:10.869> now<00:02:11.020> set

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
software has gone gray this is now set

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.680 
software has gone gray this is now set
to<00:02:11.319> external<00:02:11.920> mode<00:02:12.099> so<00:02:12.310> if<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:12.520> just<00:02:12.730> start<00:02:13.030> my

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
to external mode so if I just start my

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.630 
to external mode so if I just start my
CD<00:02:14.470> player

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.580 

you<00:02:18.640> can<00:02:18.790> hear<00:02:18.970> that<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:23.020> can<00:02:23.170> hot<00:02:23.320> switch

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
you can hear that and I can hot switch

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.930 
you can hear that and I can hot switch
between<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.100> two<00:02:28.950> now<00:02:29.950> we<00:02:30.010> can<00:02:30.190> do<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.490> for

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
between the two now we can do this for

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.020 
between the two now we can do this for
all<00:02:31.090> channels<00:02:31.450> on<00:02:32.380> channel<00:02:33.100> 1<00:02:33.280> we<00:02:33.790> can<00:02:33.940> have

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
all channels on channel 1 we can have

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.500 
all channels on channel 1 we can have
line<00:02:34.240> only<00:02:34.450> on<00:02:35.410> channels<00:02:35.860> 2<00:02:36.160> &amp;<00:02:36.400> 3<00:02:36.430> we<00:02:37.300> have
