00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.460 
banana leaf so you guys know it's banana
leaf<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:19.120> everything<00:03:19.630> here<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:19.900> basically

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
leaf so everything here is basically

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.410 
leaf so everything here is basically
natural<00:03:20.980> only<00:03:21.040> only<00:03:21.670> foreign<00:03:21.970> hold<00:03:22.120> your<00:03:22.269> hair
