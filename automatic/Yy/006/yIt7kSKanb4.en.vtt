00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.929
 hello friends are welcome 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.849
 to follow at 8 of lego the hobbit we 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.289
 Always take fast others around 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.029
 above is to be solved 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.230
 we have to believe I believe or something like that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.230
 you also have to complete it 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.790
 dies 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.360
 a cube can do that, apparently 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.940
 Roger defeats me briefly in the first 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.940
 north 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.680
 pow 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.469
 then it can somehow destroy itself 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.500
 with double night or alone 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.360
 suffice 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.360
 and there background 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.060
 only the troika alone pure 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.460
 OK 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.470
 what is that a big crack for it 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.010
 we need two hello again where are 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.010
 the others stayed 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.000
 so the action here around the big one 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.000
 destroy house 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:58.650
 but is gone is free again 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.650
 something we do not system him for 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:09.100
 says the car is destroyed and then have 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:13.440
 that part he can do that too 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.440
 a modern trigger 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.330
 yes that can trigger that and pulls the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.330
 bullet down now 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.680
 and it goes on fast 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.750
 okay this is an archer in the middle of 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.750
 occiput 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.810
 for that we need the other to here 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.490
 would not need either 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.430
 I know it dry 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.610
 so it still only one 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.989
 Two hearts have no idea how to do that 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.709
 Now I can do the far that is too 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.709
 cool 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.239
 the 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.230
 I 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:56.800
 Among the other 90 can because there 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:03.660
 Above a farewell deserves a 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.660
 it's all too easy for me to live 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.450
 Zack that's how it works 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.980
 on 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.980
 very quickly the others 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:34.600
 what is happening now and before that 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:49.090
 loses two more weeks since his 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:49.660
 and that 's it with the 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.950
 level 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.410
 we have completed the faithful place 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:05:00.820
 unlocked free game 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:03.460
 we have unlocked radegast and 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.820
 otherwise only new characters to buy 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.820
 available 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:15.419
 and we made a few coins 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.419
 37,500 to be precise 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.979
 and of course we have one again 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.700
 certain percentage reaches again 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:27.940
 not 100 percent 57 this time even only 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:34.330
 very little and we have a mini 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:37.510
 crisis of 224 we have four mini kids 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.430
 I only remember 1 1 and found 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.100
 events in with earth again, of course 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.500
 unlocked everything possible and 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.240
 of course also einstein level 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.400
 complete story 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.740
 As always, we will make tomorrow 18 clock 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.540
