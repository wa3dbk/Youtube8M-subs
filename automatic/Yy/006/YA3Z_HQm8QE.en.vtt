00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
you know it has a little fat so you have

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.229 
you know it has a little fat so you have
surface<00:02:06.840> tension<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:08.239> dishwashing

and squeeze the egg is essentially it's
unbreakable<00:03:25.090> because<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:27.049> shape<00:03:27.739> of<00:03:27.920> the

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
unbreakable because of the shape of the

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.449 
unbreakable because of the shape of the
ring<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:29.389> it<00:03:29.750> applies<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:30.739> pressure<00:03:30.980> and

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
ring that it applies the pressure and

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.460 
ring that it applies the pressure and
the<00:03:31.639> force<00:03:31.910> throughout<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.480> egg<00:03:32.660> it's<00:03:33.049> a<00:03:33.230> dome

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
the force throughout the egg it's a dome

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.110 
the force throughout the egg it's a dome
shape<00:03:33.920> which<00:03:34.160> is<00:03:34.190> one<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.670> strongest

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
shape which is one of the strongest

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.539 
shape which is one of the strongest
shapes<00:03:35.420> now<00:03:35.750> investigate<00:03:36.560> in<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:37.040> end<00:03:37.220> though

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
shapes now investigate in the end though

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:49.270 
shapes now investigate in the end though
that's<00:03:37.970> what<00:03:47.200> you<00:03:48.200> do<00:03:48.440> have<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.829> make<00:03:48.950> sure<00:03:49.160> you

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
that's what you do have to make sure you
