00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:08.510
 and there we have them as the 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:12.450
 one hundredth episode of let's play 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.670
 railway I waited a long time for it 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.580
 Really experienced a lot together 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.980
 follow this 100 and I want to 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.230
 with this video very much 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.470
 all supporters regular 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.760
 spectators watch and so on 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.920
 I would like to extend my sincerest wishes 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.420
 thank you for your support 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.030
 during the entire time already exists and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.130
 I think it just so completely 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.829
 also imagined the next years 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.110
 will not expose who would have thought 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.500
 at that time I follow a first 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.390
 New Year's Eve 2012 we have 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.870
 such a success with it 100 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.460
 consequences 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.610
 not always really admitted 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.980
 regularly now for months 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.809
 that we are reasonably regular 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.850
 pull the land and various facilities 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.079
 assemble 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.820
 I'm really pleased that we are such a 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.440
 huge audience could build up with 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.799
 a simulation that actually no 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.659
 But you know , you just look at the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.990
 Call the subscriber 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.830
 you can see it in popularity videos 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.320
 have meanwhile 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.229
 and that's not all about me 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.659
 it is yours too who deserve it 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.140
 videos shares passages to other people 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.790
 shows and that makes me very happy that one 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.890
 as good as it can help 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.530
 It is not just the let's get there 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.509
 play now with his 100 follow but 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.790
 also the whole tutorials the ancient 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.310
 tutorials that will be released soon 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.720
 Be the new railway ex tutorials 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.390
 which hang pretty behind 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.369
 the new format he gave so goes that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.200
 has also been totally well received and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.610
 it is still going on 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.070
 that is promised that always comes 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.810
 again videos for apps just like that 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.299
 versatile you can do so many things 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.950
 explain in it and I think come here 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.720
 There are still parts together if you are there 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.880
 really want to explain everything from the same 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.049
 also for that my heartfelt thanks 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.630

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.259
 thanks for your videos, thanks for that 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.340
 explain that really great that this 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.659
 platform gives that this 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.129
 There are possibilities 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.539
 that explains everything so understandable 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.269
 even if I am every now and then 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.879
 perhaps quite naturally can 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.590
 just say so in any case 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.560
 Thank you so much 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.030

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.370
 new format coming soon 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.349
 is where I often technical terms 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.150
 would like to bring more in order then also in 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.450
 my whole technical term gibberish 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.799
 just a little bit here 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.080
 order 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.209
 So I want to follow with this 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.940
 100 fully admitted that not now 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.349
 really long but i think so 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.450
 that's really worth it 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.599
 Just to say thank you now too 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.890

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.650
