00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.170
 Today I make a video of the story when my hair fits 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:15.900
 Khan is a bit long, but it doesn't mean it's really long 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:20.130
 I think it will be a little deeper story I used to know that I was gay 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:25.650
 It was not the fact that I've been thinking and I like a woman of the people or are confused 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.289
 Oh I became a girl and a friend is much more are you game Spanish lesson 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.589
 One high school 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:34.510
 I was trying to make new friends in first grade 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:39.370
 The Second President of the Middle East was a popular lesbian with many friends 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:41.469
 When you get to know each other and talk about various things, you lose yourself and you 're gay 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.960
 I thought it was a char 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:48.680
 One night talking to him a little online 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.890
 I No you a game he Ru car Do you depopulated representative was 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.160
 I was told like I calmly talked 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.989
 I to her that was not completely trust 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:03.920
 So you are why was coming out the US for some time where I thought I can it 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:10.760
 After that, people came to ask about the gainer gain at school 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:12.410
 It seems that the continuation was different and it was answered that it seems that such a first grader is over and summer is over and everyone 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.150
 I'm informed that I'm gay 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.220
 Anyone know the seat as far as I know that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.730
 Hmm 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.730
 So 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.570
 Around the end of 2006 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:34.880
 No, in the time seriously in and October wonder if not the uniforms of the time year junior high school 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:37.940
 My sister has heard more about you gayr when I got off the bus before leaving 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.300
 Your friend is saying that 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:48.240
 At first I denied that the pressure building is different from the morning and noisy 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.870
 But if my sister knew I should be very good friends with that friend and talk to anything 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.970
 income 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:56.730
 Once you and I wonder if you'll see me there is not going to get the channels lie in the story is that people Cid 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.510
 It is said that it is obviously true 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:04.210
 So I had a paper called my sister on the spot 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:08.830
 My sister accepted me but it was good fc 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.090
 But her there that I thought I wish I do not want and do is not it would use sister this thing 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.940
 I think I was could 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:21.670
 If my sister gets angry with me If I ever get angry with my sister 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:27.370
 I thought that my younger sister might threaten by pulling ui to my parents and others 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:29.190
 It is a difference that I want to stand up because it is amazing maybe maybe in the beginning of 2007 but January 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.000
 In the sea ​​where it was early season 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.900
 Mochi rush When I was angered local at the time was there were living eyes 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.330
 Carl I told you that I need to talk to my mother 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:46.680
 Sister mother is not I Do not Have a nice day and you'll I is Damn cooking in the kitchen is multiplied by the new year 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.180
 I'd say either by Kedah Zhuang trying to dominate the place it 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.549
 Mother I screamed because I was gay 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.350
 N ten Naha Once you have the explanation contained in the What is in the kitchen er mother gave me attached 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:00.820
 It was true to good 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:06.010
 It will be implemented because I did not come out that way and then little by little 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.250
 I started talking to my close friends, and the people who accepted me first grew up 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.070
 From 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:16.340
 Do I base how I'm Su' at you was really good I think that it is lucky knew it 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:20.840
 But I think that I'm far-times motor story, not know 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:26.690
 My mother and sister say I don't talk, but my father knows 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:31.670
 I can hear that talk in front of the eyes of China I know that a good friend of that relationship is my family 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:35.420
 So I decided to be coming out in I hope even if the summer of 2007 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.450
 I came out on the page of my kindergarten myspace 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.510
 Of course myspace paint myspace myspace my own 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:45.519
 I wrote an article on the page 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.840
 Also and go without having spoken to each individual to have all my friends can be notified at once to 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:52.569
 Because 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:57.849
 The fabric I wrote that please remove from your friends registered it was disgusting it is gay 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.360
 It was good because I thought that no one had removed the registration, but a message was sent from many people 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.500
 Was 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.300
 I do not know at all it is amazing 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:09.860
 Never been hit perhaps taking to everyone I think that I was shocked to know Anja 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.530
 I was or personally leaning hatred at the moment the real world 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:17.750
 I have never been mean 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:19.579
 I have been told something for a few years 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.819
 If Desu 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.740
 That 's not a very good thing , I think I'm very lucky 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:27.979
 Hand and arm 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.420
 I Naa live in the countryside of North Carolina 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:35.190
 Yes 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:38.760
 For example, in areas where there are many poor white people, people who say gay people often are not 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:43.910
 But where I work and where my mother lives 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:50.230
 It is a very good thing because there are many people who recognize the difference 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.230
 Of course thank you for listening to this is my story
