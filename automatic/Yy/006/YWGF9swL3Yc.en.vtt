figured<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.210> first<00:01:00.449> team<00:01:00.780> I'd<00:01:01.050> pick<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
figured the first team I'd pick is the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.520 
figured the first team I'd pick is the
Miami<00:01:02.190> Heat<00:01:02.489> life<00:01:03.120> after<00:01:03.480> LeBron<00:01:04.140> James

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
Miami Heat life after LeBron James

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.950 
Miami Heat life after LeBron James
probably<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.460> scary<00:01:06.000> thought<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.360> some<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.900> you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
probably a scary thought for some of you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.630 
probably a scary thought for some of you
guys<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.439> honestly<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> Miami<00:01:08.280> Heat<00:01:08.460> are

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
guys but honestly the Miami Heat are

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.280 
guys but honestly the Miami Heat are
gonna<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.299> fine<00:01:09.510> they<00:01:09.810> will<00:01:09.990> make<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
gonna be just fine they will make the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.750 
gonna be just fine they will make the
playoffs<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.920> think<00:01:11.220> they're<00:01:11.310> gonna<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.549> around

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
playoffs I think they're gonna be around

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.390 
playoffs I think they're gonna be around
the<00:01:11.939> five<00:01:12.240> six<00:01:12.840> maybe<00:01:13.080> even<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> four<00:01:13.950> seas<00:01:14.250> in

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the five six maybe even the four seas in

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.070 
the five six maybe even the four seas in
the<00:01:14.430> Eastern<00:01:14.820> Conference<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.840> with<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the Eastern Conference and then with the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.109 
the Eastern Conference and then with the
Paul<00:01:16.259> George<00:01:16.680> injury<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.310> think<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.939> honestly

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
Paul George injury I think that honestly

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.609 
Paul George injury I think that honestly
makes<00:01:18.509> them<00:01:18.659> better<00:01:18.869> than<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> Indiana

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
makes them better than the Indiana

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.429 
makes them better than the Indiana
Pacers<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.759> obviously<00:01:21.119> Pat<00:01:21.420> Riley<00:01:21.810> he<00:01:22.110> wants

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
Pacers so obviously Pat Riley he wants

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.899 
Pacers so obviously Pat Riley he wants
to<00:01:22.530> win<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.340> what<00:01:23.520> we're<00:01:23.670> gonna<00:01:23.759> be

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.149 
to win and that's what we're gonna be
trying<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.930> episode<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.920> only
