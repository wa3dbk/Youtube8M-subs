00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.730 
certain age you got to die blow well
we've<00:01:42.630> seen<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.840> repeated<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.229> there<00:01:43.649> are

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
we've seen that repeated but there are

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.580 
we've seen that repeated but there are
elements<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.399> themes<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.659> styles<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.380> they

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
elements and themes and styles that they

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.440 
elements and themes and styles that they
did<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:46.979> movie<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.060> kind<00:01:48.299> of

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
did in that movie that you can kind of

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.969 
did in that movie that you can kind of
sense<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.930> see<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> thumbprint<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.740> lot<00:01:49.950> of

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
sense and see the thumbprint in a lot of

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.190 
sense and see the thumbprint in a lot of
sci-fi<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:51.149> original<00:01:51.630> book<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> little<00:01:52.020> bit

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
sci-fi the original book is a little bit

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.420 
sci-fi the original book is a little bit
of<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.439> original<00:01:52.770> book<00:01:52.860> which<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.130> think

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
of like the original book which I think

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.429 
of like the original book which I think
him<00:01:53.549> out<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.759> 1967<00:01:54.659> was<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> little<00:01:55.350> bit

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
him out like 1967 was a little bit

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.660 
him out like 1967 was a little bit
different<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.680> think<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.950> book<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
different I think in the book the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.580 
different I think in the book the
automatic<00:01:57.119> death<00:01:57.329> age<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.659> 21<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.350> movie<00:01:58.560> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
automatic death age is 21 in the movie I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.139 
automatic death age is 21 in the movie I
think<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.860> 30<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.490> they<00:01:59.579> had<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> few<00:02:00.030> other

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
think was 30 and they had a few other

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.940 
think was 30 and they had a few other
things<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.930> pretty<00:02:01.380> true<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
things but it's a pretty true to the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.830 
things but it's a pretty true to the
book<00:02:02.070> kind<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.280> story<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.700> think<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.390> modern

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
book kind of story I think a modern

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.959 
book kind of story I think a modern
retelling<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.530> overdue<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.490> think<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:05.790> Kim

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
retelling is overdue and I think in Kim

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.130 
retelling is overdue and I think in Kim
Berg's<00:02:06.149> hands<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.600> think<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.840> could<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:06.990> really

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
Berg's hands I think it could be really

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.300 
Berg's hands I think it could be really
cool<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.590> I'm<00:02:07.680> looking<00:02:07.950> forward<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.190> it

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
cool so I'm looking forward to it

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.949 
cool so I'm looking forward to it

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.979 
boards good thing you know I believe
Joel<00:03:25.760> Silver's<00:03:26.090> also<00:03:26.329> still<00:03:26.540> attached<00:03:26.780> is

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
Joel Silver's also still attached is

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.330 
Joel Silver's also still attached is
Roberto<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.440> he<00:03:27.560> on<00:03:27.769> that<00:03:27.829> right<00:03:28.100> so<00:03:28.220> I<00:03:28.250> think

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
Roberto is he on that right so I think

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.770 
Roberto is he on that right so I think
he<00:03:28.489> probably<00:03:28.609> sells<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.060> rights<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:29.480> yeah

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
he probably sells the rights to it yeah

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.300 
he probably sells the rights to it yeah
I<00:03:29.810> mean<00:03:30.019> it<00:03:30.200> deserves<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.680> shot<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:30.950> think

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
I mean it deserves a shot I think

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.069 
I mean it deserves a shot I think
because<00:03:31.609> of<00:03:31.640> what<00:03:31.850> I'm<00:03:32.299> not<00:03:32.450> quite<00:03:32.690> gonna<00:03:32.870> say

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
because of what I'm not quite gonna say

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.509 
because of what I'm not quite gonna say
it's<00:03:33.230> it's<00:03:33.470> like<00:03:33.590> The<00:03:33.709> Godfather<00:03:33.890> science

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.870 
Trek fans were upset with JJ Abrams
because<00:04:03.620> they<00:04:03.769> thought<00:04:04.190> he<00:04:04.250> made<00:04:04.549> more<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.760> a

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
because they thought he made more of a

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.729 
because they thought he made more of a
Star<00:04:05.090> Wars<00:04:05.299> movie<00:04:05.480> with<00:04:06.019> the<00:04:06.109> first<00:04:06.319> two<00:04:06.470> Star

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
Star Wars movie with the first two Star

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.080 
Star Wars movie with the first two Star
Trek's<00:04:07.069> are<00:04:07.310> they<00:04:07.549> going<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.790> have<00:04:07.910> that

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090

problem<00:04:08.150> with<00:04:08.510> Logan's<00:04:08.840> Run<00:04:09.049> I<00:04:09.109> think<00:04:09.350> you<00:04:09.410> can

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
problem with Logan's Run I think you can

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.080 
problem with Logan's Run I think you can
take<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:10.069> you<00:04:10.160> can<00:04:10.280> more<00:04:10.459> pick<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:10.880> choose

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
take that you can more pick and choose

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.879 
take that you can more pick and choose
between<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.989> source<00:04:12.260> material<00:04:12.680> that<00:04:12.709> you're

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
between the source material that you're

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.920 
between the source material that you're
like<00:04:13.069> oh<00:04:13.250> yeah<00:04:13.280> let's<00:04:13.730> keep<00:04:13.880> that<00:04:14.060> that<00:04:14.480> we<00:04:14.750> can

like oh yeah let's keep that that we can

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.810 
like oh yeah let's keep that that we can

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
lose that that's a little goofy

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.430 
lose that that's a little goofy
he's<00:04:17.030> got<00:04:17.209> more<00:04:17.359> freedom<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:17.780> do<00:04:18.019> that<00:04:18.229> because

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
he's got more freedom to do that because

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.529 
he's got more freedom to do that because
