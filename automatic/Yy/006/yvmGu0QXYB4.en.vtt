positions<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:34.649> guess<00:00:34.890> what<00:00:35.100> they've<00:00:35.309> been

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
positions but guess what they've been

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.540 
positions but guess what they've been
doing<00:00:35.460> hun<00:00:35.969> clandestinely<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.399> is

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
doing hun clandestinely and so this is

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.459
