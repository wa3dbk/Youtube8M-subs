hey folks this is Kalani welcome back to

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.240 
hey folks this is Kalani welcome back to
fractals<00:00:03.659> of<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.959> myths<00:00:04.170> this<00:00:04.799> time<00:00:05.069> were<00:00:05.190> in

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
fractals of the myths this time were in

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.849 
fractals of the myths this time were in
the<00:00:05.339> underground<00:00:05.970> fractal<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.779> lot<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.620> dredge

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
the underground fractal a lot of dredge

the underground fractal a lot of dredge
here<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:09.150> one's<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.450> little<00:00:09.570> interesting<00:00:10.230> is

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
here this one's a little interesting is

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.350 
here this one's a little interesting is
you've<00:00:10.530> got<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.740> few<00:00:11.010> puzzles<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.519> solve<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:12.090> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
you've got a few puzzles to solve in the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.530 
you've got a few puzzles to solve in the
form<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.660> opening<00:00:13.139> doors<00:00:13.170> now<00:00:13.830> there<00:00:14.070> are

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
form of opening doors now there are

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.849 
form of opening doors now there are
several<00:00:15.540> different<00:00:15.900> puzzles<00:00:16.199> so<00:00:16.440> we'll

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
several different puzzles so we'll

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.519 
several different puzzles so we'll
tackle<00:00:17.520> them<00:00:17.789> as<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.060> get<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.359> them<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:19.260> if<00:00:19.380> you

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
tackle them as we get to them so if you

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.630 
tackle them as we get to them so if you
were<00:00:19.650> watching<00:00:19.770> closely<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.430> would<00:00:20.550> have

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
were watching closely you would have

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.279 
were watching closely you would have
seen<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.789> closed<00:00:21.150> door<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.810> right<00:00:21.990> at<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
seen a closed door on the right at the

bottom<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.769> platform<00:00:23.010> I'm<00:00:23.670> going<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.939> go

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
bottom of this platform I'm going to go

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.910 
bottom of this platform I'm going to go
open<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.470> need<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.710> head

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
open that and to do that we need to head

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.589 
open that and to do that we need to head
up<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.220> left<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.970> find<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> pressure

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
up to the left and find the pressure

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.870 
up to the left and find the pressure
plate<00:00:27.810> now<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.800> need<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.250> stand<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
plate now you need to stand on the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.700 
plate now you need to stand on the
pressure<00:00:30.060> plate<00:00:30.210> until<00:00:30.599> everyone<00:00:31.439> else<00:00:31.500> in

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
pressure plate until everyone else in

the<00:00:31.800> group<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.160> through<00:00:32.780> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:33.989> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the group is through going to have a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.569 
the group is through going to have a
friend<00:00:34.350> step<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> pressure<00:00:35.070> plate<00:00:35.219> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
friend step on the pressure plate and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.100 
friend step on the pressure plate and
keep<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.880> open<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.660> show<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.899> the

using to open the next door let's have a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.030 
using to open the next door let's have a
look<00:01:26.610> at<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:28.590> both<00:01:28.740> me<00:01:28.950> in

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
look at that so you can see both me in

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.350 
look at that so you can see both me in
the<00:01:29.130> range<00:01:29.310> we're<00:01:29.520> using<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.820> console<00:01:30.180> it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the range we're using the console it

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.520 
the range we're using the console it
doesn't<00:01:30.600> make<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.720> any<00:01:30.900> quicker<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.350> just

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
doesn't make it any quicker it just

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.260
