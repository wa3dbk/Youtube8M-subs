00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
one of the reasons I started them so

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.250 
one of the reasons I started them so
early<00:00:16.279> is<00:00:16.400> because<00:00:16.670> I<00:00:17.000> planted<00:00:17.450> some<00:00:17.510> Trinidad

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
early is because I planted some Trinidad

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.040

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
was just a few weeks out of having some

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.060 
was just a few weeks out of having some
really<00:00:23.450> good<00:00:23.720> fruit<00:00:24.110> so<00:00:24.380> I<00:00:24.410> wanted<00:00:24.770> to<00:00:24.830> make

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
really good fruit so I wanted to make

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
sure that I started them early so I

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.120 
sure that I started them early so I
would<00:00:27.140> get<00:00:27.380> a<00:00:27.560> prolific<00:00:28.400> harvest<00:00:29.030> this<00:00:29.330> season

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.640 
interesting because it actually sprouted
two<00:02:26.390> heads<00:02:27.340> as<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.489> can<00:02:28.640> see<00:02:28.849> there<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:30.500> I'm

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
two heads as you can see there and I'm

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.460 
two heads as you can see there and I'm
trying<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.040> get<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.489> grow<00:02:31.700> around<00:02:32.540> like

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
trying to get it to grow around like

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.699 
trying to get it to grow around like
twisting<00:02:33.950> around<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.550> larger<00:02:34.940> one<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:36.560> is

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
twisting around the larger one this is

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.530 
twisting around the larger one this is
the<00:02:36.830> other<00:02:36.980> avocado<00:02:37.580> I've<00:02:37.910> had<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.269> one<00:02:38.480> for

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the other avocado I've had this one for

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.300 
the other avocado I've had this one for
some<00:02:39.019> time<00:02:39.319> now<00:02:39.650> it<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.790> quite<00:02:41.269> large<00:02:41.799> I<00:02:42.799> also

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
some time now it is quite large I also

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.980 
some time now it is quite large I also
have<00:02:44.049> Carolina<00:02:45.049> Reaper<00:02:45.530> Peppa's
