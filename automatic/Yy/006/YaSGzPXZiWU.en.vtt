00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
rhythm then you've got your first shot

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.630 
rhythm then you've got your first shot
at<00:02:03.840> actually<00:02:04.110> playing<00:02:04.560> songs<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.220> sounding

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
good because if it doesn't have rhythm

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.810 
good because if it doesn't have rhythm
it's<00:02:07.380> good<00:02:07.560> not<00:02:07.710> going<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:07.980> sound<00:02:08.160> musical

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.090 
it's good not going to sound musical
right<00:02:09.050> so<00:02:10.050> you're<00:02:10.230> going<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.440> sound<00:02:10.740> good

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
right so you're going to sound good

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.070 
right so you're going to sound good
right<00:02:11.130> away<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.000> that's<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.780> think<00:02:12.810> that's

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
right away and that's I think that's

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.450 
right away and that's I think that's
really<00:02:13.440> important<00:02:13.890> for<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.040> lot<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.250> people

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
really important for a lot of people

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.830 
really important for a lot of people
because<00:02:14.760> then<00:02:15.120> they<00:02:15.360> don't<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.690> listen

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
because then they don't have to listen

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.780 
because then they don't have to listen
to<00:02:16.050> their<00:02:16.170> inner<00:02:16.380> critic<00:02:16.650> saying<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.640> we'll

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
to their inner critic saying that we'll

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.850 
to their inner critic saying that we'll
never<00:02:18.000> be<00:02:18.270> able<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.600> get<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.840> or<00:02:19.320> they<00:02:19.560> sound

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
never be able to get it or they sound

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.160 
never be able to get it or they sound
terrible<00:02:20.460> or<00:02:20.880> discouraging<00:02:21.600> friends<00:02:22.050> and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
terrible or discouraging friends and
