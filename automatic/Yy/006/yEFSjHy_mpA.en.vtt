00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
second but the last chord is C seven all

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.520 
second but the last chord is C seven all
right<00:04:21.130> that's<00:04:22.130> all<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.610> will<00:04:23.030> play<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.199> whole

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
thing one more time let's move on now to

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.680 
thing one more time let's move on now to
the<00:04:45.080> pre-chorus<00:04:45.610> it's<00:04:46.610> in<00:04:46.940> truth<00:04:47.270> quite

the pre-chorus it's in truth quite
simple<00:04:48.229> to<00:04:48.889> calls<00:04:49.340> only<00:04:49.729> two<00:04:49.880> power<00:04:50.180> calls<00:04:50.479> and

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
simple to calls only two power calls and

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.370 
simple to calls only two power calls and
only<00:04:52.039> downstrokes<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:53.330> first<00:04:53.570> one<00:04:53.810> is<00:04:54.050> a

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
only downstrokes the first one is a
