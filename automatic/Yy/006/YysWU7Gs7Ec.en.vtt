for long like that so you've got four
here<00:00:48.500> too<00:00:48.890> deep<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:49.280> then<00:00:49.460> you<00:00:49.610> will<00:00:49.700> need<00:00:49.850> two

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
here too deep and then you will need two

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.459 
here too deep and then you will need two
extra<00:00:50.180> feet<00:00:50.510> want<00:00:50.870> to<00:00:50.930> make<00:00:51.020> them<00:00:51.110> one<00:00:51.290> deep

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
extra feet want to make them one deep

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.529 
extra feet want to make them one deep
this<00:00:51.620> times<00:00:51.890> you've<00:00:52.070> got<00:00:52.160> total<00:00:52.340> of<00:00:52.550> six<00:00:52.789> for

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
it's too deep and dig a step out like

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.689 
it's too deep and dig a step out like
that<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.829> then<00:01:00.920> we<00:01:01.010> want<00:01:01.160> to<00:01:01.219> do<00:01:01.280> is<00:01:01.460> leave<00:01:01.670> the

that and then we want to do is leave the

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.270 
that and then we want to do is leave the
backspace<00:01:02.510> empty<00:01:02.989> where<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.710> step<00:01:03.920> is<00:01:04.070> and

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
backspace empty where the step is and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.040 
backspace empty where the step is and
then<00:01:04.699> your<00:01:04.820> place<00:01:04.970> two<00:01:05.270> pistons<00:01:05.690> just<00:01:05.930> in

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
brick on top of a piston and you just

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.510 
brick on top of a piston and you just
place<00:01:15.140> redstone<00:01:15.409> to<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.799> back<00:01:15.950> there<00:01:16.220> of<00:01:16.400> the

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
place redstone to the back there of the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.730 
place redstone to the back there of the
step<00:01:16.760> around<00:01:17.479> on<00:01:17.720> top<00:01:17.840> of<00:01:17.990> there<00:01:18.140> you<00:01:18.530> want<00:01:18.680> to

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
step around on top of there you want to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.800 
step around on top of there you want to
leave<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:18.890> gap<00:01:19.189> between<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.760> TNT<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.510> the<00:01:20.659> red

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
leave a gap between the TNT and the red

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.060 
leave a gap between the TNT and the red
stone<00:01:21.020> because<00:01:21.290> otherwise<00:01:21.439> it<00:01:21.710> will<00:01:21.799> activate

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
stone because otherwise it will activate

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.130 
stone because otherwise it will activate
and<00:01:22.220> blow<00:01:22.580> us<00:01:22.700> up<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:23.720> want<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:23.930> run<00:01:24.049> it

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
and blow us up and you want to run it

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.100 
and blow us up and you want to run it
down<00:01:24.290> here<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:24.970> along<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.330> then<00:01:26.689> to<00:01:26.930> there

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
down here and along and then to there

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.330 
down here and along and then to there
and<00:01:27.380> then<00:01:27.439> we<00:01:27.680> will<00:01:27.799> put<00:01:27.890> I'll<00:01:28.009> leave<00:01:28.189> it<00:01:28.310> on

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
and then we will put I'll leave it on

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.429 
and then we will put I'll leave it on
here<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.150> idea<00:01:29.299> is<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.630> you<00:01:29.780> stand<00:01:30.140> here

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
here and the idea is that you stand here

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.560 
here and the idea is that you stand here
and<00:01:31.040> when<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:31.400> activate<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.790> lever<00:01:31.970> it

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
and when you activate the lever it

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.510 
and when you activate the lever it
pushes<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.140> TNT<00:01:33.530> on<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:34.040> you<00:01:34.369> then

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
pushes the TNT on to you and you then

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.880 
pushes the TNT on to you and you then
are<00:01:34.670> inside<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.299> TNT<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.470> can<00:01:36.619> see

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
are inside the TNT and you can see

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.499 
are inside the TNT and you can see
through<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.280> map<00:01:37.579> and<00:01:37.820> through<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.299> caves

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
through the map and through the caves

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.270 
through the map and through the caves
etc<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:39.470> I'm<00:01:39.530> go<00:01:39.619> ahead<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.009> show<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:40.159> guys

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
etc so I'm go ahead and show you guys

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.170 
etc so I'm go ahead and show you guys
the<00:01:41.079> x-ray<00:01:42.079> working<00:01:42.500> in<00:01:42.650> action<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:43.310> let<00:01:44.150> me

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
the x-ray working in action so let me

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.730 
the x-ray working in action so let me
just<00:01:44.360> dig<00:01:44.509> some<00:01:44.630> more<00:01:44.659> TNT<00:01:45.020> on<00:01:45.200> there<00:01:45.470> and

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
just dig some more TNT on there and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.499 
just dig some more TNT on there and
you'll<00:01:46.009> have<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.250> block<00:01:46.490> handy<00:01:46.909> because<00:01:47.270> when

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
you'll have a block handy because when

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:48.969 
you'll have a block handy because when
you<00:01:47.600> activate<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.110> you'll<00:01:48.380> see<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:48.680> can<00:01:48.829> see

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
you activate this you'll see you can see

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.010 
you activate this you'll see you can see
through<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.250> map<00:01:49.460> or<00:01:49.640> wherever<00:01:49.850> but<00:01:50.540> then<00:01:50.960> if

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
through the map or wherever but then if

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.270 
through the map or wherever but then if
you<00:01:51.110> place<00:01:51.290> it<00:01:51.470> if<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:51.619> back<00:01:51.799> off<00:01:51.829> and<00:01:52.130> place<00:01:52.250> a

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
you place it if you back off and place a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.560 
you place it if you back off and place a
block<00:01:52.490> there<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:52.850> can<00:01:52.970> see<00:01:53.000> that<00:01:53.119> little<00:01:53.390> bit

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
block there you can see that little bit

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.940 
block there you can see that little bit
extra<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.020> it's<00:01:54.110> just<00:01:54.229> a<00:01:54.290> bit<00:01:54.409> handy<00:01:54.619> tab<00:01:54.829> that

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
extra so it's just a bit handy tab that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.399 
extra so it's just a bit handy tab that
around<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:55.850> I<00:01:56.570> didn't<00:01:56.990> even<00:01:57.170> know<00:01:57.229> that<00:01:57.259> was

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
around and I didn't even know that was

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.170 
around and I didn't even know that was
there<00:01:57.560> guys<00:01:57.829> as<00:01:58.070> you<00:01:58.130> can<00:01:58.340> see<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.729> works<00:01:58.909> quite

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
there guys as you can see it works quite

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.760 
there guys as you can see it works quite
well<00:01:59.240> for<00:01:59.509> finding<00:01:59.840> everything<00:02:00.079> there's<00:02:00.649> an

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
well for finding everything there's an

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.310 
well for finding everything there's an
ender<00:02:00.979> portal<00:02:01.280> right<00:02:01.460> there<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:03.140> know<00:02:03.259> you

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
ender portal right there you know you

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.510 
ender portal right there you know you
can<00:02:03.500> find<00:02:03.680> diamonds<00:02:04.070> you<00:02:04.130> find<00:02:04.310> what<00:02:04.430> I've

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
can find diamonds you find what I've

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.950 
can find diamonds you find what I've
obviously<00:02:04.640> those<00:02:05.030> diamonds<00:02:05.329> or<00:02:05.630> stuff<00:02:05.780> over

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
obviously those diamonds or stuff over

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.359 
obviously those diamonds or stuff over
there<00:02:06.049> you'll<00:02:06.229> be<00:02:06.320> able<00:02:06.409> to<00:02:06.560> see<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:06.799> you<00:02:07.219> can

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
there you'll be able to see it you can

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.680 
there you'll be able to see it you can
see<00:02:07.520> where<00:02:07.640> all<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.820> cave<00:02:08.030> systems<00:02:08.479> are

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
see where all the cave systems are

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.930 
see where all the cave systems are
there's<00:02:09.079> quite<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.380> lot<00:02:09.590> quite<00:02:10.160> close<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.670> us<00:02:10.790> so

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
there's quite a lot quite close to us so

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.330 
there's quite a lot quite close to us so
we<00:02:10.970> can't<00:02:11.269> really<00:02:11.299> see<00:02:11.570> too<00:02:12.019> much<00:02:12.200> around<00:02:13.100> us

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
we can't really see too much around us

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.280 
we can't really see too much around us
but<00:02:13.579> obviously<00:02:13.970> if<00:02:14.299> there<00:02:14.720> if<00:02:14.870> there<00:02:14.900> wasn't

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
but obviously if there if there wasn't

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.660 
but obviously if there if there wasn't
so<00:02:15.410> close<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.800> be<00:02:15.860> able<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.099> see<00:02:16.220> what<00:02:16.430> was<00:02:16.580> in

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
so close to be able to see what was in

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.010 
so close to be able to see what was in
the<00:02:16.730> distance<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:17.209> you<00:02:17.270> can<00:02:17.420> see<00:02:17.540> right<00:02:17.569> there

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
the distance so you can see right there

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.330 
the distance so you can see right there
you<00:02:18.140> can<00:02:18.260> see<00:02:18.290> all<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.530> lava<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.069> stuff<00:02:19.250> like

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
you can see all the lava and stuff like

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.619 
you can see all the lava and stuff like
that<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:20.120> can<00:02:20.239> see<00:02:20.330> all<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.480> different

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
that and you can see all the different

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:21.070 
that and you can see all the different
case

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
case

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.230 
case
systems<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.550> if<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:22.760> did<00:02:22.910> this<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.060> bit

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
systems and you if you did this a bit

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.520 
systems and you if you did this a bit
deeper<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:23.720> wouldn't<00:02:23.930> see<00:02:24.080> all<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.290> stuff

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
deeper you wouldn't see all this stuff

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.830 
deeper you wouldn't see all this stuff
on<00:02:24.650> top<00:02:25.040> you'd<00:02:25.370> solve<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:26.090> might<00:02:26.270> like<00:02:26.630> if<00:02:26.720> you

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
on top you'd solve you might like if you

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.510 
on top you'd solve you might like if you
have<00:02:26.960> a<00:02:26.990> deeper<00:02:27.410> do<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:27.770> if<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.190> don't<00:02:28.370> like

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
have a deeper do this if you don't like

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.100 
have a deeper do this if you don't like
inside<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:28.850> cave<00:02:29.060> whatever<00:02:29.390> then<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.780> can<00:02:29.960> see

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
inside a cave whatever then you can see

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.370 
inside a cave whatever then you can see
a<00:02:30.140> bit<00:02:30.200> more<00:02:30.320> around<00:02:30.770> you<00:02:31.570> but<00:02:32.570> that's<00:02:33.230> the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
a bit more around you but that's the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.660 
a bit more around you but that's the
first<00:02:33.590> one<00:02:33.800> really<00:02:34.040> it's<00:02:34.190> very<00:02:34.400> very<00:02:34.640> simple

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
first one really it's very very simple

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.120 
first one really it's very very simple
very<00:02:35.030> easy<00:02:35.240> as<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.840> can<00:02:35.990> see<00:02:36.200> works<00:02:36.770> very<00:02:37.070> well

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
very easy as you can see works very well

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.400 
very easy as you can see works very well
to<00:02:37.400> help<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:37.670> find<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:38.060> lot<00:02:38.270> of<00:02:38.330> cool<00:02:38.510> stuff<00:02:38.540> the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
second one is a little bit different I'm

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.940 
second one is a little bit different I'm
go<00:02:41.150> ahead<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.690> swap<00:02:42.080> my<00:02:42.260> items<00:02:42.530> out<00:02:42.710> so<00:02:42.860> you

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
go ahead and swap my items out so you

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.950 
go ahead and swap my items out so you
can<00:02:43.070> see<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.550> second<00:02:43.880> one<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.390> second<00:02:44.720> one<00:02:44.750> is

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
can see the second one the second one is

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.980 
can see the second one the second one is
just<00:02:45.260> using<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.860> minecart<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.940> piece<00:02:47.540> of<00:02:47.570> track

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
just using a minecart a piece of track

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.010 
just using a minecart a piece of track
and<00:02:48.200> some<00:02:48.590> dmt<00:02:49.570> I'm<00:02:50.570> going<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.780> go<00:02:50.840> ahead<00:02:50.900> and

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
and some dmt I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.350 
and some dmt I'm going to go ahead and
get<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.530> torch<00:02:51.950> as<00:02:52.370> well<00:02:52.520> so<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.850> guys<00:02:53.090> can<00:02:53.300> see

on top and then you're a piece of tnt
just<00:03:18.920> above<00:03:19.100> it<00:03:19.250> then<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.120> want<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.300> use<00:03:20.420> the

just above it then you want to use the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.050 
just above it then you want to use the
stone<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:21.140> so<00:03:21.800> you<00:03:21.860> need<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.280> use<00:03:22.610> some<00:03:22.760> stones

stone you so you need to use some stones
as<00:03:23.180> well<00:03:23.330> from<00:03:23.450> understand<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:23.930> do<00:03:24.110> some

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
as well from understand you do some

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
why i said it's going to get dark so as

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.720 
why i said it's going to get dark so as
you<00:03:27.200> can<00:03:27.290> see<00:03:27.410> we<00:03:27.530> just<00:03:27.739> got<00:03:27.890> them<00:03:28.280> two<00:03:28.340> blocked

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
you can see we just got them two blocked

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.490 
you can see we just got them two blocked
in<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:29.269> one<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.720> then<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.290> wanna<00:03:30.410> go

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
in and this one and then you wanna go

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.900 
in and this one and then you wanna go
ahead<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.830> climb<00:03:31.040> in<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.340> mine<00:03:31.519> cart<00:03:31.760> and

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
ahead and climb in the mine cart and

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.060 
ahead and climb in the mine cart and
then<00:03:32.810> as<00:03:33.110> you<00:03:33.230> know<00:03:33.350> as<00:03:33.410> you<00:03:33.500> can<00:03:33.709> see<00:03:33.860> through

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
then as you know as you can see through

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.530 
then as you know as you can see through
everything<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.459> if<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.820> just<00:03:35.030> place<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.209> stone

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
everything and if you just place a stone

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.759 
everything and if you just place a stone
block<00:03:35.750> outside<00:03:35.959> of<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:36.320> there<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.620> can<00:03:36.739> see

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
block outside of you there you can see

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.860 
block outside of you there you can see
again<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.340> this<00:03:37.730> one<00:03:37.970> I<00:03:38.180> think<00:03:38.239> is<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.690> bit

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
again and this one I think is a bit

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.170 
again and this one I think is a bit
better<00:03:39.050> because<00:03:39.590> like<00:03:40.190> one<00:03:40.400> tragedy<00:03:40.760> inside<00:03:41.150> a

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
better because like one tragedy inside a

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.240 
better because like one tragedy inside a
cave<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:41.870> can<00:03:42.050> see<00:03:42.230> all<00:03:42.260> around<00:03:42.560> you<00:03:42.950> you<00:03:43.100> can

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
cave you can see all around you you can

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.710 
cave you can see all around you you can
see<00:03:43.430> obviously<00:03:43.760> above<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.180> out<00:03:44.300> to<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.480> real

can<00:03:49.970> see<00:03:50.120> like<00:03:50.420> 360<00:03:51.140> degrees<00:03:51.440> all<00:03:51.470> around

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
can see like 360 degrees all around

can see like 360 degrees all around
Josie<00:03:52.280> apart<00:03:52.550> from<00:03:52.670> where<00:03:52.790> we<00:03:52.880> dug<00:03:53.060> down<00:03:53.269> there

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
Josie apart from where we dug down there

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
if you're in a cave and you don't really

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.170 
if you're in a cave and you don't really
know<00:03:57.140> where<00:03:57.320> to<00:03:57.500> go<00:03:57.650> from<00:03:57.860> there<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.340> as<00:03:59.060> you
