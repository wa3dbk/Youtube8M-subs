00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello friends welcome to this new 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.270
 part of games for android 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.330
 I think the greeting I give is already boring 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.480
 always hahaha but I do not have another hahaha 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.389
 but hey, he was looking for games and the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.279
 true that I did find and many are not 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.980
 of the best in graphics but they are 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.560
 entertaining by the way I'll put three 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.199
 repeated games because that's what I 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.029
 I imagine they will see and well the reason is 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.140
 because in the first videos that I uploaded 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.640
 I put those games 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.480
 but I did not even give a brief 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.280
 description of them I did not say anything 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.100
 I just said this is good the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.559
 game and has good graphics indeed 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.360
 I think that video lasted a minute and for 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.600
 fix what I did not say I put them here 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.850
 of course not only those three that I mentioned 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.739
 I will put in this video I will also add more 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.210
 but well I do not delay them anymore and 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.210
 let's start with the games 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.839
 age of zombies the only thing we have to 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.450
 to do is kill a number of zombies 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.610
 until dinosaurs the kind of this game 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.350
 I think it's the same jetpack game 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.720
 hear and their levels are very 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.000
 entertained and its playability is 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.550
 acceptable for those who like 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.070
 bloody games this is one of these 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.830
 only that the blood is not so detailed 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.940
 hahaha the game does not use chain fire and without 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.940
 Doubt is very good 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.760
 reckless that is cool is a game where 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.770
 first start where a thief steals a 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.780
 bank and in this way we have to 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.780
 escape from security in our super 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.090
 automobile while we escape we have to 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.790
 collect all the coins that we can 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.010
 along the clear road this 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.200
 road has a limit and safety 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.850
 it does not just chase us but 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.190
 they also try to turn the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.380
 automobile and not only that there is also more 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.540
 cars on the road to which 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.209
 we have to dodge giving us a good 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.489
 level of difficulty excelling us a 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.950
 little of what the game brings this has 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.950
 good graphics and does not use chain fire 3d 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.850
 galp action fire 2 this game is 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.000
 characterized by its good graphics and 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.680
 for its good special effects 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.080
 we will know what it is to fly in galaxies 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.570
 and will destroy other spacecraft that 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.730
 for some reason they want to attack us in 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.160
 the game we can buy more ships 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.500
 spatial as well as different 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.320
 weapons that benefit us when it comes to 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.030
 space wars well something that they 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.430
 I have to tell is that when I open 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.350
 the game the brightness goes up to the maximum and 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.420
 it's annoying because if you do not have a 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.250
 percent percent of battery the 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.950
 game with the butt brightness could 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.740
 download the battery very fast but not 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.600
 I know if only something else happens to me is from 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.880
 that when we are playing we do not squeeze 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.320
 the back button because of this 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.200
 way we get out of the game 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.790
 completely if you use chain fire but 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.610
 everything else is pretty good 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.840
 Sincerely, it 's a very good game for 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.450
 kill the time 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.220
 tennis in the face is a very game 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.260
 similar to stupid zombie 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.450
 I would say that it deals with the same thing only 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.090
 change the character and now it 's a 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.250
 tennis ball the joke is to be able to throw 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.860
 and hit each character with a ball 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.580
 that appears to us I play the truth very 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.160
 entertaining and does not use sahin fire 3d 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.740
 be of rockets in each level we will use 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.720
 a lighter to light a rocket 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.550
 what we have to do is order the 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.980
 so that in this way all 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.980
 Estalle rockets do not use chain fire 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.080
 south park mega million air is played with 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.060
 the motion sensor or with the 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.430
 accelerometer what you have to do is 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.010
 collect a lot of money without falling 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.230
 in some obstacles the game can be 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.050
 play multiplayer this has more 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.320
 things you can check and do not use chain 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.320
 fire 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.060
 dungeon hunter I do not have many words 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.920
 for this game but the only thing I know about 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.100
 he is that we have to kill a 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.930
 series of enemies and monsters I do not know 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.510
 everything else that's why I do not even know what 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.520
 tell them hahaha one of the things that do not 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.110
 I liked this game is for not 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.960
 have the best graphics 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.030
 still use chain fire 3d is something 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.970
 absurd but good what are we going to do 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.330
 but anyway, here is the 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.330
 game 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.770
