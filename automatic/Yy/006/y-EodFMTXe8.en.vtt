00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.850
 the innovative and award-winning inner membrane christ of clayton best known 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.720
 as fifth was the first addictive crystalline waterproofing for 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.570
 concrete at the global level the most effective and efficient way to waterproof 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.000
 concrete structures 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.660
 is through the use of the fifth the presentation is in plastic buckets 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.100
 or in soluble lytro bags that are simply added to the mixture of 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.829
 concrete 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.129
 either at the processing plant or at the construction site 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.550
 the concrete treated with whom it should be treated as a normal concrete is 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.610
 say it must be mixed poured and placed according to the rules 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.729
 pass standard i 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:50.149
 and the best practices for concrete end is compatible with mixtures 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.710
 most common criminal chemicals for concrete 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.340
 even the simplest membrane systems require a certain level of 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.320
 experience to be applied and to some workers with more experience 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.230
 can make mistakes when applying the products Christ not 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.520
 they require special skills in fact the quimbo does not require any 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.530
 effort to be used 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.280
 avoiding the need to leave space for the application of membranes 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.999
 external kim offers maximum flexibility in design 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.610
 allows you to make the most of the construction site making it possible for 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.010
 you get the best value for your property 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.390
 15 is much cheaper the cost of the system is compensated with the value 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.730
 added by eliminating time and death would be needed when installing a 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.650
 outer membrane waterproofing system 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.100
 kyl continuously protect concrete from potential damage caused by the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.310
 water specifically treated with clint possesses the unique ability for the whole life of the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.200
 concrete of cars she very thin artists as they are forming and 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.930
 before they become expensive cracks that can increase your 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.220
 repair and maintenance budget you control your program 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.310
 constructive when using 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.420
 it is not necessary to wait for membranes to be installed, fill in as soon as 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.260
 conflict is ready and construction ends weeks before 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.289
 programmed 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.889
 the ability of concrete treated with who to resist 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:21.029
 extreme pressures of water from any direction is one of the 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.419
 biggest advantages of the system with this 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.729
 while external waterproofing membranes can be 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.799
 pierce and wear out over time specifically has dealt with chile is 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.669
 resistant to psychic damage and not affected by weather 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.249
 once the fifth is added to the concrete it will stay there 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:40.249
 permanently 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:44.129
 protects reinforcing steel from corruption and prevents cracks 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.989
 approaches and deterioration 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.900
 other methods for the application of crystal technology for concrete 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:56.259
 for existing concrete use kristol t1 and t2 in the form of fight here 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:57.719
 applying the concepts 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.159
 reddish o'brien to the surface of the congress to be treated in large 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.299
 flat surfaces waterproof local accomplices is doing 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.360
 products about the context stuff and ending with the winner 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.200
 In addition, products and application systems have been developed for 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.130
 the repair of concrete have been cheating waterproofing boards 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.970
 Constructive sealing of holes mooring fencing 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.639
 pipe penetrations 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.929
 in this way so it is a new construction rehabilitation of 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:33.159
 an existing structure with leak repair two systems of 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.039
 waterproofing for complete as all will give you quality reliability and 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.379
 profitability like this is this 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.789
 and the famous backup service by ayrton 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:47.359
 on your side means that we will be with you at every step to ensure that your 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:48.619
 project be 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:49.699
 a complete success
