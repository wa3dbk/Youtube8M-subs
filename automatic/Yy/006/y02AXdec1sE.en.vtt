today<00:00:01.620> on<00:00:01.800> Applied<00:00:02.070> Science<00:00:02.550> I<00:00:02.669> want<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.909> talk

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
today on Applied Science I want to talk

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.690 
today on Applied Science I want to talk
about<00:00:03.210> glass<00:00:03.629> why<00:00:04.589> it<00:00:04.650> breaks<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.250> how<00:00:05.400> we<00:00:05.460> can

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
about glass why it breaks and how we can

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.909 
about glass why it breaks and how we can
strengthen<00:00:05.940> it<00:00:06.210> with<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.359> chemical<00:00:06.690> process<00:00:07.049> so

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
strengthen it with a chemical process so

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.290 
strengthen it with a chemical process so
to<00:00:07.980> get<00:00:08.130> started<00:00:08.490> let<00:00:08.610> me<00:00:08.639> show<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.059> rig

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
to get started let me show you this rig

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.120 
to get started let me show you this rig
that<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.570> built<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.929> test<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.740> strength<00:00:10.889> of

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
that I built to test the strength of

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.870 
that I built to test the strength of
these<00:00:11.250> glass<00:00:11.519> samples<00:00:13.160> here<00:00:14.160> we<00:00:14.280> have<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> rigid

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
these glass samples here we have a rigid

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.359 
these glass samples here we have a rigid
aluminum<00:00:15.089> frame<00:00:15.750> with<00:00:16.230> two<00:00:16.260> fixed<00:00:16.949> aluminum

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
aluminum frame with two fixed aluminum

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.790 
aluminum frame with two fixed aluminum
bars<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> bottom<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:19.320> pneumatic

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
bars on the bottom and a pneumatic

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.590 
bars on the bottom and a pneumatic
cylinder<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.460> top<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.090> cylinder<00:00:21.510> is

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
cylinder on the top and the cylinder is

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.859 
cylinder on the top and the cylinder is
connected<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:23.130> bar<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.539> when<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.689> add

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
connected to this bar here so when I add

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.230 
connected to this bar here so when I add
pressure<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> cylinder<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.460> pushes<00:00:26.970> down

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
pressure to the cylinder it pushes down

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.630 
pressure to the cylinder it pushes down
on<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.720> middle<00:00:27.900> bar<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.500> puts<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.279> piece<00:00:29.460> of

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
on this middle bar and puts the piece of

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.490 
on this middle bar and puts the piece of
glass<00:00:29.910> which<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> microscope<00:00:30.900> slide<00:00:31.140> in

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
glass which is a microscope slide in

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.229 
glass which is a microscope slide in
bending<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.130> eventually<00:00:32.940> when<00:00:33.059> there's

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
bending and eventually when there's

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.880 
bending and eventually when there's
enough<00:00:33.450> force<00:00:33.750> being<00:00:34.050> generated<00:00:34.590> by<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
enough force being generated by the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.389 
enough force being generated by the
cylinder<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.520> snaps<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.030> slide<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:37.399> can

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
cylinder it snaps the slide I can

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.069 
cylinder it snaps the slide I can
control<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> pressure<00:00:39.090> very<00:00:39.450> carefully<00:00:39.930> by

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
control the pressure very carefully by

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.380 
control the pressure very carefully by
dialing<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.739> regulator<00:00:41.280> here<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
dialing up the regulator here and the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.880 
dialing up the regulator here and the
gauge<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.379> will<00:00:43.559> show<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
gauge here and here will show the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.940 
gauge here and here will show the
pressure<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> system<00:00:45.410> all<00:00:46.410> right<00:00:46.590> so

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
pressure in the system all right so

00:00:46.950 --> 00:01:01.900 
pressure in the system all right so
let's<00:00:47.100> give<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.399> go

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.560 

okay<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:02.970> that<00:01:03.300> held<00:01:03.570> about<00:01:03.870> 24<00:01:04.800> psi<00:01:05.570> before

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
okay so that held about 24 psi before

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.250 
okay so that held about 24 psi before
breaking<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.400> I'll<00:01:08.550> unload<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.300> pressure

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
breaking so I'll unload the pressure

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.050 
breaking so I'll unload the pressure
here<00:01:11.450> clean<00:01:12.450> out<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.810> glass<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:16.100> I'll<00:01:17.100> wipe

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
here clean out the glass and I'll wipe

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.060 
here clean out the glass and I'll wipe
off<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.540> surface<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.590> there<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.890> make<00:01:20.040> sure

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
off the surface is there to make sure

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.859 
off the surface is there to make sure
that<00:01:20.280> there's<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.759> little<00:01:21.119> glass<00:01:21.360> grit<00:01:21.780> as

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
that there's as little glass grit as

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.980 
that there's as little glass grit as
possible<00:01:22.440> and<00:01:23.149> now<00:01:24.149> I'll<00:01:24.300> try<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
possible and now I'll try one of the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.840 
possible and now I'll try one of the
microscope<00:01:25.500> slides<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.220> treated<00:01:26.610> with

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
microscope slides that I treated with

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.310 
microscope slides that I treated with
the<00:01:26.970> chemical<00:01:27.360> process<00:01:27.840> which<00:01:28.050> I'll<00:01:28.170> talk

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
the chemical process which I'll talk

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:38.719 
the chemical process which I'll talk
about<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.740> minute<00:01:36.950> okay<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.399> broke

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
about in a minute okay so that one broke

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.200 
about in a minute okay so that one broke
at<00:01:38.940> about<00:01:39.200> 60<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.350> 70<00:01:40.380> psi<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.789> process

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
at about 60 to 70 psi so the process

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.029 
at about 60 to 70 psi so the process
really<00:01:42.570> increases<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.410> strength<00:01:43.679> quite<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
really increases the strength quite a

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.499 
really increases the strength quite a
bit<00:01:44.280> let's<00:01:44.759> talk<00:01:44.940> about<00:01:45.060> what's<00:01:45.330> actually

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
bit let's talk about what's actually

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.950 
bit let's talk about what's actually
going<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:46.020> here<00:01:47.119> when<00:01:48.119> we<00:01:48.270> bend<00:01:48.539> one<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
going on here when we bend one of the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.050 
going on here when we bend one of the
microscope<00:01:49.500> slides<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.160> this<00:01:50.310> test<00:01:50.640> unit

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
microscope slides in this test unit

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.910 
microscope slides in this test unit
what's<00:01:51.539> actually<00:01:51.750> happening<00:01:52.410> is<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.679> top<00:01:52.890> of

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
what's actually happening is the top of

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.160 
what's actually happening is the top of
the<00:01:53.130> slide<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:53.910> compression<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.050> see

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the slide is in compression you can see

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.139 
the slide is in compression you can see
the<00:01:55.320> lines<00:01:55.530> move<00:01:55.770> closer<00:01:56.100> together<00:01:56.369> here<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
the lines move closer together here and

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.649 
the lines move closer together here and
the<00:01:57.659> bottom<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.170> slide<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.830> in<00:01:59.039> tension

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
the bottom of the slide is in tension

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.080 
the bottom of the slide is in tension
now<00:02:00.659> glass<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.920> most<00:02:02.190> brittle<00:02:02.550> materials

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
now glass like most brittle materials

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.029 
now glass like most brittle materials
can<00:02:03.360> handle<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.929> compression<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.739> fine

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
can handle the compression just fine

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.740 
can handle the compression just fine
it's<00:02:05.340> actually<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.819> tension<00:02:06.270> that's<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.539> big

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
it's actually the tension that's a big

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.199 
it's actually the tension that's a big
problem<00:02:07.349> and<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.340> reason<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.789> all

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
problem and the reason is that all

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.390 
problem and the reason is that all
pieces<00:02:09.630> of<00:02:09.959> glass<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.709> world<00:02:10.950> have

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
pieces of glass in the world have

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.930 
pieces of glass in the world have
microscopic<00:02:12.209> defects<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.260> them<00:02:13.730> tiny<00:02:14.730> little

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
microscopic defects in them tiny little

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.690 
microscopic defects in them tiny little
cracks<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.690> when<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.440> bend<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.250> piece<00:02:17.459> like

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
cracks and when we bend the piece like

this<00:02:17.940> those<00:02:18.209> little<00:02:18.510> cracks<00:02:18.870> propagate

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
this those little cracks propagate

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.290 
this those little cracks propagate

these tension forces let me show you

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.309 
these tension forces let me show you
with<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> piece<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.330> packing<00:02:24.870> tape<00:02:26.330> if<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:28.020> pull

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
with a piece of packing tape if I pull

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.470 
with a piece of packing tape if I pull
on<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.620> tape<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.129> this<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:30.090> know<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.209> can

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
on the tape like this you know I can

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.790 
on the tape like this you know I can
feel<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.810> stretching<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.319> bit<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:31.680> it's

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
feel it stretching a bit but it's

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.470 
feel it stretching a bit but it's
certainly<00:02:32.099> not<00:02:32.220> breaking<00:02:32.879> it's<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:33.300> quite

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
certainly not breaking it's it's quite

certainly not breaking it's it's quite
strong<00:02:34.099> however<00:02:35.099> if<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:35.730> introduce<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.840> defect

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
strong however if I introduce a defect

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.380 
strong however if I introduce a defect
just<00:02:37.440> by<00:02:37.770> slicing<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:38.550> little<00:02:38.730> bit<00:02:38.940> with<00:02:39.360> a

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
just by slicing it a little bit with a

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.780 
just by slicing it a little bit with a
pair<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.720> scissors<00:02:39.989> so<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.590> there's<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.860> cut

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
pair of scissors so that there's a cut

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.970 
pair of scissors so that there's a cut
in<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.090> now<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.270> can<00:02:42.540> see<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.840> defect<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.530> I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
in it now you can see the defect and I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.250 
in it now you can see the defect and I
just<00:02:44.190> pull<00:02:44.430> on<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.760> there's<00:02:45.540> no<00:02:45.720> strength<00:02:46.080> at

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
just pull on it there's no strength at

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260 
just pull on it there's no strength at
all<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:47.370> could<00:02:47.520> say<00:02:47.700> yeah<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
all and you could say yeah but the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.970 
all and you could say yeah but the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
tape is still as strong as it always was

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.949 
tape is still as strong as it always was
I<00:02:52.230> just<00:02:52.440> added<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.770> defect<00:02:53.430> but<00:02:54.330> remember<00:02:54.780> in

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
I just added that defect but remember in

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.949 
I just added that defect but remember in
materials<00:02:55.500> like<00:02:55.709> glass<00:02:55.950> there<00:02:56.910> are<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.569> huge

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959

they're distributed throughout the

they're distributed throughout the

that we encounter in the world so if we

that we encounter in the world so if we

what<00:03:25.740> can<00:03:25.890> we<00:03:26.040> do<00:03:26.220> as<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:27.120> turns<00:03:27.330> out<00:03:27.510> with

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
what can we do as it turns out with

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.080 
what can we do as it turns out with
current<00:03:28.020> technology<00:03:28.650> for<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:28.980> given<00:03:29.340> size<00:03:29.790> of

current technology for a given size of

current technology for a given size of
glass<00:03:30.690> we<00:03:31.110> actually<00:03:31.470> can't<00:03:31.739> reduce<00:03:32.100> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
glass we actually can't reduce the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.460 
glass we actually can't reduce the
number<00:03:32.610> of<00:03:32.760> defects<00:03:33.239> we<00:03:33.840> can<00:03:33.989> treat<00:03:34.230> them

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
number of defects we can treat them

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.229 
number of defects we can treat them
almost<00:03:34.739> as<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.069> material<00:03:35.550> property<00:03:36.060> the

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
almost as a material property the

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.120 
almost as a material property the
defects<00:03:36.660> in<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.900> glass<00:03:37.140> are<00:03:37.530> one<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.069> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
defects in the glass are one and the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.430 
defects in the glass are one and the
same<00:03:38.480> so<00:03:39.480> what<00:03:39.660> else<00:03:39.780> can<00:03:39.959> we<00:03:40.110> do

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
same so what else can we do

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.590 
same so what else can we do
well<00:03:40.890> we<00:03:41.040> identify<00:03:41.520> that<00:03:41.760> compression<00:03:42.270> is

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
well we identify that compression is

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.750 
well we identify that compression is
easy<00:03:42.930> for<00:03:43.290> glass<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.739> handle<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.250> tension<00:03:44.670> is

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
easy for glass to handle the tension is

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.460 
easy for glass to handle the tension is
a<00:03:44.790> problem<00:03:45.239> because<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.630> pulls<00:03:45.840> open<00:03:46.080> those

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
a problem because it pulls open those

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.190 
a problem because it pulls open those
those<00:03:46.890> defects<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.640> causes<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.120> failure

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
those defects and causes a failure

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.080 
those defects and causes a failure
so<00:03:49.830> if<00:03:49.920> we<00:03:50.010> could<00:03:50.130> somehow<00:03:50.280> eliminate<00:03:50.760> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
so if we could somehow eliminate the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.880 
so if we could somehow eliminate the
tension<00:03:51.510> force<00:03:51.870> then<00:03:52.380> we<00:03:52.410> could<00:03:52.680> effectively

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
tension force then we could effectively

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.490 
tension force then we could effectively
make<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.489> material<00:03:53.970> stronger<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.690> there's<00:03:55.440> a

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
make the material stronger and there's a

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.110 
make the material stronger and there's a
clever<00:03:55.769> way<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.010> do<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.459> with<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.760> chemical

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
clever way to do this with a chemical

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.509 
clever way to do this with a chemical
process<00:04:00.080> most<00:04:01.080> common<00:04:01.500> pieces<00:04:01.890> of<00:04:02.040> glass<00:04:02.250> in

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
process most common pieces of glass in

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.520 
process most common pieces of glass in
the<00:04:02.550> world<00:04:02.819> have<00:04:03.060> had<00:04:03.090> sodium<00:04:03.750> added<00:04:04.170> to<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.500> to

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
the world have had sodium added to it to

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.160 
the world have had sodium added to it to
lower<00:04:05.010> its<00:04:05.280> melting<00:04:05.700> temperature<00:04:06.300> so<00:04:06.870> pure

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
lower its melting temperature so pure

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.740 
lower its melting temperature so pure
silicon<00:04:07.680> dioxide<00:04:07.830> is<00:04:08.489> great<00:04:09.090> but<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:09.390> melts<00:04:09.660> at

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
silicon dioxide is great but it melts at

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.270 
silicon dioxide is great but it melts at
such<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.959> high<00:04:10.140> temperature<00:04:10.530> it's<00:04:10.830> difficult

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
such a high temperature it's difficult

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.729 
such a high temperature it's difficult
to<00:04:11.370> work<00:04:11.519> with<00:04:11.580> so<00:04:12.420> we<00:04:12.569> add<00:04:12.690> sodium<00:04:12.989> oxide<00:04:13.290> in

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
to work with so we add sodium oxide in

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.259 
to work with so we add sodium oxide in
addition<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.280> lots<00:04:14.459> of<00:04:14.610> other<00:04:14.760> things<00:04:14.850> to

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
addition to lots of other things to

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.530 
addition to lots of other things to
lower<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.690> melting<00:04:16.049> temperature<00:04:17.239> so<00:04:18.239> here's

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
lower the melting temperature so here's

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.780 
lower the melting temperature so here's
a<00:04:18.620> diagram<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.950> what<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.340> might<00:04:20.519> look<00:04:20.549> like

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
a diagram of what that might look like

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.600 
a diagram of what that might look like
this<00:04:21.150> is<00:04:21.299> a<00:04:21.329> slab<00:04:21.660> of<00:04:21.690> glass<00:04:21.989> here<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.680> the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
this is a slab of glass here and the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.060 
this is a slab of glass here and the
small<00:04:23.940> circles<00:04:24.390> inside<00:04:24.750> are<00:04:25.110> sodium<00:04:25.440> atoms

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
small circles inside are sodium atoms

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.850 
small circles inside are sodium atoms
and<00:04:26.539> this<00:04:27.539> chemical<00:04:27.930> trick<00:04:28.320> involves

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
and this chemical trick involves

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.670 
and this chemical trick involves
submerging<00:04:29.640> the<00:04:29.789> piece<00:04:29.970> of<00:04:30.180> glass<00:04:30.479> in<00:04:30.870> a

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
submerging the piece of glass in a

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.610 
submerging the piece of glass in a
potassium<00:04:32.400> salt<00:04:33.060> so<00:04:33.570> these<00:04:33.720> larger<00:04:34.140> circles

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
potassium salt so these larger circles

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.490 
potassium salt so these larger circles
are<00:04:34.860> potassium<00:04:35.580> atoms<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.410> through<00:04:37.410> the

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
are potassium atoms and through the

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.070 
are potassium atoms and through the
natural<00:04:37.650> process<00:04:38.460> of<00:04:38.580> diffusion<00:04:39.030> some<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:39.960> the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
natural process of diffusion some of the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.840 
natural process of diffusion some of the
potassium<00:04:40.440> atoms<00:04:40.830> will<00:04:41.190> take<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.610> place<00:04:41.820> of

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
potassium atoms will take the place of

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.440 
potassium atoms will take the place of
the<00:04:42.180> sodium<00:04:42.600> atoms<00:04:42.960> in<00:04:43.229> the<00:04:43.770> piece<00:04:43.950> of<00:04:44.160> glass

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
the sodium atoms in the piece of glass

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.210 
the sodium atoms in the piece of glass
so<00:04:45.450> what's<00:04:45.630> happening<00:04:46.020> here<00:04:46.260> is<00:04:46.380> these<00:04:46.590> larger

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
so what's happening here is these larger

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.490 
so what's happening here is these larger
potassium<00:04:47.940> atoms<00:04:48.419> are<00:04:48.570> being<00:04:48.750> shoved<00:04:49.200> into

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
potassium atoms are being shoved into

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.230 
potassium atoms are being shoved into
the<00:04:49.650> spaces<00:04:50.220> where<00:04:50.370> there<00:04:50.520> used<00:04:50.729> to<00:04:50.820> be<00:04:50.880> just<00:04:51.120> a

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
the spaces where there used to be just a

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.230 
the spaces where there used to be just a
very<00:04:51.270> small<00:04:51.750> sodium<00:04:52.350> atom<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.729> effect<00:04:54.060> is

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
very small sodium atom and the effect is

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.320 
very small sodium atom and the effect is
that<00:04:54.419> were<00:04:54.539> basically<00:04:54.990> shoved<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.250> glass<00:04:56.520> put

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
that were basically shoved the glass put

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.210 
that were basically shoved the glass put
the<00:04:57.479> glass<00:04:57.690> in<00:04:57.720> compression<00:04:58.380> by<00:04:58.680> jamming

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
the glass in compression by jamming

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.850 
the glass in compression by jamming
these<00:04:59.370> larger<00:04:59.850> atoms<00:05:00.270> inside<00:05:00.810> of<00:05:01.020> it<00:05:01.140> now<00:05:01.710> this

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
these larger atoms inside of it now this

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.580 
these larger atoms inside of it now this
process<00:05:02.130> happens<00:05:02.789> at<00:05:03.060> a<00:05:03.330> temperature<00:05:03.990> lower

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
process happens at a temperature lower

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.500 
process happens at a temperature lower
than<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:05.070> glass<00:05:05.280> softening<00:05:05.970> point<00:05:06.180> so<00:05:06.419> the

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
than the glass softening point so the

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.270 
than the glass softening point so the
glass<00:05:06.690> is<00:05:06.750> still<00:05:07.200> hard<00:05:07.800> when<00:05:08.039> this<00:05:08.160> is

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
glass is still hard when this is

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.279 
glass is still hard when this is
happening<00:05:08.460> and<00:05:08.940> as<00:05:09.390> we're<00:05:09.570> shoving<00:05:09.840> in<00:05:10.110> these

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
happening and as we're shoving in these

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.680 
happening and as we're shoving in these
larger<00:05:10.740> atoms<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.729> glass<00:05:11.970> is<00:05:12.240> becoming

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
larger atoms the glass is becoming

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.219 
larger atoms the glass is becoming
increasingly<00:05:13.289> put<00:05:14.070> into<00:05:14.310> compression

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
increasingly put into compression

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.659 
increasingly put into compression
however<00:05:16.229> the<00:05:16.440> center<00:05:16.830> of<00:05:16.950> the<00:05:17.070> glass<00:05:17.280> is<00:05:17.520> not

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
however the center of the glass is not

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.360 
however the center of the glass is not
affected<00:05:18.150> by<00:05:18.270> this<00:05:18.330> process<00:05:18.890> as<00:05:19.890> quickly

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
affected by this process as quickly

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.190 
affected by this process as quickly
because<00:05:20.849> this<00:05:21.060> is<00:05:21.180> like<00:05:21.419> a<00:05:21.450> diffusion<00:05:21.900> process

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
because this is like a diffusion process

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.810 
because this is like a diffusion process
and<00:05:22.560> so<00:05:22.860> it<00:05:22.979> takes<00:05:23.130> a<00:05:23.310> while<00:05:23.460> for<00:05:23.490> these

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
and so it takes a while for these

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.620 
and so it takes a while for these
potassium

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
potassium

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.660 
potassium
items<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:25.410> work<00:05:25.590> their<00:05:25.830> way<00:05:25.860> into<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:26.430> glass

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
items to work their way into the glass

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.300 
items to work their way into the glass
so<00:05:27.510> if<00:05:27.630> we<00:05:27.810> cancel<00:05:28.140> the<00:05:28.410> process<00:05:28.890> after<00:05:29.100> a

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
so if we cancel the process after a

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.610 
so if we cancel the process after a
certain<00:05:29.550> amount<00:05:29.820> of<00:05:30.000> time<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:31.050> center<00:05:31.410> of<00:05:31.500> the

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
certain amount of time the center of the

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.200 
certain amount of time the center of the
glass<00:05:31.710> will<00:05:32.100> not<00:05:32.220> have<00:05:32.400> this<00:05:32.580> effect<00:05:32.940> at<00:05:33.090> all

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
glass will not have this effect at all

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.420 
glass will not have this effect at all
and<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.600> edges<00:05:33.990> will<00:05:34.250> will<00:05:35.250> be<00:05:35.280> in

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
and the edges will will be in

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.500 
and the edges will will be in
compression<00:05:37.520> so<00:05:38.520> after<00:05:38.880> the<00:05:39.000> treatment<00:05:39.390> what

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
compression so after the treatment what

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.240 
compression so after the treatment what
we<00:05:39.630> have<00:05:39.870> is<00:05:40.050> something<00:05:40.290> like<00:05:40.440> this<00:05:40.800> where<00:05:41.100> the

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
we have is something like this where the

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.950 
we have is something like this where the
edges<00:05:41.670> of<00:05:41.820> the<00:05:41.940> piece<00:05:42.120> of<00:05:42.300> glass<00:05:42.540> are<00:05:42.840> in

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
edges of the piece of glass are in

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.230 
edges of the piece of glass are in
compression<00:05:43.350> and<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:44.430> center<00:05:44.820> of<00:05:44.850> the<00:05:45.030> glass

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
compression and the center of the glass

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.570 
compression and the center of the glass
is<00:05:45.540> actually<00:05:45.720> in<00:05:46.080> tension<00:05:46.620> because<00:05:47.340> of<00:05:47.460> all

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
is actually in tension because of all

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.160 
is actually in tension because of all
those<00:05:47.730> extra<00:05:48.120> atoms<00:05:48.420> that<00:05:48.570> we<00:05:48.690> jammed<00:05:48.960> in

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.170 
those extra atoms that we jammed in

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.510 
those extra atoms that we jammed in
around<00:05:49.410> the<00:05:49.560> periphery<00:05:49.950> and<00:05:49.980> this<00:05:50.190> is<00:05:50.310> true

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
around the periphery and this is true

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.190 
around the periphery and this is true
around<00:05:50.760> the<00:05:50.880> edges<00:05:51.240> do<00:05:51.450> but<00:05:51.690> I'm<00:05:51.780> just<00:05:51.960> showing

around the edges do but I'm just showing

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.220

it<00:05:52.290> in<00:05:52.410> one<00:05:52.590> direction<00:05:53.600> so<00:05:54.600> later<00:05:54.840> when<00:05:55.080> we

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
it in one direction so later when we

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.860 
it in one direction so later when we
load<00:05:55.500> the<00:05:55.650> piece<00:05:55.890> in<00:05:56.070> bending<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:57.270> top<00:05:57.540> gets

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
load the piece in bending the top gets

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.830 
load the piece in bending the top gets
to<00:05:58.020> be<00:05:58.140> even<00:05:58.920> higher<00:05:59.160> in<00:05:59.430> compression<00:06:00.060> the

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
to be even higher in compression the

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.990 
to be even higher in compression the
center<00:06:01.200> is<00:06:01.350> still<00:06:01.470> in<00:06:01.770> tension<00:06:02.280> but<00:06:02.820> the

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
center is still in tension but the

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.670 
center is still in tension but the
bottom<00:06:03.330> layer<00:06:03.540> which<00:06:03.810> would<00:06:03.990> normally<00:06:04.140> be<00:06:04.650> in

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
bottom layer which would normally be in

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.920 
bottom layer which would normally be in
tension<00:06:05.280> in<00:06:05.400> a<00:06:05.460> bending<00:06:05.850> situation<00:06:06.570> like<00:06:06.720> this

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
tension in a bending situation like this

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.290 
tension in a bending situation like this
is<00:06:07.140> now<00:06:07.320> either<00:06:07.650> neutral<00:06:07.980> or<00:06:08.250> at<00:06:08.940> least<00:06:09.120> it's

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
is now either neutral or at least it's

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.840 
is now either neutral or at least it's
offset<00:06:09.780> quite<00:06:10.050> a<00:06:10.080> bit<00:06:10.430> because<00:06:11.430> of<00:06:11.610> that

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
offset quite a bit because of that

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.220 
offset quite a bit because of that
residual<00:06:12.300> compression<00:06:12.900> is<00:06:12.990> sort<00:06:13.200> of

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
residual compression is sort of

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.900 
residual compression is sort of
cancelling<00:06:13.830> out<00:06:13.950> the<00:06:13.980> tension<00:06:14.580> that<00:06:14.670> would<00:06:14.790> be

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
cancelling out the tension that would be

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.900 
cancelling out the tension that would be
created<00:06:15.360> by<00:06:15.510> this<00:06:15.570> loading<00:06:16.200> scenario<00:06:16.910> so

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
created by this loading scenario so

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.580 
created by this loading scenario so
we've<00:06:18.090> effectively<00:06:18.570> strengthened<00:06:19.290> the<00:06:19.410> piece

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
we've effectively strengthened the piece

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.500 
we've effectively strengthened the piece
of<00:06:19.770> glass<00:06:19.950> by<00:06:20.370> pre<00:06:20.850> loading<00:06:21.240> it<00:06:21.360> in

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
of glass by pre loading it in

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.600 
of glass by pre loading it in
compression<00:06:22.140> we<00:06:22.710> were<00:06:22.830> able<00:06:22.950> to<00:06:23.130> get<00:06:23.400> rid<00:06:23.580> of

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
compression we were able to get rid of

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.860 
compression we were able to get rid of
some<00:06:23.910> of<00:06:24.000> that<00:06:24.060> tension<00:06:24.180> loading<00:06:26.720> another<00:06:27.720> way

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
some of that tension loading another way

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.360 
some of that tension loading another way
to<00:06:27.930> think<00:06:28.200> about<00:06:28.320> this<00:06:28.680> is<00:06:28.920> that<00:06:29.130> the

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
to think about this is that the

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.950 
to think about this is that the
compression<00:06:30.060> that<00:06:30.090> we've<00:06:30.300> added<00:06:30.540> to<00:06:30.810> this

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
compression that we've added to this

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.800 
compression that we've added to this
edge<00:06:31.260> of<00:06:31.620> the<00:06:31.740> glass<00:06:31.950> helps<00:06:32.460> close<00:06:33.180> the<00:06:33.240> cracks

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
edge of the glass helps close the cracks

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.840 
edge of the glass helps close the cracks
so<00:06:34.590> when<00:06:34.740> we<00:06:34.830> put<00:06:35.010> this<00:06:35.130> in<00:06:35.190> bending<00:06:35.730> this

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850 
so when we put this in bending this

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.300 
so when we put this in bending this
crack<00:06:36.210> here<00:06:36.540> the<00:06:36.690> defect<00:06:37.170> doesn't<00:06:37.920> shoot<00:06:38.130> up

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
crack here the defect doesn't shoot up

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.800 
crack here the defect doesn't shoot up
through<00:06:38.550> the<00:06:38.640> glass<00:06:38.850> and<00:06:38.880> cause<00:06:39.300> breakage

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
through the glass and cause breakage

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.930 
through the glass and cause breakage
because<00:06:40.380> we're<00:06:40.980> in<00:06:41.100> compression<00:06:41.520> here<00:06:41.820> and

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
because we're in compression here and

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.440 
because we're in compression here and
it's<00:06:42.060> actually<00:06:42.210> sealing<00:06:42.900> the<00:06:43.170> crack<00:06:43.410> shut<00:06:44.450> the

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
it's actually sealing the crack shut the

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.780 
it's actually sealing the crack shut the
process<00:06:45.900> is<00:06:46.020> pretty<00:06:46.230> straightforward<00:06:47.010> I<00:06:47.220> set

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 
process is pretty straightforward I set

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.820 
process is pretty straightforward I set
up<00:06:47.820> a<00:06:48.060> stainless<00:06:48.540> steel<00:06:48.780> container<00:06:49.080> in<00:06:49.650> a

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
up a stainless steel container in a

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.580 
up a stainless steel container in a
small<00:06:50.130> kiln<00:06:50.580> and<00:06:50.930> added<00:06:51.930> to<00:06:52.140> it<00:06:52.290> some

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
small kiln and added to it some

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.260 
small kiln and added to it some
potassium<00:06:52.920> nitrate<00:06:53.640> that<00:06:53.820> I<00:06:53.850> bought<00:06:54.090> on<00:06:54.120> ebay

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
potassium nitrate that I bought on ebay

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.610 
potassium nitrate that I bought on ebay
Ilene's<00:06:57.270> the<00:06:57.480> glass<00:06:57.660> microscope<00:06:58.080> slides

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 
Ilene's the glass microscope slides

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.650 
Ilene's the glass microscope slides
against<00:06:59.100> the<00:06:59.220> stainless<00:06:59.640> container<00:07:00.090> and<00:07:00.450> then

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
against the stainless container and then

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.980 
against the stainless container and then
turns<00:07:01.020> the<00:07:01.230> kiln<00:07:01.470> on<00:07:01.710> and<00:07:02.040> set<00:07:02.370> it<00:07:02.520> to<00:07:02.670> about

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990 
turns the kiln on and set it to about

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.090 
turns the kiln on and set it to about
425<00:07:03.990> degrees<00:07:04.410> centigrade<00:07:06.740> after<00:07:07.740> the<00:07:07.860> kiln

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 
425 degrees centigrade after the kiln

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.460 
425 degrees centigrade after the kiln
came<00:07:08.370> up<00:07:08.520> to<00:07:08.670> temperature<00:07:09.180> I<00:07:09.450> opened<00:07:10.290> it<00:07:10.350> up

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:10.470 
came up to temperature I opened it up

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.260 
came up to temperature I opened it up
and<00:07:10.620> noticed<00:07:10.980> that<00:07:11.070> the<00:07:11.340> potassium<00:07:11.700> nitrate

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.270 
and noticed that the potassium nitrate

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.150 
and noticed that the potassium nitrate
had<00:07:12.480> quite<00:07:12.780> a<00:07:12.810> few<00:07:13.050> impurities<00:07:13.410> floating<00:07:14.070> on

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 
had quite a few impurities floating on

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.130 
had quite a few impurities floating on
the<00:07:14.280> surface<00:07:14.460> so<00:07:14.910> I<00:07:14.940> fished<00:07:15.270> those<00:07:15.570> off<00:07:15.840> and

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.140 
the surface so I fished those off and

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.040 
the surface so I fished those off and
then<00:07:17.100> added<00:07:17.520> the<00:07:17.610> slides<00:07:17.880> to<00:07:18.240> the<00:07:18.360> now<00:07:18.540> molten

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.050 
then added the slides to the now molten

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.920 
then added the slides to the now molten
potassium<00:07:19.380> nitrate<00:07:20.300> since<00:07:21.300> the<00:07:21.390> process<00:07:21.630> was

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
potassium nitrate since the process was

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.450 
potassium nitrate since the process was
going<00:07:22.050> pretty<00:07:22.380> well<00:07:22.500> I<00:07:22.650> also<00:07:22.890> up<00:07:23.250> to<00:07:23.280> the

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 
going pretty well I also up to the

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.620 
going pretty well I also up to the
temperature<00:07:23.910> to<00:07:24.030> 450<00:07:24.780> degrees<00:07:26.300> after<00:07:27.300> three

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
temperature to 450 degrees after three

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.810 
temperature to 450 degrees after three
hours<00:07:27.960> at<00:07:28.290> that<00:07:28.470> temperature<00:07:28.860> I<00:07:29.310> fished<00:07:29.640> the

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:29.820 
hours at that temperature I fished the

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.940 
hours at that temperature I fished the
slides<00:07:30.090> out<00:07:30.360> and<00:07:30.540> let<00:07:30.960> them<00:07:31.170> cool<00:07:31.410> as<00:07:31.710> slowly

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:31.950 
slides out and let them cool as slowly

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.530 
slides out and let them cool as slowly
as<00:07:32.190> possible<00:07:32.250> that<00:07:32.880> I<00:07:32.910> didn't<00:07:33.180> do<00:07:33.330> anything

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:33.540 
as possible that I didn't do anything

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.570 
as possible that I didn't do anything
special<00:07:33.870> like<00:07:34.350> put<00:07:34.590> them<00:07:34.710> into<00:07:34.890> a<00:07:35.010> temperature

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 
special like put them into a temperature

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.730 
special like put them into a temperature
controlled<00:07:36.000> chamber

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:36.740 
controlled chamber

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.240 
controlled chamber
I<00:07:36.770> just<00:07:37.250> put<00:07:37.460> them<00:07:37.550> out<00:07:37.670> in<00:07:37.730> air<00:07:39.130> after<00:07:40.130> they

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.250 
I just put them out in air after they

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.890 
I just put them out in air after they
cooled<00:07:40.520> down<00:07:40.670> naturally<00:07:40.940> I<00:07:41.270> washed<00:07:41.690> the

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:41.900 
cooled down naturally I washed the

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.410 
cooled down naturally I washed the
slides<00:07:42.170> off<00:07:42.410> in<00:07:42.650> tap<00:07:42.890> water<00:07:42.920> and<00:07:43.460> then<00:07:44.090> loaded

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:44.420 
slides off in tap water and then loaded

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.270 
slides off in tap water and then loaded
them<00:07:44.540> into<00:07:44.690> the<00:07:44.840> test<00:07:45.260> rig<00:07:45.440> and<00:07:45.680> tested<00:07:46.130> their

strengthening<00:07:59.510> that<00:07:59.600> I've<00:07:59.720> described<00:08:00.170> in

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:00.320 
strengthening that I've described in

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:07.340 
special thing about Gorilla Glass is

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.190 
special thing about Gorilla Glass is
that<00:08:07.520> it<00:08:07.640> has<00:08:07.820> a<00:08:08.120> very<00:08:08.510> unique<00:08:08.570> set<00:08:09.050> of

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:13.730 
amenable to this chemical strengthening

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:20.140 
amenable to this chemical strengthening
process<00:08:15.280> okay<00:08:16.280> see<00:08:16.850> you<00:08:17.030> next<00:08:17.060> time<00:08:17.450> bye
