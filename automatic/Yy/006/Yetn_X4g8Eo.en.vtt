momentum no dog and you're like an

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.330 
momentum no dog and you're like an
answer<00:01:16.710> if<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.950> measured<00:01:17.520> will<00:01:17.790> be

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
answer if it measured will be

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:30.110 
answer if it measured will be
now<00:01:18.490> real<00:01:18.939> is<00:01:19.210> chasing<00:01:19.659> you

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.540 

imagine<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:30.990> wheels<00:01:31.290> were<00:01:31.620> sentient<00:01:32.160> but<00:01:32.370> our

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
imagine if wheels were sentient but our

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.930 
imagine if wheels were sentient but our
unified<00:01:34.340> they<00:01:35.340> want<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.610> go<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.820> different

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
unified they want to go in different

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.030 
unified they want to go in different
directions<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.690> their<00:01:37.200> power<00:01:37.440> never<00:01:37.770> go<00:01:37.980> away

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
directions and their power never go away

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.390 
directions and their power never go away
that's<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.470> objective<00:01:43.890> destroy<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
that's so you objective destroy the

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:54.220 
that's so you objective destroy the
cards<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:46.070> how<00:01:47.070> are<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.520> take
