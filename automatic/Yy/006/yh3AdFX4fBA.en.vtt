00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
about cooking without a recipe and you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.299 
about cooking without a recipe and you
know<00:00:51.870> that's<00:00:52.050> always<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> bit<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.649> dichotomy

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
know that's always a bit of a dichotomy

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.670 
know that's always a bit of a dichotomy
for<00:00:53.550> me<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.149> guess<00:00:54.930> what<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.530> just

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
for me but I guess what it is it's just

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.439 
for me but I guess what it is it's just
putting<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> recipe<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.670> perspective<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
putting the recipe in perspective and

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.849 
putting the recipe in perspective and
understanding<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> recipe<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.649> very

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
understanding that a recipe is a very

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.410 
understanding that a recipe is a very
useful<00:00:58.980> tool<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> wonderful<00:01:00.030> part<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.359> the

paper for a while and then they start to

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.780 
paper for a while and then they start to
evolve<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> things<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.579> actually

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
evolve in the things that we actually

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.389 
evolve in the things that we actually
cook<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.750> we<00:01:42.869> slim<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.409> trim<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.860> taste<00:01:44.100> and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
cook and we slim and trim and taste and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.389 
cook and we slim and trim and taste and
tweak<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.750> ultimately<00:01:46.229> end<00:01:46.470> up<00:01:46.619> with<00:01:46.829> 110

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
that make the cut one of the ideas I had

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.580 
that make the cut one of the ideas I had
for<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.740> book<00:01:49.950> was<00:01:50.130> called<00:01:50.159> pizza<00:01:50.640> pudding

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
and if it worked we tried so hard I

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.929 
and if it worked we tried so hard I
thought<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.829> was<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> good<00:01:56.130> idea<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.520> thought

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
thought it was a good idea I thought

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.200 
thought it was a good idea I thought

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
tried it again is it and by the end of

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.240 
tried it again is it and by the end of
it<00:02:19.660> nobody<00:02:20.170> wanted<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.470> eat<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:20.740> stuff<00:02:21.010> like

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
it nobody wanted to eat this stuff like

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.240 
it nobody wanted to eat this stuff like
it<00:02:21.400> just<00:02:21.670> never<00:02:21.970> quite<00:02:22.420> worked<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.800> know<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.220> I

think it's helpful for for cooks to

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.980 
think it's helpful for for cooks to
understand<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.160> even<00:02:27.850> guys<00:02:28.030> like<00:02:28.090> me<00:02:28.570> screw
