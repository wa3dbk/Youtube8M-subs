00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Hello everyone, I am Andrew Walker, assistant product manager for football products. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Let's go around before we talk about Brazuca football and player accuracy tests. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 This is a beautiful playground, it’s as simple as my home. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Why is testing so important? Just to make sure we can make the best products on the market. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Especially for our best players, they will use these in the World Cup. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 So you can imagine, I received the email from Jochen: "Okay, the test is confirmed, Adidas is coming to the car!" 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Then I will go to the garage and put the package and start the car. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Then I went to AC Milan and met the famous Dutch player Clarence Seedorf. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Take a moment to sit down and say, "Likes, I remember the first time I scored a goal in the Champions League with Adidas." 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Look at how long it has been, this is the 2014 World Cup, it’s so cool. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 In Moscow, I talked to Capello, one of the best coaches in the world. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Playing with the ball and talking about its advanced technology 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Discuss with the players how the competition and products promote each other 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 This kind of work is great, we help each other. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Sometimes you will think "I just shake hands with the world's top players" and it feels great. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 It feels a bit unreal. The big name on TV is sitting there Dennis Bergkamp, ​​he has retired and is now a coach. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 He scored hundreds of goals for Arsenal. I also met Ibrahimovic, Boateng, Seedorf, Mark Van Bommel. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 It’s fun to meet Messi. I’m sitting in the hotel waiting, wait, “He will come, or will not come” 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 He really appeared, it was an exciting 50-second handshake, joking with each other, then I asked, "How do you feel about the product?" 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Very brief, but the handshake, the meeting and the positive feedback made me feel great, really cool. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Take these feedbacks to improve our products 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 I can say that I participated in the production of the product. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 This is a bit subjective, but I am one of them. I have an effort in each of the world competitions.
