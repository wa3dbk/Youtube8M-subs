00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.490
 how about friends today I brought a new 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.000
 Video on how to activate the code 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.670
 hidden watching a cult in the s3 of 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.160
 verizon ssh and 535 then the first 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.140
 step that we should do is verify 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.570
 about the hidden code that I speak 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.939
 is this that we would be marking for 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.480
 consult the asterisk email code 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.310
 numeral 0 6 numeral here should come out 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.339
 but as you will see I do not have activated the 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.899
 hidden code then I do not get what 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.759
 first thing we're going to do is fix 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.660
 that problem first thing we should 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:39.250
 to do is to have the phone rooted 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:44.340
 download the root explorer application 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:47.070
 and as you can see is to be here 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.150
 then we are going to open this file 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.840
 of root explore 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.290
 then we will go to the folder 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.230
 fs that is at the beginning as you can see 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.580
 then from there we go to the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.580
 carrier folder 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.860
 from there we go to the folder hayden menu 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.260
 sorry to the file there is menu we click 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.380
 in text editor as you can see 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.210
 we have the word off this 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.450
 word we should change it by the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.450
 word a whole with capital letter then 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.770
 we proceed to change it I will erase this 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.810
 from here 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.720
 I will put 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.670
 everything with a capital letter remember once 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.420
 put all that we save the file 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.820
 we put save yes 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.430
 then once all this we go back 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.430
 everything and reset our mobile 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.070
 Once this code is restarted, it has 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.860
 to be working as you can see 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.689
 this this hidden code helps us a lot 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.780
 because it 's for even to calibrate the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.000
 battery for this find out the sensors 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.659
 fix sensors for also from the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.939
 wifi signal this email of course 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.490
 and I suffered a lot with this problem and 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.860
 finally you can find a solution 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.420
 searching and browsing the web and I 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.630
 I have brought this video to do them a lot 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.220
 easier and I hope they subscribe 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.010
 I'm starting with the videos any 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.310
 suggestion comment this video I would like 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.680
 to make the comment 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.910
 what else could I say then as 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.640
 you can see here is indicating which is the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.160
 stc verizon this let's hope that the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.230
 phone will completely restart this 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.310
 it takes time to wait for us to come out 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.780
 message that you tell us around here font wood 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.000
 then that will tell us that the phone is already 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.970
 is completely on with all 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.360
 the functions with all the functions 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.950
 of the phone activated then we are going to 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.599
 waiting for us to come out is the message 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.920
 be able to test because if it is not going to 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.650
 delay if you test them right away when 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.440
 know the phone then we have to 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.600
 wait and we will have here ready to 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.060
 to be able to activate putting the code a code 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.790
 can be the code as they see back the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.260
 email code or the code to calibrate the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.700
 battery then let's put what 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.920
 let's say I'm going to cover of course the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.769
 code and I'm going to put it here they see it 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.410
 that already saw already left font wood asterisk 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.690
 numeral 06 I will put a numeral I will 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.370
 cover this so that not in the email 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.280
 good is loading 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.670
 and already left I'm going to cover them look at them 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.069
 health email code 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.160
 As you can see, I will also try 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:35.930
 then with the one to calibrate the battery 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.360
 would be asterisk numeral 0 2 2 8 numeral 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.400
 As you can see, it has already come out and that's 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.720
 it's all friends this is what quality with 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.310
 concluded very short 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.930
 I hope you share it, help them a lot 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.930
 Any doubt start until later
