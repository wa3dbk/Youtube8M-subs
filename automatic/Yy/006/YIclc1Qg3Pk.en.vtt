00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.650
 Uh, you two are just doing the same thing .

 Also, what is the life of the female auria Kim Cheolwon? 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:32.829
 I can not do it. 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:38.829
 If you have two, let 's see the brand car. 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:44.410
 So whether you've the two are somehow amounts typically are more expensive sense 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:52.329
 Presumably we definitely feel that you want to create something with a touch of the disabled 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:54.399
 Today you guys that 4 pc without that peripherals So what rocket 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.999
 Well then, 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:01.210
 I 'll show you the mouse . 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:05.170
 It's called Social Anxiety. 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.820
 I'm writing magic with a five-kicker. 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.990
 I told you. 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:17.770
 I think it shows me've seen mice before giving control 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:20.530
 A voice out of me Why do bad matures Oh I'll show if the water 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.240
 Oh, I've been hiding 550. 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.440
 Now Oh So here zest fell off wild Gimcheon 27 woven write 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.050
 Stop it . 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:36.550
 Oh, just the right part 4 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.550
 Looks like I got on my order. I want to sleep. 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.660
 Yes, Java is not cheap. 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:49.410
 I guess the charm is the charm that the right side will give you. 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:54.090
 After the month of the black, it is part of the forehead part of the h after the absence 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:58.650
 The mouse paint is now urethane coated. 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.100
 Uh, just strange thing is stick beating Northern Air 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:08.399
 When you leave home, it's summer. 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:11.910
 What is plastic or what is now on the top Coaching in the visual This part is a sweat 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:17.640
 If you get a lot of it , it stays smooth . 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.340
 Why inde was depressed as you see on the side. I take enormous slick on top 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.620
 So I have a few questions left. 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:32.130
 But what is this table that will fix the side 1 just like that year 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.060
 It's like a bumbo jappo, which is a kind of bamboo sack . 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.020
 Should I 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.470
 That makes it a bit rough 4 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:44.160
 When we painted , the size 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:48.840
 Well, it tastes good to Asian taste . 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:52.080
 I show you what to do now and repair your mouse together 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:58.770
 This is a skill reality, ie , no outgoing Kada 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.610
 The size is almost the same . 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.230
 I'm showing you. 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.910
 If you are looking for a mouse that is very well suited to Asian employment 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.820
 uh 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:14.370
 50 I am about this part now 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:18.360
 I lack a little bit inside the products described in this out because in the vicinity 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.060
 Despair has been showing up in your mind for the time being . 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.420
 Chipset on this recall watchers 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.830
 I 'll show you there first. 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:32.420
 Of course , depending on the nationality of the company , I will hear that part, but 17:00 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:36.050
 I gave the sensor information and I fed it . 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.560
 Write cold isle Sen say, and say 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:45.590
 However, when using deoraguyo Yiwu is better to attack 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.819
 So I really mobilized a little network and now the domestic lge is almost like that 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.050
 Laboratory side 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:56.540
 Yes , I've been on that side for ten minutes, but the answer ward is that. 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.860
 Since the company did not disclose the details of the data sheet on the inside 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.430
 Because there is not itself 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.190
 You will understand that this is impossible and frustrating, so one out of kulen to you 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.670
 I wanted to show you the accumulations. 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.780
 Perhaps the explanation is that much effort you'll introduce to you some shortcomings 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.700
 Is there a lot 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.940
 So now let me explain a little more about the mouse over the name Hui 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.739
 It's made of rubber. 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:25.970
 Next time you see it, it looks like a button. 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:30.229
 I was originally told that I would release seven motors for example 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:34.790
 There are no buttons to configure five cases Auburn 1 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:38.900
 Hill on the left side at the top, then click on the right one 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:44.330
 Do not place it in addition consists of two 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:47.090
 Uh you see at the bottom of the mouse, some far as bodeon per lead 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:53.690
 Anyway , if you look at the mouse 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:58.040
 400 800 1600 3200 The survivors were able to support dpi 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.500
 In the case of Sangwoo mouse, 400 800 1600 4000 around 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:06.170
 It supports 4000 dpi, even though 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:11.360
 If so well now meet in a mouse pads I like its cousins, though 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:13.919
 When the game that you can feel the sense of security that writing something 800dpi 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.389
 Did it happen? 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:23.069
 Now he's now composed of two tab pros at the bottom 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:26.189
 Part one is more especially so to the south there is a large reason and you 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:29.189
 I have a lot of minutes that the game is hasiguyo 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:34.439
 Depending on the grip, the shape of the grip is a bit different. 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:38.639
 And as usual, the bottom side moves little users. 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:42.239
 So it's almost a fixed hero and more slippery and stable 5 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:46.799
 But if the upper part slides over the mosquito 

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:47.669
 Equal to the upper end of the glide now not so smooth sliding sujeongdong 

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:51.269
 There are parts. 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:54.479
 So it's like a mouse that started out with a little bit of attention. 

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:57.749
 Hey look, I say to the kids at home, for example, 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:04.049
 It supports only 1,680 of the world with all the way to leek issues 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:08.279
 So it's not about the palette that a person can see with the naked eye. 

00:06:04.049 --> 00:06:12.839
 Can an organization like me break through 7.8 million colors ? 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:18.989
 But until he'd filled four huge that support the specification 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:20.090
 Now, if the baby is like, leave now led its function after padding dia sin 

00:06:18.989 --> 00:06:26.090
 Years 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:28.790
 You can see that once it has been torn down and then again, getting another color 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:32.750
 I can feel the joy of time 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.530
 Uh, when I look at you, I usually give you a line haircut, Ray Bow color . 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.820
 5 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.570
 To the basis of the color it is too weak to hear Mentaiko colored rear of sipguyo 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.430
 Is it changed 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:44.840
 There is such a difference between what is really about the mouse type I test 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:51.169
 It's a good dream. 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:58.010
 As for the performance, what I wrote is perfect. 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:59.300
 I will give you the details of what you can not do. 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:04.010
 No use 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:09.590
 The important ones are that I did not have scaffolding in the reviews. 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:10.460
 Most of the accomplishments of the mouse couple are more delicate in the picture 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.590
 I hope 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.590
 Well, that's usually where the reviews end here. Thank you.
