00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 good afternoon my name is yuri i am a coach 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.970
 panasonic today we talk 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.500
 about in a meat grinder when choosing a meat grinder 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.290
 consumers are most often interested in those 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.049
 things are performance not sleds 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.660
 that is, how much to them how fast but 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.580
 can cook minced meat and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.949
 reliability that is how long 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.580
 the meat grinder will serve and whether will not break 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.080
 it is if except meat 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.250
 hit the bone 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.790
 or pieces of ice were frozen with meat 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.280
 let's experiment as 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.989
 sample i have a panasonic meat grinder 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.840
 mkg 1805 is a mincer with a maximum 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.719
 1800 watts 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.520
 made in japan two models of meat grinders 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.510
 on sonic in the model range made and by 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.010
 her left in malaysia 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.280
 these assembly countries allow you to save 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.920
 high quality meat grinders panasonic not 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.739
 so let's experiment all parts 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.390
 panasonic meat grinder metal 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.930
 so it can work long and 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.600
 reliably and for the test we use here 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.290
 such pencils 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.860
 wooden take pencil inserting 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.860
 meat grinder 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:57.070
 look at the result of our pencils 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.480
 turned into such fine sawdust then 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.210
 eat even if the meat will 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.790
 fairly dense jivas with pieces 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.920
 ice if it was frozen even in 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.640
 In this case, it will be turned mince 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.470
 very quickly the most important constructive 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.600
 panasonic feature is 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.440
 the presence of a fuse that is 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.830
 circuit breaker 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.470
 the meaning is simple if the grinder hits that 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.020
 the fact that she can not swallow 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.410
 translate asleep and disconnects after 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.670
 how do you extract for example bone 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.890
 the meat grinder will continue work let's 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.740
 let's experiment take a wand 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.220
 thicker put in our meat grinder and 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.220
 turn on 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.850
 this pysanki turned off worked when 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:04.850
 cooking the post now press the button 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.920
 chopper meat grinder continue your 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.300
 the job 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.400
 spittoon and ensure long and 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.400
 reliable work of the meat grinder without breakage 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.380
 inside competitors grinders difference from 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.250
 panasonic installed gearbox and 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.390
 others either cook on from plastic in 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.920
 the case when the meat grinder cannot 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.200
 twist the meat or bones this part 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.380
 gearbox breaks down and needs to be replaced 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.050
 some gear in the gearbox at panasonic 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.580
 do this at the expense of a circuit breaker 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.930
 not necessary 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.410
 the meat grinder just turns off there 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.520
 the load is too large one of 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.490
 most important characteristics 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.260
 meat grinder is power drawings 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.810
 panasonic have a very high 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.890
 maximum power world in data 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.280
 rates and it is 1800 watts and 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:01.100
 low standard powerful worker 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.780
 This leaves 332 this model 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.760
 that the meat grinder will work range 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.770
 power from 330 to 1800 watts 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.290
 eat meat without lived it is screwed 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.739
 with minimum power and battle lines 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.680
 lived 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.650
 ice pieces or small bones 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.140
 power grows reaching the limit 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.120
 power 1800 watt 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.340
 the meat grinder will be turned off by the chopper 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.940
 chains 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.130
 high performance 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.180
 not only high 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.340
 power and grinder 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:36.389
 but also a special form of knives 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.150
 knives meat grinders panasonic 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.550
 self-sharpening they trudge on 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.729
 friction crate during cooking 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:48.720
 stuffing due to this they keep their 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.800
 severity over the course of many years another 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.759
 a feature that is worth paying 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.630
 attention is specially selected 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.770
 calculated 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.919
 step of the groove due to this short 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.460
 steps 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:06.570
 meat as fast as possible goes to knives 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.699
 and turns into mince when developing 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.900
 panasonic mincers as much as possible 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.110
 took care of convenience to 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.500
 grinder users has a very 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.660
 secure fit and besides yours 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.780
 convenient to use to disassemble and assemble 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.199
 example in order to tighten the nut 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.310
 you can make a small horse plum 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.539
 girls will be comfortable with what you can 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.860
 spin the meat grinder with any metal 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:33.930
 subject to another of the evidence 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.210
 high quality panasonic 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.970
 is the victory of one of our models 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.669
 transfer control purchase did not participate 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.289
 1300 panasonic meat grinder which 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.639
 proved to be the leader among all 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.070
 submitted samples 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.710
 now let's rate 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.560
 performance for this we take 1 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.889
 kilogram of meat 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.889
 weighing control 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:13.389
 we get a little bit more than a kilogram 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:18.130
 we lay our meat in the top tray 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:18.130
 for the convenience of making minced meat 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.229
 note that a whole kilogram 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:32.610
 meat we have placed 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:39.540
 tray set a plate in which 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:45.889
 will get our stuffing now insert 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:50.360
 stopwatch prepare for 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:50.360
 cooking stuff go 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:42.360
 So we look at the result along with the time. 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:46.830
 which went on measurement took about 45 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:51.080
 seconds is a kilo of meat and mince 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:53.699
 excellent quality summarize 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.280
 panasonic meat grinders possess 

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:58.789
 tremendous reliability due to 

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.770
 Japanese or Malaysian assembly 

00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:05.430
 metal mechanism and breaker 

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:07.949
 chains and besides it provides high 

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:10.440
 performance due to powerful 

00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:13.039
 the motor other than this is not very quiet 

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.520
 will be comfortable to use and the kitchen 

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:16.520
 Thanks for attention
