00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.589
 money for multivarku did not want 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:10.140

 non-stick coating inside everything 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.090
 in general, it is simple to show 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.350
 there is here below 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.900

 that he is preparing in a slow cooker 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.370

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:00.490
