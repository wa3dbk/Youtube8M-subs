welcome<00:00:10.129> to<00:00:10.370> this<00:00:10.519> tutorial<00:00:11.299> where<00:00:11.660> we<00:00:11.780> will

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
welcome to this tutorial where we will

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.060 
welcome to this tutorial where we will
be<00:00:12.110> discussing<00:00:12.440> the<00:00:12.980> endomembrane<00:00:13.759> system<00:00:13.789> of

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
be discussing the endomembrane system of

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.280 
be discussing the endomembrane system of
eukaryotic<00:00:16.070> cells<00:00:16.369> so<00:00:16.580> when<00:00:16.760> I<00:00:16.789> say

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.290 
eukaryotic cells so when I say

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.830 
eukaryotic cells so when I say
endomembrane<00:00:18.290> I<00:00:18.800> mean<00:00:19.040> membranes<00:00:19.910> within<00:00:20.540> our

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
endomembrane I mean membranes within our

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.750 
endomembrane I mean membranes within our
cell<00:00:21.170> and<00:00:21.410> straightaway<00:00:21.920> we<00:00:22.160> can<00:00:22.340> think<00:00:22.490> our

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
cell and straightaway we can think our

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.880 
cell and straightaway we can think our
membranes<00:00:23.690> within<00:00:24.020> the<00:00:24.140> cell<00:00:24.380> that's<00:00:24.620> going

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
membranes within the cell that's going

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.790 
membranes within the cell that's going
to<00:00:24.980> be<00:00:25.100> organelles<00:00:25.970> but<00:00:26.780> not<00:00:27.050> all<00:00:27.260> of<00:00:27.680> our

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
to be organelles but not all of our

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.560 
to be organelles but not all of our
organelles<00:00:28.250> are<00:00:28.460> part<00:00:28.850> of<00:00:29.030> the<00:00:29.180> endomembrane

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
organelles are part of the endomembrane

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.650 
organelles are part of the endomembrane
system<00:00:29.950> so<00:00:30.950> we<00:00:31.070> have<00:00:31.100> our<00:00:31.550> eukaryotic<00:00:32.419> cell

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
system so we have our eukaryotic cell

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.080 
system so we have our eukaryotic cell
here<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.170> we're<00:00:33.980> going<00:00:34.220> to<00:00:34.370> write<00:00:34.610> down<00:00:34.640> that

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
here and we're going to write down that

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.500 
here and we're going to write down that
the<00:00:35.270> endomembrane<00:00:35.720> system<00:00:35.750> is<00:00:36.620> composed<00:00:37.100> of

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
the endomembrane system is composed of

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.890 
the endomembrane system is composed of
membranous<00:00:38.510> organelles<00:00:38.920> but<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:41.239> organelles

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
membranous organelles but the organelles

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.140 
membranous organelles but the organelles
that<00:00:42.020> are<00:00:42.140> in<00:00:42.410> this<00:00:42.620> system<00:00:42.890> have<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:43.820> be

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
that are in this system have to be

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.510 
that are in this system have to be
working<00:00:45.079> closely<00:00:45.440> together<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.250> they're

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
working closely together so they're

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.170 
working closely together so they're
either<00:00:46.750> joined<00:00:47.750> in<00:00:48.020> some<00:00:48.350> way<00:00:48.560> or<00:00:48.860> arise<00:00:49.730> from

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
either joined in some way or arise from

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.900 
either joined in some way or arise from
the<00:00:50.470> vesicles<00:00:51.470> that<00:00:51.590> transport<00:00:52.460> various

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
the vesicles that transport various

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.650 
the vesicles that transport various
things<00:00:53.210> around<00:00:53.690> our<00:00:53.960> cells<00:00:54.940> so<00:00:55.940> let's<00:00:56.270> list

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
things around our cells so let's list

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.930 
things around our cells so let's list
all<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.170> different<00:00:57.440> structures<00:00:58.309> within<00:00:58.579> this

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
all the different structures within this

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.459 
all the different structures within this
system<00:00:59.420> before<00:00:59.570> we<00:00:59.809> actually<00:01:00.230> talk<00:01:00.440> about

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
system before we actually talk about

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.370 
system before we actually talk about
what<00:01:00.710> each<00:01:01.130> one<00:01:01.430> of<00:01:01.550> them<00:01:01.700> is<00:01:01.910> doing<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.140> this

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
what each one of them is doing so this

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.890 
what each one of them is doing so this
organelle<00:01:04.250> I've<00:01:04.519> just<00:01:04.850> drawn<00:01:05.210> up<00:01:05.449> here<00:01:05.750> is

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
organelle I've just drawn up here is

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.980 
organelle I've just drawn up here is
part<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.940> endoplasmic<00:01:07.940> reticulum<00:01:08.810> it's

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
part of the endoplasmic reticulum it's

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.590 
part of the endoplasmic reticulum it's
actually<00:01:09.350> our<00:01:09.530> rough<00:01:10.130> endoplasmic<00:01:10.600> reticulum

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
actually our rough endoplasmic reticulum

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.200 
actually our rough endoplasmic reticulum
which<00:01:12.140> we<00:01:12.320> know<00:01:12.500> is<00:01:12.740> continuous<00:01:13.580> with<00:01:14.180> the

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
which we know is continuous with the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.080 
which we know is continuous with the
outer<00:01:14.470> layer<00:01:15.470> of<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.799> nuclear<00:01:16.430> envelope<00:01:16.670> of

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
outer layer of the nuclear envelope of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.090 
outer layer of the nuclear envelope of
our<00:01:17.479> nucleus<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:18.500> we<00:01:18.619> have<00:01:18.740> our<00:01:18.860> rough

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
our nucleus so we have our rough

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.760 
our nucleus so we have our rough
endoplasmic<00:01:19.390> reticulum<00:01:20.390> here<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:20.840> we're

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
endoplasmic reticulum here and we're

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.880 
endoplasmic reticulum here and we're
going<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.100> have<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.430> smooth<00:01:22.880> endoplasmic

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
going to have the smooth endoplasmic

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.210 
going to have the smooth endoplasmic
reticulum<00:01:24.890> as<00:01:25.040> well<00:01:26.470> next<00:01:27.470> we<00:01:27.619> can<00:01:27.770> see<00:01:28.010> our

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
reticulum as well next we can see our

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.240 
reticulum as well next we can see our
Golgi<00:01:28.729> apparatus<00:01:28.850> which<00:01:29.570> is<00:01:29.869> another<00:01:30.560> tightly

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
Golgi apparatus which is another tightly

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.670 
Golgi apparatus which is another tightly
folded<00:01:31.600> membranous<00:01:32.600> organelles<00:01:32.840> within<00:01:33.350> our

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
folded membranous organelles within our

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.640 
folded membranous organelles within our
eukaryotic<00:01:34.490> cells<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.090> we<00:01:35.600> can<00:01:35.780> also<00:01:35.990> see<00:01:36.470> the

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
eukaryotic cells and we can also see the

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.399 
eukaryotic cells and we can also see the
vesicles<00:01:37.369> that<00:01:37.580> we<00:01:37.700> have<00:01:37.880> budding<00:01:38.750> off<00:01:38.930> the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
vesicles that we have budding off the

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.980 
vesicles that we have budding off the
Golgi<00:01:40.159> apparatus<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.909> I'll<00:01:41.119> just<00:01:41.420> draw<00:01:41.750> a

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
Golgi apparatus and I'll just draw a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.460 
Golgi apparatus and I'll just draw a
couple<00:01:42.860> more<00:01:43.189> vesicles<00:01:43.880> here<00:01:44.180> as<00:01:44.360> well<00:01:44.630> before

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
couple more vesicles here as well before

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.440 
couple more vesicles here as well before
we<00:01:45.830> move<00:01:45.860> on<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.430> next<00:01:46.759> component<00:01:46.939> which

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
we move on to the next component which

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.859 
we move on to the next component which
is<00:01:47.479> our<00:01:48.159> lysosomes<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.939> lysosomes<00:01:50.600> I'll

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
is our lysosomes and the lysosomes I'll

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.899 
is our lysosomes and the lysosomes I'll
put<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.110> few<00:01:51.439> inside<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.070> cell<00:01:52.280> as<00:01:52.490> well<00:01:52.700> in

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
put a few inside the cell as well in

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.020 
put a few inside the cell as well in
pink<00:01:53.240> we<00:01:53.540> can<00:01:53.720> see<00:01:53.930> here<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:54.700> we're<00:01:55.700> going<00:01:55.970> to

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
pink we can see here and we're going to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.050 
pink we can see here and we're going to
have<00:01:56.439> vacuoles<00:01:57.439> as<00:01:57.829> well<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:58.250> vacuoles<00:01:58.790> are

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
have vacuoles as well and vacuoles are

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.980 
have vacuoles as well and vacuoles are
quite<00:01:59.960> large<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:01.460> I'll<00:02:01.640> draw<00:02:01.880> them<00:02:02.060> larger

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
quite large so I'll draw them larger

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.310 
quite large so I'll draw them larger
than<00:02:03.320> our<00:02:03.640> lysosomes<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:04.970> our<00:02:05.210> vesicles<00:02:06.140> and

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
than our lysosomes and our vesicles and

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.749 
than our lysosomes and our vesicles and
also<00:02:07.100> our<00:02:07.369> plasma<00:02:08.259> membrane<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:09.610> before<00:02:10.610> you

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
also our plasma membrane and before you

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.180 
also our plasma membrane and before you
get<00:02:10.910> kind<00:02:11.239> of<00:02:11.330> confused<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.110> say<00:02:12.349> well<00:02:12.770> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
get kind of confused and say well the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.080 
get kind of confused and say well the
plasma<00:02:13.970> membrane<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.450> not

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
plasma membrane is not

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.720 
plasma membrane is not
a<00:02:15.260> membrane<00:02:16.260> within<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.920> cells<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.430> how<00:02:17.580> can

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
a membrane within the cells so how can

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.300 
a membrane within the cells so how can
it<00:02:17.819> be<00:02:17.910> part<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.300> endomembrane<00:02:18.780> system<00:02:19.310> we

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
it be part of the endomembrane system we

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.890 
it be part of the endomembrane system we
classify<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> part<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.510> endomembrane

I've saved the best for last so the last
structure<00:02:32.910> we're<00:02:33.060> going<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.390> find<00:02:33.690> as<00:02:33.870> part<00:02:34.260> of

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
structure we're going to find as part of

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.089 
structure we're going to find as part of
our<00:02:34.680> endomembrane<00:02:35.670> system<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:37.110> nuclear

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
our endomembrane system is the nuclear

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.820 
our endomembrane system is the nuclear
envelope<00:02:38.569> so<00:02:39.569> our<00:02:39.750> nuclear<00:02:40.200> envelope<00:02:40.410> is

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
envelope so our nuclear envelope is

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.550 
envelope so our nuclear envelope is
actually<00:02:41.250> two<00:02:41.879> lipid<00:02:42.660> bilayers<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.410> our

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
actually two lipid bilayers and our

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.789 
actually two lipid bilayers and our
outer<00:02:43.799> layer<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.870> continuous<00:02:45.870> with<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.349> rough

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
outer layer is continuous with the rough

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.220 
outer layer is continuous with the rough
endoplasmic<00:02:47.099> reticulum<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.390> must<00:02:48.720> be<00:02:48.870> part

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
endoplasmic reticulum so it must be part

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.800 
endoplasmic reticulum so it must be part
of<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.440> endomembrane<00:02:49.890> system<00:02:49.920> right<00:02:50.760> now<00:02:51.030> we

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
of the endomembrane system right now we

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.289 
of the endomembrane system right now we
can<00:02:52.260> finally<00:02:52.709> talk<00:02:52.920> about<00:02:53.280> how<00:02:53.549> all<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:54.120> these

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
can finally talk about how all of these

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.680 
can finally talk about how all of these
structures<00:02:54.989> work<00:02:55.860> together<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:57.299> form<00:02:57.569> the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
structures work together to form the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.509 
structures work together to form the
endomembrane<00:02:58.170> system<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:58.950> let's<00:02:59.190> start<00:02:59.430> with

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
endomembrane system so let's start with

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.880 
endomembrane system so let's start with
in<00:02:59.700> our<00:02:59.940> nucleus<00:03:00.840> where<00:03:01.049> we're<00:03:01.230> going<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.739> be

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
in our nucleus where we're going to be

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.800 
in our nucleus where we're going to be
performing<00:03:02.510> transcription<00:03:03.510> which<00:03:03.660> is

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
performing transcription which is

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.449 
performing transcription which is
creating<00:03:04.440> new<00:03:05.030> mRNAs<00:03:06.030> from<00:03:06.540> DNA<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.680> those

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
creating new mRNAs from DNA and those

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.580 
creating new mRNAs from DNA and those
mRNAs<00:03:09.180> are<00:03:09.390> going<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.660> be<00:03:09.750> transported<00:03:10.410> out

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
mRNAs are going to be transported out

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.710 
mRNAs are going to be transported out
into<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.519> cell<00:03:11.819> where<00:03:12.120> they're<00:03:12.269> more<00:03:12.569> than

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
into the cell where they're more than

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.009 
into the cell where they're more than
likely<00:03:12.780> going<00:03:13.349> to<00:03:13.470> associate<00:03:14.280> with<00:03:14.610> the

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
likely going to associate with the

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.860 
likely going to associate with the
ribosomes<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.500> rough<00:03:16.890> endoplasmic

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.259 
ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic
reticulum<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.079> our<00:03:20.040> ribosomes<00:03:20.730> will<00:03:21.030> then

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
reticulum and our ribosomes will then

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.610 
reticulum and our ribosomes will then
translate<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.350> mRNA<00:03:23.340> into<00:03:24.090> an<00:03:24.329> amino<00:03:25.079> acid

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
translate that mRNA into an amino acid

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.379 
translate that mRNA into an amino acid
chain<00:03:25.889> which<00:03:26.190> will<00:03:26.400> then<00:03:26.579> enter<00:03:26.819> our<00:03:27.180> rough

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
chain which will then enter our rough

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.360 
chain which will then enter our rough
endoplasmic<00:03:27.829> reticulum<00:03:28.829> where<00:03:29.040> it's<00:03:29.160> going

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
endoplasmic reticulum where it's going

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.809 
endoplasmic reticulum where it's going
to<00:03:29.459> be<00:03:29.660> folded<00:03:30.660> into<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.139> functional<00:03:32.099> protein

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
to be folded into a functional protein

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.930 
to be folded into a functional protein
so<00:03:33.090> we're<00:03:33.269> creating<00:03:33.920> protein<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.730> our

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
so we're creating protein and in our

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.780 
so we're creating protein and in our
smooth<00:03:36.389> endoplasmic<00:03:36.859> reticulum<00:03:37.859> we're<00:03:38.519> going

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
smooth endoplasmic reticulum we're going

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.650 
smooth endoplasmic reticulum we're going
to<00:03:38.970> be<00:03:39.150> synthesizing<00:03:40.109> lipids<00:03:41.099> and<00:03:41.370> steroids

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
to be synthesizing lipids and steroids

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.530 
to be synthesizing lipids and steroids
or<00:03:42.660> moans<00:03:42.870> as<00:03:43.139> well<00:03:43.410> so<00:03:43.709> these<00:03:43.919> two

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
or moans as well so these two

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.720 
or moans as well so these two
endoplasmic<00:03:45.540> reticulum<00:03:46.380> are<00:03:46.650> going<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.579> be

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
endoplasmic reticulum are going to be

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.629 
endoplasmic reticulum are going to be
working<00:03:48.389> together<00:03:48.540> in<00:03:48.930> synthesizing<00:03:49.829> new

working together in synthesizing new
cellular<00:03:51.000> products<00:03:51.919> but<00:03:52.919> we<00:03:53.069> need<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.370> be<00:03:53.459> able

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.120 
cellular products but we need to be able
to<00:03:53.700> tell<00:03:54.209> our<00:03:54.480> body<00:03:54.750> where<00:03:55.109> we<00:03:55.139> want<00:03:55.500> these<00:03:55.680> new

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
to tell our body where we want these new

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.550 
to tell our body where we want these new
products<00:03:56.639> to<00:03:56.819> go<00:03:57.060> so<00:03:57.750> what<00:03:57.930> we're<00:03:58.079> going<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.380> do

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
products to go so what we're going to do

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.120 
products to go so what we're going to do
is<00:03:58.769> send<00:03:59.130> them<00:03:59.310> off<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.849> the<00:04:00.000> Golgi<00:04:00.840> apparatus

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
is send them off to the Golgi apparatus

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.770 
is send them off to the Golgi apparatus
where<00:04:02.130> they're<00:04:02.310> going<00:04:02.579> to<00:04:02.760> be<00:04:02.910> our<00:04:03.120> processed

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.089 
where they're going to be our processed
and<00:04:04.079> tagged<00:04:04.799> and<00:04:05.160> put<00:04:05.519> into<00:04:06.000> vesicles<00:04:07.099> once

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
and tagged and put into vesicles once

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.979 
and tagged and put into vesicles once
they're<00:04:08.370> put<00:04:08.639> into<00:04:08.819> vesicles<00:04:09.419> we<00:04:09.810> can

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
they're put into vesicles we can

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.199 
they're put into vesicles we can
actually<00:04:10.440> start<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.829> deliver<00:04:11.579> them<00:04:12.000> either

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
actually start to deliver them either

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.500 
actually start to deliver them either
around<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.900> cell<00:04:13.169> or<00:04:13.410> around<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:14.099> body<00:04:14.359> so<00:04:15.359> we

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
around the cell or around the body so we

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.060 
around the cell or around the body so we
can<00:04:15.660> see<00:04:15.870> this<00:04:16.049> vesicle<00:04:16.500> here<00:04:16.859> either

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
can see this vesicle here either

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.479 
can see this vesicle here either
delivering<00:04:17.849> its<00:04:18.030> new<00:04:18.299> contents<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.200> the

right<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:31.860> we<00:04:32.010> need<00:04:32.280> our<00:04:32.310> lysosomes<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.360> be

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
right and we need our lysosomes to be

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.160 
right and we need our lysosomes to be
able<00:04:33.570> to<00:04:33.870> digest<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:35.040> recycle<00:04:35.820> any<00:04:36.170> cellular

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
plasma membrane is going to be involved

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.750 
plasma membrane is going to be involved
in<00:05:23.450> endocytosis<00:05:24.450> or<00:05:24.890> exocytosis<00:05:25.890> as<00:05:26.280> well<00:05:26.550> but

in endocytosis or exocytosis as well but

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.590 
in endocytosis or exocytosis as well but
we'll<00:05:26.940> use<00:05:27.590> endocytosis<00:05:28.590> and<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.600> phagosome

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
we'll use endocytosis and the phagosome

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.490 
we'll use endocytosis and the phagosome
as<00:05:30.840> an<00:05:31.290> example<00:05:32.040> so<00:05:32.820> if<00:05:33.090> we<00:05:33.330> have<00:05:33.600> a<00:05:33.630> segment<00:05:34.140> of

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
as an example so if we have a segment of

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.850 
as an example so if we have a segment of
plasma<00:05:35.400> membrane<00:05:35.880> here<00:05:36.120> with<00:05:36.360> a<00:05:36.620> bacteria<00:05:37.620> on

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
the outside of our cell we're going to

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.540 
the outside of our cell we're going to

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
have a process have been called

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.940 
have a process have been called
phagocytosis<00:05:42.470> in<00:05:43.640> specific<00:05:44.640> cells<00:05:45.950> what's

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
phagocytosis in specific cells what's

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.620 
phagocytosis in specific cells what's
going<00:05:47.220> to<00:05:47.280> happen<00:05:47.640> here<00:05:47.850> is<00:05:47.970> our<00:05:48.120> plasma

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
going to happen here is our plasma

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.260 
going to happen here is our plasma
membrane<00:05:49.020> is<00:05:49.229> going<00:05:49.500> to<00:05:49.650> begin<00:05:49.860> to<00:05:50.270> engulf

that bacteria so it begins to engulf the

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.029 
that bacteria so it begins to engulf the
bacterial<00:05:55.260> cell<00:05:56.190> and<00:05:56.430> once<00:05:57.419> it<00:05:57.690> fully<00:05:58.169> engulfs

the<00:05:59.300> bacteria<00:06:00.390> we've<00:06:00.660> formed<00:06:01.320> something

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
the bacteria we've formed something

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.300 
the bacteria we've formed something
called

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
called

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.290 
called
the<00:06:02.930> phagosome<00:06:03.930> or<00:06:04.200> the<00:06:04.320> phagocytic<00:06:05.300> vacuole

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
the phagosome or the phagocytic vacuole

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.930 
the phagosome or the phagocytic vacuole
but<00:06:07.289> you<00:06:07.470> may<00:06:07.680> also<00:06:07.919> hear<00:06:08.370> it<00:06:08.400> called<00:06:08.520> a

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
but you may also hear it called a

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.380 
but you may also hear it called a
phagocytic<00:06:09.710> vesicle<00:06:10.710> as<00:06:10.919> well<00:06:11.400> so<00:06:11.910> the<00:06:12.090> best

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
phagocytic vesicle as well so the best

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.840 
phagocytic vesicle as well so the best
example<00:06:12.660> of<00:06:13.140> a<00:06:13.289> vacuole<00:06:13.890> is<00:06:14.100> going<00:06:14.610> to<00:06:14.729> be

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
example of a vacuole is going to be

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.830 
example of a vacuole is going to be
within<00:06:15.030> our<00:06:15.419> plant<00:06:15.780> cells<00:06:16.110> but<00:06:16.470> for<00:06:17.340> this

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
within our plant cells but for this

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.380 
within our plant cells but for this
process<00:06:18.840> either<00:06:19.140> term<00:06:19.680> is<00:06:20.060> acceptable<00:06:21.060> so

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.390 
process either term is acceptable so

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.810 
process either term is acceptable so
we've<00:06:21.570> had<00:06:21.810> that<00:06:22.050> bacteria<00:06:23.039> come<00:06:23.340> into<00:06:23.700> the

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
we've had that bacteria come into the

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.360 
we've had that bacteria come into the
cell<00:06:24.090> and<00:06:24.300> from<00:06:24.479> a<00:06:24.690> vacuole<00:06:25.229> or<00:06:25.470> a<00:06:25.500> vesicle<00:06:26.160> and

cell and from a vacuole or a vesicle and

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.690 
cell and from a vacuole or a vesicle and
then<00:06:27.150> we're<00:06:27.330> going<00:06:27.510> to<00:06:27.570> have<00:06:27.810> the<00:06:27.960> lysosome

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
then we're going to have the lysosome

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.430 
then we're going to have the lysosome
join<00:06:29.700> with<00:06:29.940> the<00:06:30.090> phagosome<00:06:30.660> to<00:06:30.930> form<00:06:31.260> the

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
join with the phagosome to form the

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.000 
join with the phagosome to form the
Fagor<00:06:32.400> lysosome<00:06:33.390> and<00:06:33.570> the<00:06:34.110> Fagor<00:06:34.350> lysosome<00:06:34.950> is

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
Fagor lysosome and the Fagor lysosome is

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.520 
Fagor lysosome and the Fagor lysosome is
where<00:06:35.370> we're<00:06:35.520> going<00:06:35.700> to<00:06:35.880> kill<00:06:36.570> and<00:06:36.900> break<00:06:37.289> down

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
where we're going to kill and break down

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.480 
where we're going to kill and break down
that<00:06:37.950> bacteria<00:06:39.169> so<00:06:40.169> we<00:06:40.349> can<00:06:40.530> see<00:06:40.800> now<00:06:40.979> how<00:06:41.010> all

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
processes and the last thing we want to

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.810 
processes and the last thing we want to
note<00:06:53.250> in<00:06:53.460> this<00:06:53.640> video<00:06:53.970> is<00:06:54.210> the<00:06:54.390> absence<00:06:55.020> of<00:06:55.230> the

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:55.820 
note in this video is the absence of the

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.120 
note in this video is the absence of the
mitochondria<00:06:56.820> and<00:06:57.500> peroxisomes<00:06:58.500> from<00:06:59.010> the

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.130 
mitochondria and peroxisomes from the

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.330 
mitochondria and peroxisomes from the
endomembrane<00:06:59.730> system<00:07:00.350> this<00:07:01.350> is<00:07:01.620> because<00:07:02.100> the

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
endomembrane system this is because the

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.060 
endomembrane system this is because the
mitochondria<00:07:03.180> is<00:07:03.450> going<00:07:03.870> to<00:07:04.020> be<00:07:04.170> involved<00:07:04.920> in

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070 
mitochondria is going to be involved in

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.040 
mitochondria is going to be involved in
cellular<00:07:05.370> respiration<00:07:05.850> and<00:07:06.630> energy

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
cellular respiration and energy

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.020 
cellular respiration and energy
production<00:07:07.230> which<00:07:07.710> is<00:07:07.860> not<00:07:08.100> part<00:07:08.790> of<00:07:08.880> the

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
production which is not part of the

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.780 
production which is not part of the
processes<00:07:09.810> we<00:07:10.020> have<00:07:10.200> seen<00:07:10.440> here<00:07:10.740> and<00:07:10.920> the

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.790 
processes we have seen here and the

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.490 
processes we have seen here and the
peroxisome<00:07:12.300> is<00:07:12.720> going<00:07:12.960> to<00:07:13.080> be<00:07:13.200> mainly

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 
peroxisome is going to be mainly

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.400 
peroxisome is going to be mainly
responsible<00:07:13.920> for<00:07:14.930> detoxifying<00:07:15.930> certain

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.410 
responsible for detoxifying certain

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.680 
responsible for detoxifying certain
chemicals<00:07:16.890> within<00:07:17.190> the<00:07:17.460> cell<00:07:17.700> as<00:07:17.880> well<00:07:18.450> as

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.690 
chemicals within the cell as well as

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.560 
chemicals within the cell as well as
oxidation<00:07:19.290> of<00:07:19.740> fatty<00:07:20.280> acids<00:07:20.760> and<00:07:20.940> it's<00:07:21.330> also

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:21.570 
oxidation of fatty acids and it's also

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.300 
oxidation of fatty acids and it's also
much<00:07:22.290> smaller<00:07:22.710> than<00:07:23.280> our<00:07:23.550> lysosome<00:07:24.450> and<00:07:25.310> with

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310 
much smaller than our lysosome and with

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.040 
much smaller than our lysosome and with
that<00:07:26.550> we've<00:07:26.730> covered<00:07:26.940> the<00:07:27.150> basics<00:07:27.690> of<00:07:27.840> our

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.050 
that we've covered the basics of our

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.530 
that we've covered the basics of our
endomembrane<00:07:28.860> system<00:07:28.890> so<00:07:29.820> we<00:07:29.940> can<00:07:29.970> see<00:07:30.360> how

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:30.540 
endomembrane system so we can see how

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.050 
endomembrane system so we can see how
all<00:07:30.570> of<00:07:30.810> these<00:07:31.140> membranous<00:07:32.130> organelles<00:07:32.370> work

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 
all of these membranous organelles work

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.590 
all of these membranous organelles work
together<00:07:33.330> to<00:07:34.080> make<00:07:34.470> sure<00:07:34.500> our<00:07:34.920> cell<00:07:35.280> is

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:35.600 
together to make sure our cell is

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.180 
together to make sure our cell is
functioning<00:07:36.600> correctly<00:07:36.750> now<00:07:37.680> I<00:07:37.710> hope<00:07:38.040> this

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:38.190 
functioning correctly now I hope this

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.430 
functioning correctly now I hope this
