00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hi how about youtube friends like the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.779
 been not expecting to find my 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.300
 name is key and is in the channel 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.990
 master pc 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.390
 excuse me if you hear something weird but I 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.410
 you want to give all 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.779
 and well 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.600
 as I had already said in a video 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.000
 previous in the cyclical download in the 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.060
 portable in this video I'm going to show you 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.060
 how to really use it is very easy 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.619
 and then if you do not have this program in 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.930
 the description of the video will be the link 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.720
 of the video so you can download it 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.070
 the 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.350
 Here is the interface of the chiclanero 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.600
 and what we will do is click where 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 says cleaner on the left side we 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.740
 comes out a menu we click on cleaner and 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.900
 analyze 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.770
 yes in case you have files 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:57.160
 based on running the cleaner accept and 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.750
 here it tells you when you have deleted them 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.390
 is going to tell you 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.300
 how many mb / d libero 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.640
 and we enter the registry in the same way 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.990
 is in the left menu we give in 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.990
 look for problems and here may take a 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.040
 little because they are the problems that when 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.840
 you turn on your computer, maybe there's a 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.810
 bad start as you can see I have 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.060
 these and we give in repairing selected 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.520
 we see that no no and no 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.799
 although as you see already says that no 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.280
 problem has failed now we move on to the 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.860
 tool option 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.900
 as you see here shows us the programs 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.640
 installed 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.850
 and in case you want to uninstall 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.450
 any 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.300
 packaged select it and you are going to click 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.750
 in running uninstaller 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.060
 it is very easy next following 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.600
 finish we're going to start 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.270
 and here you can configure the boot of 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.250
 your system is to say if you want to remove 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.330
 something that starts with two systems 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.330
 we can do 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.810
 I'll leave it that way 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.240
 I am fine but had to 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.730
 deactivate not only the choices and you 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.450
 click on that active 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:25.660
 restore and restore the system here 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.960
 You can see the day and the description of 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.630
 of the restaurant lie delete unit this 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.810
 program also allows you to delete a 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.530
 unity 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.330
 in case you do not want any of the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.930
 elections and erases them 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:48.630
 in options we find the option of the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:52.140
 chiclanero in the version and version and 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.470
 the language in configuration we can 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.530
 select another language if we want to 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.810
 example from Georgia but in this case I 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.460
 I choose it in Spanish 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.430
 once done that 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.430
 I think there is nothing left to say 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.020
 and that's how easy it is to use this simple 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.600
 program the truth is highly recommended 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.740
 since there is always a program of 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.740
 cleaning on your computer 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.110
 I also have videos of how to make a 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.630
 maintenance to a computer without 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.790
 programs 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.690
 everything propitiates the tools of 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.780
 windows and I hope and this video 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.190
 basic and simple more than anything has 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.810
 helped have served 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.330
 and then we will continue to see the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.560
 different records say goodbye and go 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.560
 See you later
