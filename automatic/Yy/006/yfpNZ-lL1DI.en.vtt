00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello guys for those who have not seen yet 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.969
 my parallel switch video is 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.860
 good to see why because the person 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.680
 understand this switch scheme 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.600
 intermediary has to know the scheme 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.220
 parallel switch because because the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.199
 intermediate fi 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.160
 its installation is between parallels 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.700
 Ok, so I'll leave it here in the description 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.050
 this video the link to my video of 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.219
 parallel switch 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.890
 Ok, so let's go, people, schema. 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.540
 multifilament of a switch 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.590
 intermediary 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.320
 the intermediate switch has two 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.800
 positions for contacts 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.930
 the first is this one, the contacts in 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.780
 parallel 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:02.699
 then the first contact closes the boy and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:09.260
 11 born with two second contact closes 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:18.360
 born 3 as born 4 personal rock 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:19.950
 now I'll show you if the second 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.590
 contact position 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.630
 the second position and personal x when the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.170
 person goes there and key 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.340
 it changes from the parallel contact to x 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.500
 coc 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:38.130
 now it closes the born 1 with bayern 4 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.619
 and the born 2 colborn 3 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.470
 this is the internal functioning of 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.200
 contacts 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.790
 then back here to the parallel 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.080
 I'll leave in parallel to start 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:56.000
 explain then the staff 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.580
 intermediate contact in parallel is 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.370
 as if it were a direct thread 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.160
 Ok, we can consider this here. 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.130
 as an amendment because it does not 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.090
 do nothing, it's just stay 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.870
 inactive here ok then if we just 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.600
 use the parallel the parallels 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.300
 the same connection scheme is the same 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.350
 how my video works 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:28.790
 anterior contact on the opposite side of the 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:33.230
 lamp off the same side 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:38.290
 in the same direction the circulation of 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:41.540
 and the lamp lights up 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.420
 so the staff is like this 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.650
 contact in the same direction follow the thread 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.709
 here o 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.540
 all closed contracts there are 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.140
 current circulation 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.850
 now I come in the second parallel here 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:01.130
 I put the contact down then 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:07.900
 contact in the opposite direction there is no 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:10.239
 and the lamp turns off 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.790
 equal 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:18.470
 the previous video 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:22.370
 the difference will now pretend that I you 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:28.030
 I created here the intermediate switch and 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:30.640
 it closed in xis how it works now 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:36.040
 so let's follow the contact 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:39.350
 the current goes out of phase passes to the born 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.269
 from above because the ones with the contact 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.989
 closed up 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.930
 by the return of the higher parallel I 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.450
 I'll call this one of superior and arrive 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.079
 up to the first first 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.110
 intermediate as it is closed in x 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:00.650
 the current will go from the born 11 to the 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.200
 4 and will exit by returning the 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.920
 parallel 2 lower 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:11.400
 I'll call it inferior 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.459
 as the contact is closed through the 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:20.340
 reaches the center of the parallel and 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:23.520
 output from the lamp return amounting to 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.730
 Same ok, guys. 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:32.250
 so we can conclude that if the 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:37.050
 of the intermediary are x to 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:40.500
 light will come on if the 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.669
 two parallels are pointing 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.540
 opposite 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:49.530
 Okay look there, then if you're going 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:56.010
 opposite to current flow in 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:59.550
 sense in the same sense, there is no 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:03.090
 current flow followed here by the 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:06.510
 wire to roll the center up and arrived 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.330
 until the one born of the middleman passed 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.820
 for the 4 born out by the return of the 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.570
 parallel reaching the bottom 2 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.160
 2 and the open contact then does not 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.840
 there is current circulation 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.970
 the same occurs in the other sense here 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:28.830
 arrived here in born 2 of the middleman 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:32.669
 passed to the 3 left by the return of the 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.440
 lower parallel, and here the contact 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.460
 is open then there is no circulation of 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.070
 chain 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.600
 This is how it works, now I'm going. 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:48.690
 simulate typing here in the middleman 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:50.780
 look there I got it closed in parallel and 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:59.100
 what happened 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:06:02.850
 the lamp came on because why 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:05.970
 contact of the parallels in the same direction and 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.229
 the contact here closing the one with 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.169
 born 2 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:14.760
 let's follow the current thread went through 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:17.820
 here and there he found the path closed and 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.930
 lighting a light bulb is a bit difficult 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.150
 to understand but that's how it works 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:26.449
 I'll show it now on my bench. 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:29.330
 operation with one with two and with 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:32.270
 three intermediate switches and I'll 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.370
 to simulate a defect that is the most common 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.979
 what else happens on a daily basis 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.979
 Ok, let's go to my workbench.
