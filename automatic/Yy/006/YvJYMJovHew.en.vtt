from the team in the air consistent gold
so<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:10.950> didn't<00:00:11.160> get<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.340> big<00:00:11.730> stat<00:00:12.420> increases

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019

with<00:01:04.619> him<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.210> this<00:01:06.210> guy<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.750> actually<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> very

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
with him and this guy is actually a very

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.039 
with him and this guy is actually a very
solid<00:01:08.130> player<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:09.119> i'm<00:01:09.299> honest<00:01:09.659> she<00:01:09.810> didn't

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
solid player if i'm honest she didn't

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.810 
solid player if i'm honest she didn't
feel<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.470> much<00:01:10.650> different<00:01:11.070> since<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.729> not

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
feel that much different since I not

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.880 
feel that much different since I not
informed<00:01:12.030> at<00:01:12.479> all<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.869> mean<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.650> was<00:01:13.770> already

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
informed at all I mean I was already

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.830 
informed at all I mean I was already
expecting<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.850> much<00:01:15.090> different<00:01:15.450> based<00:01:15.659> on

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
expecting to be much different based on

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.380 
expecting to be much different based on
the<00:01:15.960> stats<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.280> base<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.490> solely<00:01:18.150> on

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the stats but if you base it solely on

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.609 
the stats but if you base it solely on
the<00:01:18.509> price<00:01:18.780> difference<00:01:19.080> then<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.530> would

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the price difference then you would

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.990 
the price difference then you would
expect<00:01:19.890> him<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.310> good<00:01:20.490> bit<00:01:20.640> different

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
expect him to be a good bit different

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.760 
expect him to be a good bit different
played<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> couple<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.960> nice<00:01:22.140> passes<00:01:22.619> actually

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
played a couple of nice passes actually

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.920 
played a couple of nice passes actually
which<00:01:23.009> was<00:01:23.159> quite<00:01:23.310> surprising<00:01:23.759> his<00:01:24.450> passing

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
which was quite surprising his passing

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.840 
which was quite surprising his passing
did<00:01:25.080> get<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> seven-point<00:01:25.890> upgrade<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:26.670> it's

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
did get a seven-point upgrade but it's

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.359 
did get a seven-point upgrade but it's
only<00:01:27.240> 72<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.470> team<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> year<00:01:28.920> version

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
only 72 in the team of the year version

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.210 
only 72 in the team of the year version
so<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.970> was<00:01:30.119> quite<00:01:30.659> surprising<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:32.070> yeah

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
so that was quite surprising but yeah

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.740 
so that was quite surprising but yeah
there's<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.939> really<00:01:33.119> much<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.360> complain

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
there's not really much to complain

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.170 
there's not really much to complain
about<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.650> Kelly<00:01:34.979> apart<00:01:35.820> from<00:01:35.939> maybe

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
about with this Kelly apart from maybe

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.319 
about with this Kelly apart from maybe
the<00:01:36.390> price<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:37.020> mean<00:01:37.439> he's<00:01:37.619> got<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> pace<00:01:38.329> he's

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
the price I mean he's got the pace he's

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.050 
the price I mean he's got the pace he's
got<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.540> tackling<00:01:40.049> he<00:01:41.009> might<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.909> a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
got the tackling he might just be a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.990 
got the tackling he might just be a

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.760 
this case
a<00:04:26.730> very<00:04:27.030> solid<00:04:27.420> defender<00:04:27.750> definitely<00:04:28.650> better

than day day he seems to feel a bit
quickly<00:04:31.470> probably<00:04:32.010> due<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.400> his<00:04:32.910> much<00:04:33.360> higher

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
quickly probably due to his much higher

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.110 
quickly probably due to his much higher
agility<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.200> balance<00:04:34.520> although<00:04:35.520> it's<00:04:35.940> not

agility and balance although it's not
the<00:04:36.480> best<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:37.020> he<00:04:37.290> can<00:04:37.500> get<00:04:37.650> turned<00:04:37.920> inside

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
the best and he can get turned inside

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.180 
the best and he can get turned inside
out<00:04:38.400> sometimes<00:04:39.000> because<00:04:39.810> he<00:04:40.350> only<00:04:40.470> has<00:04:40.680> 70

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190

something<00:04:41.400> each<00:04:41.760> other<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.090> imbalance<00:04:42.480> which

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
something each other the imbalance which

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.150 
something each other the imbalance which
means<00:04:42.990> you<00:04:43.110> won't<00:04:43.230> be<00:04:43.350> able<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.590> turn<00:04:43.710> his<00:04:43.890> fast

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
means you won't be able to turn his fast

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.730 
means you won't be able to turn his fast
but<00:04:44.820> his<00:04:44.940> sprint<00:04:45.180> speed<00:04:45.420> is<00:04:45.690> very<00:04:46.140> impressive

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
but his sprint speed is very impressive

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.040 
but his sprint speed is very impressive
and<00:04:46.920> then<00:04:47.760> his<00:04:47.940> acceleration<00:04:48.390> being<00:04:48.690> quite<00:04:49.020> a

and then his acceleration being quite a

and then his acceleration being quite a

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
lot lower than his average pace is not

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.450 
lot lower than his average pace is not
really<00:04:51.660> that<00:04:51.690> noticeable<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.470> yeah<00:04:53.160> this<00:04:53.280> guy

really that noticeable and yeah this guy
feels<00:04:53.670> like<00:04:53.850> a<00:04:53.880> very<00:04:54.150> quick<00:04:54.600> center<00:04:54.990> back<00:04:55.170> and

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
feels like a very quick center back and

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.710 
feels like a very quick center back and
he's<00:04:56.100> got<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.310> decent<00:04:56.520> enough<00:04:56.940> shot<00:04:57.210> on<00:04:57.330> him<00:04:57.510> too

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
he's got a decent enough shot on him too

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.840 
he's got a decent enough shot on him too
