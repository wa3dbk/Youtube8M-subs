 it's a hat that makes music 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.639

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.370

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.289

 loses by pressing the play button here 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.430
 for 5 seconds 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.890
 the soul cap is in awake mode the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.539
 phone if we 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.550

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.410
 mark or water the earth that's it was in 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.670
 for a moment there is a small LED that has 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.350
 says that it's happening or 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.670

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.800
 are studying who just works this is 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.840

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.640

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.870
 a phone archos of course on 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.320
 the bonnet like the one kill in the egg 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.949
 that's it on the 50th okay see 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.750
 our side so a whole this is the 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.690
 musicme darcos will be available in 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.610
 October multiple colors 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.750
 if marketed in case 29 euros 99 so 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.040
 at the hat is operating your 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.110
 phone with his cap finally when 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.970
 yes that's exactly so it's a 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.140
 hat that will make sure that one 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.520
 stream of music from anywhere 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.330
 which bluetooth device 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.610
 so again android ios windows 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.540
 phone he heard and we'll streamed from the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.580
 music since then 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.320
 imagine a smartphone on the blue the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.470
 bluetooth on walnut bread 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.759
 the denial music and so that it works so 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.680
 in standard bluetooth it's 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.100
 marketed in October from 9 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.240
 euros 99 and so that's for sure so yes and 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.710
 so against the little thing that I have 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.360
 not said earlier and that someone 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.039
 interesting is that we can wash 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.200
 of course the cap or in fact there 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.850
 there is a small opening here 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.649
 and then my there I made my life 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.119
 he creates between the two teams and then 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.259
 it's dubbed a kind of polar that's 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.750
 that's it 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.039
 Frankly that's true for the price we 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.650
 was cold with that is that there is a 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.300
 very good quality or 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.980
 and so this is so suddenly there is this 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.630
 little virtue done to reload it 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.660
 how going so it recharges 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.300
 micro usb here is so once look 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.650
 it takes eight hours listening so 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.360
 roughly speaking it will hold you the week 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.430
 too baked jog if you run 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.340
 8 so agree and it's charging in 90 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.550
 minutes at the micro usb rest charge us 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.260
 these times is the first bonnec 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.620
 we plug into a usb port 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.180
 yeah that's it exactly and then and 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.380
 then again the sound quality 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.970
 is really nice to me personally 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.100
 I was really amazed 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.610
 honesty because why in 1999 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.410
 it's really great there will be 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.550
 several colors of mayorat several 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.080
 runners I can not tell you more 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.510
 for now but yes in several 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.340
 colors several patterns and it happens 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.600
 so again in October under the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.090
