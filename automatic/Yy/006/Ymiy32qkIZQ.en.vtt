00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.309
 while today we will talk about wintering 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.679
 Gross% is in kindergarten 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.139
 so we have the wind in our sails 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.679
 that's where you explain all that 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.000
 hello everyone so the wintering% is so as its name indicates 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.620
 it is to protect the engine during the winter period so that it is 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.130
 outboard or terminal 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.130
 we will have to protect all the engines inside the outside 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.730
 so that they are in good condition to be able to return to water 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.980
 so let's start with the fuel stabilizer it's a 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.080
 important product 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.410
 why it is important 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.220
 because it's a product that allow you to keep your essence from a 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.640
 year on the other 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.830
 this deficiency with decency 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.220
 this little boy 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.230
 if you do the math the top avoids throwing your knowledge out of 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.090
 deaf so it's still a product 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.130
 relatively weak 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.540
 second thing 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.540
 to this you avoid the deputies this innovation 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.850
 it's things 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.000
 the rather interesting 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.010
 one of the centerpieces balance sheet has to be rotated it does not 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.439
 better, that is to say, we do 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.649
 we drop it in the tank we run the engine 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:09.790
 for a little while 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.890
 and everything that happens when one knows of course the senses and the future in 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.890
 the feed circuit to prevent that strollers feeding 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.370
 very important of spectators 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.159
 a very important city product if civil side story then sport and style 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.450
 they must also provide elsewhere 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.820
 these something 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.909
 that we put inside the engine and that's going to ensure us 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.810
 term viewer protection 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.080
 How's it going 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.380
 you have the world 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.810
 with a little studio like that for the past 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.850
 in the cylinders 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.510
 we remove candles replacement six years 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.710
 we will make sure that this is at the level 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.360
 mission level to run the state engine 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.510
 at a regime 2500 rpm 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.350
 you spend your useful time 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.590
 at the mission level 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.640
 the engine enough all the one way 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.550
 you cut the engine where it will overtake everything done alone he stalled 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.079
 and for his club you have 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.860
 more than 75 tonnes are protected for various 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.050
 how much time is it worth 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.050
 so that's a product that boasted a euro 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.329
 then we have the Genevan camp rda 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:19.389
 so this product it allowed you to put a layer to spend a layer 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.309
 it is targeting the milk crisis at the level of the engine 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.239
 it really is very important 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.239
 because it's going to protect the engine from moisture 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:31.959
 the five most exposed countries in this collective 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.959
 it's going to make a protective run high head level 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.139
 importance 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:39.779
 then we have 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.869
 what's called on the votes to read the oil in bad that is here 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.289
 what are also called feet 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:47.629
 facing these lines 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.889
 this normal 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.279
 of sarah leonor base why during the winter 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.299
 if you ever have water presence in their bases what may happen that they 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.299
 do not wish you presented to members 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.140
 if you do not drain 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.259
 when you go back next season 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:04.029
 if you have to your 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:07.979
 gold down what stayed all will liberate with water in it board that 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:08.469
 carried away 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:12.060
 they have not all been published demonstrate what would be good for me 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:14.959
 in fact you are killers tickets prem 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.919
 it 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.389
 and how much 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:19.890
 his reply 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.890
 it costs in the suburbs 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.549
 it is done 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:29.869
 we have of course 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:32.999
 obviously the oil 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.069
 engine 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.079
 I want to make an engine oil change 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.549
 so that 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.839
 because when you go back time 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:42.189
 they are ready to turn 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.459
 then the engine 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.529
 after fitted to your boxer motor forming a terminal 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:48.949
 it will be him of course 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.089
 and what makes that 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:53.220
 in the beautiful days tour 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.509
 we will have an engine that will be in good condition kraft foods 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:58.359
 the candles would have to change too 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.229
 then pleaded 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:02.659
 supermarket supervisory board 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.799
 that is to say that as we had a lot of teeth run the engine 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.919
 for a critical round 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.369
 and desire martine aubry 

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:13.509
 for wintering filled 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:15.080
 the old candles 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.340
 to support the news 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.219
 but the news 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:21.829
 for the restart I turned with small candles the time of 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.150
 current debate that the city surplus has been rested for the greens 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.100
 and then the wave of shock while not forgetting of course the ice 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.200
 then greece of course 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.229
 which equals 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.490
 trees working tracks 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.350
 so for the om 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.689
 launching netizens who saw this emptiness on the magna rim 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:43.729
 the union alliance in the wake of this site we offer you this 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:44.520

 disappointed 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.979
 in e to 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.539
 it is by this route that the fuel budget items 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:19.159
 are you going to keep it and what's more you avoid it 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.759
 howard 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.979
 we will start with the stabilizer
