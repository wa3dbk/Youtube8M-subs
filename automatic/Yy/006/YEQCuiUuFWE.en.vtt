00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.719
 hi i am emma and today i would like to 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.580
 so much to show you how to make it 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.150
 perforated stitches working 2 stitches 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.410
 together with the thrown using 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.700
 this technique 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.390
 we can make beautiful ones 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.599
 openwork shawls like this where in 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.910
 actually we use a tie for 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.550
 make the body part and then the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.280
 part perforated and made of 2 meshes 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.620
 together worked together with straight with the 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.780
 thrown the effect then you see 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.850
 beautiful of these nuances is given 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.739
 just from the yarn dyeing that a 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.890
 very beautiful and very charming world 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.649
 because every skein every ball has one 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.449
 their own identity their own colors 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.850
 I used this technique of the two 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.920
 jerseys along with straight of the thrown 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.469
 even in this neck as far as 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.920
 concerns the perforated part and lo 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.960
 combined with braids we now take 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.619
 the project here i'm making one 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.600
 shawl where all the movement over 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.960
 to the shades of color that are very 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.119
 fascinating and made just thanks 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.330
 to these 2 knitwear together work a 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.820
 straight and thrown to work 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.920
 shawls with circular needle actually I 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.110
 I don't close in circles but I continue to 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.680
 work back and forth as if 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.259
 were using a straight iron when 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.759
 started working in begotten a small one 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.409
 edge in the garter stalls for which 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.659
 start and work the first five jerseys 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.810
 in this case for this shawl a 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.360
 straight i am using brand point for 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.500
 tell me in this case the change of 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:56.619
 processing and now I begin to create the two 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.939
 jerseys along with straight and thrown 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.530
 taking the two shirts I work 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:05.090
 right but I take them together and then 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.690
 I take the tip of the right iron it 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.480
 passed under the wire and creates a new one 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.530
 knit when I work then iron 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.769
 next working it the thrown one 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.109
 worked will make me this hole 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.819
 decorative also serves me for a 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.319
 technical reason 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.639
 when I work 2 shirts together with 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.989
 straight actually creates a decrease 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.790
 in the next episodes you would like 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.269
 so much to show you other techniques 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.299
 to create perforated and decorative stitches 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.989
 but in the meantime we train together 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:43.879
 working thrown and 2 mesh together 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:48.639
 thrown and 2 stitches together 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.639
 hello next time, good job 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:03:01.900
