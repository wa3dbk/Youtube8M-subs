00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.720
 of the channel is moto thinking today tutorials 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.779
 for you 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.689
 there's how to create a virtual machine in your 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.609
 Real machine , it's fine, too. 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.800
 Before you talk about it, you can 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.289
 realize that I have a new look 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.020
 right here with windows 8.1 rock and you guys 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.180
 they perceive that it looks like a real 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.860
 which has all the functionalities 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.920
 I can access everything I have here. 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.800
 among many things it's good in 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.810
 truth is a virtual machine 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.150
 If I do it here to say that 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.550
 I'm on my real pc is this 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.200
 and my virtual machine is from here 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.710
 it's in a window 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.420
 It's good, folks, the first thing I go 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.820
 choose I will clarify what is a 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.490
 virtual machine by its own name says 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.439
 virtual machine is not even virtual 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.630
 that it the operating system that you 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.720
 directly installs our machine is 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.820
 made on a machine in a software that turns 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.510
 a virtual machine like this that you 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.790
 You see, it's good, it 's guaranteed with 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.580
 that the guarantee that you have even this 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.140
 virtual machine the benefits in fact 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.190
 any benefits you have to this 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.320
 virtual machine 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.810
 good the virtual machine is very good for 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.479
 you test operating systems you 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.880
 even I know do not know sometimes you 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.520
 just want to test it and in other programs 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.920
 test programs among other things 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.140
 test things or even use it with 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.060
 normal operation 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.510

 my real activity machine is 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.740
 people and and here is virtual machine goes 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.229

 priest who works everything normal zinho is 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.979
 like a real machine and demands a 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.590
 a little because after a while the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.599
 ram for this machine is that I will 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.569
 Come in and you are the first I go 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.749

 more or less okay so it's not so heavy 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.889

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.120
 here is the problem after you

 this is you are downloaded then you 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.280
 will double-click on the program 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:05.069
 You hope it's a bit of a plus. 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:05.069

 click next is also marked next 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.680
 I think if you want it is a 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.430
 icon on the desktop in this area of 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:34.090
 and the menu in the programs is then 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.270
 yes, then you click next 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:43.449
 click continue and you are installing 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:45.370
 vm the web player're also some people 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.639
 You went to find out a little bit more about the 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.759
 government is not who sees it and a thousand is 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.400
 xbox tate a tank that there is paid 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:57.039
 so how is it free and does almost everything 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.300
 Workstation Does Resolve to Teach 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.410
 this for you 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.620
 there is also the pc the pc box virtualbox eu 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.690
 I think even there, except that one is 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.340
 This is much better because it has the 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.780
 windows in linux has several systems 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.570
 that you may be 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.460
 installing another one there does not have a 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.130
 limitation for what I saw 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.919
 It's him and it's much cooler. 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:25.050
 more intuitive so I quite like it 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:27.639
 he's fine, so let's wait here 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.150
 finished installing you click on 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.740
 peniche made will be here the icon if 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.690
 You left to dial and in the hours 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.090

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.650
 What here is good, then you'll give two 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.009
 Clicks on it will take a 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:45.759
 little but always opens and will open 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:49.690
 what 's the hot virtual machine 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:52.690
 you are using can see that here of 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:56.080
 best player not commercial use only 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:59.169
 is read-only and is not 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.940
 commercial tabu and the next videoaula 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.110
 this is from the next videoaula to 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.710
 People are going to teach what a machine is like 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.380
 virtual and then this teach together 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.539
 creating more virtual the same together 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:15.280
 Why can not you run away from this? 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:17.199
 It's how you format it, it's fine. 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.330
 It's very simple, and you will learn 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.310
 step by step how to format how it is 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.130
 a brand a virtual machine 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.590
 so it 's really cool with the good people I hope 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:29.349
