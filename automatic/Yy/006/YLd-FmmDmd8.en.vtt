00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.679
 hello everyone that such kids 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.149
 welcome to the channel and today I bring you 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.060
 a video showing how to do the 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:10.010
 whatsapp logo in the call of duty 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.110
 black ostos in the emblem editor there 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.600
 you have it and well these are the layers 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.910
 that we will use during creation 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.800
 of the emblem now I will go to teach 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.930
 what step by step we can give 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.180
 different tones to the green area but 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.760
 Well the first thing is to include some 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.280
 circles once you have all the 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.380
 unlocked forms you can do it 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.210
 the first one is going to be white, we're going to 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.670
 use a white triangle to 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.460
 finish that area of ​​the sandwich we're going 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.800
 to turn with the triggers we are going to place 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.199
 so that there and then we are going to take 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.319
 let's make a green circle 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.809
 this time it's going to be smaller we can 

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:50.719
 then change the color by pressing the button 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.370
 and it's worth it and we can put it different 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.010
 shades of green you can put more 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.870
 of course I have done with 2 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.850
 two shades of green the other bed more 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.379
 dark and this milk clearer and good 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.820
 we just leave it a little more 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.129
 small that the edge now 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.740
 we take a triangle we draw it from 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.780
 green color we also have it that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.680
 put a little above the area 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.390
 this way will give a feeling that it is 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.539
 one sandwich over another and it will stay 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.810
 pretty good you'll see at the end 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.640
 we put that 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.040
 we can change it a bit we can 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.990
 leave more white areas less areas 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.610
 white and then to perform the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.310
 phone that is inside the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.250
 logo we're going to need another three 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.929
 layers we're going to need two circles and 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.490
 in him to perform in the stick area 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:43.360
 we're going to need a stick like that a little bit 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.950
 oblique we are going to see how it is we take 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.320
 the other circle the two circles that 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.679
 they must be the same size obviously 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.649
 and good I will bring you more emblems so that 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.750
 you see how to do it I hope that I am 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.450
 Enjoying that you make your own 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.610
 logo that gives you ideas and nothing we take 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.649
 this this stick here we rotate it 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.119
 we put between the two circles what 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.369
 we do a little bit bigger here I had 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.979
 gone a bit and nothing there we have already 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.840
 made our telof phone more or less 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.150
 the truth is that it will give quite the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.739
 sing but good the truth is that it remains 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.739
 pretty good I hope you liked it 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.630
