00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.310 
feel like this is a lot an easier way to
apply<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.090> lipstick<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.900> don't<00:02:16.170> get

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
apply the lipstick and you don't get

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.930 
apply the lipstick and you don't get
such<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.560> heavy<00:02:16.860> amount<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.370> get<00:02:17.520> more<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.790> a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
such a heavy amount you get more of a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.510 
such a heavy amount you get more of a
stained<00:02:18.810> look<00:02:19.170> rather<00:02:19.380> than<00:02:19.650> just<00:02:19.950> cakey

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
stained look rather than just cakey

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.310 
stained look rather than just cakey
lipstick<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.360> end<00:02:21.540> up<00:02:21.690> not<00:02:21.750> getting<00:02:22.080> it

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
lipstick and you end up not getting it

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.080 
lipstick and you end up not getting it
all<00:02:22.470> over<00:02:22.500> your<00:02:22.740> teeth<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.760> looks<00:02:23.910> a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
all over your teeth and it just looks a

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.760 
all over your teeth and it just looks a
lot<00:02:24.209> more<00:02:24.270> natural<00:02:24.810> than<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.050> does<00:02:25.200> before<00:02:25.380> so

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
lot more natural than it does before so

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.470 
lot more natural than it does before so
