00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello everyone here again here in the 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.700
 6,500 brought them a new video 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.600
 in which I'm going to show you how to do 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.690
 A first thing is how not to get lost 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.180
 how not to get lost in how not to lose your 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.250
 house rather computer minecraft 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.410
 as they know they are going to create computer 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.010
 worlds are infinite and it's very easy to 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.110
 that we lose our house the first thing is 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.450
 teach how to make a map when to 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.650
 make a map they will need a 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:38.370
 compass and to make the compass go to 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.370
 need 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:45.600
 a good iron so they have to put 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.600
 all that way 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:59.540
 since they have their compass they will proceed 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.570
 to do this they are going to need paper 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.580
 and we have paper 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.630
 this is the map here 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.630
 and I can 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.610
 then they're going to put the paper in there 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.130
 and the compass they did in the middle 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.150
 and already after they have that they are going to 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.150
 have your mommy 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.159
 well then they are going to do this 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.159
 looking down 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.060
 how studying a flat world looks like this 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.790
 but 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.009
 well now since you have your map I'm going 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.920
 to teach how to do it to not 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.299
 get lost as I have taught them 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.299
 the compass is made like this 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.430
 one of these acts 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.430
 whenever they leave, take one 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.690
 whenever it is the performance of a 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.619
 compass why 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.990
 So simple because that's how I do not know 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.170
 they will lose because a compass always 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.960
 is going to point where the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.390
 recommendation is to make your house near 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.810
 where they appeared or make a 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.570
 pointing for example if you 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.720
 they appeared to say here and their house the 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.990
 they do up there 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.250
 that is, here 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.250
 for example to your house 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.299
 for example where they appeared make a 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.939
 pointing out that his house is there 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.939
 as for example in the little arrow 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.440
 louis came out 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.090
 little arrows more or less like this 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.330
 so it's indicating that your house 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.810
 stay there and you just follow the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.810
 arrow 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.379
 when that is this rivals thing 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.890
 and we will see that your case is towards 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:15.500
 there and if they get lost simply 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.330
 they follow their compass and their compass 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.040
 guide where they appeared by 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.560
 example the guide here here appeared 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.840
 then they simply follow this and they 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.830
 are going to run into your house like that 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.930
 They told me a lot of our 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.700
 and good if you liked the video do not forget 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.020
 give like subscribe and until next time 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.020
 eating a video well
