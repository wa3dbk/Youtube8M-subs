00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.270
 new video I bring you a new tweet that 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.060
 it's called sweeping this tweet 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.810
 is in the beat box network to a 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:36.180
 price of 2.99 or on the repo of your 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.340
 iphone is at a free price so 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.800
 what interests us detrick is how 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.350
 they will see when they change the page they see 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.100
 effects 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.809
 that you can configure it, I have to 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.320
 closing random forgiveness and so be the 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.320
 to leave 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.530
 but we can configure it as we want 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.829
 this looks very nice I like is 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.190
 the batman 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.390
 says this 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.520
 how will you see wheels 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.469
 the applications 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.150
 and good is what this 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:18.820
 Tweet 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.530
 it's personalization but it's very pleasant 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.860
 and good to install we are going to 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.860
 Syria 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.520
 we are going to Syria 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.090
 and we wait for them to carry 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.909
 and well this this tweet not me 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.789
 it worked I have a generation ipod 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.860
 but they updated it and it already serves as 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.550
 They will see you recommended that they talk to you about 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.800
 this rhythm of shakira and pont 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.350
 the big box is also in the network but 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.720
 it costs so I recommend you 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.480
 initials the javier iphone and if not 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.740
 you know how to install that repo 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.850
 you will manage 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.950
 the sources edit add 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.619
 and the network will leave it in the destruction 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.150
 the repo and in an ad here but the 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:16.470
 answer http two diagonal points 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:20.390
 diagonal repo dot hac 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.810
 I iphone 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.080
 dot org bar and you would add 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.480
 source and it would be added in this case I do not 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.160
 I add it because I already have it and as 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.160
 you will see we go to the letter b 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.690
 and we look for the barrel tweet 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.330
 and we would give it where it seems 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.670
 modify they give install and they are 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.560
 will restart the device and they will be 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.240
 will create the application in this case I will 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.970
 meter is in the folder of cydia 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.510
 and also in adjustments I think if you 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.510
 the option will remain 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.880
 yes bar 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.690
 and well that 's what this does 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:14.250
 tweet that this effect is very nice 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.250
 also as an ulna 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.540
