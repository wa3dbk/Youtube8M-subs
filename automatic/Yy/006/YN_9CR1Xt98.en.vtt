00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.560
 hello everyone welcome to the channel before 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.510
 that all of you will surely notice my voice a 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.029
 little congested but I'm wrong 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.880
 there was a need to record this entry for the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.160
 video and then already regarding the video today 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.559
 I bring some decorations for you 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.420
 room that are super easy there's no 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.370
 to do any painting craft 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.500
 or buying things but they are things 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.270
 that we have on hand to decorate a 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.950
 bookshelf and it does not end so boring nor 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.020
 full of books so I hope that you 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.700
 like and inside video many times 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.120
 we have shelves full of books 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.430
 or messy since we do not know how 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.440
 decorate the or also mess up in 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.300
 day to day so they teach me 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.480
 three ideas how to decorate the bookshelf 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.370
 and also how to save your notes 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.700
 for the first idea we are going to use a 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.290
 car and a handful of sweets like that 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.030
 thought that we can decorate our 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.770
 room with something sweet because that's how 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.560
 when we went up we can talk a 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.350
 little bit 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.060
 I'm going to sort them as I like 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.189
 colors to fit well and 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.619
 next I will use a file cabinet 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.100
 great that is a zeta I do not know if what 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.320
 you call it like that and I've picked it up in pink 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.049
 just like with the box because well 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.049
 is more straight and I can put the stoppage 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.369
 to give prominence to the jug with 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.619
 touches I'm going to put it in the middle raised 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.619
 above the box to be pink then it goes 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.570
 with the tone of my room and the jar 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.520
 I like it a lot because it calls quite the 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.320
 Attention 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.060
 for the second idea we will use 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.330
 our notebooks or notebooks the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.910
 preferred a vase and a few 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.340
 flowers the flowers I will put them in a 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.459
 vase and I think this is a way 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.650
 to decorate and give a touch of joy to 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.709
 the room and that is not just a sign 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.290
 spring I will also place over 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.000
 of the books a handful of bracelets that 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.840
 I love them and I think they are super 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.840
 cool to decorate 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.180
 and so the result remains the truth that 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.580
 I love this bookshelf this drawer 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.350
 this part of the next idea that 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.750
 let's do is use an accessory 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.510
 favorite and magazines I will use 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.459
 magazines in small mode because I 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.330
 it seems that they are more comfortable and who after 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.910
 better I'll put them in mode I do not know how 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.000
 explain it floor and give it accessory over 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.130
 so it's easy to stay and very fast 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.690
 do the same so it will be shelving me 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.290
 I think there's quite a change of is the 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.540
 final is an ascenderÃ­a that I love 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.600
 decorate it and change it so I think that 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.380
 I'm going to make castles of fears 10 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.380
 different attractions 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.870

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.370

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.920
