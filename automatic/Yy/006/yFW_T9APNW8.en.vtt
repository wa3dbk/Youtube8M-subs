00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:08.140
 this is the most there the camera turned off 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:10.360
 by chance we keep talking 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.910
 I will come about this product here 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.220
 expensive stores and put all these 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:21.840
 shop as hall funds like ralf when 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.950
 many say other stores thats and they 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.230
 many of them position themselves as 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.040
 shops where 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.000
 predominant amount of products 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:34.000
 organic products are also meat 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.980
 for example the cow there always ate only 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.190
 exceptionally fresh good grass without 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.430
 any grams without increments of vacuum cleaners 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.660
 there and so on here of course among 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.650
 American population for very 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.600
 popular 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.960
 I noticed in principle, but for myself this 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.960
 shot that america is a very ideological nation 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.410
 if you submit ideas for organic food 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.910
 it is good and helpful the nation is very 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.630
 quickly it picks up thats exactly 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.120
 eat so 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.560
 the seat falls that beat the animals it 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.880
 ill immediately opens 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.250
 billion organization to protect them and then 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.260
 there is basically a business point of view 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.510
 probably it is very good if you 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.890
 you can push through some idea and 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.180
 people will catch it right away and 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.220
 buy you expensive organic product 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.680
 although on the other hand, but personally, I think 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.050
 what 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.640
 after our for example Belarusian 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.520
 chernobyl love accordion organics here this 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.350
 more than drugs Belarus therefore I 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.540
 to be honest on this is not particularly 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.620
 I dwell on everything and see no point 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.990
 overpay 2 3 2 3 price per stamp 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.330
 organics is of course true tourist on 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.729
 in fact there will be food not artificially 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.350
 grown all natural environment 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.880
 natural tasty and healthy 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.770
 well i don't think it's worth herring 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.320
 some is worth well yes 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.119
 funny to say of course they say that in 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.290
 America there everything is from the ladies chemistry 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.450
 trawling a lot of products 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.459
 here you already understand what's the matter of note note 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.040
 so it is, but here they talk about it and 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.290
 doing this side research and 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.530
 trying to somehow change the situation or 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.530
 even some chemicals to remove 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.330
 Fields with harmful it is as if no-one 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.820
 it does not follow 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.890
 and all by a lot to one place and you 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.050
 don't even know what you eat and never 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:36.470
 you learn from us this question is not even 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:38.990
 rises something might be in that food 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.530
 in any case, even organic is not organic. 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.020
 here any food any product passes 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.030
 mandatory also 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.950
 here and if this products will be 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.160
 unsuitable use is simply not 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.590
 miss sales is not so in Belarus 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.430
 as in Russia, that is, the team 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.620
 unsuitable gave bribe a bribe 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.810
 and the products immediately became suitable here 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.320
 this does not pass all that is connected with 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.790
 health of people with children's health 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.459
 hopeless animals absolutely everything 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.390
 undergoes mandatory testing and must 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.580
 be sure to be certified 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.980
 unconditional without options and 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.180
 and so on so basically buying 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.490
 here is the food 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.550
 I think anyone can be 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.590
 absolutely calm for their quality well yes 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.850
 only for a shelf life well and this is it 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.150
 of course there is anything well here we are 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.540
 drove in some 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.450
 day I honestly don't know where we are 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.140
 This is what you just go on or 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.079
 on the hills here in california 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.480
 at least ric sat down were things 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:53.950
 the territory is divided into my 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:57.790
 called a unit or like here 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.140
 build houses single catch every a 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.290
 one family 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.080
 This suggests that it is impossible 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.130
 to build houses that would be acceptable 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.410
 our family will be cut off 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.990
 that is, here for some reason divided 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:19.530
 minutes on such single-file criteria and 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:21.770
 there is gauss and rio or up there to the navel cute 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.770
 then 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.920
 here I think the houses are not very expensive 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:32.330
 live on white 7 so have average 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.920
 prosperity but judging because some 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.880
 the maze 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.880
 I do not think that here 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.120
 they are very expensive and maybe even 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.889
 reduce the cost 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.650
 although in principle I think there are many 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.650
 at home with a good view because it is a hall 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.289
 property principle understand we are heading 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:57.930
 bridle bardo grifid park it 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.149
 public city park los angeles where 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.539
 here are these letters where to talk 

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:05.300
 there are a lot of walking trails 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.979
 Where 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.830
 just walk go in for sports 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.599
 are gods with children there beautiful 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.020
 Nice view on beautiful los 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.690
 angeles 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.389
 and this is aquile water and well 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.080
 this is a little armenia literally there 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.080
 ten 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.520
 there were very many films shot 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.410
 popular place what may be going 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.310
 now press 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:35.200
 anyone can even something 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:36.910
 find out any price 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.010
 but in short such cases we probably now 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.050
 from swearing we need to figure out where we are 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.400
 go and then you should not yet 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.400
 shoot griffith park
