00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello to all she goes out on November 29 and 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.019
 she is already on the 01net techno channel 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.639
 it's playstation 4 and it's in a 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.469
 Parisian loft that we took in 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.889
 hand this console what are these 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.760
 new 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:22.289
 answer right away and you the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.600
 discover in all its seams 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.590
 if you have not seen it yet 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.420
 on the web which is still little 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.210
 probable but here it is true that we have 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.500
 filmed and yes so that's good she is not 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.610
 not completely completely different 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.320
 from the previous playsation case 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.270
 maybe with more shapes 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.010
 angular there really is a line this 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.079
 school generation actual true 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.680
 generation is not good design design 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.660
 sony she is relatively thin and this 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.670
 console in fact and well happens seven years 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.559
 after the playstation 3 7 in a big 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.780
 hour of play that breaks records in fact 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.940
 of longevity an extraordinary one has it 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.280
 tried and we can still say that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.500
 it's not it's not a shock indeed 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.079
 wow a lease because the first shock 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.640
 what we expect is the visual shock of 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.379
 to say we're going to see wow games that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.060
 will take off the retinas so there is 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.439
 very good games but you have to know that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.630
 these games there we could very well 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.369
 imagine seeing them on the playstation 3 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.310
 so we think that eventually this 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.360
 console is in its infancy and then 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.590
 more and more beautiful games in the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.659
 coming years while the ps3 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.920
 she arrived relationship remained summer 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.600
 for developers who want s 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.460
 perfect are beautiful so what 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.540
 are the three main novelties of 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.170
 this playstation 4 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.170
 we see that right away 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.700
 and the first of the novelties is here 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.469
 that it happens is the joystick well 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.880
 sure yes that's the heart of the console 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.820
 do it's with that you'll be able 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.630
 expose all your scores and play your 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.340
 games to perfection 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.990
 what's new on this controller then he 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.450
 there are two buttons that have disappeared I am 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.549
 very very sad I see well here is the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.770
 start button and the select button have 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.869
 gone but we forgive them because 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.490
 it is replaced by here this pavé pavé 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.869
 touch that will be used in 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.829
 some games there are very few people 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.149
 yet for the moment that it exploits 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.209
 but it will come and that is also 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.860
 clickable so why this touchpad 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.890
 is good because actually sony 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.990
 also wants to be in this movement of 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.399
 tactile games a convoy on the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.649
 smartphones and tablets 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.819
 digital so again we will have this 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.829
 possibility if you want 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.540
 obviously and then françois belle 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.170
 color that that's life color 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.250
 blue 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.650
 so why this little light in 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.060
 makes this light to several utilities 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.349
 the first is to know a little 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.430
 a few colors from finally the 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.200
 blue ritual me I'm going to have the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.400
 red and we'll know who plays with 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.630
 telma net 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.819
 and then that will allow you too 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.739
 to have certain interactions in 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.099
 some games at some key moments 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.099
 we'll say 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.849
 then the big piece of this console 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.230
 it's connectivity 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.090
 actually she connects to the web and 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.290
 from that moment on it is full 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.879
 full of new features 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.500
 will happen features 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.579
 unpublished compared to the playstation 3 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.629
 and wii what do we want to do 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.129
 most often when we play 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.629
 today is to share what we 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.099
 is doing so then up 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.629
 present we took a picture with his 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.500
 smartphone a little video and then we 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.209
 sent it on the web 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.389
 you've all done it if you're a gamer 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.489
 if you are under 18 years old too 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:05.170
 that's why maxi wines after that is 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.579
 true that we are most in need of 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.019
 smartphones everything is in the gamepad 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.430
 again the controller with this little 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.769
 button here is the play button this is the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.389
 big novelty is the share button 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.239
 sharing what happens when we 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.620
 press sharing well we access 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.120
 immediately to the last fifteen 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.200
 minutes of play that were recorded 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.889
 and yes because the strength of this 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.269
 console 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.650
 we will not go into the aspects 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.989
 techniques in fact she has two big 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.760
 processor 1 8 hearts that deals in 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.079
 spinning games 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.909
 traditional and then another that is going 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.650
 take care of all the video and 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.209
 sharing ie by pressing 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.700
 this end on this share button you go 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.470
 able to send the last 15 minutes 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.109
 of your game if you have exploded a 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.609
 boss who had been resisting for weeks 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.260
 if you have broken a record you are going 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.180
 able to do it and even go up the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.680
 Video avoid having fifteen minutes 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.510
 take to say the key moment and we 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.579
 even saw screenshots exactly 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.629
 so that's with this interface 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.129
 his menus but that are not 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.190
 definitive it will not be exactly like 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.989
 that when it comes out and we can send 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.560
 the video for example on facebook on 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.389
 ustream and later on youtube 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.849
 another aspect of the connectivity of 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.470
 French mobile apps and yes there 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.979
 still to join a little bit the 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.019
 touchpad 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:13.180
 you will be able to interact with this 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.680
 console with mobile apps from 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.419
 mobile apps that will not work that 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.979
 on smartphones say it works 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.169
 there too it is for example on ios ios 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.250
 android or download an app that will 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.139
 allow you to actually interact with 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.330
 your console for example a new game 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.770
 just released you receive a 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.419
 notification on your smartphone and 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.009
 you will be able even if you are not 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.050
 not at home directly 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.370
 well, here is the distance, it's not bad 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.840
 like that when you come back in the evening you 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.070
 can start playing this game good 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.969
 obviously it's forbidden in class 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.349
 recess 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:42.459
 but at school in a way not in the 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.689
 playground possibly it's 

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:45.639
 especially in classes where his interests 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.799
 in the echo and it's forbidden also 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.949
 at the offices to yes that's not good 

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:52.629
 assured productivity decline 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:55.389
 connectivity yet with another judge 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:58.689
 sony is the ps vita and wii the console 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.219
 portable sony who admit it has trouble 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.629
 to take off a maybe that precisely the 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:03.249
 playstation 4 inhabitants is a new 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.079
 youth this is a second existence a 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.549
 new youth with the possibility 

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:08.469
 is fine as we can do with 

00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:09.699
 some games the wiiu jérôme you 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.049
 start game for example on your 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.599
 playstation 4 

00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:15.369
 well you will continue this game there by 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.739
 example to continue his part in 

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:19.479
 your bed and well with the screen of the ps 

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:21.729
 vita is saying that I want this stream 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.029
 is automatically ps4 on ps 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.409
 vita 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.729
 so at first it will be 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.909
 only in the context of the house 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.229
 yes but in the wifi staff but 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.299
 sony plans to expand this 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.889
 international functionality via 

00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:35.409
 internet so you'll be in tokyo and 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.699
 your playstation at home with lamotte 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:38.679
 you will be able to play on the 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.829
 playstation move in favor of the top of the 

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:40.829
 kisses 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.690
 and yes third particularity of this 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.880
 console must not forget anyway in 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.840
 video material and get right into the 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.330
 world the 4k 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.280
 so yes of the ultra hd but be careful 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.010
 jérôme it will be an arbitration that for 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.390
 the movies you can download 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.470
 via a store that will be put in place 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.150
 do not know when we will make the games 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.500
 here are not the games anyway for 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.060
 the moment he whispers that maybe 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.590
 with an update we could have 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.110
 games in 4k it's not safe 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.000
 and something else it would seem and there 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.320
 again it's whispering here that this is the 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.570
 playstation 4 could be updated 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.950
 so that the blu ray player can 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.900
 become a blu-ray player four cases 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.970
 when the format 4k blu ray will come out in 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.650
 trade that would be fine here for 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.450
 the playstation 4 so be they so 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.450
 remember it on November 29 and 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.160
 will cost how much and will cost 399 euros 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.660
 months precisely just for the 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.910
 position relative to the price of the 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.500
 xbox wang who will stop big console 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.120
 and measuring arrived virtually at the same 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.440
 time and will cost 100 euros less but 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.340
 she will not have to say all the 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.260
 peculiarities every 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.140
 gesture capture features 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.190
 of kinect cora so the xbox one on 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.080
 which we will have the opportunity to come back 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.190
 very sure there will be about fifteen 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.840
 days promises us a fortnight 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.370
 titles at launch of this just ps4 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.710
 a dozen in dematerialized form 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.870
 so download and here we could 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:56.220
 try well including fifa 14 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.810
 killzone shadows fall with this vision 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.430
 enemies through the rocks I 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.780

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:11.160
 frankly it's the camera that will be 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.050
 by the way an option and so here we are 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.970
 joined a little bit the concept that 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.630
 that we already had on the playstation 3 and 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.010
 on kinect 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.990
 that's what we could say about this 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:23.510
 playstation 4 opportunities to return well 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.510
