00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.230 

okay<00:00:07.740> periscope<00:00:08.250> design<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.730> lot<00:00:08.910> simpler

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
okay periscope design is a lot simpler

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.299 
okay periscope design is a lot simpler
than<00:00:09.360> some<00:00:09.719> previous<00:00:10.170> ones<00:00:10.410> it's<00:00:11.160> actually

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
than some previous ones it's actually

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.039 
than some previous ones it's actually
just<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.730> slide<00:00:12.000> rail<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.389> couple<00:00:12.780> different

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
just a slide rail a couple different

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.959 
just a slide rail a couple different
parts<00:00:13.320> comes<00:00:13.590> apart<00:00:13.889> easily<00:00:14.099> for<00:00:14.580> fixing

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
parts comes apart easily for fixing

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.890 
parts comes apart easily for fixing
maintaining<00:00:16.460> unlike<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:18.090> drawer<00:00:18.420> slide<00:00:18.690> one

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
maintaining unlike the drawer slide one

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.200 
maintaining unlike the drawer slide one
which<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.529> actually<00:00:19.890> come<00:00:20.100> apart<00:00:20.460> if<00:00:20.789> it's<00:00:21.029> in

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
which can actually come apart if it's in

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.790 
which can actually come apart if it's in
the<00:00:21.240> right<00:00:21.420> position<00:00:21.900> or<00:00:22.020> push<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.470> right<00:00:22.590> way

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the right position or push the right way

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.620 
the right position or push the right way
it<00:00:23.039> come<00:00:23.310> off<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.550> slides<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:24.060> one<00:00:24.269> cannot

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
it come off it slides this one cannot

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.320 
it come off it slides this one cannot
this<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.109> off<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> CNC<00:00:25.890> machine<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.970> will<00:00:27.119> not

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
this is off a CNC machine it will not

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.970 
this is off a CNC machine it will not
let<00:00:27.510> go<00:00:27.720> unless<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.439> pull<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.710> through<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
let go unless you pull it through the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.299 
let go unless you pull it through the
top<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:31.140> what<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.410> not<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.679> there<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.130> right

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
top and what is not on there to do right

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.340 
top and what is not on there to do right
now<00:00:32.430> because<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> vulture<00:00:33.329> not<00:00:33.989> short<00:00:34.260> enough

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
now because the vulture not short enough

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.619 
now because the vulture not short enough
but<00:00:34.860> overall<00:00:35.450> it<00:00:36.450> works<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:37.790> periscope<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.450> our

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
but overall it works a periscope for our

00:00:39.629 --> 00:01:00.150 
but overall it works a periscope for our
two<00:00:39.899> first<00:00:40.860> design<00:00:41.250> first<00:00:41.850> test

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:15.770 

going<00:01:00.850> down

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.200 

let's<00:01:16.409> test<00:01:16.799> not<00:01:17.010> too<00:01:17.190> bad<00:01:17.400> there<00:01:17.670> isn't<00:01:17.700> burr

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
let's test not too bad there isn't burr

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.450 
let's test not too bad there isn't burr
on<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.840> rail<00:01:19.049> here<00:01:19.409> which<00:01:19.770> makes<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.220> stick

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
on the rail here which makes it to stick

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.190 
on the rail here which makes it to stick
a<00:01:20.490> little<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.270> find<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.600> way<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.930> fixing

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
a little I have to find a way of fixing

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.859 
a little I have to find a way of fixing
minute<00:01:22.710> or<00:01:23.220> put<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> spring<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.479> pulls<00:01:24.690> it

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
minute or put a spring so it pulls it

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.600 
minute or put a spring so it pulls it
back<00:01:24.960> down<00:01:25.259> completely<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:26.009> think<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> weight

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
back down completely I think the weight

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.460 
back down completely I think the weight
of<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> periscope<00:01:27.299> might<00:01:27.570> fix<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.049> problem

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
of the periscope might fix the problem

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.980 
of the periscope might fix the problem
down<00:01:28.619> by<00:01:28.920> itself<00:01:28.979> pasco<00:01:29.970> take<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> pier

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
down by itself pasco take to a pier

00:01:30.990 --> 00:02:03.220 
down by itself pasco take to a pier
scoop<00:01:31.229> on

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.320 

still<00:02:04.230> hanging<00:02:04.440> up<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.920> one<00:02:05.130> burr<00:02:05.430> but<00:02:06.300> I

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
still hanging up in that one burr but I

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.790 
still hanging up in that one burr but I
also<00:02:06.420> want<00:02:06.660> to<00:02:06.780> goes<00:02:06.900> up<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.170> down<00:02:07.260> once<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.620> put

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
also want to goes up and down once I put

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.620 
also want to goes up and down once I put
the<00:02:07.830> actual<00:02:08.160> pulley<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:08.910> motor<00:02:09.210> I'll<00:02:09.450> go

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
the actual pulley on the motor I'll go

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.100 
the actual pulley on the motor I'll go
up<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:09.930> down<00:02:10.080> twice<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.830> speed
