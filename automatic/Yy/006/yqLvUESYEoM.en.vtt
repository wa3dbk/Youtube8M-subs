00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.550 
up yes it works let's go the reason
being<00:04:12.890> is<00:04:13.490> because<00:04:13.520> this<00:04:14.090> frees<00:04:14.450> up<00:04:14.630> a<00:04:14.810> lot<00:04:14.840> in

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
being is because this frees up a lot in

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.370 
being is because this frees up a lot in
finding<00:04:16.190> a<00:04:16.340> lot<00:04:16.580> of<00:04:16.880> memory<00:04:17.299> on<00:04:17.750> your<00:04:17.810> computer

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
finding a lot of memory on your computer

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.960 
finding a lot of memory on your computer
so<00:04:18.440> you<00:04:18.560> can<00:04:18.650> run<00:04:18.919> other<00:04:19.190> things<00:04:19.489> at<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.789> same

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
so you can run other things at the same

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.290 
so you can run other things at the same
time<00:04:20.180> as<00:04:20.419> your<00:04:20.510> server<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:20.930> going<00:04:21.760> now<00:04:22.760> once

time as your server is going now once

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.380 
time as your server is going now once
you<00:04:23.419> see<00:04:23.630> it's<00:04:23.750> worth<00:04:23.960> just<00:04:24.200> type<00:04:24.470> stop<00:04:25.390> enter
