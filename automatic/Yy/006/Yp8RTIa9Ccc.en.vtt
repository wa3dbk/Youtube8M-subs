would<00:01:05.640> allow<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.939> glass<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.840> touch<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.260> frame

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
would allow the glass to touch the frame

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.440 
would allow the glass to touch the frame
when<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.250> closing<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:08.939> could<00:01:09.240> create

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
when it's closing and that could create

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.140 
when it's closing and that could create
a<00:01:09.570> break<00:01:09.869> another<00:01:10.770> area<00:01:11.220> where<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:11.820> exert
