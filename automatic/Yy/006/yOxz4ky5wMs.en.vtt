00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.000
 also as it is normal but it has 94 of 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.230

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.630
 note that it has a shooting power 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.420
 incredible has far shot an authentic 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.070

 I leave the link in the description with a 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.120
 discount code and let's talk a 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.040
 bit bonino to see what a great goal 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.810
 pulling almost from the middle of the field 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.090
 holding there the race with all 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.030
 holds the body very well to almost all 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.970
 the centrals that you have actually used goes 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.610
 very very very well at the time of the hour of 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.590
 well put the body and so on 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.540
 see this beautiful also how it 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.030
 Stirs there in the air as he puts it and 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.980
 brutal not in a head I think it's from 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.260
 the five best players that I have 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.690
 tested this year's head is a 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.490
 obviously we obviously know all the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.040
 world knows that in the headbutts this year 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.740
 he is very opinion everything to all the mete 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.450
 until walcott as well if it does not matter 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.730
 but I have to say that of the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.800
 players that I liked the most 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.060
 the time to throw head is not all going 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.800
 for inside and with a power 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.770
 incredible and then with the ball in the 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.420
 feet is still very good is what 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.400
 found even though the pace I think 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.350
 is less than the 20 you will find it 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.240
 a tad faster and more skillful 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.070
 about the ball for my taste that's what 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.750
 only one that I think has better than mind 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.770
 that the definition is very good too 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.300
 but the 20's that was very heavy and good 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.580
 good and the truth is that fixed or that 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.480
 stumbled and a paradon that make me already 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.959
 I dont know 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.569
 and that and well what I said that 20 this 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.819
 sorry bony is a great player if not 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.430
 you want to use the usual ones to 20 that 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:26.420
 to huca to limit you can use bonnie that 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.590
 is really a beast this is not the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.540
 chemistry fails him a bit for the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.819
 nationality but the rest of things very 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.470
 well everything very high I hope that I have 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.870
 liked and as always leave your 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.730
 like that always helps to grow and what 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.629
 said the next video another discard 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.629
