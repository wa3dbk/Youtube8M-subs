00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 that games based on licenses 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.190
 external are good business we have 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 commented often but what we live to 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.400
 late 80s and early 90s 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.190
 it was exceptional 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.780
 batman navy seals or ninja turtles 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.000
 they were some of the most 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.490
 fun and loved by the players 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.560
 but probably no reach 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.270
 level of mysticism of the game that 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.270
 analyzed the simpsons today 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.360
 1991 was an exceptional year in arcades 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.370
 some of the most memorable games of 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.380
 history were launched this year in their 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.780
 versions for recreational and his legacy 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.400
 endures to this day inspires the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.080
 overwhelming success that the series achieved 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.940
 regular of the simpsons a couple of years 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.400
 before in the USA and its expansion 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.780
 international both klein and konami 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.140
 they bought the rights to develop 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.750
 video games and 1991 saw the launch of 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.760
 five different titles based on this 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.830
 dysfunctional family but only the 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.080
 Japanese company dared to launch it 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.330
 for the arcade salons and also decided 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.700
 develop it in a genre that fascinated 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.830
 at that time he lost 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.479
 neighborhood inspired by the first 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.250
 season of the series and also putting 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.170
 part of your konami imagination 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.700
 transformed the town of springfield into 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.680
 the ideal scenario to pursue the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.540
 evil smithers that after stealing a 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.540
 jewelry has kidnapped maggie 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.710
 if you hear I said that konami is 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.500
 allowed many liberties of a series 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.000
 that was not yet so definite of 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.500
 done when he left he was electrocuted 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.630
 shows some rabbit ears in his 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.460
 skeleton this is so because in the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.050
 original concept of the series to which 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.330
 we assume konami had access 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.490
 Matt Groening had described that march 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.200
 hides these ears under her hair and that 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.970
 I would unveil it in the final episode of 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.100
 season but as the series was a 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.619
 audience success and it was renewing itself 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.960
 they eliminated and the game has very 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.509
 good ideas that few times have we 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.180
 could see some elements the town 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.470
 well some not a single element the 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.720
 police car of the first phase 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.000
 you need at least two players to 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.620
 can be lifted unfortunately not 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.269
 I know other uses of this 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.860
 capacity which would have given him more 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.230
 variety to the game in later 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.150
 scenarios but another option is that the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.730
 players join forces and have a power 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.190
 different according to the chosen characters 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.320
 homer and marge make a bart roll and 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.180
 Lisa run hand in hand 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.489
 jover climbs his sons on the shoulder and fights 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.650
 with them and Marc throws them through the air 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.209
 to cover a horizontal area a 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.230
 very great contribution to the gameplay 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.120
 that the door 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.430
 of actions and more tools for 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.989
 collaborate with friends the conversions 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.030
 for computer were made by the 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.830
 company novo trade the history of this 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.540
 hongaresa company is curious formed 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.040
 by four banks and almost a hundred 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.049
 companies in block times 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.610
 socialist to get input from 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.260
 foreign currency through the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.420
 realization of video games advertisements 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.340
 television and so on when the 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.870
 regime his california office began 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.329
 to operate in conjunction with the office 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.250
 mother probably this is why 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.530
 so many orders fell into his hands 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.230
 although his most famous game is one of 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.200
 original development echo of dolphin but 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.030
 that's another story what yes that 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.829
 it is curious is that the only 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.890
 adaptations to domestic systems 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.739
 they went to commodore 64 and ms 2 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.959
 because it has never been explained but my 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.359
 suspicion falls on the fact of being two 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.970
 systems of American origin with a 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.230
 market already worked in that country remember 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.849
 than in the economic mecca for 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.060
 Japanese companies from that time 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.400
 it was a huge country with a market 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.870
 gigantic and a single language full of 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.870
 entrepreneurs willing to invest 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.930
 the recreational version apart from being 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.240
 the original is the best and most complete 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.280
 without a doubt it was one of the games 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.960
 with better graphics throughout the year and it's 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.030
 which has more variety of actions and 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.470
 elements on screen play up to 4 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.540
 players is a visual joy 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.130
 especially because we can join 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.180
 when making special attacks and 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.550
 increases the number of enemies 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.190
 simultaneous the music is wonderful and 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.720
 their incredible digitized voices the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.820
 conversion for commodore 64 is 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.130
 surprisingly very good although the 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.810
 under a graphic and sound is expected the 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.489
 game converts the title with all its 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.530
 phases and most of its elements 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.940
 they also present the images to 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.740
 full screen of the family 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.020
 including the original opening of the 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.000
 recreational a very good conversion for 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.100
 a system that was already at the end of its 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.960
 commercial life for s 2 we have 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.480
 obviously a conversion with better 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.100
 graphics and if to general features is a 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.350
 better game than the commodore version 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.090
 64 although they have inexplicably 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.160
 eliminated all the final part of the phase 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.690
 of the cemetery something inconceivable 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.910
 It has a larger memory space 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.410
 for inclusion but we review 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.390
 leads to deception is still a 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.620
 very good conversion at a time in the 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:58.169
 that the pc was not famous for its actions 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.449
 and being frank I do not care in 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.820
 absolute the graphic or sound part of 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.260
 both conversions the truth is that 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.690
 both have a very positive point 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.949
 strong you can play doubles and 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.410
 they also share the same point 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.760
 Negative movements were not adapted 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.310
 where we could gather the 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.290
 characters and I think you will share all 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.240
 with me that here the strong point has 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.240
 much more weight than the negative 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.990
 there's no worse version because I think that 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.460
 everyone makes good use of the power 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.460
 existing of each hardware 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.480
 the meritorious version is that of commodore 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.010
 64 has most of 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.840
 elements of the recreational and have not 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.610
 spared with the intros or images to 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.950
 full screen that would be expected 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.020
 It is not a conversion to which there will 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.580
 sitting well over the years but if 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.470
 you do not look with the perspective that you 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:57.240
 deserves is worth praising the effort 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.240
 made in this adaptation 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.100
 the best version is the one of arcade we go 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.290
 without any discussion or shadow of doubt 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.490
 being this a recreational one that I was wearing 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.740
 to the limit the graphic capabilities 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.720
 views so far and that none 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.850
 conversion to the domestic system tried 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.560
 improve or change the recreational game 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.190
 there are still several steps 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.190
 on top of the rest 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.150
 The simpsons in their beginnings do not 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.310
 they fell in love and the game helped geeks 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.110
 like us to fall in love even more with 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.850
 the franchise I think none of their 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.380
 subsequent games have managed to like 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.170
 half of what this recreational did 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.940
 and that is worth admiring unfortunately 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.410
 almost two decades ago that the series of 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.620
 the simpsons stopped me from doing grace 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.630
 but this title still seems so 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:54.610
 glorious as the first day that I saw it in 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.610
 a wonderful arcade room 

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:58.619
 Y
