00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 according to the incredible attorney 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.910
 from the whole 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.819
 in place 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.819
 a competitor 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.079
 the winger used it 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.609
 for the first time in the fall 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.009
 but that's what is asked what is it 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.949
 we feel it 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.429
 the actor 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.470
 our six months but it is again 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.750
 could complicate life 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.530
 rockers rockers so today with a soft mood 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.170
 5 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.540
 l 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.830
 at the same time 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.899
 m 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.159
 so now it's this loneliness 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.159
 there pelote reports he 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.450
 d too 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.450
 everything starts to flow 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.040
 but here it is question 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.420
 but not normal 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.910
 a lot of women 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.310
 the male agreement 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.510
 Yes 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.510
 so I guess 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.770
 in 2 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.880
 more than 10% 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.880
 so since 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 rogge 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.930
 of course 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.950
 m 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.420
 nice
