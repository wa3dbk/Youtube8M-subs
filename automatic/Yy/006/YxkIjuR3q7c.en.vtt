righty-tighty<00:00:23.840> now<00:00:24.840> my<00:00:24.990> daughter<00:00:25.230> Kelly<00:00:25.590> says

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
righty-tighty now my daughter Kelly says

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.589 
righty-tighty now my daughter Kelly says
she<00:00:26.430> doesn't<00:00:26.670> want<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.210> touch<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.960> toilet<00:00:28.439> I

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
she doesn't want to touch the toilet I

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.880 
she doesn't want to touch the toilet I
guess<00:00:30.599> thinking<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> toilet<00:00:31.529> water<00:00:31.740> is

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
guess thinking that the toilet water is

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.250 
guess thinking that the toilet water is
dirty<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.239> water<00:00:33.450> that's<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.960> tank

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
dirty but the water that's in the tank

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.220 
dirty but the water that's in the tank
is<00:00:35.030> actually<00:00:36.030> drinking<00:00:36.420> water<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.989> comes

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
is actually drinking water that comes

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.369 
is actually drinking water that comes
straight<00:00:37.500> out<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:38.100> lot<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.180> your<00:00:39.329> same<00:00:40.050> lines

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
straight out of a lot of your same lines

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.940 
straight out of a lot of your same lines
and<00:00:40.680> feed<00:00:40.920> your<00:00:41.160> sink<00:00:41.879> etc<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.739> water

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and feed your sink etc so the water

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.920 
and feed your sink etc so the water
that's<00:00:44.219> going<00:00:44.399> into<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> tank<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.390> actually

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
that's going into the tank is actually

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.819 
that's going into the tank is actually
pure<00:00:46.710> clean<00:00:47.129> drinking<00:00:47.640> water<00:00:48.559> it's<00:00:49.559> really

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
pure clean drinking water it's really

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.470 
pure clean drinking water it's really
not<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.010> great<00:00:50.219> idea<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.820> use<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.239> flush

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
not a great idea to use it to flush

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.950 
not a great idea to use it to flush
waste<00:00:51.809> away<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.379> that's<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:53.219> another<00:00:53.250> topic

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
waste away but that's for another topic

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.500 
waste away but that's for another topic
so<00:00:55.730> moments<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:56.879> we're<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> open<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
so moments here we're going to open the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.349 
so moments here we're going to open the
tank<00:00:59.090> okay

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
so this is the inside of tank that

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.359 
so this is the inside of tank that
parked<00:01:03.180> down<00:01:03.329> at<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> bottom<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.229> blue<00:01:04.769> part

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
parked down at the bottom that blue part

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.679 
parked down at the bottom that blue part
is<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.970> flapper<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:07.010> it's<00:01:08.010> gotten<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.850> little

is the flapper and it's gotten a little
hard<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:10.140> age<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.909> starting<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.600> lose

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
hard with age and it's starting to lose

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.750 
hard with age and it's starting to lose
its<00:01:12.990> shape<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.470> allow<00:01:13.740> water<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.130> seep<00:01:14.520> down

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
its shape and allow water to seep down

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.240 
its shape and allow water to seep down
into<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.270> tank<00:01:15.740> eventually<00:01:16.740> causing<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
into the tank eventually causing the
