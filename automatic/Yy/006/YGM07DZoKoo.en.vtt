that's only going to work kayvyun but

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.460 
that's only going to work kayvyun but
anywhere<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.700> put<00:03:23.910> yeah<00:03:24.290> windscreen<00:03:25.290> heater

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
anywhere you put yeah windscreen heater

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.500 
anywhere you put yeah windscreen heater
you<00:03:25.650> will<00:03:25.860> rear<00:03:26.220> screen<00:03:26.640> yes

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
you will rear screen yes

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.920 
you will rear screen yes
air<00:03:28.500> conditioning<00:03:30.530> temperatures<00:03:31.530> within

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
air conditioning temperatures within

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.580 
air conditioning temperatures within
your<00:03:34.769> intensity<00:03:35.989> where<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.109> want<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.409> air<00:03:37.560> to

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
your intensity where you want the air to

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.910 
your intensity where you want the air to
blow<00:03:37.829> due<00:03:39.439> back<00:03:40.439> on<00:03:40.469> here<00:03:40.829> what<00:03:41.010> we<00:03:41.129> got<00:03:41.310> in<00:03:41.489> 4i

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
blow due back on here what we got in 4i

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:51.229 
blow due back on here what we got in 4i
things<00:03:43.920> like<00:03:44.099> traffic<00:03:44.340> reports<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:50.239> wouldn't

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
things like traffic reports I wouldn't

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.099 
things like traffic reports I wouldn't
have<00:03:51.329> them<00:03:51.510> on<00:03:53.629> there<00:03:54.629> we<00:03:54.750> go

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
have them on there we go

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.679 
have them on there we go
so<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.409> is<00:03:55.639> just<00:03:56.639> a<00:03:56.790> quick<00:03:56.969> run-through<00:03:57.239> of

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
so that is just a quick run-through of

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:03.170 
so that is just a quick run-through of
the<00:03:58.909> system<00:03:59.909> itself<00:04:01.730> obviously<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:03.060> is

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
the system itself obviously this is

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.000 
the system itself obviously this is
where<00:04:03.329> you'd<00:04:03.450> set<00:04:03.659> up<00:04:03.780> things<00:04:04.019> like<00:04:04.109> date<00:04:04.530> time

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
where you'd set up things like date time

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:12.889 
where you'd set up things like date time
navigation<00:04:05.760> volume<00:04:09.349> consumption<00:04:10.349> rates<00:04:10.590> etc
