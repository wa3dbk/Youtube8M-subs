and it's yeah it is just fantastic and

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.730 
and it's yeah it is just fantastic and
that<00:01:28.270> obviously<00:01:28.420> is<00:01:28.810> because<00:01:29.140> of<00:01:29.259> all<00:01:29.409> of<00:01:29.560> you

if it would have been for the
Kickstarter<00:01:31.899> campaign<00:01:31.929> it<00:01:32.590> would<00:01:32.709> have<00:01:32.799> been

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
Kickstarter campaign it would have been

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.740

are in original sin because the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.130
