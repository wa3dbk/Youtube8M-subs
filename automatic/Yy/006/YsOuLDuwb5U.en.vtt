so<00:01:59.240> I<00:01:59.270> thought<00:01:59.510> a<00:01:59.570> cool<00:01:59.810> thing<00:01:59.960> to<00:01:59.990> do<00:02:00.200> would<00:02:00.620> be

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
so I thought a cool thing to do would be

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.240 
so I thought a cool thing to do would be
we<00:02:01.970> have<00:02:02.210> our<00:02:02.420> normal<00:02:02.870> mic<00:02:03.530> setup<00:02:03.830> which<00:02:04.100> is

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
we have our normal mic setup which is

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.080 
we have our normal mic setup which is
the<00:02:04.370> mic<00:02:04.550> tech<00:02:04.850> c5<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:05.920> I<00:02:06.920> usually<00:02:07.550> place<00:02:07.820> it

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
the mic tech c5 and I usually place it

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.800 
the mic tech c5 and I usually place it
aimed<00:02:08.330> right<00:02:08.479> around<00:02:08.930> the<00:02:10.240> neck<00:02:11.240> joint<00:02:11.510> so

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
aimed right around the neck joint so

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.490 
aimed right around the neck joint so
where<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.170> neck<00:02:12.350> meets<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.800> body<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:15.350> we're

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
where the neck meets the body so we're

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.200 
where the neck meets the body so we're
doing<00:02:15.770> that<00:02:15.950> but<00:02:16.190> then<00:02:16.340> we're<00:02:16.490> also<00:02:16.640> running<00:02:16.970> a

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
doing that but then we're also running a

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.820 
doing that but then we're also running a
signal<00:02:17.630> out<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.530> pickup<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.510> what<00:02:21.170> what

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
signal out of the pickup so what what

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.680 
signal out of the pickup so what what
we're<00:02:21.950> going<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.130> do<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.700> give<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.120> an<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.450> B

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
we're going to do is give you an a B

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.750 
we're going to do is give you an a B
example<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.560> what<00:02:24.740> those<00:02:24.950> two<00:02:25.160> things<00:02:25.430> sound

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
example of what those two things sound

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.340 
example of what those two things sound
like<00:02:26.030> with<00:02:26.300> as<00:02:26.450> little<00:02:28.360> like<00:02:29.360> eq<00:02:29.930> and

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
like with as little like eq and

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.620 
like with as little like eq and
treatment<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.220> signal<00:02:31.670> as<00:02:31.820> possible<00:02:32.390> so

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
treatment to the signal as possible so

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.449 
treatment to the signal as possible so
first<00:02:33.440> thing<00:02:33.620> we<00:02:33.680> want<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.860> do<00:02:33.980> is<00:02:34.100> listen<00:02:34.310> to

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
with the direct signal so i'm going to

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.710 
with the direct signal so i'm going to
cut<00:03:10.070> off<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.220> mics<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.880> magically<00:03:11.480> switch

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
over to that signal so play something

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:39.080 
over to that signal so play something
with<00:03:15.020> that

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.890
