00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.160
 Smoking is a great pleasure, sensual. 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.020
 Smoking I wait for the man that I want, 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.080
 behind the windows of cheerful windows. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.980
 While I smoke, my life I do not consume 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.060
 because floating the smoke I usually get numb ... 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.180
 Lying in the chaisse longue dream and love ... 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.300
 See my solicitous and gallant lover, 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.040
 feel your lips kiss with wise kisses, 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.700
 and the flirtation feel with more desires 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.620
 When your eyes see, thirsting for passion. 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.300
 That's why being good is smoking an Eden. 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:12.040
 Give me the smoke from your mouth. Go on, that way I go crazy. 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.040
 Run I want to go crazy with pleasure, 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.140
 feeling that heat 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.520
 of the intoxicating smoke 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.420
 that ends by igniting the burning flame of love. 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.400
 My Egyptian is special, what a smell, sir. 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.700
 After the battle in which love explodes, 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.020
 a cigarette is always a landing 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.220
 and although it seems that the body languishes, 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.380
 after the cigar grows its strength, its vigor. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.100
 The hour of restlessness with him, is not cruel, 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.640
 its spirals are heavenly dreams, 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.840
 and form clouds that thus rise to glory 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.600
 and wrapped in it, its spark is a star 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.780
 that looks, clear and beautiful with rapid glare. 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.660
 That's why being good is smoking an Eden. 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.680
 Give me the smoke from your mouth. 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.560
 Go on, that way I go crazy. 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.760
 Run I want to go crazy with pleasure, 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.100
 feeling that heat of the intoxicating smoke 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.360
 that ends by igniting the burning flame of love. 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.420
