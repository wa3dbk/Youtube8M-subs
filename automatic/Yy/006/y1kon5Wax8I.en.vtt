buck report video this is a buck which
has<00:00:16.219> been<00:00:16.400> in<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:16.580> game<00:00:16.700> for<00:00:16.730> a<00:00:16.970> long<00:00:17.240> time

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:17.599 
has been in the game for a long time

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:19.859 
has been in the game for a long time
actually<00:00:17.869> and<00:00:18.260> it's<00:00:18.800> just<00:00:19.130> annoying<00:00:19.460> me

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
actually and it's just annoying me

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.590 
actually and it's just annoying me
recently<00:00:20.869> a<00:00:21.170> lot<00:00:21.439> with<00:00:21.650> some<00:00:22.010> creation<00:00:22.430> I<00:00:23.359> was

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
recently a lot with some creation I was

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.359 
recently a lot with some creation I was
building<00:00:23.990> and<00:00:24.140> yeah<00:00:24.650> in<00:00:24.769> the<00:00:24.830> past<00:00:24.980> people

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
building and yeah in the past people

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.859 
building and yeah in the past people
used<00:00:25.400> this<00:00:25.699> to<00:00:25.910> build<00:00:26.090> Wireless<00:00:26.449> redstone

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
used this to build Wireless redstone

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.140 
used this to build Wireless redstone
devices<00:00:27.380> but<00:00:27.590> I<00:00:27.619> think<00:00:28.070> there<00:00:28.310> are<00:00:28.490> other<00:00:29.060> ways

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
devices but I think there are other ways

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.330 
devices but I think there are other ways
to<00:00:29.510> do<00:00:29.630> this<00:00:29.779> anyway<00:00:30.199> so<00:00:30.769> let's<00:00:30.980> get<00:00:31.130> right

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
to do this anyway so let's get right

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.910 
to do this anyway so let's get right
into<00:00:31.400> it<00:00:31.760> the<00:00:31.970> problem<00:00:32.449> is<00:00:32.599> about<00:00:33.019> hitboxes<00:00:33.710> of

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
into it the problem is about hitboxes of

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.760 
into it the problem is about hitboxes of
blocks<00:00:34.610> which<00:00:34.850> have<00:00:35.110> orientations<00:00:36.110> so<00:00:36.590> for

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
blocks which have orientations so for

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.910 
blocks which have orientations so for
example<00:00:37.160> n<00:00:37.309> builds<00:00:37.760> or<00:00:37.910> chests<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:38.690> those<00:00:39.649> hit

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
example n builds or chests and those hit

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.920 
example n builds or chests and those hit
boxes<00:00:40.309> are<00:00:40.520> not<00:00:40.910> saved<00:00:41.239> for<00:00:41.480> each<00:00:41.510> envelope

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
boxes are not saved for each envelope

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.860 
boxes are not saved for each envelope
block<00:00:42.739> but<00:00:42.950> somehow<00:00:43.300> generally<00:00:44.300> for<00:00:44.540> all<00:00:44.570> the

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
block but somehow generally for all the

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.850 
block but somehow generally for all the
objects<00:00:45.260> in<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.530> chunk<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.309> all<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:47.860> animals

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
objects in the chunk so all the animals

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.279 
objects in the chunk so all the animals
are<00:00:49.039> either<00:00:49.390> facing<00:00:50.390> in<00:00:50.629> this<00:00:50.750> direction<00:00:50.809> or

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
are either facing in this direction or

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.410 
are either facing in this direction or
in<00:00:51.590> this<00:00:51.680> direction<00:00:51.739> for<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.520> hitbox<00:00:52.879> hitbox

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
in this direction for the hitbox hitbox

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.930 
in this direction for the hitbox hitbox
wise<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.020> in<00:00:54.140> this<00:00:54.260> case<00:00:54.530> this<00:00:55.219> n<00:00:55.430> value<00:00:55.460> just

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
wise so in this case this n value just

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.680 
wise so in this case this n value just
works<00:00:56.210> fine<00:00:56.449> right<00:00:56.690> now<00:00:57.309> in<00:00:58.309> this<00:00:58.489> one<00:00:58.699> yeah

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
works fine right now in this one yeah

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.229 
works fine right now in this one yeah
you<00:00:59.930> see<00:01:00.140> it's<00:01:00.800> somehow<00:01:01.100> spacing<00:01:01.789> and<00:01:01.969> this

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
you see it's somehow spacing and this

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.620 
you see it's somehow spacing and this
camera<00:01:02.600> is<00:01:02.719> a<00:01:02.750> little<00:01:02.870> bit<00:01:03.140> spacing<00:01:03.559> because

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
camera is a little bit spacing because

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.539 
camera is a little bit spacing because
well<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.780> hitbox<00:01:05.869> doesn't<00:01:06.380> isn't<00:01:07.010> correct<00:01:07.340> if

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
well the hitbox doesn't isn't correct if

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.370 
well the hitbox doesn't isn't correct if
I<00:01:07.640> shoot<00:01:07.820> an<00:01:07.970> arrow<00:01:08.119> into<00:01:08.210> it<00:01:08.510> it<00:01:08.960> gets<00:01:09.200> updated

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
I shoot an arrow into it it gets updated

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.030 
I shoot an arrow into it it gets updated
and<00:01:09.950> also<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.960> my<00:01:12.110> car<00:01:12.350> over<00:01:12.530> there<00:01:12.650> triggers

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
and also the my car over there triggers

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.120 
and also the my car over there triggers
because<00:01:13.670> this<00:01:14.240> it<00:01:14.390> box<00:01:14.600> is<00:01:15.260> now<00:01:15.439> proper<00:01:15.920> and

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
because this it box is now proper and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.010 
because this it box is now proper and
the<00:01:16.729> other<00:01:16.850> one<00:01:17.000> has<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.540> same<00:01:17.689> issue<00:01:17.900> that

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
the other one has the same issue that

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.260 
the other one has the same issue that
you<00:01:18.259> get<00:01:18.439> stuck<00:01:18.710> in<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:18.979> because<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.030> server

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
you get stuck in it because the server

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.179 
you get stuck in it because the server
things<00:01:20.720> says<00:01:21.290> that<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.530> hitbox<00:01:21.830> is<00:01:21.979> now

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
things says that the hitbox is now

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.420 
things says that the hitbox is now
already<00:01:23.030> rotated<00:01:23.869> same<00:01:24.710> is<00:01:24.920> with<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.189> chest

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430

game<00:02:02.960> just<00:02:03.320> tries<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.590> push<00:02:03.920> me<00:02:03.950> out<00:02:04.100> and

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
game just tries to push me out and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.219 
game just tries to push me out and
therefore<00:02:04.880> it's<00:02:05.000> stuttering<00:02:05.719> like<00:02:05.960> crazy

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
therefore it's stuttering like crazy

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.380 
therefore it's stuttering like crazy
once<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:06.950> look<00:02:07.100> back<00:02:07.250> at<00:02:07.369> it<00:02:07.399> at<00:02:07.880> this<00:02:08.119> chest

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
once I look back at it at this chest

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.260 
once I look back at it at this chest
here<00:02:08.660> it's<00:02:08.989> fine<00:02:09.290> again<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.849> once<00:02:10.849> again<00:02:10.970> just

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
here it's fine again and once again just

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.970 
here it's fine again and once again just
for<00:02:12.260> demonstration

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.199 

-<00:02:15.810> point<00:02:16.810> three<00:02:17.140> looking<00:02:18.069> at<00:02:18.159> the<00:02:18.280> chest<00:02:18.489> BAM

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
- point three looking at the chest BAM

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.490 
- point three looking at the chest BAM
I<00:02:19.239> can<00:02:19.510> move<00:02:19.629> a<00:02:19.780> little<00:02:19.930> bit<00:02:20.049> further<00:02:20.290> into

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
I can move a little bit further into

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.619 
I can move a little bit further into
this<00:02:20.650> direction<00:02:20.799> so<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.599> demonstrate

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
this direction so just to demonstrate

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.930 
this direction so just to demonstrate
this<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.379> can<00:02:23.590> update<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.010> hitboxes<00:02:24.610> for

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
this you can update the hitboxes for

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.820 
this you can update the hitboxes for
chest<00:02:25.209> by<00:02:25.450> looking<00:02:25.870> at<00:02:25.959> them<00:02:26.110> as<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.409> just<00:02:26.590> saw

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
chest by looking at them as you just saw

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.149 
chest by looking at them as you just saw
for<00:02:27.640> n<00:02:28.000> builds<00:02:28.360> or<00:02:28.569> you<00:02:29.110> can<00:02:29.290> for<00:02:29.590> example<00:02:29.680> add

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
for n builds or you can for example add

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.920 
for n builds or you can for example add
this<00:02:30.459> also<00:02:30.730> goes<00:02:30.940> for<00:02:30.970> chest<00:02:31.330> shoot<00:02:31.660> an<00:02:31.810> arrow

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
this also goes for chest shoot an arrow

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.949 
this also goes for chest shoot an arrow
into<00:02:32.080> them<00:02:32.489> so<00:02:33.489> if<00:02:33.879> for<00:02:34.030> example<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.540> made<00:02:34.930> a

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
into them so if for example I made a

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.360 
into them so if for example I made a
little<00:02:35.170> clock<00:02:35.470> here<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:37.239> just<00:02:37.510> need<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:39.160> mine

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
little clock here you just need to mine

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.030 
little clock here you just need to mine
cards<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:40.720> is<00:02:40.780> what<00:02:41.349> you<00:02:41.470> can<00:02:41.620> do<00:02:41.769> with<00:02:41.920> it

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
cards this is what you can do with it

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.830 
cards this is what you can do with it
but<00:02:42.069> I<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:42.790> say<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.060> actually<00:02:43.360> want<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.720> get

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
but I just say I actually want to get

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.470 
but I just say I actually want to get
this<00:02:43.989> fixed

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
this fixed

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:54.569 
this fixed
yeah<00:02:46.480> wrong<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:46.959> will<00:02:47.110> this<00:02:47.590> one<00:02:53.519> okay<00:02:54.519> so

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
yeah wrong and will this one okay so

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.900 
yeah wrong and will this one okay so
what<00:02:54.940> happens<00:02:55.269> is<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:56.160> each<00:02:57.160> minecart<00:02:57.730> when

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
what happens is that each minecart when

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.180 
what happens is that each minecart when
its<00:02:58.060> tribals<00:02:58.680> triggers<00:02:59.680> this<00:02:59.829> dispenser

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
its tribals triggers this dispenser

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.819 
its tribals triggers this dispenser
maybe<00:03:00.549> shoots<00:03:00.819> an<00:03:01.030> arrow<00:03:01.870> into<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.230> endless

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
maybe shoots an arrow into the endless

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.949 
maybe shoots an arrow into the endless
hitbox<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.640> other<00:03:03.790> one<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.810> it

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
hitbox of the other one and so it

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.619 
hitbox of the other one and so it
updates<00:03:05.410> this<00:03:05.650> anvil<00:03:06.099> and<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:07.090> problem<00:03:07.450> is

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
updates this anvil and the problem is

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.940 
updates this anvil and the problem is
that's<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:08.609> minecart<00:03:09.609> if<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.290> quickly<00:03:11.290> stop

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
that's a minecart if I quickly stop

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.030 
that's a minecart if I quickly stop
these<00:03:12.129> dispensers<00:03:12.640> here<00:03:13.799> so<00:03:14.799> let's<00:03:14.950> just

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
these dispensers here so let's just

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.599 
these dispensers here so let's just
update<00:03:15.459> this<00:03:15.579> hitbox<00:03:15.940> one<00:03:16.150> more<00:03:16.299> time<00:03:16.510> and

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
update this hitbox one more time and

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.610 
update this hitbox one more time and
place<00:03:18.609> another<00:03:18.849> one<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.269> minecart<00:03:20.019> always<00:03:20.410> gets

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
place another one a minecart always gets

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.780 
place another one a minecart always gets
stuck<00:03:20.709> against<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.720> vertical<00:03:22.720> hitbox<00:03:23.470> of<00:03:23.790> the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
stuck against the vertical hitbox of the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.500 
stuck against the vertical hitbox of the
off<00:03:25.359> the<00:03:25.540> object<00:03:25.930> in<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.829> corner<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.370> if<00:03:28.359> I

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
off the object in the corner and if I

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.330 
off the object in the corner and if I
shoot<00:03:28.690> it<00:03:28.780> against<00:03:29.139> this<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.530> will<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:30.190> will

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
shoot it against this and will you will

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.949 
shoot it against this and will you will
see<00:03:30.459> it<00:03:30.579> slightly<00:03:31.209> moves<00:03:31.419> inward<00:03:31.599> because

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
see it slightly moves inward because

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.289 
see it slightly moves inward because
this<00:03:32.319> elbow<00:03:32.620> has<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:32.859> closer<00:03:33.430> hitbox<00:03:33.940> if<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.120> now

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
this elbow has a closer hitbox if I now

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.229 
this elbow has a closer hitbox if I now
shoot<00:03:34.930> against<00:03:35.290> this<00:03:35.410> for<00:03:35.620> again<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:36.819> hitbox

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
shoot against this for again the hitbox

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.870 
shoot against this for again the hitbox
is<00:03:37.480> getting<00:03:38.440> set<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.190> normal<00:03:39.430> value<00:03:39.700> and

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
is getting set to the normal value and

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.879 
is getting set to the normal value and
the<00:03:39.940> my<00:03:40.090> cart<00:03:40.299> is<00:03:40.389> already<00:03:40.870> within<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.560> anvil

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
the my cart is already within the anvil

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.740 
the my cart is already within the anvil
and<00:03:41.919> therefore<00:03:42.489> it<00:03:42.639> has<00:03:42.849> it<00:03:43.269> doesn't<00:03:43.419> collide

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
and therefore it has it doesn't collide

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.940 
and therefore it has it doesn't collide
with<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:44.049> anymore<00:03:44.290> because<00:03:44.500> it's<00:03:44.829> already

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
with it anymore because it's already

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.470 
with it anymore because it's already
inside<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.519> it<00:03:45.639> just<00:03:45.730> travels<00:03:46.150> through<00:03:46.450> it

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
inside and it just travels through it

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.670 
inside and it just travels through it
and<00:03:47.010> yeah<00:03:48.010> that's<00:03:48.220> what<00:03:48.370> happens<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:49.530> but<00:03:50.530> as

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
and yeah that's what happens and but as

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.819 
and yeah that's what happens and but as
I<00:03:50.799> said<00:03:50.859> in<00:03:51.340> general<00:03:51.900> this<00:03:52.900> part<00:03:53.169> happens<00:03:53.410> to

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
I said in general this part happens to

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.530 
I said in general this part happens to
pretty<00:03:54.069> much<00:03:54.250> everything<00:03:54.700> which<00:03:55.150> has<00:03:55.389> an

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
pretty much everything which has an

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.770 
pretty much everything which has an
orientation<00:03:55.690> or<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.290> changeable<00:03:56.769> hitbox<00:03:57.250> and

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
orientation or a changeable hitbox and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.849 
orientation or a changeable hitbox and
it's<00:03:58.780> super<00:03:59.049> annoying<00:03:59.319> for<00:03:59.590> certain

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
it's super annoying for certain

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.199 
it's super annoying for certain
constructions<00:04:00.430> where<00:04:00.579> you<00:04:00.669> have<00:04:00.819> to<00:04:00.970> rely<00:04:01.180> on

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
constructions where you have to rely on

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.470 
constructions where you have to rely on
the<00:04:01.480> exact<00:04:01.810> hitbox<00:04:02.200> of<00:04:02.379> an<00:04:02.470> object<00:04:03.000> so<00:04:04.000> maybe

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
the exact hitbox of an object so maybe

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.030 
the exact hitbox of an object so maybe
didn't<00:04:04.810> one<00:04:04.900> sees<00:04:05.139> this<00:04:05.319> and<00:04:05.530> can<00:04:05.739> actually

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
didn't one sees this and can actually
