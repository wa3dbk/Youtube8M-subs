so<00:00:05.130> on<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.310> Dyson<00:00:05.640> 360<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:06.210> Robot<00:00:06.569> we<00:00:07.020> chose<00:00:07.319> to

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
so on the Dyson 360 I Robot we chose to

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.259 
so on the Dyson 360 I Robot we chose to
use<00:00:07.680> vision<00:00:08.220> because<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.700> means<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.970> robot

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
use vision because it means the robot

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.879 
use vision because it means the robot
can<00:00:09.420> know<00:00:09.540> exactly<00:00:10.080> where<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.440> within<00:00:10.830> a

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
can know exactly where it is within a

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.249 
can know exactly where it is within a
room<00:00:11.040> very<00:00:11.340> accurately<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:12.509> turn<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.019> means

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
room very accurately in turn that means

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.509 
room very accurately in turn that means
that<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.440> machine<00:00:13.559> can<00:00:13.920> clean<00:00:14.250> very

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
that the machine can clean very

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.090 
that the machine can clean very
efficiently<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.120> systematically<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.980> when

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
efficiently and systematically so when

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.010 
efficiently and systematically so when
we<00:00:17.220> were<00:00:17.340> developing<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.880> camera<00:00:18.240> systems<00:00:18.630> it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
we were developing a camera systems it

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.779 
we were developing a camera systems it
was<00:00:19.230> very<00:00:19.590> clear<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.220> there<00:00:20.400> wasn't<00:00:20.580> an

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
was very clear that there wasn't an

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.880 
was very clear that there wasn't an
existing<00:00:21.300> system<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.720> could<00:00:21.900> just<00:00:22.050> use<00:00:22.260> we

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
existing system we could just use we

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.769 
existing system we could just use we
very<00:00:23.130> quickly<00:00:23.310> decided<00:00:23.789> not<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.180> use<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.480> Ford

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
very quickly decided not to use a Ford

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.019 
very quickly decided not to use a Ford
facing<00:00:25.170> standard<00:00:25.590> camera<00:00:25.980> what<00:00:26.670> was<00:00:26.820> needed

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
facing standard camera what was needed

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.910 
facing standard camera what was needed
was<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.390> system<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.230> all<00:00:28.470> around<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
was a system that can see all around the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.130 
was a system that can see all around the
machine<00:00:29.220> all<00:00:29.490> at<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> same<00:00:30.029> time<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
machine all at the same time the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.780 
machine all at the same time the
advantage<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.679> such<00:00:31.859> systems<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.399> don't

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
advantage of such systems is you don't

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.430 
advantage of such systems is you don't
need<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.000> physically<00:00:33.390> turn<00:00:33.690> around<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.260> look

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
need to physically turn around to look

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.170 
need to physically turn around to look
to<00:00:34.590> see<00:00:34.739> where<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.980> are<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.820> other<00:00:35.850> thing

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
to see where you are and the other thing

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.090 
to see where you are and the other thing
is<00:00:36.360> anything<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:36.989> comes<00:00:37.170> into<00:00:37.350> view<00:00:37.469> doesn't

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
is anything that comes into view doesn't

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.830 
is anything that comes into view doesn't
obscure<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.730> whole<00:00:38.879> image<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> robot

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
obscure the whole image so the robot

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.290 
obscure the whole image so the robot
isn't<00:00:39.989> easily<00:00:40.260> blinded<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.149> an

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
isn't easily blinded so this is an

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.299 
isn't easily blinded so this is an
example<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> panoramic<00:00:43.530> image<00:00:43.829> used<00:00:44.129> by

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
example of the panoramic image used by

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.729 
example of the panoramic image used by
the<00:00:44.370> robot<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.820> navigate<00:00:45.239> by<00:00:45.420> one<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> main

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the robot to navigate by one of the main

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.740 
the robot to navigate by one of the main
advantages<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.550> all<00:00:47.850> four<00:00:48.090> sides<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> room

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
advantages is all four sides of the room

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630 
advantages is all four sides of the room
are<00:00:48.960> visible<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.680> single<00:00:50.010> shot<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
are visible in a single shot so the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.040 
are visible in a single shot so the
robot<00:00:50.910> doesn't<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> continually<00:00:51.750> turn

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
robot doesn't have to continually turn

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.600 
robot doesn't have to continually turn
itself<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.590> actually<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:53.010> where<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.309> going

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
itself to actually see where it's going

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.029 
itself to actually see where it's going
it<00:00:54.420> will<00:00:54.539> take<00:00:54.780> high<00:00:55.110> contrast<00:00:55.620> features

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
it will take high contrast features

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.650 
it will take high contrast features
throughout<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.640> image<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.120> use<00:00:57.480> those

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
throughout the image and use those

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.529 
throughout the image and use those
triangulate<00:00:58.350> its<00:00:58.530> position<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:59.219> the<00:01:00.210> robot

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
triangulate its position as the robot

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.810 
triangulate its position as the robot
begins<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.989> move<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> advantages<00:01:02.609> is

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
begins to move one of the advantages is

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.820 
begins to move one of the advantages is
those<00:01:03.300> features<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:03.960> tracked<00:01:04.320> throughout

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
those features can be tracked throughout

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.750 
those features can be tracked throughout
the<00:01:05.129> image<00:01:05.430> without<00:01:06.090> ever<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.720> out<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.990> shop

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
the image without ever going out of shop

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.370 
the image without ever going out of shop
so<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> navigation<00:01:09.000> system<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.869> very<00:01:10.049> clever

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
so the navigation system is very clever

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.950 
so the navigation system is very clever
whilst<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.369> actually<00:01:11.760> using<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.210> map<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
whilst it's actually using a map to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.530 
whilst it's actually using a map to
localize<00:01:13.409> itself<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.610> also<00:01:14.790> has<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> create

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
localize itself it also has to create

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.230 
localize itself it also has to create
that<00:01:15.840> map<00:01:16.080> at<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.979> same<00:01:17.189> time<00:01:17.520> infrared

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
that map at the same time infrared

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.179 
that map at the same time infrared
sensors<00:01:18.720> detect<00:01:19.110> where<00:01:19.380> objects<00:01:19.770> are<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
sensors detect where objects are and

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.190 
sensors detect where objects are and
place<00:01:20.850> those<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> map<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
place those on the map so that the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.950 
place those on the map so that the
machine<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.710> avoid<00:01:23.130> objects<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
machine can avoid objects and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.999 
machine can avoid objects and
systematically<00:01:24.960> plan<00:01:25.320> its<00:01:25.500> way<00:01:25.619> around<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
systematically plan its way around the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.300 
systematically plan its way around the
room<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.670> ensure<00:01:26.820> methodical<00:01:27.630> cleaning<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:29.250> in

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
room to ensure methodical cleaning so in

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.249 
room to ensure methodical cleaning so in
the<00:01:29.369> cleaning<00:01:29.610> pattern<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.210> very<00:01:30.240> simple<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
the cleaning pattern is very simple the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.530 
the cleaning pattern is very simple the
robot<00:01:31.560> only<00:01:31.890> ever<00:01:32.009> wants<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.400> travel<00:01:32.640> within

robot only ever wants to travel within

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.880 
robot only ever wants to travel within
one<00:01:33.780> robots<00:01:34.110> width<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.470> where<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.740> been

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
one robots width of where it's been

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.819 
one robots width of where it's been
before<00:01:35.450> what<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.600> means<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.079> as<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.560> robot

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
before what that means is as the robot

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.620 
before what that means is as the robot
moves<00:01:38.070> around<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.060> gets<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> location

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
moves around when it gets to a location

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.780 
moves around when it gets to a location
such<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.650> doesn't<00:01:40.979> go<00:01:41.070> forward<00:01:41.490> it
