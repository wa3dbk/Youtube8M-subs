00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
antenna Wow the apple-shaped coverage

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.930 
antenna Wow the apple-shaped coverage
transforms<00:00:34.530> into<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.040> full<00:00:35.460> 3d<00:00:36.030> sphere

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.369 

no<00:00:41.940> matter<00:00:42.210> where<00:00:42.539> you<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.109> your<00:00:43.140> home

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
no matter where you are in your home

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.160 
no matter where you are in your home
you'll<00:00:43.920> still<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.609> fully<00:00:44.969> covered<00:00:45.329> when

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
you'll still be fully covered when

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.649 
you'll still be fully covered when
multiple<00:00:46.649> devices<00:00:47.010> access<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.909> network<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
multiple devices access the network the

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.590 
multiple devices access the network the
ws<00:00:49.320> 330<00:00:49.979> will<00:00:50.280> automatically<00:00:51.089> select<00:00:51.479> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
ws 330 will automatically select the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:03.560 
ws 330 will automatically select the
best<00:00:51.989> antenna<00:00:52.469> combination<00:00:53.339> for<00:00:53.609> each<00:00:53.850> device

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.990 

so<00:01:04.570> even<00:01:05.199> when<00:01:05.440> you're<00:01:05.650> moving<00:01:05.860> you'll<00:01:06.580> still

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
so even when you're moving you'll still

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.100 
so even when you're moving you'll still
have<00:01:07.300> a<00:01:07.360> steady<00:01:07.840> connection<00:01:10.110> sometimes

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
have a steady connection sometimes

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.560 
have a steady connection sometimes
there's<00:01:11.560> more<00:01:11.800> than<00:01:11.860> one<00:01:12.280> obstacle<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:13.060> that

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
there's more than one obstacle and that

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.560 
there's more than one obstacle and that
naturally<00:01:14.200> leads<00:01:14.230> to<00:01:14.770> poorer<00:01:15.100> reception<00:01:15.790> but

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
naturally leads to poorer reception but

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.780 
naturally leads to poorer reception but
because<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.230> the<00:01:17.560> third<00:01:17.830> built-in<00:01:18.400> antenna

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
because of the third built-in antenna

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.020 
because of the third built-in antenna
the<00:01:19.360> ws3<00:01:20.020> thirty's<00:01:20.710> ability<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.490> penetrate

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
the ws3 thirty's ability to penetrate

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.060 
the ws3 thirty's ability to penetrate
obstructions<00:01:22.660> is<00:01:22.840> amplified<00:01:23.560> which

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
obstructions is amplified which

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.330 
obstructions is amplified which
translates<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:24.820> better<00:01:25.270> coverage<00:01:25.810> for<00:01:26.110> you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
translates to better coverage for you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.780 
translates to better coverage for you
does<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:27.370> work<00:01:27.760> well<00:01:28.060> in<00:01:28.390> two-story<00:01:29.140> homes

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
does it work well in two-story homes

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.960 
does it work well in two-story homes
absolutely

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970

the ws3 here is built-in antenna means

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.480 
the ws3 here is built-in antenna means
it's<00:01:34.510> vertical<00:01:34.860> penetration<00:01:35.860> ability<00:01:35.979> is

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
it's vertical penetration ability is

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.030 
it's vertical penetration ability is
also<00:01:37.330> better<00:01:37.570> than<00:01:37.869> conventional<00:01:38.110> routers

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
also better than conventional routers

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.520 
also better than conventional routers
even<00:01:39.670> with<00:01:39.940> a<00:01:40.150> better<00:01:40.390> coverage<00:01:40.840> it's<00:01:41.140> still

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
even with a better coverage it's still

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.370 
even with a better coverage it's still
