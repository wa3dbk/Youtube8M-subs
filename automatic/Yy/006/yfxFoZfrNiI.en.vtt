00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.950
 world of crafts today 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.690
 I'm going to teach you how to prepare these 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.730
 malted choices in the form of 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.830
 ghosts for your parties 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.130

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.950
 Share with your friends the materials 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:30.840
 what are we going to need are a cup of 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:32.920
 Milk from 2 to 5 scoops of ice cream cups 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.289
 straw 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.760
 dark chocolate sparks for 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.050
 melt 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.050
 and whipped cream 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.649
 we put our chocolate sparks in 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.960
 a water bath container to melt 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.300
 the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.790
 be very careful that water does not 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.180
 touch this chocolate as it will be ruined 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.920
 and we do not want to waste the food 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.690
 I remember to mix the chocolate so that 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.690
 melts faster 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.810
 already with our melted chocolate with 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.990
 very careful we will put with help from 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.060
 a stick the little eyes and the mouth of 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.060
 our ghost in the glass 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.750
 the face of our ghost is ready 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.290
 we put our glasses to the freezer 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.290
 a few minutes 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.510
 i 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.539
 now we will prepare the shake we add 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.539
 the milk cup 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.080
 our ice cream balls among more 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.590
 ice cream you put more special will be the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.590
 milk shake 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.500
 and we liquefy to make it more consistent 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.849
 ah 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.990
 now it only remains to empty the milkshake in 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.990
 our arms 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.000
 and we make some texts copetes with the 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.000
 whipped cream 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.190
 and remember that a shake is not a 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.700
 malted without the capes so it is not 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.379
