00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.210 
box and so why don't we look at the
press<00:03:07.780> box<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.260> was<00:03:08.350> like<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.980> can<00:03:09.100> see

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
press box and it was like you can see

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.130 
press box and it was like you can see
everything<00:03:09.760> like<00:03:09.970> extremely<00:03:10.420> cousin<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:10.930> and

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
everything like extremely cousin is and

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.320 
everything like extremely cousin is and
so<00:03:11.230> we're<00:03:11.380> like<00:03:11.500> we<00:03:12.430> will<00:03:12.730> make<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.090> work

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
so we're like we will make this work

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.030 
so we're like we will make this work
that<00:03:13.660> because<00:03:14.200> it's<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.709> was<00:03:14.800> what<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:14.980> was

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
that because it's it was what it was

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.949 
that because it's it was what it was
like<00:03:15.250> cool<00:03:15.550> enough<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:15.970> shot<00:03:16.239> that<00:03:16.510> we<00:03:16.630> we

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
like cool enough of a shot that we we

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.080 
like cool enough of a shot that we we
needed<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:18.070> like<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.520> think<00:03:18.970> our

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
needed that and it's like I think our

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.310 
needed that and it's like I think our
ending<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.600> he's<00:03:19.720> probably<00:03:19.930> one<00:03:20.140> of<00:03:20.170> the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
ending and he's probably one of the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.660 
ending and he's probably one of the
coolest<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.770> he<00:03:20.830> was<00:03:20.950> Tim<00:03:21.130> that<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.489> art

day is such a blur because we
or<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:42.099> it<00:03:42.640> was<00:03:43.090> just<00:03:43.300> such<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.510> burst<00:03:43.870> of<00:03:44.019> energy

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
or so it was just such a burst of energy

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.680 
or so it was just such a burst of energy
at<00:03:44.560> one<00:03:44.739> time<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.400> think<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.879> only<00:03:45.910> problem

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
at one time I think the only problem

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.710 
at one time I think the only problem
that<00:03:46.720> we<00:03:46.989> had<00:03:47.230> in<00:03:47.530> recollection<00:03:48.160> is<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:49.330> lip

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
that we had in recollection is the lip

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.910 
that we had in recollection is the lip
syncher<00:03:50.050> is<00:03:50.110> actually<00:03:50.379> hearing<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.769> music

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
syncher is actually hearing the music

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.610 
syncher is actually hearing the music
and<00:03:51.489> I<00:03:52.239> don't<00:03:52.780> think<00:03:52.930> we<00:03:53.110> ever<00:03:53.290> anticipated

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
and I don't think we ever anticipated

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.790 
and I don't think we ever anticipated
all<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.879> energy<00:03:55.269> and<00:03:55.629> the<00:03:55.720> screaming<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:56.709> the

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
all the energy and the screaming and the

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.470 
all the energy and the screaming and the
excitement<00:03:57.489> of<00:03:57.550> kids<00:03:57.819> when<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.090> camera

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
excitement of kids when the camera

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.130 
excitement of kids when the camera
started<00:03:58.750> rolling<00:03:58.840> by<00:04:00.750> walking<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.810> hallways

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
started rolling by walking the hallways

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.089 
started rolling by walking the hallways
was<00:04:02.739> an<00:04:03.330> extremely<00:04:04.330> amazing<00:04:04.930> experience<00:04:05.769> like

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
was an extremely amazing experience like

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.740 
was an extremely amazing experience like
just<00:04:06.310> just<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.849> be<00:04:06.970> there<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.269> live<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.569> I<00:04:07.629> was

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
just just to be there to live it I was

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.869 
just just to be there to live it I was
right<00:04:07.930> there<00:04:08.160> behind<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.400> camera<00:04:09.730> I<00:04:09.760> was

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
right there behind the camera I was

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.220 
right there behind the camera I was
pulling<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.150> music<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:10.720> was<00:04:10.840> probably<00:04:10.959> one<00:04:11.200> of

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
pulling the music it was probably one of

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.039 
pulling the music it was probably one of
the<00:04:11.349> coolest<00:04:11.590> experiences<00:04:12.160> ever<00:04:12.400> had<00:04:12.670> so<00:04:13.390> like

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
the coolest experiences ever had so like

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.039 
the coolest experiences ever had so like
hopefully<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.099> camera<00:04:15.610> will<00:04:16.150> show<00:04:16.660> it<00:04:16.810> just

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
hopefully the camera will show it just

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.199 
hopefully the camera will show it just
as<00:04:17.200> just<00:04:17.470> how<00:04:17.680> cool<00:04:18.040> it<00:04:18.190> was<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.910> was<00:04:19.030> really

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
as just how cool it was it was really

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.780

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
cool to see everyone gets so excited

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.390 
cool to see everyone gets so excited
over<00:04:21.790> something<00:04:22.000> that<00:04:22.720> like<00:04:22.900> I<00:04:23.200> don't<00:04:23.770> know<00:04:23.919> we
