00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730

know<00:02:08.649> strawberries<00:02:09.280> grew<00:02:09.460> like<00:02:09.670> this<00:02:09.880> would

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
know strawberries grew like this would

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.690 
know strawberries grew like this would
actually<00:02:10.899> solve<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:13.360> know<00:02:13.560> push<00:02:14.560> out<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:15.070> stand

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
actually solve you know push out a stand

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.130 
actually solve you know push out a stand
that<00:02:16.630> jumps<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:17.820> goes<00:02:18.820> to<00:02:19.120> root<00:02:19.270> itself<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.930> bit

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
that jumps and goes to root itself a bit

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.230 
that jumps and goes to root itself a bit
further<00:02:20.380> from<00:02:20.590> plants<00:02:21.070> in<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.610> sort<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:21.910> crawl

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
further from plants in a sort of crawl

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.230 
further from plants in a sort of crawl
like<00:02:22.420> this<00:02:22.740> on<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.980> ground<00:02:24.220> which<00:02:24.820> is<00:02:24.850> nice

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
like this on the ground which is nice

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.970 
like this on the ground which is nice
but<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.570> don't<00:02:25.810> have<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.350> many<00:02:26.470> thoughts<00:02:26.709> right

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
but I don't have so many thoughts right

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.540 
but I don't have so many thoughts right
now<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:27.850> for<00:02:28.330> now<00:02:28.480> it's<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.520> cohabitating<00:02:30.520> with

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
now so for now it's a cohabitating with

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.140 
now so for now it's a cohabitating with
the<00:02:31.180> tomato<00:02:31.480> plants<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:33.550> think<00:02:34.030> it's

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
the tomato plants and I think it's

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.850 
the tomato plants and I think it's
really<00:02:34.330> nice<00:02:34.540> most<00:02:34.990> people<00:02:35.410> told<00:02:35.709> me<00:02:35.770> that

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
really nice most people told me that

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.800 
really nice most people told me that
they<00:02:36.160> would<00:02:36.280> not<00:02:36.430> last<00:02:36.730> especially<00:02:37.090> indoors

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
they would not last especially indoors

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.870 
they would not last especially indoors
and<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.860> they<00:02:38.980> would<00:02:39.100> just<00:02:39.250> die<00:02:39.459> out<00:02:39.490> and

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
and that they would just die out and

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.550 
and that they would just die out and
it's<00:02:40.030> been<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.240> couple<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.660> months<00:02:40.930> now<00:02:40.959> and

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
it's been a couple of months now and

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.690 
it's been a couple of months now and
they're<00:02:41.770> doing<00:02:41.800> just<00:02:42.220> great

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
they're doing just great

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.420 
they're doing just great
really<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.630> know<00:02:43.900> good<00:02:44.740> driving<00:02:45.250> actually

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
really you know good driving actually

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.170 
really you know good driving actually
growing<00:02:45.970> really<00:02:46.300> nicely<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:48.550> today<00:02:49.090> I'm

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
growing really nicely and so today I'm

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.210 
growing really nicely and so today I'm
going<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.390> give<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:49.600> few<00:02:49.810> tips<00:02:49.989> first<00:02:50.620> to

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
going to give you a few tips first to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.550 
going to give you a few tips first to
grow<00:02:51.459> them<00:02:51.670> into<00:02:51.880> an<00:02:52.330> optimized<00:02:52.810> April<00:02:54.030> so

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
grow them into an optimized April so

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.840 
grow them into an optimized April so
it's<00:02:56.560> very<00:02:56.920> simple<00:02:57.840> say<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.900> eat<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.230> mango

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
it's very simple say you eat a mango

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.460 
it's very simple say you eat a mango
these<00:03:00.850> seeds<00:03:01.120> are<00:03:01.239> actually<00:03:01.390> jackfruit<00:03:02.290> seeds

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
these seeds are actually jackfruit seeds

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.380 
these seeds are actually jackfruit seeds
so<00:03:03.130> those<00:03:03.550> are<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.790> ones<00:03:03.940> we're<00:03:04.060> going<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.239> use

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
so those are the ones we're going to use

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.979 
so those are the ones we're going to use
a<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:05.440> show<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.680> how<00:03:05.830> it's<00:03:05.980> done<00:03:06.040> but<00:03:07.030> say<00:03:07.930> you

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
a to show you how it's done but say you

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.680 
a to show you how it's done but say you
grow<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.260> mango<00:03:08.680> well<00:03:09.220> clean<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.150> peach<00:03:10.360> really

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
grow a mango well clean the peach really

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.360 
grow a mango well clean the peach really
nicely<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:12.570> then<00:03:13.570> when<00:03:13.750> it's<00:03:13.870> really<00:03:14.140> nice<00:03:14.370> if

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
nicely and then when it's really nice if

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.280 
nicely and then when it's really nice if
it's<00:03:15.580> really<00:03:16.000> ripe<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.480> fruit<00:03:16.510> you'll<00:03:17.140> be

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
it's really ripe the fruit you'll be

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.160 
it's really ripe the fruit you'll be
able<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.650> pry<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:17.980> open<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.580> access<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.959> seat

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
able to pry it open and access the seat

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.380 
able to pry it open and access the seat
with<00:03:20.920> jackfruit<00:03:21.370> is<00:03:21.459> very<00:03:21.670> simple<00:03:22.060> you<00:03:22.300> know

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
with jackfruit is very simple you know

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.900 
with jackfruit is very simple you know
if<00:03:22.510> you<00:03:22.630> let<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.959> seat<00:03:23.380> dry<00:03:23.640> then<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:24.760> will

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
if you let the seat dry then you will

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.690 
if you let the seat dry then you will
just<00:03:25.090> be<00:03:25.239> yeah<00:03:25.739> just<00:03:26.739> be<00:03:26.830> like<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.160> really

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
just be yeah just be like that really

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.630 
just be yeah just be like that really
simple<00:03:28.090> now<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.900> next<00:03:29.170> step<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.680> want<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:29.980> do

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
simple now the next step you want to do

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.150 
simple now the next step you want to do
is<00:03:31.269> take<00:03:31.540> some<00:03:31.570> cotton<00:03:32.320> or<00:03:32.470> toilet<00:03:32.980> paper

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
is take some cotton or toilet paper

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.060 
is take some cotton or toilet paper
because<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.459> have<00:03:33.670> rotten<00:03:34.440> enough<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.709> wrap<00:03:35.890> the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
because I have rotten enough to wrap the

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.310 
because I have rotten enough to wrap the
seeds<00:03:36.340> in<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:37.110> such<00:03:38.110> as<00:03:38.290> this<00:03:39.390> then<00:03:40.390> grab<00:03:40.690> the

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
seeds in it such as this then grab the

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.970 
seeds in it such as this then grab the
standard<00:03:43.260> freezing<00:03:44.280> plastic<00:03:45.280> bag<00:03:46.650> place<00:03:47.650> your

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
standard freezing plastic bag place your

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.430 
standard freezing plastic bag place your
seeds<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.700> toilet<00:03:49.269> paper<00:03:49.299> in<00:03:49.690> it

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:02.030 

and<00:03:53.440> then<00:03:54.960> really<00:03:55.960> Downton<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:59.970> have<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.210> be

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
and then really Downton you have to be

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.900 
and then really Downton you have to be
you<00:04:03.040> can<00:04:03.220> see<00:04:03.430> really<00:04:04.420> really<00:04:05.050> wet<00:04:05.910> those

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
you can see really really wet those

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.730 
you can see really really wet those
babies<00:04:07.420> in<00:04:07.450> order<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:07.960> grow<00:04:08.140> then<00:04:08.470> we<00:04:08.590> need

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
babies in order to grow then we need

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.740 
babies in order to grow then we need
first<00:04:09.580> a<00:04:09.940> lot<00:04:10.150> of<00:04:10.210> water<00:04:11.850> but<00:04:12.850> that's<00:04:13.300> not<00:04:13.600> all

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
first a lot of water but that's not all

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.380 
first a lot of water but that's not all
they're<00:04:14.650> also<00:04:14.800> going<00:04:15.070> to<00:04:15.130> need<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.820> lots<00:04:16.120> of

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
they're also going to need the lots of

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.300 
they're also going to need the lots of
heat<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.170> sand<00:04:18.010> so<00:04:18.250> what<00:04:18.430> we're<00:04:18.670> going<00:04:18.850> to<00:04:18.910> do

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
heat and sand so what we're going to do

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:33.890 
heat and sand so what we're going to do
is<00:04:21.930> close<00:04:23.670> this<00:04:24.670> feeding<00:04:25.120> bag<00:04:28.440> such<00:04:29.440> as<00:04:29.650> this

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.240 

and<00:04:34.900> that's<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.290> what<00:04:36.250> this<00:04:36.400> does<00:04:36.670> is<00:04:38.250> because

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
and that's it what this does is because

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.670 
and that's it what this does is because
the<00:04:39.670> bag<00:04:40.090> is<00:04:40.120> sealed<00:04:40.510> it<00:04:41.230> creates<00:04:41.620> a

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
the bag is sealed it creates a

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.060 
the bag is sealed it creates a
microclimate<00:04:42.660> when<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.780> Sun<00:04:44.050> strikes<00:04:44.830> the

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
microclimate when the Sun strikes the

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.880 
microclimate when the Sun strikes the
bag<00:04:45.250> it<00:04:46.030> will<00:04:46.390> make<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.990> water<00:04:47.230> evaporate

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
bag it will make the water evaporate

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.180 
bag it will make the water evaporate
which<00:04:48.640> will<00:04:48.940> then<00:04:49.180> condense<00:04:49.690> on<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.830> surface

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
which will then condense on the surface

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.510 
which will then condense on the surface
of<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.430> bag<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:52.740> fold<00:04:53.740> back<00:04:53.920> again<00:04:54.280> on<00:04:54.430> the

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
of the bag to fold back again on the

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.100 
of the bag to fold back again on the
seeds<00:04:54.990> really<00:04:55.990> creating<00:04:56.500> this<00:04:56.770> microclimate

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
seeds really creating this microclimate

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.680 
seeds really creating this microclimate
with<00:04:59.110> tropical<00:04:59.680> features<00:05:00.270> so<00:05:01.270> I'm<00:05:01.360> just<00:05:01.540> going

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
with tropical features so I'm just going

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.610 
with tropical features so I'm just going
to<00:05:01.750> put<00:05:01.900> it<00:05:01.990> there<00:05:03.840> next<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.050> other<00:05:05.200> plants

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
to put it there next to the other plants

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.540 
to put it there next to the other plants
and<00:05:06.480> leave<00:05:07.480> it<00:05:07.600> there<00:05:07.630> for<00:05:08.140> maybe<00:05:09.070> a<00:05:09.220> couple<00:05:09.430> of

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
and leave it there for maybe a couple of

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.990 
and leave it there for maybe a couple of
weeks<00:05:09.700> we'll<00:05:10.240> see<00:05:11.370> once<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.550> seeds<00:05:12.790> have

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
weeks we'll see once the seeds have

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.550 
weeks we'll see once the seeds have
germinated<00:05:13.030> which<00:05:13.840> usually<00:05:14.020> takes<00:05:14.290> a<00:05:14.410> couple

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
germinated which usually takes a couple

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.920 
germinated which usually takes a couple
of<00:05:14.740> weeks<00:05:14.800> it's<00:05:15.790> time<00:05:16.030> to<00:05:16.210> put<00:05:16.390> them<00:05:16.540> in<00:05:16.660> soil

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
of weeks it's time to put them in soil
