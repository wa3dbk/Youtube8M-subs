00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 obesity has been transformed into a 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.109
 disease of this new era which is 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.940
 is spreading very fast 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.070
 affecting not only adults but 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.440
 also to children there are records of 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.540
 children who weigh 80 kilos at 9 years of age 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.490
 age so I set routines for 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.279
 lose weight that involve all the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.600
 family are very important within 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.730
 the causes of childhood obesity 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.949
 it could be believed that the main one is the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.410
 genetic factor but the truth is that 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.140
 only 5% is determined by this 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.030
 condition the fundamental reason is that 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.010
 children suffer from overweight or obesity 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.590
 prior to poor diet and little or 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.450
 no physical activity there are no routines 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.280
 to lose effective weight if that 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.840
 there is no control on the part of the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.030
 parents of the quantity and quality of 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.039
 food that your children consume since 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.079
 many consume large amounts of the 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.940
 called junk food that only 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.829
 provides large amounts of calories and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.539
 fats and few nutrients and minerals 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.059
 that are so important to your body 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.250
 growing within the routines 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.960
 to lose weight you should have in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.879
 account above all that health is 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.860
 paramount in the lives of all 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.060
 parents are responsible for teaching them 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.860
 to eat their children 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.229
 to guide them through the correct path of 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.820
 healthy life and good nutrition is for 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.549
 this is fundamental 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.350
 prevention the vast majority of us 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.030
 knows that obesity is the product of 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.789
 accumulation of fat that we eat in 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.970
 excess in our body some of the 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.860
 Recommended weight loss routines 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.630
 Doing exercises on a regular basis is 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.700
 important to encourage children to do 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.710
 physical activity and that this is for them 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.960
 entertaining create games that make them 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.270

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.580
 in addition to burning calories there is also 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.709
 the alternative of realizing 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.179
 physical training classes in many 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:50.580

 schools for example the food is 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.659
 fundamental for humans but 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.950
 we must focus on avoiding consumption 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.080
 Excessive food 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.479

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.590
 fats may have the same taste 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.319
 but the amount of calories is very 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.540
 different it is very important to teach
