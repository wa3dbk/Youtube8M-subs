00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.410
 hi all you omnadren and Nicole 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:16.450
 channel rainbow loom bands and today we 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.419
 continue the series of our base and 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.000
 initial lessons weaving weaving 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.699
 rezinochek bracelets or how else 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.160
 called irises and today we have a simple 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.480
 a bracelet called fishtail 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.480
 and we will weave it 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.510
 on the fingers without using the machine and 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:40.210
 hooks and so for that we need two 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:44.489
 kind of rezinochki so start we take 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:49.059
 rezinochku twist her vosmerochka and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.360
 that's how it looks like on our fingers 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:57.879
 So now we take rezinochku different color 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:01:04.690
 and not twisting stringing it on 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:07.030
 finger straightened see the first rezinochka 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.460
 blue twisting eights 2 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.970
 rubber pink not twisted 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.580
 now we take a different color gum 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.319
 old about fingers and also not 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:24.030
 we twist like that now we take 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:27.789
 lower blue rubber band and throws 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.910
 up on top of these two rezinochek 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:35.940
 and the same thing on the other hand 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:39.700
 You see it turns out such as a bundle 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:45.300
 Now we take two rezinochki series of them 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.300
 flowers we take now pink gum 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.720
 not twisting and so we continue 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:06.080
 we throw the lower gum up so 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.539
 Now strung again alternating gum 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.070
 strung without twisting continue 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.070
 weave our bracelet 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.560
 can pull up like that down and have 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.890
 order of these to be 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:43.460
 even went below you can pull up 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.710
 as there was no and lower them down herself 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.580
 and at the very fingertips 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.580
 a bit uncomfortable 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.200
 and the bracelet list is very simple it is very 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.960
 quickly and simply weaves no need 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.740
 no special skills for this any 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.460
 the child will be able to weave a bracelet 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.460
 for this lesson 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:24.370
 so in order to we weave such 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.790
 here's a piece of bracelet for him 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.790
 shut down 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:37.980
 action so take the lock 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:53.080
 Here we throw gum on one finger 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:55.990
 do not cling to them lock catch everything 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.470
 rezinochki so that nothing is not from us 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.470
 ran away 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.819
 so why 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:22.200
 everything and so we hooked see here's all 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.200
 gum end 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:37.160
 our camera does not want to focus so 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:41.849
 we hooked our reins at the end 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:45.289
 now we close our bracelet bracelet 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:48.509
 so super small came out because 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:51.330
 we didn't make it long i think you 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:53.009
 understood the principle of how to weave it here 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.130
 end we find the last one too 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:58.580
 rubber screw straight on it 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:06.330
 lock but here's such we have left 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:12.650
 a pattern called fishtail here 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:19.050
 so here it looks like this braid 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:21.210
 peculiar beautifully this pattern also 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.789
 can be woven on the machine next 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.789
 our video we will show how to weave accurately 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:28.590
 the same bracelet only on the machine all 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:30.270
 all for now if you liked this
