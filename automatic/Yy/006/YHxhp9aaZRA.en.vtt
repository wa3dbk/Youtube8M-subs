to<00:01:19.500> your<00:01:19.680> name<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.610> really<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
to your name on but I really do like the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.810 
to your name on but I really do like the
idea<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.930> Moab<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.950> DNA<00:01:23.250> bomb<00:01:23.460> and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
idea of the Moab and the DNA bomb and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.160 
idea of the Moab and the DNA bomb and
the<00:01:23.880> nuke<00:01:24.060> whatever<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.720> want<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> call<00:01:25.110> it

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
the nuke whatever you want to call it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.210 
the nuke whatever you want to call it
but<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.380> really<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.680> think<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.979> they<00:01:26.189> should

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
but I really do think that they should

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.039 
but I really do think that they should
really<00:01:26.820> incorporate<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.420> tactical<00:01:27.930> nuke

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
really incorporate the tactical nuke

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.630 
really incorporate the tactical nuke
back<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> game<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.950> know<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.340> lot<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.549> people

back in the game I know a lot of people

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.010 
back in the game I know a lot of people
thought<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> was<00:01:30.180> very<00:01:30.240> skeptical<00:01:30.869> how<00:01:30.960> you

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.359 
thought it was very skeptical how you
guys<00:01:31.170> could<00:01:31.320> end<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> game<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
guys could end the game with it and it

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.920 
guys could end the game with it and it

where it would end the game or you know
even<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.220> were<00:01:44.430> losing<00:01:44.790> any<00:01:44.909> call<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.210> a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
even if you were losing any call in a

even if you were losing any call in a
tactical<00:01:45.509> nuke<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.290> would<00:01:46.470> be<00:01:46.590> winning<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
tactical nuke you would be winning the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.830 
tactical nuke you would be winning the
game<00:01:47.100> or<00:01:47.369> use<00:01:47.520> would<00:01:47.790> win<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> game<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
game or use would win the game but the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.359 
game or use would win the game but the
thing<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.320> they<00:01:49.530> should<00:01:49.740> do<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:49.920> instead

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
thing is that they should do is instead

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.710 
thing is that they should do is instead
