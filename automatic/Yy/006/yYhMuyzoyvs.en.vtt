00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.240
 there are very good youtube here commenting and 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.980
 today we immobilize different I am 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.660
 using a new micro that found 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.179
 out there in the box of wires that you had 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.160
 a wireless micro a wireless that 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:17.090
 there are the typical ones that are put on the 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.710
 ear like those in the xbox and go with 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.630
 a cable to the computer but good is 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.160
 say it's portable I do not have to 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.930
 being there is not a fixed micro like what 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.789
 had I is recording then I'm 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.830
 trying a little bit of how to use what 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.390
 how it goes the sound and maybe just because 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.859
 which I will use to make the live so 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.930
 I have to be aware of where it is 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.329
 the micro where is the micro and good 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.480
 here is that they stab me is a 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.470
 screen I need we are playing three of 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.170
 milan height 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.990
 with guiri and against three guiris there 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.280
 110 is the 12 the ortiz with a few 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.200
 times with them and they were more than all 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.530
 the bastards and good as he did a lot 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.090
 time that did not bring the gameplay of these 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.010
 of competitive and apart from searching and 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.390
 study then two for one 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.090
 that's how we are a little bit of so much 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.380
 moshav and zombies and maps a little bit of 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.230
 variety 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.580
 they beat us the first round and you see the 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.780
 uncle of this you have seen that the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.130
 guiri in our team also had 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.600
 a connection the first shot and 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.250
 look that he has given quality of 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.890
 shots kills her or is uncle was super 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.380
 doped and it was good and come on I 've already 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.820
 said we were several times several 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.560
 challenges playing with them was already a 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.510
 poquillo shit for the connection that 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.240
 leads was saying to see in this 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.410
 country brought out but the problem that I have 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.820
 is that as they take me out they do not count 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.440
 connection over far they carry them 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.200
 so it bursts me then there is a 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.810
 little air 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.979
 looking from afar you are seeing and 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.649
 Attention to bad luck I'm going to 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.600
 have now because it's awesome already 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.149
 he touched the pineapple and suddenly a pineapple falls 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.189
 gives me and peta the drum that is up and 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.840
 I say to good very well worth it we start 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.329
 ok but I think this is going to 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.149
 solve what I am going to put and to put serious 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.100
 I changed my class I started to make 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.500
 constitution and then I put the app 90 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.969
 to go to sack then this map that 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.770
 you have to do on this map this map is 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.439
 enough of it she took out I've seen by 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.370
 example in important projects like the 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.160
 end of the 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.450
 of the final cap and some withdrawal like that 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.910
 some important of some magnificent 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.070
 for the good tournaments I have seen that the 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.260
 people tend to change a lot in the 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.300
 late I do not know why because actually 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.040
 it's a map that you have to go to sac if 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.710
 do not do anything, eat your snot about 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.390
 everything defending has to advance 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.130
 positions because if it does not give us and not 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.330
 you cant corner then right now 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.950
 I was watching the part of the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.710
 right that we are with a guiri is not 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.610
 organized and that's why I see that the 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.980
 first it is because they are seeing us 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.420
 poll starting post look at me but I 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.670
 hooked me liar I wanted to 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.290
 is not watching champion then I would 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.690
 I look at the part on the right in 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.300
 this case there has to be a couple of 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.680
 people looking in the middle or can go 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.260
 a sac, this is saying attacking 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.210
 could all go to sack through or through 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.760
 the left and there has to be a 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.170
 background war watching them then 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.870
 Now you will see that I'm going to change 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.100
 class is going to put my pp 90 and even though 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.060
 I'm going 23 I think it was the thing is going to change 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:08.290
 let's make a couple of doubles and some 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.300
 last kashif so in this case like 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.489
 was saying defending I'm going to 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.720
 go to sack came van and connection or pest 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.690
 I'm going to be analyze of being there 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.280
 back with the hacr I go to fire and 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.370
 I'm suddenly here with the gift 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.620
 of one and two that leaves me very touchy 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.360
 I'm going and I say no, I'm not going 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.080
 come back for you where they will not be 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.510
 these 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.950
 and the uncle happens that just what 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.030
 I look and go out there 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.890
 I just looked there was not 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.840
 the connection that the uncle has not even 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.840
 I look at him in his camera 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.430
 good to kill you we draw and we go 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.140
 losing 0 2 we tied two and I'm going to 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.390
 continue with my tactics well with the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.970
 submachine with the penalty sale here 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.470
 defending is pretty easy to hard 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.090
 to defend I am a supporter of doing 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.950
 what I have done I studied in the 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.570
 half another basic and if you try 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.160
 load others there must be from the 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.450
 monitoring means top me 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.020
 have killed now has to go one 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.030
 watching and watching that and watching the 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.110
 part of the corridor on the right should and 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.730
 that has to be in action in the 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.840
 part of trying to go to bag or if not 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.060
 stay behind like stations that I 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.010
 you are stopping this one asked him this is 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.389
 we kill him 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.530
 and here I was with a little bit of 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.910
 careful because I knew that finishing the 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.450
 pineapple is piece of pineapple there was one there 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.760
 down and 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.950
 there he is going to kill him now there he is 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.270
 on that side the pineapple and then there is one in 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.890
 defining in what I am with a 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.390
 little about not wanting to go there 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.650
 they kill him and he is the one from before the 12 that 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.120
 I was on this side in the area 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.530
 events I say good I do not look for can 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.170
 look here that came out here 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.300
 we beat to wait for him and the gray one 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.130
 find and just came for me that is 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.220
 for me to my point of view has it 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.220
 taken away 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.750
 there is the death chamber 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.250
 cultivate the area where I was 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.919
 pointing surely I was going to climb up the 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.900
 left so pretty good 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.470
 small comeback that we are 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.270
 hitting 32 again defend and I'm going to 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.560
 continue to mine this time I'm going to get 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.449
 on the other site because they are going to be 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.610
 hoping I'll go for the part of the 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.830
 left you have to change you know that in 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.870
 seeks to destroy especially in challenges not 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.930
 You can do the same thing twice you have 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.570
 What to try to change zones 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.259
 here he caught the guy good also balls 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.259
 because it almost killed me 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:26.490
 we download this channel this pomegranate t 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.260
 in the face they are loaded to another and to the look I 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.600
 I will load it to make me almost a 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.190
 full team we send in the back uncle 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.170
 splashed the m-14 with turbo 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.570
 but will it be that it is not locked t is that 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.610
 on this map and I tell you that the best is 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.960
 that a couple go to sack and if it is 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.980
 get with the rounds of yours 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.530
 because I'm going to catch you all over the 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.980
 back so this is a clip that is 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:50.310
 I cut pretty good challenge I think that 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.780
 of 84 not bad victory overcoming from 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.870
 0-2 I hope you liked the 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.620
 gameplay you have it I like favorites and
