00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.780
 plants in pots April the month I have not 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.710
 had enough time to process it correctly 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:17.190
 the main mistake as a plant 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:22.670
 we need to increase the green mass then we 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:26.310
 must cut all the flowers and buds on it 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.730
 firstly the flowers take excess nutrition during 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.290
 second the plant is much slower 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.530
 our task begins to grow 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.649
 build up a good fluffy green mass 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.469
 that is, we take scissors 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:47.129
 mercilessly all this business is cut off 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.280
 there is a lot of young shoots that us 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.989
 will give plenty of bloom and these 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.989
 large leaves they obscure the light 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.280
 young shoots so we continue 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:07.049
 do a haircut under the square and here these 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:13.590
 all leaves of aubrey loan are free 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:16.409
 young shoots light warmly very fashionable 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.350
 miksovat plants that is in one pots 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.320
 sits a pair of three different plants 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:28.310
 here is the latest seating is not my Sufi and 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.780
 here from the edge 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.310
 vegetative lobelia that is 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.670
 vegetative lobelia lowered a twig I 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.170
 I took this twig in a circle 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.590
 pots from every leaf bilge went 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.040
 fresh twig and eventually should 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.560
 turn out so wonderful 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.259
 surfiniya in blue framing for 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.329
 planting pots 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:03.990
 often uses yats and which gives 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:07.409
 delicate cloud of orange and very 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.310
 love us people use alissum but 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.979
 in pots 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.200
 together with ampelous plants 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.900
 it is desirable to plant 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.410
 ampelous forest because the alissum of 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.620
 the seed becomes the aggressor it fills 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.280
 full capacity pots and oppresses main 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.760
 rastiria 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.190
 if the plant you have let a long 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.959
 branch there are such plants that 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.519
 love to grow water in one stem 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:37.269
 you don't worry do n't worry don't 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:41.540
 cut this thread almost to the root 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:48.459
 just take it neatly lay it 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:52.640
 in pots in a circle it here locks 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.599
 side shoots will go they all grow up 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.270
 bloom 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.699
 and it will be just a miracle 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.699
