00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.710 

first<00:00:22.040> the<00:00:22.370> engineers<00:00:22.820> put<00:00:23.090> it<00:00:23.210> back<00:00:23.390> on<00:00:23.630> the

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
first the engineers put it back on the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.570 
first the engineers put it back on the
dynamometer<00:00:24.140> and<00:00:24.530> find<00:00:24.860> the<00:00:25.010> engine<00:00:25.160> even

real time alive in front of you all 24
hours<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:06.890> NASCAR<00:01:07.400> was<00:01:07.640> stressing<00:01:08.479> them<00:01:08.810> you

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
hours of NASCAR was stressing them you

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.499 
hours of NASCAR was stressing them you
know<00:01:09.200> all<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.710> basic<00:01:10.130> art<00:01:10.550> turbochargers

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
know all the basic art turbochargers

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.020 
know all the basic art turbochargers
were<00:01:11.540> spinning<00:01:11.930> up<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:12.380> down

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.640 

one<00:01:16.030> of<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.180> reasons<00:01:16.630> we<00:01:16.990> know<00:01:17.140> this<00:01:17.380> thing<00:01:17.560> is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
one of the reasons we know this thing is

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.840 
one of the reasons we know this thing is
still<00:01:17.830> functioning<00:01:18.280> well<00:01:18.400> and<00:01:18.550> I<00:01:18.610> know<00:01:18.670> there

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
still functioning well and I know there

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.250 
still functioning well and I know there
were<00:01:18.940> a<00:01:18.970> lot<00:01:19.090> of<00:01:19.120> questions<00:01:19.600> about<00:01:19.780> whether

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
were a lot of questions about whether

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.110 
were a lot of questions about whether
these<00:01:20.380> turbo's<00:01:20.800> would<00:01:21.010> really<00:01:21.250> live<00:01:21.490> is<00:01:21.700> like

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
these turbo's would really live is like

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.730 
these turbo's would really live is like
we<00:01:22.210> said<00:01:22.390> before<00:01:22.510> we<00:01:22.750> brought<00:01:23.170> this<00:01:23.320> back<00:01:23.560> in

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
we said before we brought this back in

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.530 
we said before we brought this back in
the<00:01:23.830> dynamometer<00:01:24.280> lab<00:01:24.670> we<00:01:25.210> were<00:01:25.270> able<00:01:25.360> to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
the dynamometer lab we were able to

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.170 
the dynamometer lab we were able to
generate<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:26.020> same<00:01:26.170> foot<00:01:26.410> pounds<00:01:26.830> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
generate the same foot pounds and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.490 
generate the same foot pounds and
horsepower<00:01:28.180> which<00:01:28.570> if<00:01:28.990> this<00:01:29.170> thing<00:01:29.320> wasn't

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
horsepower which if this thing wasn't

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.210 
horsepower which if this thing wasn't
working<00:01:29.650> right<00:01:29.890> wouldn't<00:01:30.610> have<00:01:30.700> happened

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.710 

hauling<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.310> logs<00:01:36.490> was<00:01:36.850> really<00:01:37.180> about<00:01:37.420> the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
hauling the logs was really about the

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.360 
hauling the logs was really about the
low-speed<00:01:38.140> torque<00:01:38.200> really<00:01:38.890> stressed<00:01:39.280> the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
low-speed torque really stressed the

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.190 
low-speed torque really stressed the
bottom<00:01:39.730> end<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.030> engine<00:01:40.240> crankshaft<00:01:40.690> of

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
bottom end of the engine crankshaft of

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.190 
bottom end of the engine crankshaft of
bearings<00:01:41.560> in<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:41.770> Pistons<00:01:42.690> so<00:01:43.690> crank<00:01:43.960> can't

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
bearings in the Pistons so crank can't

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.920 
bearings in the Pistons so crank can't
play<00:01:44.410> that<00:01:44.650> is<00:01:44.830> just<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.220> measure<00:01:45.460> of<00:01:45.900> sort<00:01:46.900> of

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
play that is just a measure of sort of

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.600 
play that is just a measure of sort of
the<00:01:47.050> actual<00:01:47.470> thrust<00:01:47.800> between<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:48.280> engine<00:01:48.520> to

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
the actual thrust between the engine to

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.040 
the actual thrust between the engine to
the<00:01:48.640> transmission<00:01:48.760> so<00:01:49.480> there's<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.690> couple<00:01:49.870> of

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
the transmission so there's a couple of

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.840 
the transmission so there's a couple of
thrust<00:01:50.320> bearings<00:01:50.740> that<00:01:50.920> hold<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.460> crank<00:01:51.700> in

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
place what they're gonna measure here is

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.780 
place what they're gonna measure here is
how<00:01:53.380> much<00:01:53.560> where<00:01:53.830> we<00:01:53.980> have<00:01:54.160> on<00:01:54.310> those<00:01:54.460> thrust

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
that that engine's getting shaken all

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.770 
that that engine's getting shaken all
over<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> place<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:17.970> very<00:02:18.000> very<00:02:18.540> nasty

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
over the place and a very very nasty

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.319 
over the place and a very very nasty
environment<00:02:19.530> we<00:02:19.890> needed<00:02:20.129> robust<00:02:20.579> piston<00:02:21.269> to

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
environment we needed robust piston to

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.330 
environment we needed robust piston to
be<00:02:21.420> able<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.689> handle<00:02:21.930> all<00:02:22.079> that<00:02:22.290> we<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.680> Molly

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
be able to handle all that we have Molly

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.430 
be able to handle all that we have Molly
coat<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.909> reduce<00:02:24.450> friction<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.140> that's<00:02:25.230> one

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
coat to reduce friction and that's one

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.960 
coat to reduce friction and that's one
of<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.590> first<00:02:25.860> things<00:02:26.069> we<00:02:26.220> take<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.489> look<00:02:26.730> at<00:02:26.849> on

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
of the first things we take a look at on

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.729 
of the first things we take a look at on
a<00:02:27.000> piston<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.540> this<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:28.049> what<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.590> wear

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
a piston like this is what the wear

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.380 
a piston like this is what the wear
pattern<00:02:29.190> looks<00:02:29.400> like<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.819> how<00:02:29.879> much<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.180> gone

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
pattern looks like and how much is gone

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.750 
pattern looks like and how much is gone
and<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.379> see<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:31.829> there's<00:02:32.129> really<00:02:32.400> not

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and you can see this there's really not

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.580 
and you can see this there's really not
much<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.120> Molly<00:02:33.299> code<00:02:33.540> gone<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:34.319> go<00:02:34.470> ahead

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
much the Molly code gone you go ahead

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.930 
much the Molly code gone you go ahead
and<00:02:34.829> take<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.129> Rings<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.519> make<00:02:35.670> sure<00:02:35.790> that

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
and take the Rings and make sure that

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.979 
and take the Rings and make sure that
they<00:02:36.120> spin<00:02:36.359> freely

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
they spin freely

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.020 
they spin freely
if<00:02:37.290> rings<00:02:37.620> get<00:02:37.829> stuck<00:02:38.159> you're<00:02:38.640> gonna<00:02:38.760> wind<00:02:38.970> up

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
if rings get stuck you're gonna wind up

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.550 
if rings get stuck you're gonna wind up
a<00:02:39.120> little<00:02:39.329> compression<00:02:39.689> low<00:02:39.930> performance

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
a little compression low performance

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.009 
a little compression low performance
fuel<00:02:40.799> economy<00:02:41.010> suffers<00:02:41.730> as<00:02:42.090> well<00:02:42.390> as<00:02:42.569> oil

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
fuel economy suffers as well as oil

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.990 
fuel economy suffers as well as oil
consumption<00:02:43.500> we<00:02:43.769> go<00:02:43.920> up<00:02:44.129> this<00:02:44.430> piston<00:02:44.849> looks

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
consumption we go up this piston looks

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.550 
consumption we go up this piston looks
great<00:02:45.299> last<00:02:45.780> thing<00:02:46.079> then<00:02:46.260> we're<00:02:46.379> going<00:02:46.530> to

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
great last thing then we're going to

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.410 
great last thing then we're going to
have<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.739> look<00:02:46.920> at<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.400> condition<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.299> the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
have a look at is condition of the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.180 
have a look at is condition of the
cylinder<00:02:48.810> dwarfs<00:02:49.139> will<00:02:49.379> measure<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:50.010> bore

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
cylinder dwarfs will measure the bore

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.649 
cylinder dwarfs will measure the bore
and<00:02:50.430> actually<00:02:50.700> measure<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:51.060> wear<00:02:51.269> when<00:02:51.569> you

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
and actually measure the wear when you

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.240 
and actually measure the wear when you
go<00:02:51.750> ahead<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.109> look<00:02:52.260> through<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.620> board<00:02:52.950> all

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
go ahead and look through this board all

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.979 
go ahead and look through this board all
the<00:02:53.430> crosshatch<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.000> there<00:02:54.389> the<00:02:54.540> crosshatch

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
the crosshatch is there the crosshatch

the crosshatch is there the crosshatch
is<00:02:55.200> critical<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:56.010> oil<00:02:56.220> consumption<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:57.150> want

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
is critical for oil consumption you want

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.940 
is critical for oil consumption you want
some<00:02:57.510> oil<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.959> cylinders<00:02:58.379> to<00:02:58.409> lubricate

the Rings going up and down and the
piston<00:03:00.690> but<00:03:01.109> you<00:03:01.230> want<00:03:01.379> to<00:03:01.440> be<00:03:01.500> able<00:03:01.620> to

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
piston but you want to be able to

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.379 
piston but you want to be able to
control<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.639> really<00:03:02.879> looking<00:03:03.120> at<00:03:03.239> this
