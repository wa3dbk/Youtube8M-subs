00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 we begin next to review the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.640
 dates 15 and 16 of the directive league by 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.560
 back and in the best best of our 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.450
 country with a Pablo Escoz has inspired 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.400
 that our five triples to finish 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.650
 with 20 Spanish points of talca won 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.650
 for the second time in the tournament to colo colo 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.680
 party full of emotions two teams 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.720
 who fought in an important meeting 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.100
 and with judy abreu living a day 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.450
 special 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.820
 the tactical cofan term shout those of 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.400
 Spanish with all this we witnessed 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.340
 of the match between colo colo and Spanish 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.500
 of talca each one ladies and gentlemen end 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.129
 of the match 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.830
 great match won Spanish talca 81 87 a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.790
 colo colorado in the previous Cuban dt 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.120
 I saw calm the benefits of 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.120
 Frank 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.670
 at that time he still did not know about the 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.430
 sad news that would be reported in the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.320
 third room where it was confirmed 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.799
 phone that his brother had 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.049
 Cuba died despite the sadness 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.720
 Quijote's coach continued his task 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.759
 and he turned an incredible match 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.470
 colo colo came to draw 20 points 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.049
 advantage in the third quarter with a 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.080
 unstoppable or louis mccullough and the contribution 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.700
 from the bench of ignacio collado 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.439
 difference that Pablo Barraza was commissioned 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.439
 to shorten with five triples 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.200
 when bravo bravo with the race of three 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.140
 dry bars 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.090
 appeared sniper barraza him 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.950
 it turns out triple on the other hand 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.950
 Sebastian Saez had a special duel 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.049
 with a staff after a first time for the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.399
 I forget the forward of the Hispanics was getting 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.200
 a difficult task 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.850
 I hope I can go down in coleo I have a lot 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.350
 a lot of responsibility in what arrives 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.490
 until he so far I assume it 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.689
 I have no problem with that but 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.539
 Now I'm going to put a little more 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.880
 I think emphasis is crucial that 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.590
 lower the scoring of the paper as see 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.390
 they even expect a more even match 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.489
 what is left of the cuts maybe is 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.040
 fulfilled improved in defense is to the point 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.599
 to cancel the American who was leaving 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.599
 of the party for five faults 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.750
 look 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.849
 it is clear the lack cristÃ³bal infant what 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.680
 replaces while titus robinson 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.370
 they made it clear that he would be the owner of 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.920
 boards 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.110
 the American was unstoppable in the 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.659
 last quarter and routed a triumph 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.110
 worked for talcinos for less 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:45.770
 OK OK OK sir , please intentional 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.170
 triumph as a Spanish visit 87-81 and 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.620
 with Pablo barraza as a managerial figure 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.200
 a very difficult real maximum visit and 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.630
 nothing happy for the triumph assures us 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.820
 a little higher noted then but 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.890
 I feel important I did not have eric 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.020
 and it will complicate things of the people 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.600
 so we went take advantage is colo colo 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.400
 could not against the quixote and began to 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.500
 suffer in a weekend for the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.810
 I forget while the Hispanic picture 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.340
 would achieve the first of two wins in 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.340
 your visit to the capital
