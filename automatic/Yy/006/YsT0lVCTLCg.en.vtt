well<00:00:02.399> hello<00:00:02.669> everybody<00:00:02.970> this<00:00:03.240> is<00:00:03.510> Eric<00:00:03.870> and

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
well hello everybody this is Eric and

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.360 
well hello everybody this is Eric and
what<00:00:06.000> we're<00:00:06.120> looking<00:00:06.180> at<00:00:06.390> here<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.720> CBR

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370 
what we're looking at here is a CBR

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.060 
what we're looking at here is a CBR
1,000<00:00:08.370> mm<00:00:08.730> this<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.290> 2004<00:00:10.290> has

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
1,000 mm this is a 2004 has

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.959 
1,000 mm this is a 2004 has
approximately<00:00:11.700> 25,000<00:00:12.570> miles<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.969> it's

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
approximately 25,000 miles and it's

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.140 
approximately 25,000 miles and it's
having<00:00:15.150> problem<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.199> charging<00:00:16.619> system

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
having problem with the charging system

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.510 
having problem with the charging system
we<00:00:18.150> check<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> battery<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.199> battery

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
we check the battery and the battery

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.529 
we check the battery and the battery
seemed<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.850> was<00:00:20.970> holding<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.330> charge

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
seemed like it was holding a charge

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.890 
seemed like it was holding a charge
pretty<00:00:21.960> well<00:00:22.279> so<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.730> next<00:00:24.420> obvious<00:00:24.630> thing

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
pretty well so the next obvious thing

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.070 
pretty well so the next obvious thing
was<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.560> look<00:00:25.680> at<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.890> stator<00:00:26.689> and<00:00:27.689> state

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
was to look at the stator and state

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.419 
was to look at the stator and state
here's<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> left<00:00:28.740> side<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.220> bike

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
here's on the left side of the bike

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.510 
here's on the left side of the bike
right<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:33.860> there's<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> bunch<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.190> screws

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
right here and there's a bunch of screws

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.130 
right here and there's a bunch of screws
that<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.270> undid<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.140> open<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.219> up

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
that we just undid and open it up

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.950 
that we just undid and open it up
visually<00:00:40.140> inspecting<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.129> see<00:00:41.960> here

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
visually inspecting it you can see here

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.799 
visually inspecting it you can see here
on<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.559> right<00:00:43.920> side<00:00:45.260> here<00:00:46.879> here<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.300> here

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.290 

visually<00:00:51.809> those<00:00:52.050> coils<00:00:52.969> look<00:00:53.969> very<00:00:54.239> dark<00:00:56.300> so

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
visually those coils look very dark so

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.410 
visually those coils look very dark so
visually<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.840> would<00:00:58.109> say<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.969> they<00:00:59.969> got<00:01:00.210> too

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
visually I would say that they got too

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.340 
visually I would say that they got too
hot<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.039> that's<00:01:02.039> normal<00:01:02.539> or<00:01:03.539> at<00:01:03.780> least<00:01:03.809> normal

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
hot and that's normal or at least normal

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.850 
hot and that's normal or at least normal
for<00:01:04.650> modern<00:01:05.369> sport<00:01:05.700> bikes<00:01:06.409> these<00:01:07.409> Staters

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
for modern sport bikes these Staters

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.310 
for modern sport bikes these Staters
will<00:01:08.100> only<00:01:08.280> last<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.700> about<00:01:08.850> 12,000<00:01:09.810> miles<00:01:09.990> if

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
will only last for about 12,000 miles if

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.690 
will only last for about 12,000 miles if
you're<00:01:10.470> riding<00:01:10.710> them<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.130> warm<00:01:11.430> climates

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you're riding them in warm climates

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.440 
you're riding them in warm climates
especially<00:01:13.670> there's<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.729> reason<00:01:15.060> why<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.240> only

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
especially there's a reason why you only

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.929 
especially there's a reason why you only
get<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> year<00:01:15.990> warranty<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.759> 12,000<00:01:17.759> miles

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
get a year warranty in 12,000 miles

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.649 
get a year warranty in 12,000 miles
usually<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.100> sport<00:01:20.100> bike<00:01:20.570> there<00:01:21.570> are<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
usually with a sport bike there are a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.120 
usually with a sport bike there are a
lot<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.810> reasons<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.439> would<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.920> them

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
lot of reasons this would be one of them

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.240 
lot of reasons this would be one of them
right<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.750> in<00:01:24.750> any<00:01:24.930> case<00:01:25.140> what<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.710> here

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
right here in any case what we have here

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.940 
right here in any case what we have here
is<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:27.210> nice<00:01:27.509> stator<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.380> one<00:01:28.590> cost<00:01:28.770> one

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
is a nice stator this one cost one

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.649 
is a nice stator this one cost one
hundred<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.250> forty<00:01:29.640> dollars<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.390> got<00:01:33.509> it

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
hundred and forty dollars and we got it

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.490 
hundred and forty dollars and we got it
from<00:01:33.810> Rick's<00:01:34.220> motorsports<00:01:35.220> electronics<00:01:36.500> now

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
from Rick's motorsports electronics now

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.950 
from Rick's motorsports electronics now
we<00:01:37.650> open<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.979> up

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
we open that up

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.710 
we open that up
and<00:01:39.960> we'll<00:01:40.170> take<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.350> look<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.360> new<00:01:42.360> stator

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and we'll take a look at the new stator

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.240 
and we'll take a look at the new stator
right<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.350> what<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> stator<00:01:43.890> should

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
right here this is what a stator should

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.670 
right here this is what a stator should
look<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:44.939> can<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.420> there's<00:01:45.689> there's

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
look like as you can see there's there's

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.080 
look like as you can see there's there's
no<00:01:46.950> black<00:01:48.860> burning<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.250> oil<00:01:50.430> around<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
no black burning of the oil around the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.940 
no black burning of the oil around the
coil<00:01:52.430> these<00:01:53.430> coils<00:01:53.670> are<00:01:54.560> inside<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.710> an<00:01:55.770> oil

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
coil these coils are inside of an oil

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.740 
coil these coils are inside of an oil
the<00:01:56.219> whole<00:01:56.369> time<00:01:56.640> which<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.329> supposed<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> help

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the whole time which is supposed to help

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.700 
the whole time which is supposed to help
keep<00:01:57.990> them<00:01:58.110> cool<00:01:58.140> but<00:02:00.229> probably<00:02:01.229> better<00:02:01.619> off

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
keep them cool but probably better off

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.499 
keep them cool but probably better off
you<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.219> putting<00:02:02.640> them<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.000> air<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
you know putting them in the air and the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.170 
you know putting them in the air and the
free<00:02:03.689> air<00:02:03.869> stream<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.409> keep<00:02:04.590> cool<00:02:05.030> but<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.090> any

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
free air stream to keep cool but in any

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.459 
free air stream to keep cool but in any
case<00:02:06.240> that's<00:02:06.570> why<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.750> cannot<00:02:06.960> expect<00:02:07.290> them

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
case that's why you cannot expect them

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.059 
case that's why you cannot expect them
to<00:02:07.530> last

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
to last

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.160 
to last
like<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.429> say<00:02:08.610> about<00:02:08.970> 12,000<00:02:09.629> miles<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.140> know

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
like I say about 12,000 miles you know

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.500 
like I say about 12,000 miles you know
and<00:02:10.410> that's<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:10.619> you're<00:02:10.739> lucky<00:02:11.150> in<00:02:12.150> any<00:02:12.300> case

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
and that's if you're lucky in any case

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
and that's if you're lucky in any case
we're<00:02:12.900> going<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.050> put<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.319> new

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
we're going to put the new

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.440 
we're going to put the new
one<00:02:13.650> on<00:02:13.800> here<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.280> then<00:02:14.970> we'll<00:02:15.060> take<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.270> look

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
one on here and then we'll take a look

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.820 
one on here and then we'll take a look
at<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.600> charging<00:02:16.020> system<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.530> I'll<00:02:16.620> show<00:02:16.770> you

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
at the charging system and I'll show you

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.570 
at the charging system and I'll show you
the<00:02:17.010> results<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.459> that

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.450 

okay<00:02:22.300> so<00:02:22.420> we<00:02:22.630> took<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.080> old<00:02:23.230> one<00:02:23.380> out<00:02:23.710> put<00:02:24.010> the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
okay so we took the old one out put the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.400 
okay so we took the old one out put the
new<00:02:24.610> one<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.800> we<00:02:26.800> just<00:02:26.980> put<00:02:27.130> these<00:02:27.280> on<00:02:28.410> hand

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
new one in and we just put these on hand

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.090 
new one in and we just put these on hand
tight<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:30.930> can<00:02:31.930> put<00:02:33.900> Kermit<00:02:34.900> X<00:02:35.110> blue<00:02:35.500> on<00:02:35.800> there

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
tight you can put Kermit X blue on there

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.340 
tight you can put Kermit X blue on there
if<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.820> want<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.240> but<00:02:37.570> like<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.930> say<00:02:38.170> you're

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
if you want to but like I say you're

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.920 
if you want to but like I say you're
probably<00:02:38.530> going<00:02:38.740> to<00:02:38.800> be<00:02:38.860> changing<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.460> again

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
probably going to be changing this again

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.510 
probably going to be changing this again
in<00:02:40.930> about<00:02:41.170> twelve<00:02:41.410> thousand<00:02:41.830> miles<00:02:41.980> anyway<00:02:42.460> so

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
in about twelve thousand miles anyway so

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.260 
in about twelve thousand miles anyway so
I<00:02:42.820> wouldn't<00:02:43.330> put<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.810> too<00:02:44.050> hard<00:02:45.060> but<00:02:46.060> in<00:02:46.180> any

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
I wouldn't put it on too hard but in any

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.700 
I wouldn't put it on too hard but in any
case<00:02:46.330> yeah<00:02:46.660> make<00:02:46.840> sure<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.990> put<00:02:47.200> them<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.440> hand

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
case yeah make sure you put them on hand

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.520 
case yeah make sure you put them on hand
tight<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.280> way<00:02:48.960> that<00:02:49.960> it<00:02:50.200> won't<00:02:50.350> come<00:02:50.410> off

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
tight that way that it won't come off

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.660 
tight that way that it won't come off
this<00:02:50.980> hair<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.280> put<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:51.700> on<00:02:51.910> hand<00:02:52.180> tight<00:02:52.480> and

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
this hair I put this on hand tight and

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.630 
this hair I put this on hand tight and
I'm<00:02:54.670> going<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:54.880> put<00:02:55.090> some<00:02:55.360> high-temperature

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
I'm going to put some high-temperature

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:05.490 
I'm going to put some high-temperature

careful when you put when you use these

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.450 
careful when you put when you use these
uh<00:03:09.930> gasket<00:03:10.930> makers<00:03:11.350> that<00:03:12.040> are<00:03:12.190> made<00:03:12.310> out<00:03:12.340> of

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
uh gasket makers that are made out of

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.160 
uh gasket makers that are made out of
silicon<00:03:13.000> here's<00:03:13.480> another<00:03:13.750> one<00:03:13.960> here<00:03:16.170> one

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
silicon here's another one here one

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.420 
silicon here's another one here one
thing<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.380> want<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.560> point<00:03:17.740> out<00:03:17.950> is<00:03:18.190> make<00:03:18.400> sure

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
thing I want to point out is make sure

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.230 
thing I want to point out is make sure
that<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:19.060> don't<00:03:19.270> get<00:03:19.450> them<00:03:20.340> inside<00:03:21.340> of<00:03:21.370> the

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
that you don't get them inside of the

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.380 
that you don't get them inside of the
screw<00:03:22.600> holes<00:03:22.960> that<00:03:23.860> is<00:03:24.100> inside<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:25.709> here

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
screw holes that is inside of here

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.170 
screw holes that is inside of here
because<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.989> silicone<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:32.310> not<00:03:33.310> compressible

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
because the silicone is not compressible

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.410 
because the silicone is not compressible
very<00:03:34.810> well<00:03:35.110> so<00:03:35.590> if<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.459> put<00:03:36.760> them<00:03:36.910> inside<00:03:37.120> of

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
very well so if you put them inside of

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.500 
very well so if you put them inside of
the<00:03:37.900> hole<00:03:38.140> here<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:39.640> can<00:03:39.760> actually<00:03:39.940> crack

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
the hole here you can actually crack

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.190 
the hole here you can actually crack
your<00:03:41.080> entire<00:03:41.470> crankcase<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:43.540> word<00:03:44.020> of<00:03:44.140> the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
your entire crankcase so word of the

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.050 
your entire crankcase so word of the
wise<00:03:44.320> is<00:03:44.709> yeah<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:44.950> could<00:03:45.190> put<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.610> silicon

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
wise is yeah you could put the silicon

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.920 
wise is yeah you could put the silicon
around<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:47.730> mating<00:03:48.730> surfaces<00:03:49.239> but<00:03:49.510> make<00:03:49.900> sure

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
around the mating surfaces but make sure

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.660 
around the mating surfaces but make sure
that<00:03:50.260> you<00:03:50.380> don't<00:03:50.500> put<00:03:50.800> them<00:03:50.980> inside<00:03:51.130> of<00:03:51.550> the

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
that you don't put them inside of the

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.750 
that you don't put them inside of the
screw<00:03:52.330> holes<00:03:52.570> okay<00:03:53.310> alright<00:03:54.310> so<00:03:54.340> we're<00:03:54.670> going

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
screw holes okay alright so we're going

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.630 
screw holes okay alright so we're going
to<00:03:54.820> put<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.090> back<00:03:55.300> together<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:56.459> we'll<00:03:57.459> see

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
to put this back together and we'll see

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.660 
to put this back together and we'll see
how<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:57.910> does<00:04:01.800> okay<00:04:02.800> we<00:04:02.920> got<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.190> new<00:04:03.340> stator

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
how it does okay we got the new stator

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.760 
how it does okay we got the new stator
on<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:05.010> we're<00:04:06.010> going<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.160> start<00:04:06.640> up<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.850> bike

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
on and we're going to start up the bike

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.000 
on and we're going to start up the bike
right<00:04:08.770> now<00:04:08.800> we<00:04:08.980> got<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.400> voltmeter<00:04:10.680> set<00:04:11.680> up<00:04:11.800> on

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
right now we got the voltmeter set up on

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.660 
right now we got the voltmeter set up on
the<00:04:12.280> battery<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.770> we've<00:04:14.770> got<00:04:14.950> twelve<00:04:15.280> point

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
the battery and we've got twelve point

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.729 
the battery and we've got twelve point
four<00:04:16.000> three<00:04:16.359> volts<00:04:17.519> which<00:04:18.780> isn't<00:04:19.780> fantastic

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
four three volts which isn't fantastic

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.580 
four three volts which isn't fantastic
but<00:04:21.040> it's<00:04:21.340> not<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:21.700> bad<00:04:21.940> for<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.590> battery

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
but it's not that bad for a battery

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.060 
but it's not that bad for a battery
especially<00:04:24.130> an<00:04:24.220> older<00:04:24.340> one<00:04:25.320> in<00:04:26.320> any<00:04:26.500> case<00:04:26.740> when

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
especially an older one in any case when

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.690 
especially an older one in any case when
we<00:04:27.220> start<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.669> motorcycle<00:04:29.280> we<00:04:30.280> should<00:04:30.580> get

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
we start the motorcycle we should get

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.500 
we start the motorcycle we should get
more<00:04:30.940> vaults<00:04:31.479> than<00:04:31.960> what<00:04:32.560> we<00:04:32.680> have<00:04:33.360> when<00:04:34.360> it's

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
more vaults than what we have when it's

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.430 
more vaults than what we have when it's
not<00:04:34.690> running

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
not running

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.160 
not running
especially<00:04:36.130> at<00:04:36.280> higher<00:04:36.790> rpms<00:04:37.390> and<00:04:37.690> when<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:37.870> say

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
especially at higher rpms and when I say

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.240 
especially at higher rpms and when I say
higher<00:04:38.410> around<00:04:39.480> 5000<00:04:40.480> or<00:04:40.600> so<00:04:40.840> so<00:04:41.800> let's<00:04:42.070> start

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
higher around 5000 or so so let's start

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.530 
higher around 5000 or so so let's start
off<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.430> bike<00:04:42.580> and<00:04:42.790> see<00:04:42.910> if<00:04:42.970> we<00:04:43.060> can<00:04:43.210> get<00:04:43.360> more

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
off the bike and see if we can get more

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.220 
off the bike and see if we can get more
than<00:04:43.600> twelve<00:04:43.960> point<00:04:44.230> four<00:04:44.620> three<00:04:45.010> volts<00:04:45.730> and

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
than twelve point four three volts and

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:57.560 
than twelve point four three volts and
we'll<00:04:47.230> see<00:04:47.440> if<00:04:47.790> our<00:04:48.790> new<00:04:48.970> stator<00:04:49.330> is<00:04:49.480> working

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.010 

okay<00:04:58.570> right<00:04:58.840> now<00:04:59.020> the<00:05:00.180> at<00:05:01.180> idle<00:05:01.660> we've<00:05:01.870> got

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
okay right now the at idle we've got

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.650 
okay right now the at idle we've got
twelve<00:05:02.440> point<00:05:02.920> seven<00:05:03.700> zero<00:05:06.000> now<00:05:07.000> twelve<00:05:07.360> point

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
twelve point seven zero now twelve point

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.080 
twelve point seven zero now twelve point
eight<00:05:07.890> so<00:05:08.890> yeah<00:05:09.130> we<00:05:09.400> definitely<00:05:09.580> have<00:05:10.060> a

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
eight so yeah we definitely have a

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.650 
eight so yeah we definitely have a
better<00:05:10.840> stator<00:05:11.260> the<00:05:12.010> other<00:05:12.160> stator<00:05:12.660> was

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
better stator the other stator was

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.630 
better stator the other stator was
reading<00:05:14.020> less<00:05:14.230> voltage<00:05:14.560> after<00:05:15.370> the

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
reading less voltage after the

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.090 
reading less voltage after the
motorcycle<00:05:16.270> was<00:05:16.390> started<00:05:16.900> so<00:05:17.230> all<00:05:17.860> you<00:05:17.980> need

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
motorcycle was started so all you need

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.560 
motorcycle was started so all you need
is<00:05:18.160> one<00:05:18.400> of<00:05:18.490> these<00:05:18.580> volt<00:05:18.820> meters<00:05:19.150> here<00:05:19.390> these

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
is one of these volt meters here these

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.190 
is one of these volt meters here these
cost<00:05:19.810> about<00:05:20.110> six<00:05:21.040> dollars<00:05:21.220> at<00:05:21.930> Harbor<00:05:22.930> Freight

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
cost about six dollars at Harbor Freight

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.770 
cost about six dollars at Harbor Freight
and<00:05:23.380> tool<00:05:23.560> and<00:05:24.060> as<00:05:25.060> you<00:05:25.180> can<00:05:25.240> see<00:05:25.300> now<00:05:25.600> we<00:05:25.660> got

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
and tool and as you can see now we got

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.660 
and tool and as you can see now we got
up<00:05:26.020> to<00:05:26.110> thirteen<00:05:26.560> and<00:05:26.740> if<00:05:26.860> I<00:05:26.980> rev<00:05:27.220> it<00:05:27.370> a<00:05:27.460> little

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
up to thirteen and if I rev it a little

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.510 
up to thirteen and if I rev it a little
bit<00:05:27.850> see<00:05:28.600> if<00:05:28.630> we<00:05:28.810> can<00:05:28.960> get<00:05:29.080> more

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.590 

okay<00:05:32.520> yeah<00:05:32.670> so<00:05:32.850> that's<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.180> sign<00:05:33.390> of<00:05:33.420> a

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
okay yeah so that's the sign of a

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.680 
okay yeah so that's the sign of a
healthy<00:05:33.630> stator<00:05:34.350> so<00:05:35.220> it<00:05:35.670> looks<00:05:35.820> like<00:05:36.000> we<00:05:36.390> fixed

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
healthy stator so it looks like we fixed

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.120 
healthy stator so it looks like we fixed
the<00:05:36.780> problem<00:05:37.640> thanks<00:05:38.640> for<00:05:38.790> watching
