status because all the statistics show
that<00:00:08.910> we're<00:00:09.210> just<00:00:09.389> decaying<00:00:09.809> our<00:00:10.080> planet<00:00:10.469> a

that we're just decaying our planet a

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.009 
that we're just decaying our planet a
very<00:00:10.769> rapid<00:00:11.280> rate<00:00:11.309> well<00:00:12.059> your<00:00:12.210> statistics<00:00:12.840> are

very rapid rate well your statistics are

very rapid rate well your statistics are
so<00:00:13.200> short-sighted<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:14.309> see<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.089> very

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
so short-sighted you see the very

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.300 
so short-sighted you see the very
premise<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:15.960> question<00:00:16.109> comes<00:00:16.949> forth

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
premise of that question comes forth

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.130 
premise of that question comes forth
from<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.580> vibrational<00:00:18.240> base<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.779> does<00:00:18.960> not

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
from a vibrational base that does not

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.160 
from a vibrational base that does not
serve<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.770> when<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.670> say<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.210> feel<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:22.050> my

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
serve you when you say I feel that my

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.990 
serve you when you say I feel that my
planet<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.710> being<00:00:22.980> destroyed<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.880> our

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
planet is being destroyed and that our

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.960 
planet is being destroyed and that our
environmental<00:00:24.810> methods<00:00:25.619> are<00:00:25.970> inappropriate

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
environmental methods are inappropriate

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.210 
environmental methods are inappropriate
the<00:00:27.390> basis<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.170> vibration<00:00:28.380> cannot

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
the basis of that vibration cannot

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.099 
the basis of that vibration cannot
possibly<00:00:29.699> attract<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.510> what<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.840> want

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
possibly attract to you what you want

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.889 
possibly attract to you what you want
but<00:00:31.740> out<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.160> contrasting<00:00:33.059> experiences

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
but out of that contrasting experiences

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.709 
but out of that contrasting experiences
born<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.440> desire<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:35.219> Earth<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:35.969> continue

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
born this desire for Earth to continue

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.780 
born this desire for Earth to continue
and<00:00:36.840> desire<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.559> clean<00:00:37.860> air<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.280> clean<00:00:38.579> water

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and desire for clean air and clean water

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.240 
and desire for clean air and clean water
and<00:00:39.120> desire<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:40.170> beautiful<00:00:40.620> vistas<00:00:41.070> and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
and desire for beautiful vistas and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.430 
and desire for beautiful vistas and
beautiful<00:00:41.670> places<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.120> continue<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
beautiful places to continue to be and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.130 
beautiful places to continue to be and
so<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.129> as<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.520> turn<00:00:44.550> your<00:00:45.120> desire<00:00:45.600> your

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
so then as you turn your desire your

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.110 
so then as you turn your desire your
attention<00:00:46.770> toward<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.370> which<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.879> your

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
attention toward that which is your

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.360 
attention toward that which is your
desire<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.200> make<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.649> dominant<00:00:50.219> part

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
desire and you make that a dominant part

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.729 
desire and you make that a dominant part
of<00:00:50.520> your<00:00:50.670> vibration<00:00:51.300> then<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> tides<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.530> your

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
of your vibration then the tides of your

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.650 
of your vibration then the tides of your
elections<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> tides<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:54.239> happens

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
elections and the tides of what happens

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.170 
elections and the tides of what happens
have<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.320> follow<00:00:55.559> along<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.489> vibration

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
have to follow along with that vibration

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.180 
have to follow along with that vibration
that<00:00:57.300> that's<00:00:57.629> 17<00:00:58.440> seconds<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.070> were

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
that that's 17 seconds that we were

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.220 
that that's 17 seconds that we were
talking<00:00:59.579> about<00:00:59.640> one<00:01:00.449> person<00:01:00.719> who<00:01:01.109> is

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
talking about one person who is

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.200 
talking about one person who is
connected<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> stream<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.520> more<00:01:02.670> powerful

connected to the stream is more powerful

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.750 
connected to the stream is more powerful
than<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.359> million<00:01:03.629> who<00:01:03.960> are<00:01:04.019> not<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.500> see

otherwise and then they always blame the
other<00:01:20.040> guy<00:01:20.280> hmm<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.960> very<00:01:22.350> great<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.189> you

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
other guy hmm it's very great that you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.679 
other guy hmm it's very great that you
said<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.790> me<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> very<00:01:24.509> way<00:01:24.659> I

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
said that to me that in the very way I

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.390 
said that to me that in the very way I
was<00:01:24.930> asking<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.380> question<00:01:25.650> was<00:01:26.009> basically

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
was asking that question was basically

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.920 
was asking that question was basically
saying<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.030> universe<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.570> mean<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
saying that the universe I mean that the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.969 
saying that the universe I mean that the
our<00:01:28.860> environment<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:30.150> suffering<00:01:30.840> now<00:01:31.530> I

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
our environment is is suffering now I

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.069 
our environment is is suffering now I
want<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.430> ask<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.540> see<00:01:33.750> most<00:01:33.960> people

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
want to ask you this you see most people

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.890 
want to ask you this you see most people
have<00:01:34.560> been<00:01:34.770> oriented<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.570> look<00:01:36.720> at

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
have been oriented to get you to look at

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.929 
have been oriented to get you to look at
what's<00:01:37.170> wrong<00:01:37.439> before<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.040> take<00:01:38.310> your<00:01:38.340> action

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
what's wrong before you take your action

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.819 
what's wrong before you take your action
so<00:01:39.210> you've<00:01:39.600> been<00:01:39.780> trained<00:01:40.140> into<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.650> way<00:01:40.799> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
so you've been trained into that way of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.340 
so you've been trained into that way of
looking<00:01:41.100> at<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.610> because<00:01:42.350> environmentalists

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
looking at it because environmentalists

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.200 
looking at it because environmentalists
believe<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.009> if<00:01:44.189> they<00:01:44.340> show<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.850> everything

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
believe that if they show you everything

believe that if they show you everything
that<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.570> wrong<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.259> from<00:01:46.530> your<00:01:46.680> concern

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that is wrong then from your concern

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.069 
that is wrong then from your concern
about<00:01:47.250> what<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.759> wrong<00:01:48.000> then<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:48.869> take

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
about what is wrong then you will take

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.960 
about what is wrong then you will take
some<00:01:49.350> action<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.829> will<00:01:50.159> then<00:01:50.340> correct<00:01:50.790> it

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
some action that will then correct it

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.270 
some action that will then correct it
but<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.390> never<00:01:52.049> works<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.530> way<00:01:52.890> there<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.250> a

instead<00:03:02.250> look<00:03:03.209> at<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:04.110> much<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.769> going

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
instead look at so much that is going

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.280 
instead look at so much that is going
right<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.640> bring<00:03:06.209> yourself<00:03:06.750> individually

that is yours and continue to thrive and

what is your secret and you may say well

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.620 
what is your secret and you may say well
for<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.040> long<00:03:17.220> time<00:03:17.519> I<00:03:17.700> saw<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.150> much<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.510> was

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
for a long time I saw so much that was

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.750 
for a long time I saw so much that was
wrong<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:18.989> made<00:03:19.260> myself<00:03:19.470> sick<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.519> then

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
wrong I made myself sick and then

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.640 
wrong I made myself sick and then
finally<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.269> decided<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.870> Remember<00:03:22.320> Who<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:22.500> am

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
finally I decided to Remember Who I am

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.039 
finally I decided to Remember Who I am
and<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.459> sifted<00:03:23.970> through<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.209> data<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.810> Earth's

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
and I sifted through the data of Earth's

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.259 
and I sifted through the data of Earth's
space-time<00:03:25.799> reality<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.640> discovered<00:03:27.239> that

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
space-time reality and I discovered that

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.030 
space-time reality and I discovered that
there<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.810> much<00:03:28.019> going<00:03:28.320> well<00:03:28.620> then<00:03:28.890> there

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
there is so much going well then there

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.099 
there is so much going well then there
is<00:03:29.130> not<00:03:29.340> going<00:03:29.609> well<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.359> I<00:03:30.570> found<00:03:30.840> something

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
is not going well and I found something

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.690 
is not going well and I found something
to<00:03:31.350> focus<00:03:31.680> upon<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.190> made<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.459> my

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
to focus upon and I made it my

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.120 
to focus upon and I made it my
vibrational<00:03:33.390> basis<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.440> more<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.680> focused

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
vibrational basis and the more I focused

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.650 
vibrational basis and the more I focused
upon<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.400> things<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:35.940> went<00:03:36.090> well<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.480> more

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
upon the things that went well the more

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.569 
upon the things that went well the more
things<00:03:36.930> went<00:03:37.170> well<00:03:37.320> in<00:03:37.500> my<00:03:37.680> life<00:03:37.890> until<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.310> have
