fuel pump bolts on the Nissan with the
impact<00:00:15.480> wrench<00:00:16.369> let's<00:00:17.369> get<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.670> bus<00:00:17.880> started

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
impact wrench let's get the bus started

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.929 
impact wrench let's get the bus started
and<00:00:18.600> make<00:00:18.720> sure<00:00:18.930> it's<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.230> neutral<00:00:19.470> here<00:00:20.010> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and make sure it's a neutral here and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.270 
and make sure it's a neutral here and
start<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.449> up

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.160 

and<00:00:28.760> I<00:00:28.850> think<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:29.300> problems<00:00:29.810> I<00:00:29.990> was<00:00:30.110> having

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
and I think the problems I was having

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.130 
and I think the problems I was having
with<00:00:30.710> it<00:00:30.860> earlier<00:00:31.240> was<00:00:32.240> that<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:32.540> choke<00:00:32.840> was

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
with it earlier was that the choke was

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.530 
with it earlier was that the choke was
sticking<00:00:33.620> in<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:33.920> on<00:00:34.220> position

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.510

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
now about the bus go

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.960 
now about the bus go
and<00:00:43.060> without<00:00:43.270> the<00:00:43.540> airline<00:00:44.080> hooks<00:00:44.500> up<00:00:44.680> to<00:00:44.970> the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
and without the airline hooks up to the

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.530 
and without the airline hooks up to the

fold off and we've got the fuel tank
straps<00:01:40.720> loosened<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.420> now<00:01:43.660> I<00:01:44.400> just<00:01:45.400> need<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.880> go

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
straps loosened so now I just need to go

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.430 
straps loosened so now I just need to go
ahead<00:01:46.150> and<00:01:46.510> see<00:01:46.690> if<00:01:46.720> there's<00:01:46.960> anything<00:01:47.200> else

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
ahead and see if there's anything else

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.980 
ahead and see if there's anything else
holding<00:01:47.980> it<00:01:48.100> on<00:01:48.250> there<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:49.230> drop<00:01:50.230> it<00:01:50.410> down<00:01:51.990> we

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
holding it on there and drop it down we

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.100 
holding it on there and drop it down we
now<00:01:53.200> have<00:01:53.440> a<00:01:53.470> fuel<00:01:53.860> tank<00:01:54.330> remove<00:01:55.330> or<00:01:55.780> have<00:01:55.960> it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
now have a fuel tank remove or have it

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.660 
now have a fuel tank remove or have it
loosened<00:01:56.680> I<00:01:56.920> took<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:57.970> mudguard<00:01:58.330> off<00:01:58.870> of<00:01:59.140> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
loosened I took the mudguard off of the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.450 
loosened I took the mudguard off of the
this<00:02:00.670> area<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.150> I<00:02:01.210> get<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.510> filler<00:02:01.720> pipe<00:02:02.020> out

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
this area so I get the filler pipe out

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.990 
this area so I get the filler pipe out
only<00:02:03.460> thing<00:02:03.730> is<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:05.280> can't<00:02:06.280> get<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.520> fuel<00:02:06.790> tank

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
only thing is I can't get the fuel tank

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.450 
only thing is I can't get the fuel tank
straps<00:02:07.330> out<00:02:07.540> of<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.780> back<00:02:08.020> and<00:02:08.500> I<00:02:08.950> think<00:02:09.010> I

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
straps out of the back and I think I

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.870 
straps out of the back and I think I
need<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.700> take<00:02:10.030> off<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.650> this<00:02:11.880> protective

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
need to take off the this protective

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.470 
need to take off the this protective
cover<00:02:12.910> here<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:15.040> think<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.490> probably<00:02:15.880> should

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
cover here and I think I probably should

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.020 
cover here and I think I probably should
have<00:02:16.630> done<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.020> first<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:17.800> that's<00:02:18.760> what<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:18.970> get

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
have done that first I that's what I get

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.330 
have done that first I that's what I get
for<00:02:19.270> not<00:02:19.330> following<00:02:19.840> instructions<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.680> think<00:02:21.250> I

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
for not following instructions I think I

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.070 
for not following instructions I think I
read<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.730> service<00:02:21.970> manual<00:02:22.330> said<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.840> remove

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
read the service manual said to remove

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.890 
read the service manual said to remove
the<00:02:23.230> fuel<00:02:23.440> tank<00:02:23.680> shield<00:02:24.040> first<00:02:24.610> but<00:02:25.600> I<00:02:25.660> thought

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
the fuel tank shield first but I thought

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.080 
the fuel tank shield first but I thought
well<00:02:26.110> I'll<00:02:26.410> just<00:02:26.590> try<00:02:26.890> removing<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.430> bolts

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
well I'll just try removing the bolts

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.660 
well I'll just try removing the bolts
first<00:02:28.360> but<00:02:28.750> they<00:02:29.530> wrote<00:02:29.740> that<00:02:29.770> for<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.220> reason

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
first but they wrote that for a reason

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.540 
first but they wrote that for a reason
so<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.090> guess<00:02:31.420> what<00:02:31.600> I'll<00:02:31.690> need<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.900> do<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.560> just

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
so I guess what I'll need to do is just

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.699 
so I guess what I'll need to do is just
block<00:02:33.820> up<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.180> fuel<00:02:34.450> tank<00:02:34.750> on<00:02:34.959> something<00:02:35.530> and

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
block up the fuel tank on something and

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.699 
block up the fuel tank on something and
get<00:02:36.220> down<00:02:36.430> in<00:02:36.670> there<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.000> take<00:02:37.209> off<00:02:37.450> this<00:02:37.750> the

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
get down in there and take off this the

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.729 
get down in there and take off this the
shield<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.570> can<00:02:40.690> get<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.900> fuel<00:02:41.140> tank<00:02:41.380> straps

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
shield so I can get the fuel tank straps

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.290 
shield so I can get the fuel tank straps

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
detached but the straps are still

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.720 
detached but the straps are still
attached<00:02:51.910> up<00:02:52.239> at<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.510> top<00:02:52.870> at<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.320> back<00:02:53.730> they

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
attached up at the top at the back they

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.979 
attached up at the top at the back they
just<00:02:54.760> fit<00:02:55.209> in<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.630> twist<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.970> now<00:02:58.270> once<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:58.750> take

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
just fit in and twist so now once I take

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.610 
just fit in and twist so now once I take
off<00:02:59.230> this<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.910> shroud<00:03:01.330> I<00:03:01.870> should<00:03:02.260> be<00:03:02.350> able<00:03:02.470> to

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
off this the shroud I should be able to

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.729 
off this the shroud I should be able to
get<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:02.950> fuel<00:03:03.190> tank<00:03:03.489> off<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.810> think<00:03:05.080> South

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
get the fuel tank off and I think South

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.560 
get the fuel tank off and I think South
JK<00:03:06.220> recommend<00:03:06.670> I'm<00:03:06.820> I<00:03:06.940> could<00:03:07.120> take<00:03:07.270> it<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.450> a

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
JK recommend I'm I could take it to a

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.860 
JK recommend I'm I could take it to a
radiator<00:03:08.020> repair<00:03:08.500> shop<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:09.610> he<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.690> he's

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
radiator repair shop and he that he's

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.560 
radiator repair shop and he that he's
had<00:03:11.110> success<00:03:11.320> in<00:03:11.620> getting<00:03:12.150> fuel<00:03:13.150> tanks

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
had success in getting fuel tanks

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.690 
had success in getting fuel tanks
cleaned<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.610> soldered<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.980> I<00:03:18.040> think<00:03:18.340> I'll<00:03:18.459> try

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
cleaned and soldered so I think I'll try

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.180 
cleaned and soldered so I think I'll try
that<00:03:19.620> but<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.770> made<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:20.980> lot<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.250> progress<00:03:21.580> and

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
that but I made a lot of progress and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.750 
that but I made a lot of progress and
hidden<00:03:24.190> identify<00:03:26.010> kind<00:03:27.010> of<00:03:27.160> done<00:03:27.280> without<00:03:27.489> the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
hidden identify kind of done without the

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.589 
hidden identify kind of done without the
bus<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:29.620> impact<00:03:30.040> wrench

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
bus and the impact wrench

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.470 
bus and the impact wrench
I<00:03:30.629> think<00:03:31.170> I<00:03:31.290> still<00:03:31.560> have<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.739> little<00:03:31.950> power<00:03:32.480> and

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
I think I still have a little power and

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.699 
I think I still have a little power and
see<00:03:33.840> if<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.170> turn<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.799> light<00:03:35.010> on<00:03:35.040> here<00:03:35.659> we<00:03:36.659> go<00:03:36.719> my

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
see if I turn the light on here we go my

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.739 
see if I turn the light on here we go my
stove<00:03:38.129> a<00:03:38.189> little<00:03:38.430> power<00:03:38.639> left<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.420> little

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:39.749 
stove a little power left and a little

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:41.330 
stove a little power left and a little
bit<00:03:39.959> of<00:03:40.019> air<00:03:40.170> left<00:03:40.319> in<00:03:40.469> the<00:03:40.590> tank

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
bit of air left in the tank

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.619 
bit of air left in the tank
yeah<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.810> they're<00:03:43.049> not<00:03:43.230> enough<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.680> do<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:44.010> but

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
yeah and they're not enough to do it but

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.599 
yeah and they're not enough to do it but
there<00:03:45.629> was<00:03:45.810> enough<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.409> to<00:03:46.889> do<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.189> when<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.459> was

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
there was enough to to do it when it was

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.879 
there was enough to to do it when it was
running
