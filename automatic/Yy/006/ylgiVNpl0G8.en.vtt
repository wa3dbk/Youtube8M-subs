00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
they'll be able to play it so that's

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.780 
they'll be able to play it so that's
pretty<00:01:30.360> cool<00:01:30.659> another<00:01:31.439> drawback<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.579> have

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
pretty cool another drawback is you have

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.429 
pretty cool another drawback is you have
to<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.119> online<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.509> them<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.990> access<00:01:34.140> your

to be online for them to access your

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.100 
to be online for them to access your
games<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.860> can't<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.189> offline<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:37.049> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
games you can't be offline so if that
