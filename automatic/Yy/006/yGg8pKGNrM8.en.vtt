00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:21.955
Oh I come on down from Kirkland
with some napalm in my hand

00:00:22.152 --> 00:00:26.994
And I spread some joy, and do deploy some fire on your head

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:32.099
Oh dear Bungie, we thank you, yes we do

00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:37.371
Cause our head's on fire, and we're no liar, we promise we love you

00:00:42.353 --> 00:00:47.247
On the seventh of July we celebrate the Bungie way

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:52.291
By giving to our fans and stating that we're here to stay

00:00:52.477 --> 00:00:57.400
We've got some big ole plans for a new franchise that'll pwn

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:02.396
Cause we split from Microsoft and wanna make it on our own

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:07.301
Oh dear Bungie, our scalps are flaming hot

00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:12.573
But we do not mind, cause you will 
 find, we sure like you a lot

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:22.516
On our independence day we spread the word throughout the land

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:27.679
That I come on down from Kirkland with some napalm in my hand

00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:32.726
When Reach is Gold we will prepare to put Halo to bed

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:37.898
So I spread some joy, and do deploy some fire on your head

00:01:38.174 --> 00:01:42.900
Oh dear Bungie, we thank you, yes we do

00:01:43.097 --> 00:01:47.880
Cause our head's on fire, and we're no liar, we promise we love you

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:53.510
Yes we promise we love you
