00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.770
 and 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.840
 hello today we have a new video in 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.180
 which I want to tell you how 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.119
 do here is a panel of a cat 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.250
 performed on with the help of nails and not so 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.289
 I really liked his weave hope 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.869
 that you will also like it 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.330
 let's start for but we will need you 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.339
 cut down a tree or any board which 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.150
 you have to take such a thicker 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.760
 so when we drank cloves into it 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.379
 the courtyard did not go to the opposite side 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.550
 but accordingly as I told us 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.280
 will need nails 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.549
 I just want to say what I tried here 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.640
 beat me first I was guests size 20 

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:51.769
 they were very big here such i had 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.369
 they are completely inappropriate so what if 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:58.699
 you will buy 8 buy size 12 

00:00:54.369 --> 00:01:00.019
 they are so small then we need 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.269
 will print the internet or 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.920
 draw a schematic seal could become and 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.470
 I tried to see by valx awn 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.479
 but I have a very large circuit 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.820
 so I had to give her a little 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.790
 reduce i will kill nails by 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.810
 pencil lines will also be needed 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.880
 Threads are different I will make a cat in 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.310
 green as in my room 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.780
 but there are different things green to me 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.909
 it seems that it will look good 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.630
 you use what threads you want and 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.340
 we will need a hammer let's begin 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.050
 first we need to put our 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.640
 drawing and cut down a tree and arrange it 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.890
 so that 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.960
 anywhere did not speak that all 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.960
 beautiful and evenly spaced 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.010
 i think i will kill the tail and so 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.190
 I will drive the nails on the contour 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:08.840
 so let's get down I will 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:10.340
 use the pliers to kill i will 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.900
 about gothic 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:18.010
 departing from each previous somewhere 0 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.010
 5 centimeters 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:36.950
 after i got all the nails 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:41.050
 Now you can remove our piece of paper just 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.050
 my take and tear off 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.670
 Here I have such a cat and 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.790
 now we will decorate it with all 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.450
 very simple i will start this 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:00.060
 behind the heads first to the first stud we 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.060
 just tying our thread 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:15.510
 and now we start our weaving just in 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.810
 in a chaotic order, I will reel 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.760
 thread through gothic closing the space 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.760
 that's where I had my drawing 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.660
 Now I plan tissue seal all else I 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.610
 I wanted to make him edging 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.620
 contour just lay a thread to me 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.520
 it seems so and the work looks more 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.580
 perfect 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.690
 I just have to cut the threads 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.460
 tied here on carnations by 2 knots 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.880
 so I can safely cut at the root 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:00.470
 and the threads and no less dissolve with one 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.780
 one side, that's all mine 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.630
 finished me turned out so green 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.120
 cat if you want you can still here 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.070
 decorate somehow for example once a writer 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.050
 still fill Jose how do some 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.590
 interesting elements but i will leave my 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.210
 Seal this again, I repeat that the picture 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.600
