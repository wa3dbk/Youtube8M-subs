00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.270 
choose the number of icons for each row
up<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.160> 15<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.690> can<00:02:24.870> set<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.290> rows<00:02:25.530> up<00:02:26.010> to

opens up to the photos out I think
there's<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.350> way<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.590> can<00:03:28.950> set<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.400> open<00:03:29.640> up

well<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:32.970> haven't<00:03:33.299> been<00:03:33.600> using<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.170> but<00:03:34.470> I

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
well but I haven't been using that but I

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.900 
well but I haven't been using that but I
think<00:03:34.829> there's<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.130> way<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.340> can<00:03:35.670> do<00:03:35.880> it

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
think there's a way you can do it
