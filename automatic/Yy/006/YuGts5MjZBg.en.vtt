00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
like 26 and 0 before we lost our first

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.130 
like 26 and 0 before we lost our first
match<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.820> remember<00:00:44.879> playing<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.780> matches

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
match and I remember playing the matches

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.770 
match and I remember playing the matches
up<00:00:46.260> until<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.649> point<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.190> streak

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
up until that point with the streak

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.090 
up until that point with the streak
building<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.050> there<00:00:49.770> was<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> lot<00:00:50.070> of

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
building and there was a lot of

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.700 
building and there was a lot of
nervousness<00:00:50.550> sweaty<00:00:51.059> palms<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:52.260> really

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
nervousness sweaty palms just really

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.709 
nervousness sweaty palms just really
didn't<00:00:53.100> want<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> guy<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.180> let<00:00:54.539> your

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
didn't want to be the guy to let your

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.290 
didn't want to be the guy to let your
teammate<00:00:55.199> down<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.680> any<00:00:55.860> clutch<00:00:56.190> situation<00:00:56.940> so

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
teammate down in any clutch situation so

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.119 
teammate down in any clutch situation so
that's<00:00:57.989> probably<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.469> biggest<00:00:58.680> memory<00:00:59.100> I

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
that's probably the biggest memory I

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.580 
that's probably the biggest memory I
have<00:00:59.460> modern<00:01:00.120> warfare<00:01:00.270> 2<00:01:00.750> was<00:01:01.050> just<00:01:01.350> an

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
have modern warfare 2 was just an

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.920 
have modern warfare 2 was just an
amazing<00:01:01.890> game<00:01:02.309> yes<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.760> had<00:01:02.910> some<00:01:03.120> faults<00:01:03.480> but

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
amazing game yes it had some faults but

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.660 
amazing game yes it had some faults but
every<00:01:04.229> every<00:01:04.680> call<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.010> duty<00:01:05.250> does<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.610> you

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
every every call of duty does and you

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.330 
every every call of duty does and you
can't<00:01:05.970> make<00:01:06.260> everyone<00:01:07.260> happy<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.100> general

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
can't make everyone happy but in general

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.270 
can't make everyone happy but in general
I<00:01:08.729> would<00:01:08.970> say<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:10.170> hit<00:01:10.439> detection<00:01:10.619> was

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
I would say the hit detection was

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.880 
I would say the hit detection was
probably<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.420> best<00:01:12.720> I've<00:01:13.049> ever<00:01:13.080> felt<00:01:13.560> when<00:01:13.770> it

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
probably the best I've ever felt when it

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.590 
probably the best I've ever felt when it

up<00:01:42.659> my<00:01:42.780> character<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.290> doing<00:01:43.560> all<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> ranks

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
up my character and doing all the ranks

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
up my character and doing all the ranks
I'm<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:45.000> for<00:01:45.090> kills<00:01:45.450> trees<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.020> know

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
I'm going for kills trees you know

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.899 
I'm going for kills trees you know
aiming<00:01:46.439> for<00:01:46.649> nukes<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.040> perfecting<00:01:47.790> my

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
aiming for nukes and perfecting my

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.940 
aiming for nukes and perfecting my
sniping<00:01:48.360> skills<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.259> what<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.470> found<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.920> most

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
sniping skills and what I found the most

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.039 
sniping skills and what I found the most
addicting<00:01:50.610> honestly<00:01:51.060> was<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.659> after<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
addicting honestly was going after the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.960 
addicting honestly was going after the
titles<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.560> emblems<00:01:52.680> even<00:01:53.189> boosted<00:01:53.579> with<00:01:53.729> you

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
titles and emblems even boosted with you

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.270 
titles and emblems even boosted with you
and<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.270> think<00:01:54.540> classic<00:01:55.170> first-person<00:01:55.890> shooter

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
and I think classic first-person shooter

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.160 
and I think classic first-person shooter
that's<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.850> game<00:01:57.000> I'm<00:01:57.149> thinking<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.630> simply

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that's the game I'm thinking of simply

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.300 
that's the game I'm thinking of simply
because<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.649> know<00:01:58.710> everyone's<00:01:59.100> got<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
because you know everyone's got a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.649 
because you know everyone's got a
special<00:01:59.579> place<00:01:59.880> in<00:01:59.909> their<00:02:00.090> heart<00:02:00.329> for<00:02:00.390> their

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
special place in their heart for their

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.209 
special place in their heart for their
first<00:02:00.840> call<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.140> duty<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.710> was<00:02:01.799> really<00:02:02.040> my

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
first call of duty but it was really my

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.760 
first call of duty but it was really my
first<00:02:02.460> multiplayer<00:02:03.299> game<00:02:03.810> well<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.409> would<00:02:04.590> just

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
first multiplayer game well I would just

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.920 
first multiplayer game well I would just
lose<00:02:04.979> hours<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.909> hours<00:02:06.090> doing<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.719> same

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
lose hours and hours doing the same

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.389 
lose hours and hours doing the same
thing<00:02:07.200> over<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.469> over<00:02:07.590> again<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.220> would<00:02:08.369> be

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
thing over and over again it would be

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.700 
thing over and over again it would be
amazing<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.209> see

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
amazing to see

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.570 
amazing to see
back<00:02:10.000> number<00:02:11.000> three<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.020> this<00:02:12.740> is<00:02:12.950> kind<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.340> one

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
back number three so this is kind of one

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.480 
back number three so this is kind of one
that<00:02:13.790> people<00:02:14.120> have<00:02:14.360> covered<00:02:14.720> before<00:02:14.930> but<00:02:15.490> I'm

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
that people have covered before but I'm

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.520 
that people have covered before but I'm
not<00:02:17.150> at<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.390> biggest<00:02:17.840> call<00:02:17.990> of<00:02:18.080> duty<00:02:18.260> player

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
not at the biggest call of duty player

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.700 
not at the biggest call of duty player
anymore<00:02:18.800> but<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.250> was<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.600> reason<00:02:20.780> why<00:02:21.080> was

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
anymore but I was and the reason why was

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.520 
anymore but I was and the reason why was
because<00:02:21.740> modern<00:02:22.370> warfare<00:02:22.730> 2<00:02:23.150> was<00:02:23.900> just<00:02:24.200> fun

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
and that's kind of a kind of a cop-out

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.510 
and that's kind of a kind of a cop-out
answer<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:30.020> it's<00:02:30.200> just<00:02:30.380> fun<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.040> want<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.370> I

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
to see modern warfare 2 because that's a

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.210 
to see modern warfare 2 because that's a
game<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.020> I<00:02:45.080> actually<00:02:45.290> enjoyed<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:45.980> play

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
game that I actually enjoyed to play

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.460 
game that I actually enjoyed to play
whereas<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.000> newer<00:02:47.150> call<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.570> duties<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:48.020> just

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
whereas the newer call of duties I just

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.640 
whereas the newer call of duties I just
don't<00:02:48.710> enjoy<00:02:49.220> as<00:02:49.460> much<00:02:49.520> really<00:02:50.390> at<00:02:50.660> all<00:02:50.690> number

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
don't enjoy as much really at all number

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.640 
don't enjoy as much really at all number
two<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.580> this<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.030> kind<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.630> one<00:02:54.050> that<00:02:54.260> plagues

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
two so this is kind of one that plagues

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.160 
two so this is kind of one that plagues
all<00:02:54.980> games<00:02:55.460> from<00:02:55.790> last<00:02:56.030> gen<00:02:56.330> that<00:02:56.720> aren't<00:02:57.080> on

all games from last gen that aren't on

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.350 
all games from last gen that aren't on
next-gen<00:02:57.650> is<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.520> don't<00:02:58.940> really<00:02:59.060> have<00:02:59.210> a

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
next-gen is that I don't really have a

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.120 
next-gen is that I don't really have a
way<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.600> play<00:02:59.900> it<00:02:59.930> anymore<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.650> play<00:03:00.830> with<00:03:00.950> my

one I think I speak for a lot of people

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.800 
one I think I speak for a lot of people
when<00:03:33.740> I<00:03:33.800> say<00:03:34.160> that<00:03:34.490> modern<00:03:34.850> warfare<00:03:35.030> 2<00:03:35.420> was<00:03:35.780> a

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
when I say that modern warfare 2 was a

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.750 
when I say that modern warfare 2 was a
game<00:03:36.110> that<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:36.800> they<00:03:36.920> played<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.190> lot<00:03:37.460> and

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
game that that they played a lot and

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.930 
game that that they played a lot and
they<00:03:38.180> played<00:03:38.390> with<00:03:38.480> their<00:03:38.660> friends<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:39.230> lot<00:03:39.440> and

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
they played with their friends a lot and

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.070 
they played with their friends a lot and
it's<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:41.000> game<00:03:41.150> that<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.300> played<00:03:41.570> for<00:03:41.720> multiple

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
years straight I played it for maybe

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.960 
years straight I played it for maybe
three<00:03:44.900> years<00:03:45.320> like<00:03:45.650> as<00:03:45.860> like<00:03:46.010> my<00:03:46.160> only<00:03:46.400> game<00:03:46.760> i

three years like as like my only game i
played<00:03:47.240> and<00:03:48.070> even<00:03:49.070> longer<00:03:49.280> than<00:03:49.490> that<00:03:49.640> just

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
played and even longer than that just

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.390 
played and even longer than that just
mixing<00:03:50.690> in<00:03:50.840> other<00:03:51.080> games<00:03:51.320> as<00:03:51.560> well<00:03:51.710> but

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
mixing in other games as well but

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.040 
mixing in other games as well but
there's<00:03:52.700> something<00:03:53.000> about<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.330> game<00:03:53.690> that

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
there's something about that game that

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.720 
there's something about that game that
I've<00:03:54.230> never<00:03:54.590> really<00:03:54.980> experienced<00:03:55.400> before<00:03:55.520> and

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
I've never really experienced before and

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.760 
I've never really experienced before and
that's<00:03:56.120> that<00:03:56.330> I<00:03:56.360> played<00:03:56.810> it<00:03:57.020> consistently

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
that's that I played it consistently

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.530 
that's that I played it consistently
with<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.040> same<00:03:58.250> friends<00:03:58.730> almost<00:03:59.090> every<00:03:59.510> day

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
with the same friends almost every day

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.740 
with the same friends almost every day
and<00:03:59.750> it<00:04:00.080> was<00:04:00.170> almost<00:04:00.350> like<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:01.420> secondary<00:04:02.420> life

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
and it was almost like a secondary life

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.590 
and it was almost like a secondary life
or<00:04:03.050> something<00:04:03.410> in<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.680> places<00:04:04.190> I<00:04:04.370> began<00:04:05.240> to

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
or something in the places I began to

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.330 
or something in the places I began to
feel<00:04:06.020> as<00:04:06.380> if<00:04:06.470> they<00:04:06.620> were<00:04:06.680> real<00:04:06.860> because<00:04:07.130> you

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
feel as if they were real because you

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.440 
feel as if they were real because you
know<00:04:07.460> you're<00:04:07.610> experiencing<00:04:08.030> them<00:04:08.210> with<00:04:08.330> the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
know you're experiencing them with the

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.510 
know you're experiencing them with the
same<00:04:08.630> people<00:04:08.810> all<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.110> time<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:09.590> that<00:04:10.250> type

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
same people all the time and that type

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.400 
same people all the time and that type
of<00:04:10.550> feeling<00:04:11.000> of<00:04:11.150> just<00:04:11.330> being<00:04:11.450> connected<00:04:12.230> with

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
of feeling of just being connected with

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.580 
of feeling of just being connected with
other<00:04:12.590> people<00:04:13.060> it's<00:04:14.060> especially<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:15.320> mean<00:04:15.440> in

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
other people it's especially to mean in

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.470 
other people it's especially to mean in
life<00:04:15.740> in<00:04:15.950> general<00:04:15.980> but<00:04:16.340> in<00:04:16.460> a<00:04:16.549> game<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:17.330> was

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
life in general but in a game it was

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.030 
life in general but in a game it was
really<00:04:17.840> nice<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.049> it's<00:04:18.530> something<00:04:18.739> that<00:04:19.010> I

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
really nice and it's something that I

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.530 
really nice and it's something that I
really<00:04:19.250> haven't<00:04:19.400> gotten<00:04:19.880> into<00:04:20.210> again<00:04:20.510> I

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
really haven't gotten into again I

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.030 
really haven't gotten into again I
haven't<00:04:20.900> really<00:04:21.169> found<00:04:21.320> another<00:04:21.620> game<00:04:21.830> that

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
haven't really found another game that

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.400 
haven't really found another game that
play<00:04:22.220> consistently<00:04:22.700> with<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:22.970> same<00:04:23.150> people

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
play consistently with the same people

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.450 
play consistently with the same people
mostly<00:04:24.410> because<00:04:24.590> most<00:04:24.860> of<00:04:24.950> us<00:04:25.010> have<00:04:25.190> grown<00:04:25.310> up

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
mostly because most of us have grown up

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.740 
mostly because most of us have grown up
but<00:04:25.580> it<00:04:25.700> would<00:04:25.850> be<00:04:25.880> nice<00:04:26.120> to<00:04:26.300> kind<00:04:26.480> of<00:04:26.510> get<00:04:26.630> that

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
but it would be nice to kind of get that

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.480 
but it would be nice to kind of get that
reminiscent<00:04:27.320> factor<00:04:27.680> of<00:04:27.800> entering<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.310> game

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
reminiscent factor of entering the game

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.940
