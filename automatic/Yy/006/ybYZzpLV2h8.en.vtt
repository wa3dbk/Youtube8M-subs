 Game authors had to react to it 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.480

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.880
 Thousands of products ideas and 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.860

 sort the products for your shipment 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.390
 that I have to say at first 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.360
 that you look at the product of a company 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.939
 a publisher's focus is on 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.530
 human history and culture and 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.299
 which things ultimately piece and 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.400
 to deal with that decides you 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.600
 this works as follows 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.000
 but with at least twelve euros 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.560
