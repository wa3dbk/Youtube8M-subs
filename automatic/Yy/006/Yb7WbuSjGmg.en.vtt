came out with with a deaf ear box and

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.400 
came out with with a deaf ear box and
also<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.610> 540<00:02:15.329> think<00:02:15.540> super<00:02:15.870> Brett<00:02:16.140> actually

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
also a 540 think super Brett actually

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.440 
also a 540 think super Brett actually
came<00:02:16.650> out<00:02:16.680> with<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.069> 380<00:02:17.700> motor

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
came out with a 380 motor

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.880 
came out with a 380 motor
so<00:02:21.240> this<00:02:22.240> I<00:02:22.510> got<00:02:23.099> there<00:02:24.099> cheaply<00:02:24.550> actually<00:02:25.120> on

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
so this I got there cheaply actually on

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.150 
so this I got there cheaply actually on
eBay<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:29.200> was<00:02:29.410> Green

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
eBay it was Green

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.710 
eBay it was Green
weren't<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.700> see<00:02:30.910> where<00:02:31.060> it's<00:02:31.180> blue<00:02:31.390> there<00:02:31.660> it

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720

weren't you see where it's blue there it
was<00:02:31.900> green<00:02:32.290> but<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.099> was<00:02:33.190> just<00:02:33.400> falling<00:02:33.790> off<00:02:34.120> so

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
was green but it was just falling off so

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.229 
was green but it was just falling off so
I<00:02:34.930> got<00:02:35.530> rid<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.860> green<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.400> just<00:02:36.940> found<00:02:37.120> an

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
I got rid of the green and just found an

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.930 
I got rid of the green and just found an
old<00:02:37.360> Tammy<00:02:37.630> our<00:02:37.780> Paint<00:02:38.050> Pot<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.730> touched<00:02:39.730> up

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
old Tammy our Paint Pot and touched up

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.120 
old Tammy our Paint Pot and touched up
with<00:02:39.970> blue<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.540> mean<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:41.110> probably<00:02:41.230> looks<00:02:41.530> ok<00:02:41.920> on

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
with blue I mean it probably looks ok on

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.559 
with blue I mean it probably looks ok on
camera<00:02:43.030> but<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.830> know<00:02:44.830> this<00:02:45.100> white<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.670> can

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
camera but you know this white you can

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.479 
camera but you know this white you can
tell<00:02:46.780> it's<00:02:46.930> old

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
tell it's old

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.259 
tell it's old
so<00:02:48.489> yeah<00:02:48.760> just<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:49.239> very<00:02:49.450> quick<00:02:51.239> touch-up<00:02:52.239> on

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
so yeah just a very quick touch-up on

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.740 
so yeah just a very quick touch-up on
this<00:02:52.569> to<00:02:52.750> make<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:54.430> blue<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:54.970> with<00:02:55.600> these

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
this to make it the blue and with these

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.570 
this to make it the blue and with these
shells<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.470> brain<00:02:56.769> I<00:02:56.980> was<00:02:57.100> just<00:02:57.250> literally

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
shells the brain I was just literally

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.140 
shells the brain I was just literally
flicking<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:59.739> know<00:02:59.890> you<00:02:59.950> flick<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.760> shell

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
flicking it you know you flick the shell

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.600 
flicking it you know you flick the shell
sometimes<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.930> paint<00:03:02.170> just<00:03:02.440> falls<00:03:03.160> off<00:03:03.370> and

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
sometimes the paint just falls off and

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.949 
sometimes the paint just falls off and
that's<00:03:03.760> literally<00:03:04.060> what<00:03:04.269> I<00:03:04.299> did<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.690> get<00:03:04.840> rid

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
that's literally what I did to get rid

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.410 
that's literally what I did to get rid
of<00:03:05.049> like<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.980> old<00:03:06.130> line<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.790> make<00:03:07.209> it

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
of like the the old line and make it

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.360 
of like the the old line and make it
blue<00:03:07.660> which<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.019> think<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.950> one<00:03:09.160> been

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
blue which you think that one been

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.820 
blue which you think that one been
unique<00:03:09.940> but<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.810> bit<00:03:11.080> different<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
unique but a bit different to the

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.580 
unique but a bit different to the
standard<00:03:12.640> box<00:03:12.970> art<00:03:13.269> pink<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:15.930> especially<00:03:16.930> put

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
standard box art pink and especially put

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.809 
standard box art pink and especially put
a<00:03:17.799> modern<00:03:18.730> ESC<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:19.720> there<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.519> but<00:03:21.519> I've<00:03:21.670> left

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
a modern ESC in there and but I've left

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.539 
a modern ESC in there and but I've left
the<00:03:22.060> resistors<00:03:22.600> on<00:03:22.780> because<00:03:23.140> I<00:03:23.470> think<00:03:24.220> they

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
the resistors on because I think they

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.610 
the resistors on because I think they
look<00:03:24.730> fantastic<00:03:24.810> Wow

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
look fantastic Wow

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.830 
look fantastic Wow
yeah<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.340> on/off<00:03:27.579> switch<00:03:27.609> on<00:03:27.970> these<00:03:28.180> is<00:03:28.510> he's

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
yeah the on/off switch on these is he's

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.150 
yeah the on/off switch on these is he's
on<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.140> body<00:03:29.320> she'll<00:03:29.560> different<00:03:29.980> for<00:03:30.100> the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
on the body she'll different for the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.319 
on the body she'll different for the
rerelease<00:03:30.640> so<00:03:30.880> they're<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.450> buying<00:03:31.690> it<00:03:31.890> a

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
rerelease so they're you buying it a

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.170 
rerelease so they're you buying it a
shell

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
shell

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.050 
shell
your<00:03:35.359> vintage<00:03:35.900> frog<00:03:36.469> and<00:03:37.159> it'll<00:03:37.909> be<00:03:38.030> a

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
your vintage frog and it'll be a

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.580 
your vintage frog and it'll be a
rerelease<00:03:38.629> shell<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.049> you<00:03:39.079> won't<00:03:39.349> get<00:03:39.469> the

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
rerelease shell and you won't get the

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.199 
rerelease shell and you won't get the
holes<00:03:39.799> there<00:03:40.129> that's<00:03:40.459> a<00:03:40.549> good<00:03:40.700> way<00:03:40.819> to<00:03:40.849> tell

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
holes there that's a good way to tell

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.640 
holes there that's a good way to tell
whether<00:03:41.359> you<00:03:41.510> get<00:03:41.659> a<00:03:41.689> RiRi<00:03:42.170> shell<00:03:42.469> or<00:03:42.620> a

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
whether you get a RiRi shell or a

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.500 
whether you get a RiRi shell or a
vintage<00:03:43.099> be<00:03:43.310> not<00:03:43.489> really<00:03:43.609> gonna<00:03:43.819> fun<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.180> be<00:03:44.299> to

show anyway so yeah there we go
see<00:03:52.129> how<00:03:52.219> she<00:03:52.280> -<00:03:52.639> it<00:03:52.969> will<00:03:53.150> be<00:03:53.329> at<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.540> front

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:53.689 
see how she - it will be at the front

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:04.189 
surface the rear-wheel drive is still

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.479 
surface the rear-wheel drive is still
fair<00:04:04.489> amount<00:04:04.730> of<00:04:04.790> tread<00:04:05.030> left<00:04:05.060> on<00:04:05.450> those<00:04:05.659> tires

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
fair amount of tread left on those tires

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:16.039 
fair amount of tread left on those tires
see<00:04:07.489> what

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.720
