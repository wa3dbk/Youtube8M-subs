welcome to other unreal foods video
today<00:00:09.430> I<00:00:09.460> want<00:00:09.700> to<00:00:09.760> talk<00:00:09.910> briefly<00:00:10.450> about<00:00:11.130> using

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.130 
today I want to talk briefly about using

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.920 
today I want to talk briefly about using
your<00:00:12.340> left<00:00:12.580> hand<00:00:12.670> on<00:00:13.030> the<00:00:13.090> goalie<00:00:13.450> and<00:00:13.720> the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:13.930 
your left hand on the goalie and the

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.800 
your left hand on the goalie and the
tool<00:00:14.139> bar<00:00:14.320> so<00:00:14.770> let's<00:00:15.280> get<00:00:15.460> started<00:00:15.760> first<00:00:16.630> off

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
tool bar so let's get started first off

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.810 
tool bar so let's get started first off
there's<00:00:17.200> a<00:00:17.260> couple<00:00:17.470> ways<00:00:17.680> of<00:00:17.800> doing<00:00:17.860> it<00:00:18.160> one<00:00:18.369> is

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
there's a couple ways of doing it one is

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.269 
there's a couple ways of doing it one is
holding<00:00:19.390> the<00:00:19.599> handles<00:00:20.050> and<00:00:20.260> the<00:00:20.740> other<00:00:20.860> one<00:00:21.040> is

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
holding the handles and the other one is

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.230 
holding the handles and the other one is
holding<00:00:21.760> the<00:00:22.330> rods<00:00:22.950> it's<00:00:23.950> to<00:00:24.669> me<00:00:24.820> it's<00:00:24.970> it's

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
holding the rods it's to me it's it's

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.420 
holding the rods it's to me it's it's
it's<00:00:25.689> a<00:00:25.779> preference<00:00:26.020> I<00:00:26.439> don't<00:00:26.619> find<00:00:26.980> one<00:00:27.250> way

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
it's a preference I don't find one way

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.300 
it's a preference I don't find one way
or<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:27.610> other<00:00:27.700> to<00:00:28.599> be<00:00:28.720> better<00:00:28.930> so<00:00:29.619> it's<00:00:30.009> it's

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
or the other to be better so it's it's

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.800 
or the other to be better so it's it's
just<00:00:30.550> you<00:00:30.910> know<00:00:31.000> whatever<00:00:31.180> you<00:00:31.419> feel<00:00:31.630> more

just you know whatever you feel more
comfortable<00:00:32.169> with<00:00:32.430> try<00:00:33.430> both<00:00:34.239> methods<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:34.899> see

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
comfortable with try both methods to see

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.710 
comfortable with try both methods to see
what<00:00:35.290> what<00:00:35.950> you<00:00:36.040> like<00:00:36.250> I<00:00:36.430> like<00:00:36.670> holding<00:00:37.660> the

what what you like I like holding the
handles<00:00:38.170> and<00:00:38.500> I<00:00:38.890> typically<00:00:39.670> place<00:00:40.030> my<00:00:40.239> hands

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
handles and I typically place my hands

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.349 
handles and I typically place my hands
on<00:00:40.719> the<00:00:40.870> thinner<00:00:41.079> part<00:00:41.170> of<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.590> handle<00:00:42.359> you

on the thinner part of the handle you
know<00:00:43.449> I<00:00:43.480> put<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.719> rods<00:00:43.989> all<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.260> way<00:00:44.379> up

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
know I put the rods all the way up

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.279 
know I put the rods all the way up
against<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.879> bumpers<00:00:46.239> over<00:00:46.420> there<00:00:46.600> set<00:00:47.260> up

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
against the bumpers over there set up

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
move both of the bars and I can you know

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.829 
move both of the bars and I can you know
I<00:00:58.929> have<00:00:59.140> movement<00:00:59.769> where<00:01:00.160> I'm<00:01:00.550> able<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:01.120> spin

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
I have movement where I'm able to spin

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.320 
I have movement where I'm able to spin
the<00:01:01.989> rocks<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.350> little<00:01:02.469> bit<00:01:02.589> or<00:01:03.150> separate<00:01:04.150> them

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
the rocks a little bit or separate them

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.700 
the rocks a little bit or separate them
or<00:01:04.540> move<00:01:04.930> them<00:01:05.140> you<00:01:05.710> know<00:01:05.830> in<00:01:06.490> parallel<00:01:07.230> or<00:01:08.230> you

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
or move them you know in parallel or you

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.860 
or move them you know in parallel or you
know<00:01:08.800> just<00:01:08.830> just<00:01:09.310> having<00:01:09.580> every<00:01:10.000> every

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
know just just having every every

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.140 
know just just having every every
movement<00:01:11.050> that<00:01:11.260> you<00:01:11.380> think<00:01:11.590> you'll<00:01:11.740> need<00:01:12.150> so

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
movement that you think you'll need so

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.500 
movement that you think you'll need so
this<00:01:13.570> is<00:01:13.720> a<00:01:13.780> technique<00:01:14.170> that<00:01:14.200> you<00:01:14.440> can<00:01:14.470> use<00:01:14.680> for

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
this is a technique that you can use for

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.410 
this is a technique that you can use for
defensive<00:01:16.510> purposes<00:01:18.030> obviously<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.330> know

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
defensive purposes obviously you know

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.790 
defensive purposes obviously you know
you're<00:01:19.510> trying<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.840> gain<00:01:20.260> a<00:01:20.290> little<00:01:20.560> bit<00:01:20.650> of<00:01:20.710> an

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
you're trying to gain a little bit of an

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.320 
you're trying to gain a little bit of an
advantage<00:01:21.070> by<00:01:21.370> the<00:01:21.430> fact<00:01:21.700> that<00:01:21.760> you<00:01:21.940> can<00:01:22.120> move

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
advantage by the fact that you can move

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.860 
advantage by the fact that you can move
two<00:01:22.930> rods<00:01:23.230> or<00:01:23.530> at<00:01:23.650> least<00:01:23.860> you're<00:01:24.130> able<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:24.870> to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
two rods or at least you're able to to

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.660 
two rods or at least you're able to to
move<00:01:26.110> this<00:01:26.380> when<00:01:27.100> you're<00:01:27.370> playing<00:01:27.640> singles

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
move this when you're playing singles

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.370 
move this when you're playing singles
typically<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:31.480> know<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:31.660> can<00:01:31.870> set<00:01:32.080> up<00:01:32.200> a

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
typically you you know you can set up a

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.790 
typically you you know you can set up a
a<00:01:32.650> zone<00:01:33.430> and<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.780> for<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.110> most<00:01:35.290> part<00:01:35.410> you'll

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
a zone and and for the most part you'll

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.460 
a zone and and for the most part you'll
be<00:01:35.950> moving<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:37.330> five<00:01:37.510> bar<00:01:37.720> and<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.080> three<00:01:38.290> bar

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
be moving the five bar and the three bar

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.290 
be moving the five bar and the three bar
so<00:01:38.740> your<00:01:39.160> goal<00:01:39.400> your<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:39.760> know<00:01:39.880> your<00:01:40.030> goalie

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
so your goal your you know your goalie

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.840 
so your goal your you know your goalie
and<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.720> tool<00:01:40.900> bar<00:01:41.050> will<00:01:41.260> typically<00:01:41.620> be

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
and the tool bar will typically be

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.420 
and the tool bar will typically be
static<00:01:42.850> they'll<00:01:43.060> just<00:01:43.270> be<00:01:43.420> sitting<00:01:43.780> there

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
static they'll just be sitting there

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.490 
static they'll just be sitting there
which<00:01:45.430> is<00:01:45.610> which<00:01:46.360> you<00:01:46.660> know<00:01:46.840> it's<00:01:47.080> it's<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.470> it's

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
which is which you know it's it's a it's

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.210 
which is which you know it's it's a it's
it's<00:01:48.310> it's<00:01:48.610> a<00:01:48.760> good<00:01:48.940> technique<00:01:49.090> as<00:01:49.600> well<00:01:50.220> but

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
it's it's a good technique as well but

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.340 
it's it's a good technique as well but
sometimes<00:01:51.490> if<00:01:51.880> somebody<00:01:52.210> scoring<00:01:52.630> on<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:53.050> and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
sometimes if somebody scoring on you and

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.320 
sometimes if somebody scoring on you and
you<00:01:53.440> want<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.040> be<00:01:54.370> able<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.610> change<00:01:54.880> things<00:01:55.150> up

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
you want to be able to change things up

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.480 
you want to be able to change things up
it's<00:01:55.510> it's<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.050> good<00:01:56.200> idea<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.530> maybe<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:57.460> know

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
it's it's a good idea to maybe you know

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.080 
it's it's a good idea to maybe you know
change<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:58.510> up<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.720> little<00:01:58.870> bit<00:01:59.220> and<00:02:00.220> just<00:02:00.670> you

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
change it up a little bit and just you

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.180 
change it up a little bit and just you
know<00:02:01.120> give<00:02:01.360> somebody<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.780> different<00:02:02.260> defensive

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
know give somebody a different defensive

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.009 
know give somebody a different defensive
look<00:02:03.400> so<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.920> can<00:02:06.160> be<00:02:06.250> used<00:02:06.490> also<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:07.900> know

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
look so this can be used also you know

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.080 
look so this can be used also you know
if<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.229> want<00:02:08.379> to<00:02:08.440> play<00:02:08.649> when<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.489> sometimes

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
if you want to play when you sometimes

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.630 
if you want to play when you sometimes
when<00:02:10.269> you<00:02:10.390> move<00:02:10.569> on<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:11.830> defensive<00:02:12.400> position

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
when you move on a defensive position

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.640 
when you move on a defensive position
where<00:02:13.239> somebody<00:02:13.540> has<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.959> ball<00:02:14.140> under<00:02:14.410> five

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
where somebody has the ball under five

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.840 
where somebody has the ball under five
and<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.580> want<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.820> play<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.480> right-handed

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
and you want to play a right-handed

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.270 
and you want to play a right-handed
defense<00:02:18.850> on<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.120> five<00:02:19.330> as<00:02:19.720> before

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
defense on the five as before

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.220 
defense on the five as before
doing<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.910> with<00:02:21.030> your<00:02:21.209> left<00:02:21.390> hand<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:22.200> can

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
doing it with your left hand you can

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.020 
doing it with your left hand you can
either<00:02:22.970> hold<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> single<00:02:24.750> rod<00:02:25.200> or<00:02:26.030> you

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
either hold on to a single rod or you

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.340 
either hold on to a single rod or you
can<00:02:27.209> hold<00:02:27.630> on<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.810> both<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.490> again<00:02:29.730> it's

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
can hold on to both and so again it's

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.020 
can hold on to both and so again it's
it's<00:02:31.350> up<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:32.010> essentially<00:02:32.640> know<00:02:32.790> when

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
it's up to you to essentially know when

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.990 
it's up to you to essentially know when
you<00:02:33.150> want<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.420> use<00:02:34.130> one<00:02:35.130> defensive<00:02:35.610> technique

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
you want to use one defensive technique

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.630 
you want to use one defensive technique
versus<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.569> other<00:02:36.720> one<00:02:36.959> but<00:02:37.400> sometimes<00:02:38.400> it's

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
versus the other one but sometimes it's

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.199 
versus the other one but sometimes it's
just<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:39.090> know<00:02:39.180> good<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.720> able<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.970> be

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
just you know good to be able to to be

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.900 
just you know good to be able to to be
able<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.390> have<00:02:42.540> control<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.930> both<00:02:43.230> rods<00:02:43.700> if<00:02:44.700> you

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
able to have control of both rods if you

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.610 
able to have control of both rods if you
know<00:02:45.030> especially<00:02:45.300> if<00:02:45.870> somebody<00:02:46.050> has<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.350> good

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
know especially if somebody has a good

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.860 
know especially if somebody has a good
left<00:02:46.890> hook<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:48.090> you're<00:02:48.270> afraid<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.600> you're

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
left hook and you're afraid that you're

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.559 
left hook and you're afraid that you're
leaving<00:02:49.050> too<00:02:49.290> much<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.250> hole<00:02:50.459> here<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.000> you

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
leaving too much of a hole here and you

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.240 
leaving too much of a hole here and you
might<00:02:51.690> not<00:02:51.870> be<00:02:51.959> able<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.230> stop<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.709> with<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.920> 5r

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
might not be able to stop it with the 5r

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.850 
might not be able to stop it with the 5r
then<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.880> know<00:02:54.030> then<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.570> can<00:02:54.750> use<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:55.590> hand

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
then you know then you can use this hand

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.190 
then you know then you can use this hand
to<00:02:56.040> make<00:02:56.190> these<00:02:56.370> guys<00:02:56.580> sort<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:57.030> just<00:02:57.989> hover

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
to make these guys sort of just hover

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.410 
to make these guys sort of just hover
around<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.769> hole<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.910> know<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.060> try<00:03:00.360> to

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
around this hole you know to try to

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.080 
around this hole you know to try to
discourage<00:03:01.290> them<00:03:01.890> from<00:03:01.950> shooting<00:03:02.519> or<00:03:02.820> even<00:03:03.000> if

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
they do shoot it to have a better chance

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.080 
they do shoot it to have a better chance
of<00:03:06.090> stopping<00:03:06.330> them<00:03:06.739> or<00:03:07.739> sometimes<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.970> know

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
of stopping them or sometimes you know

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.479 
of stopping them or sometimes you know
if<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.330> know<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:10.950> they<00:03:11.280> have<00:03:11.459> a

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
certain certain pass maybe a brush to

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.100 
certain certain pass maybe a brush to
the<00:03:14.010> lane<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.280> you're<00:03:14.610> gonna<00:03:14.730> be<00:03:15.000> swinging<00:03:15.840> at

it you might you might deflect it at an
angle<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.900> want<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.500> make<00:03:19.620> sure<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:20.040> that

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
it's gonna go to the wall and bounce

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.000 
it's gonna go to the wall and bounce
back<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:28.230> know<00:03:28.350> that<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.709> don't<00:03:28.799> just

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
ball so again I typically when I play

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.199

singles I start out with my with my
defensive<00:03:45.690> zone<00:03:45.870> but<00:03:46.350> at<00:03:47.310> times<00:03:47.640> if<00:03:47.850> you<00:03:48.090> know

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
defensive zone but at times if you know

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.849 
defensive zone but at times if you know
somebody<00:03:48.540> scoring<00:03:48.930> well<00:03:49.140> on<00:03:49.500> me<00:03:49.769> especially
