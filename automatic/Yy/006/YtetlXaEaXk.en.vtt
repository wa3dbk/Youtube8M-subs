00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
would let me pull the guns off of the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.280 
would let me pull the guns off of the
Avenger<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> couldn't<00:01:54.509> tell<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.689> which<00:01:55.020> one

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
Avenger so I couldn't tell you which one

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.719 
Avenger so I couldn't tell you which one
these<00:01:55.439> are<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.890> could<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.280> joke<00:01:56.490> upon

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
these are so this could be the joke upon

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.980 
these are so this could be the joke upon
short<00:01:57.000> could<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.540> talents<00:01:58.170> wreckers

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
short could be the talents wreckers

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.210 
short could be the talents wreckers
and<00:02:00.110> I<00:02:00.530> have<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.400> guess<00:02:01.640> it<00:02:01.820> where<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.060> other

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
and I have to guess it where the other

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.920 
and I have to guess it where the other
cons<00:02:04.220> would<00:02:04.340> be<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.450> let's<00:02:05.600> take<00:02:05.720> a<00:02:05.750> look

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
cons would be so let's take a look

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.710 
cons would be so let's take a look
inside<00:02:06.399> now<00:02:07.399> I<00:02:07.700> feel<00:02:07.820> like<00:02:08.090> compared<00:02:08.569> to<00:02:08.630> the

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
inside now I feel like compared to the

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.430 
inside now I feel like compared to the
Hornet<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.800> very<00:02:10.009> underpowered<00:02:11.440> with

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
Hornet it is very underpowered with

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.740 
Hornet it is very underpowered with
weapons<00:02:12.980> but<00:02:13.760> i'll<00:02:14.000> be<00:02:14.180> able<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.450> add<00:02:14.569> some

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
weapons but i'll be able to add some

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.720 
weapons but i'll be able to add some
weapons<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:15.500> I'm<00:02:16.160> not<00:02:16.280> looking<00:02:16.519> to<00:02:16.550> go

way to shut off the nitrogen because
your<00:03:34.670> friends<00:03:35.030> might<00:03:35.239> be<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.840> tad<00:03:36.230> cold<00:03:37.180> we<00:03:38.180> can

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.599 
your friends might be a tad cold we can
just<00:03:38.420> freeze<00:03:38.660> them<00:03:38.840> make<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.620> quick<00:03:39.859> for<00:03:40.100> them

to get home

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.580 
to get home
you'll<00:03:42.330> just<00:03:42.690> be<00:03:42.780> frozen<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.260> whole<00:03:43.380> way<00:03:43.470> home

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
you'll just be frozen the whole way home

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.020 
you'll just be frozen the whole way home
and<00:03:43.740> they<00:03:43.830> remember<00:03:44.160> anything<00:03:44.400> about<00:03:44.730> half

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
and they remember anything about half

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.350 
and they remember anything about half
hour<00:03:45.180> triple<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.720> take<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:46.110> couple<00:03:46.890> seconds

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
hour triple and take a couple seconds

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.670

now<00:03:52.770> we<00:03:52.830> look<00:03:53.010> at<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.190> wall<00:03:53.340> on<00:03:53.460> the<00:03:53.520> right

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
now we look at the wall on the right

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.880 
now we look at the wall on the right
this<00:03:54.780> looks<00:03:54.840> like<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.170> great<00:03:55.350> wall<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.740> hang

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
this looks like a great wall to hang

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.330 
this looks like a great wall to hang
pinups<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:57.720> hot<00:03:58.500> alien<00:03:58.800> on<00:04:00.050> sector<00:04:01.050> 5<00:04:01.340> you

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
pinups of that hot alien on sector 5 you

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.620

can<00:04:02.490> see<00:04:02.580> it<00:04:02.670> right<00:04:02.790> from<00:04:02.880> your<00:04:03.060> your<00:04:03.480> bed

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
can see it right from your your bed

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.980 
can see it right from your your bed
that's<00:04:04.530> kind<00:04:04.740> of<00:04:04.770> cool<00:04:04.970> now<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.510> glass<00:04:06.750> is

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990

that's kind of cool now the glass is
kind<00:04:07.260> of<00:04:07.410> blurry<00:04:08.000> but<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.210> can<00:04:09.420> spy<00:04:09.630> up<00:04:09.780> there<00:04:09.990> a

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
kind of blurry but I can spy up there a

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.420 
kind of blurry but I can spy up there a
TV<00:04:10.560> screen<00:04:11.300> so<00:04:12.830> it's<00:04:13.830> kind<00:04:14.070> of<00:04:14.130> nice<00:04:14.250> because

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
all right now you can see the technology

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.740 
all right now you can see the technology
in<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.440> cockpit<00:04:40.740> I<00:04:41.220> need<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.270> get<00:04:42.360> to<00:04:42.420> see<00:04:42.630> at

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
in the cockpit I need to get to see at

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.230 
in the cockpit I need to get to see at
the<00:04:42.840> seats<00:04:43.050> yellow<00:04:43.910> because<00:04:44.910> you<00:04:45.000> can<00:04:45.120> get

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
the seats yellow because you can get

this and you get into the seat but the

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.250 
this and you get into the seat but the
technology<00:04:48.120> is<00:04:48.360> kind<00:04:48.540> of<00:04:48.600> old<00:04:48.690> now<00:04:48.870> this<00:04:49.050> looks

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
technology is kind of old now this looks

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.740 
technology is kind of old now this looks
like<00:04:49.380> an<00:04:49.530> old<00:04:49.680> fishing<00:04:49.950> vessel<00:04:50.430> with<00:04:51.150> about<00:04:51.360> 40

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
like an old fishing vessel with about 40

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.080 
like an old fishing vessel with about 40
gps's<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:53.160> you<00:04:53.250> can<00:04:53.340> see<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.580> tuna<00:04:53.910> that's

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
gps's so you can see the tuna that's

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.840 
gps's so you can see the tuna that's
little<00:04:54.330> below<00:04:54.480> your<00:04:54.510> ship<00:04:55.040> but<00:04:56.040> this<00:04:56.640> is<00:04:56.820> a

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
little below your ship but this is a

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.840 
little below your ship but this is a
spaceship<00:04:57.419> this<00:04:57.720> is<00:04:57.900> not<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.080> tuna<00:04:58.410> vessel<00:04:58.850> this

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
spaceship this is not a tuna vessel this

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.580 
spaceship this is not a tuna vessel this
is<00:05:00.000> old<00:05:00.210> technology<00:05:00.360> but<00:05:00.990> I<00:05:01.110> kind<00:05:01.380> of<00:05:01.410> like<00:05:01.560> it

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
is old technology but I kind of like it

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.230 
is old technology but I kind of like it
it<00:05:01.770> makes<00:05:01.890> me<00:05:02.040> feel<00:05:02.220> closer<00:05:02.430> to<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.760> ship<00:05:03.000> I

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
it makes me feel closer to the ship I

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.700 
it makes me feel closer to the ship I
feel<00:05:03.750> like<00:05:03.840> this<00:05:03.990> is<00:05:04.110> a<00:05:04.140> ship<00:05:04.380> that<00:05:04.410> you<00:05:04.560> might

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
feel like this is a ship that you might

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.570 
feel like this is a ship that you might
see<00:05:04.890> built<00:05:05.160> now<00:05:07.010> so<00:05:08.010> it<00:05:08.100> makes<00:05:08.220> me<00:05:08.370> kind<00:05:08.550> of

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
see built now so it makes me kind of

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.550 
see built now so it makes me kind of
identify<00:05:09.030> with<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:09.300> little<00:05:09.450> bit<00:05:09.570> more<00:05:09.720> most<00:05:10.440> of

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
identify with a little bit more most of

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.020 
identify with a little bit more most of
the<00:05:10.620> other<00:05:10.770> ships<00:05:11.040> have<00:05:11.280> a<00:05:11.310> lot<00:05:11.580> of<00:05:11.610> 3d

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
the other ships have a lot of 3d

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.750 
the other ships have a lot of 3d
holographic<00:05:12.480> type<00:05:12.810> screens<00:05:13.490> so<00:05:14.490> it<00:05:14.580> seems

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
holographic type screens so it seems

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.490

I do have to fly out of this hangar and
it<00:05:32.700> might<00:05:32.820> make<00:05:32.910> it<00:05:33.060> hard<00:05:33.210> if<00:05:33.330> I<00:05:33.419> can't<00:05:33.630> see<00:05:33.750> my

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
there's no impediment this view so this

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.720 
there's no impediment this view so this
is<00:06:21.160> a<00:06:21.220> impede<00:06:21.580> of<00:06:21.700> view<00:06:21.960> it's<00:06:22.960> perfect<00:06:23.460> no<00:06:24.460> bars

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
is a impede of view it's perfect no bars

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.850 
is a impede of view it's perfect no bars
there's<00:06:25.060> no<00:06:25.180> cross<00:06:25.420> beams<00:06:25.720> I<00:06:26.020> can<00:06:26.680> see

there's no cross beams I can see

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.490 
there's no cross beams I can see
everywhere<00:06:27.220> now<00:06:28.180> if<00:06:28.660> I'm<00:06:28.780> fighting<00:06:29.110> a<00:06:29.140> Hornet

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
everywhere now if I'm fighting a Hornet

everywhere now if I'm fighting a Hornet
and<00:06:29.650> he<00:06:29.860> has<00:06:30.010> maybe<00:06:30.940> some<00:06:31.600> obstruction<00:06:32.140> in<00:06:32.230> his

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
and he has maybe some obstruction in his

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.510 
and he has maybe some obstruction in his
views<00:06:33.330> that's<00:06:34.330> a<00:06:34.420> benefit<00:06:34.720> to<00:06:34.780> me<00:06:34.960> I<00:06:35.340> can<00:06:36.340> see

views that's a benefit to me I can see

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.550 
views that's a benefit to me I can see
everywhere<00:06:36.790> so<00:06:37.000> if<00:06:37.090> he's<00:06:37.240> flying<00:06:37.510> by<00:06:37.750> he<00:06:38.350> might
