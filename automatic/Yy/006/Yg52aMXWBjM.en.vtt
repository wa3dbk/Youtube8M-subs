00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
pull this back this is a huge deficit

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.670 
pull this back this is a huge deficit
unfortunately<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.009> minute<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:58.700> 45<00:01:59.210> 46<00:02:00.200> seconds

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
unfortunately a minute and 45 46 seconds

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.710 
unfortunately a minute and 45 46 seconds
down<00:02:00.920> on<00:02:00.979> Rowan<00:02:01.429> Dennis<00:02:01.729> but<00:02:01.970> it's<00:02:02.420> such<00:02:02.659> a

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
down on Rowan Dennis but it's such a

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.419 
down on Rowan Dennis but it's such a
huge<00:02:03.049> effort<00:02:03.229> I<00:02:03.470> think<00:02:03.679> it's<00:02:03.830> difficult<00:02:04.039> to

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
huge effort I think it's difficult to

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.270 
huge effort I think it's difficult to
explain<00:02:04.939> just<00:02:05.689> how<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:06.259> higher<00:02:06.500> standard<00:02:06.950> he's

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280

kilometers<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:37.390> suspect<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.720> would<00:02:38.900> be

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
kilometers I suspect that it would be

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.559 
kilometers I suspect that it would be
just<00:02:39.319> hard<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.769> it<00:02:40.040> was<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.920> mean<00:02:43.489> just<00:02:44.390> so

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
just hard and it was and I mean just so

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.090 
just hard and it was and I mean just so
disappointed<00:02:45.230> when<00:02:45.349> I<00:02:45.380> started<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.890> falter

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
disappointed when I started to falter

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.370 
disappointed when I started to falter
just<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:47.000> early<00:02:47.359> and<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.570> just<00:02:47.930> didn't<00:02:48.200> have<00:02:48.350> it

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
just so early and I just didn't have it

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.229 
just so early and I just didn't have it
at<00:02:49.040> all<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.519> was<00:02:50.299> just<00:02:50.570> too<00:02:51.049> far<00:02:51.850> far<00:02:52.850> from<00:02:53.120> it

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239
