00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.120 
of ventilation both at the top and at
the<00:02:26.060> bottom<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.420> mean<00:02:27.569> look<00:02:27.810> at<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.140> huge<00:02:28.680> fan

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
the bottom I mean look at this huge fan

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.420 
the bottom I mean look at this huge fan
here<00:02:29.370> as<00:02:29.459> well<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:30.019> 160<00:02:31.019> millimeter<00:02:31.650> fan<00:02:32.040> that's

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
here as well a 160 millimeter fan that's

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.030 
here as well a 160 millimeter fan that's
if<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.940> want<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.269> use<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:33.690> don't<00:02:33.720> have<00:02:34.230> to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
if you want to use it you don't have to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.790 
if you want to use it you don't have to
actually<00:02:35.459> power<00:02:36.090> this<00:02:36.540> fan<00:02:36.780> are<00:02:36.989> all<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.500> to

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
actually power this fan are all and to

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.580 
actually power this fan are all and to
do<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.069> by<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.280> way<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:39.120> use<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.780> USB

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
do that by the way you use the USB

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.570 
do that by the way you use the USB
connection<00:02:41.069> but<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.239> idea<00:02:42.630> here<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.920> lift

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
connection but the idea here is to lift

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.830 
connection but the idea here is to lift
the<00:02:45.360> laptop<00:02:45.750> off<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.610> surface<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.299> then

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
the laptop off of the surface and then

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.180 
the laptop off of the surface and then
let<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:50.250> laptops<00:02:50.940> coolers<00:02:51.600> pull<00:02:52.019> in<00:02:52.319> cool<00:02:52.890> air

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
let the laptops coolers pull in cool air

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.030 
let the laptops coolers pull in cool air
now<00:02:53.970> if<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.180> need<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.600> fan<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.230> will<00:02:55.500> assist

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
now if you need the fan it will assist

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.509 
now if you need the fan it will assist
in<00:02:56.340> pushing<00:02:56.700> more<00:02:57.030> air<00:02:57.269> into<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.560> laptop<00:02:59.069> but

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
in pushing more air into the laptop but

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.670 
in pushing more air into the laptop but
still<00:02:59.819> in<00:03:00.090> most<00:03:00.630> cases<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.080> probably<00:03:01.290> won't

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
still in most cases you probably won't

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.890 
still in most cases you probably won't
need<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.430> would<00:03:03.269> be<00:03:03.390> great<00:03:03.660> because

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
need it and that would be great because

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.020 
need it and that would be great because
it<00:03:04.260> will<00:03:04.349> be<00:03:04.470> completely<00:03:04.920> silent<00:03:05.160> now<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.880> is

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
it will be completely silent now this is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.680 
it will be completely silent now this is
a<00:03:06.060> 15<00:03:06.660> point<00:03:06.989> 4<00:03:07.560> inch<00:03:07.950> notebook<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.970> with<00:03:09.510> it

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
a 15 point 4 inch notebook and with it

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.080 
a 15 point 4 inch notebook and with it
on<00:03:09.870> top<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.980> laptop<00:03:11.489> cooler<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.060> can

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
on top of the laptop cooler you can

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.479 
on top of the laptop cooler you can
really<00:03:12.599> see<00:03:12.870> how<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.440> works

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
really see how it works

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.319 
really see how it works
the<00:03:14.700> laptop<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:15.420> elevated<00:03:16.319> so<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:17.160> laptop<00:03:17.880> fan

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
the laptop is elevated so the laptop fan

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.860 
the laptop is elevated so the laptop fan
or<00:03:18.780> fans<00:03:19.140> can<00:03:19.920> intake<00:03:20.519> lots<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.120> lots<00:03:21.299> of<00:03:21.510> cool

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
or fans can intake lots and lots of cool

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.090 
or fans can intake lots and lots of cool
air<00:03:22.140> with<00:03:22.440> or<00:03:22.709> without<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:24.480> laptop<00:03:25.100> coolers

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
air with or without the laptop coolers

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.559 
air with or without the laptop coolers
fan<00:03:26.609> on<00:03:27.109> because<00:03:28.109> even<00:03:28.769> if<00:03:28.950> it's<00:03:29.160> not<00:03:29.519> on<00:03:29.850> it

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
fan on because even if it's not on it

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.830 
fan on because even if it's not on it
will<00:03:30.840> still<00:03:31.230> allow<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:32.459> laptop<00:03:33.060> fans<00:03:33.480> to

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
will still allow the laptop fans to

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.020 
will still allow the laptop fans to
intake<00:03:34.290> lots<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.829> lots<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.280> cool<00:03:35.579> air<00:03:35.819> you've

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
intake lots and lots of cool air you've

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.539 
intake lots and lots of cool air you've
got<00:03:36.269> this<00:03:36.480> nice<00:03:36.810> space<00:03:37.290> below<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:37.920> laptop

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
got this nice space below the laptop

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.000 
got this nice space below the laptop
like<00:03:38.760> for<00:03:39.000> example<00:03:39.480> if<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:40.019> throw<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.380> laptop

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
like for example if you throw a laptop

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.430 
like for example if you throw a laptop
on<00:03:41.220> your<00:03:41.430> bed<00:03:41.730> or<00:03:41.760> on<00:03:42.000> carpet<00:03:42.690> or<00:03:42.810> on<00:03:42.930> your<00:03:43.079> lap

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
on your bed or on carpet or on your lap

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.090 
on your bed or on carpet or on your lap
the<00:03:44.340> fans<00:03:44.670> can't<00:03:45.180> intake<00:03:45.870> air<00:03:46.139> very<00:03:46.620> well<00:03:46.889> at

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
the fans can't intake air very well at

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.300 
the fans can't intake air very well at
all<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.519> this<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.180> why<00:03:48.569> these<00:03:49.049> laptop<00:03:49.889> coolers

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
all and this is why these laptop coolers

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.000 
all and this is why these laptop coolers
really<00:03:50.910> work<00:03:51.120> now<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.799> difference<00:03:52.799> you'll

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
really work now the difference you'll

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.250 
really work now the difference you'll
get<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.910> know<00:03:53.940> vary<00:03:54.540> depending<00:03:54.870> on<00:03:55.139> the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
get you know vary depending on the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.449 
get you know vary depending on the
environment<00:03:55.950> but<00:03:56.519> usually<00:03:57.239> between<00:03:57.480> 5<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.889> 15

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
environment but usually between 5 and 15

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.940 
environment but usually between 5 and 15
degrees<00:03:59.700> Celsius<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.900> can<00:04:01.049> be<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:01.500> dramatic

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
degrees Celsius it can be that dramatic

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.979 
degrees Celsius it can be that dramatic
and<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.730> really<00:04:03.060> good<00:04:03.180> thing<00:04:03.239> about<00:04:03.480> this

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
and the really good thing about this

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.920 
and the really good thing about this
laptop<00:04:04.230> cooler<00:04:04.950> is<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.519> fits<00:04:05.760> laptops<00:04:06.359> up<00:04:06.660> to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
laptop cooler is it fits laptops up to

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.309 
laptop cooler is it fits laptops up to
17<00:04:07.739> inches<00:04:07.769> now<00:04:08.250> this<00:04:08.400> is<00:04:08.519> a<00:04:08.639> 15<00:04:09.030> point<00:04:09.329> 4<00:04:09.900> inch

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
17 inches now this is a 15 point 4 inch

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.640 
17 inches now this is a 15 point 4 inch
laptop<00:04:11.160> it's<00:04:11.310> a<00:04:11.370> fairly<00:04:11.609> big<00:04:12.620> 15.4<00:04:13.620> inch

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
laptop it's a fairly big 15.4 inch

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.000 
laptop it's a fairly big 15.4 inch
laptop<00:04:14.280> all<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.489> same<00:04:14.850> but<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:16.079> 17<00:04:16.739> inch

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
laptop all the same but the 17 inch

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.849 
laptop all the same but the 17 inch
laptop<00:04:17.519> would<00:04:17.700> probably<00:04:18.359> hang<00:04:18.750> out<00:04:18.959> over<00:04:19.139> just

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
laptop would probably hang out over just

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.070 
laptop would probably hang out over just
a<00:04:20.100> little<00:04:20.130> bit<00:04:20.459> finally<00:04:21.269> how<00:04:21.479> to<00:04:21.510> listen<00:04:21.870> to

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
a little bit finally how to listen to

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:31.230 
a little bit finally how to listen to
the<00:04:22.229> fan

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.480 

so<00:04:31.870> what<00:04:32.169> should<00:04:32.289> you<00:04:32.350> be<00:04:32.500> looking<00:04:32.800> for<00:04:32.830> in<00:04:33.130> a
