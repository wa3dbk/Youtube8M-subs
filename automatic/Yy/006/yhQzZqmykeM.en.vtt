00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.650
 defined 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.859
 it was then that sony decided to end 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.189
 that and launched his first mascot 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.590
 nursery 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.770
 many people thought that day-care is a 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.600
 fox an orange dog type mas but 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.629

 puppies like kangaroo for example 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.489
 originally from Australia because it is very 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.500
 travel this right 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.760
 good but in case of daycare it is not a 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.219
 common marsupial 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.989
 it has been genetically altered to be 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.850
 a soldier in the service of evil 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.689
 your creator is a scientist is evil 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.729
 called neocortex doctor neo doctor 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.890
 o'neill often do many 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.970
 animal experiments and transformed 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.250
 genetically 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.350
 many of these animals the nursery was a 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.810
 of these animals modified by the doctor 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.330
 he becomes a smart marsupial 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.580
 agile and with some special powers 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.340
 but he can escape the base of the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.750
 neo doctor throwing himself out the window and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.909
 fallen in the ocean 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.880
 when waking up on a grechi beach 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.810
 find in 7 ask for a locality where 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.939
 if the game is played and this is where everything starts 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.280
 here is what gets what you wanted from nelsan 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.649
 ellis island in australia 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.689
 It is up to the crÃ¨che to cross all the 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.170
 game passing through indigenous villages 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.659
 Inca times polluted sewers of much 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.630
 more until you return to the secret lab 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.850
 of courtesy in order to be able to 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.439
 girlfriend and to help her journey 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.810
 nursery can count on the help of a 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.150
 Inca entity is incorporated in a 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.400
 mask that helps you 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.070
 you do have some of the stadiums 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.930
 funniest pecha 1 as per 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.000
 example where you have to run from 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.980
 a ball-shaped rock rather than 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.980
 very reminiscent of a famous movie scene 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:32.080
 who has this other stage also where 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:32.080
 You run over a boar gave the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.230
 he was almost so successful that soon 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:46.730
 sony decided to launch its sequel in 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:48.200
 1997 corttex troicki tec second game 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.480
 brought all that the first had to 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.120
 better yet with improved graphics and 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.470
 some new things besides animations 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.300
 many ways 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.670
 I have to admit that some phases 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.740
 They are very similar to the first but 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:10.190
 even so the game gets our points 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:12.650
 difficulty gameplay successfully 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.940
 second game a third game was just 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.850
 a matter of time 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.970
 it was then that in 1998 it was released with 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.890
 she 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.770
 considered by many 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.460
 the best game of the series aa anp cruel 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.460
 order 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.900
 the new game in the series has brought a new 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.709
 playable character who was the most 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.709
 new clash 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.459
 has a stage where you can pilot the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.459
 jet ski with her 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.570
 The legal in this third game that you 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.550
 You can choose which stage start 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.180
 franchise daycare sold so much that they created 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.890
 up a racing game karki daycare game 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.150

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.150
 similar is mario kart 64 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.550
 That's because I want more. 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.780
 but we'll talk about this game more 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.780

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.380
 Crash Bandicoot is a fun and 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.990
 attractive 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.030

 spurious baskets separated in three 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.580
 days of playing enough to spend a 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.990
 good time to be able to give 100% to is a 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.050
 challenge that has to be taken in 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.780
 A consideration that you miss playing 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.250
