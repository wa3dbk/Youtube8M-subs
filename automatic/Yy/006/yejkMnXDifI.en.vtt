mission<00:00:14.160> both<00:00:14.580> identical<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.450> they're<00:00:15.750> both

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
mission both identical and they're both

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.410 
mission both identical and they're both
comprehensive<00:00:16.770> proof<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.850> you'd<00:00:18.060> have<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.390> be

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
comprehensive proof so you'd have to be

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.560 
comprehensive proof so you'd have to be
absolutely<00:00:19.100> in<00:00:20.100> my<00:00:20.250> opinion<00:00:20.430> crazy<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.240> ignore

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
absolutely in my opinion crazy to ignore

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.519 
absolutely in my opinion crazy to ignore
this<00:00:21.720> because<00:00:22.619> comprehensive<00:00:23.340> proof<00:00:23.519> cars

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
this because comprehensive proof cars

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.259 
this because comprehensive proof cars
crash<00:00:25.529> proof<00:00:25.830> fire<00:00:26.220> proof<00:00:26.550> bulletproof<00:00:26.820> and

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
crash proof fire proof bulletproof and

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.380 
crash proof fire proof bulletproof and
explosion<00:00:27.779> proof<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.429> also<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> obtain<00:00:30.060> both

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
explosion proof and also to obtain both

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.200 
explosion proof and also to obtain both
of<00:00:30.599> them<00:00:30.779> because<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.410> can<00:00:31.529> obtain<00:00:31.710> two<00:00:32.210> you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
of them because you can obtain two you

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.729 
of them because you can obtain two you
have<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.390> actually<00:00:33.600> pass<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.200> mission<00:00:34.530> so

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
have to actually pass the mission so

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.010 
have to actually pass the mission so
value<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:36.000> check<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.420> video<00:00:36.660> response

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
value just check the video response

00:00:37.020 --> 00:01:59.520 
value just check the video response
because<00:00:37.469> past<00:00:38.250> mission<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.700> get<00:00:38.790> two<00:00:39.000> cars

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.830 

yeah<00:02:00.530> well<00:02:00.799> to<00:02:01.159> get<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:01.700> two<00:02:01.909> cars<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.659> mean<00:02:02.810> a

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
yeah well to get the two cars I mean a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.690 
yeah well to get the two cars I mean a
slightly<00:02:03.259> tricky<00:02:03.829> because<00:02:04.039> you<00:02:04.189> have<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.549> UM

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
slightly tricky because you have to UM

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.219 
slightly tricky because you have to UM
ditch<00:02:05.090> them<00:02:05.299> in<00:02:05.359> the<00:02:05.479> water<00:02:05.689> and<00:02:05.959> there's<00:02:06.170> a

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
ditch them in the water and there's a

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.990 
ditch them in the water and there's a
risk<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.590> drowning<00:02:06.829> but<00:02:07.729> for<00:02:07.939> the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
risk of drowning but for the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.999 
risk of drowning but for the
comprehensive<00:02:08.660> proof<00:02:08.869> nasai<00:02:09.289> I<00:02:09.530> would<00:02:09.769> really

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
comprehensive proof nasai I would really

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.500 
comprehensive proof nasai I would really
recommend<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.729> since<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.090> have<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.269> pass<00:02:11.480> a

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
recommend it since you have to pass a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.690 
recommend it since you have to pass a
mission<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.049> get<00:02:12.170> both<00:02:12.349> of<00:02:12.590> them<00:02:12.709> if<00:02:13.519> you've

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
mission to get both of them if you've

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.220 
mission to get both of them if you've
obtained<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.239> helicopter<00:02:14.780> then<00:02:14.870> you've<00:02:15.049> done

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
obtained the helicopter then you've done

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.960 
obtained the helicopter then you've done
you<00:02:15.560> know<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.860> tough<00:02:16.099> part<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.579> mean<00:02:16.819> this<00:02:16.910> is

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
you know the tough part I mean this is

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:24.509 
you know the tough part I mean this is
easy<00:02:17.599> compared<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.380> helicopter<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.880> um

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.890 

yeah<00:02:25.519> I<00:02:25.549> normally<00:02:25.970> can't<00:02:26.209> be<00:02:26.329> bothered<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.690> get

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
yeah I normally can't be bothered to get

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.740 
yeah I normally can't be bothered to get
back<00:02:27.230> up<00:02:27.470> because<00:02:27.860> it's<00:02:28.040> just<00:02:28.160> um<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:29.120> know<00:02:29.269> so

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
back up because it's just um you know so

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.319 
back up because it's just um you know so
much<00:02:29.810> quicker<00:02:30.110> just<00:02:30.379> not<00:02:30.620> getting<00:02:31.069> it<00:02:31.280> I

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.759 

normally<00:02:38.329> just<00:02:38.450> do<00:02:38.720> this<00:02:38.840> unique<00:02:39.230> jump<00:02:39.500> here

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
normally just do this unique jump here

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.620 
normally just do this unique jump here
though<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.160> I'll<00:02:40.549> go<00:02:40.819> over<00:02:40.850> all<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.420> unique

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
though I I'll go over all the unique

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:54.809 
though I I'll go over all the unique
jumps<00:02:42.049> that<00:02:42.170> worries<00:02:42.590> us<00:02:45.220> great

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.670 

right<00:02:55.819> I<00:02:56.000> don't<00:02:56.240> care<00:02:56.390> past<00:02:57.020> smoking<00:02:57.590> i'm

right I don't care past smoking i'm
going<00:02:57.950> over<00:03:06.010> it's<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:07.430> much<00:03:07.459> quicker

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
going over it's just so much quicker

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:15.780 
going over it's just so much quicker

and<00:04:26.590> poor<00:04:26.860> time<00:04:27.130> I<00:04:27.160> think<00:04:31.800> now<00:04:32.800> it's<00:04:33.010> good<00:04:33.190> to

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
and poor time I think now it's good to

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.659 
and poor time I think now it's good to
the<00:04:33.460> other<00:04:33.580> car<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:36.240> fish<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:37.479> slightly<00:04:38.669> do

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
the other car and fish it slightly do

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.129 
the other car and fish it slightly do
