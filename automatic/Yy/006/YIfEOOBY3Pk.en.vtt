00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 i 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.610
 and how about youtube friends welcome to 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.400
 this new video in this video I'm going to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.840
 talk a little about the contents 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.050
 they should publish in gta 5 on youtube 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.019
 because here in the 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.579
 in the rotating support rotate game 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:34.670
 but this one just published a series of 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:37.489
 warning or article showing about 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.980
 what we have to upload the songs 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.290
 that they can not do this depending on 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.560
 what we went up as an example to 5 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.870
 right now I'm going to read what 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.570
 what then what is here in the 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.000
 page first they asked a question and 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.700
 the question is what can be done 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.650
 upload on youtube or another website that if 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.740
 you can use the copyrighted material 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.620
 in other fan sites if it's for use 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.410
 not commercial or does not have spoilers or 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.840
 which is what we can upload so that 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:14.530
 we get copyright and this is the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.350
 the response to rotate usually take 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.479
 two interactive is not opposed to what 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.119
 amateur who use materials to 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.920
 non- commercial uses in a way that does not 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.520
 intentionally spoils 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.069
 intentionally the plot for others 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.959
 to what he added to make our 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:35.259
 position about it is easier to 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:37.240
 understand we have compiled a list of 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.490
 the contents that in case of being 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.970
 published you will receive a notice to 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.720
 remove it 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.790
 this has divided it between three points the 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.400
 first point is about the videos of 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.410
 pre-release any publication 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.450
 related to the copies with the 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.400
 filtered copies of the game before its 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.740
 official release date will be 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.990
 erased regardless of how it 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.630
 got the game this includes also the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.909
 boxes 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.240
 the second point is about the 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.979
 spoilers then post a video that 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.080
 shows the end of the game scene 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.570
 cinematic is done well 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.030
 any other revelation in history 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.840
 it is good to show cinematic scenes 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:25.069
 as part of a draw plan 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:28.129
 or let's play let's say it like that 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.249
 a video type let's play so that you 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:34.189
 they know it but they do not show so much 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:37.099
 yes the game kinematics if you're not 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:39.200
 sure if what you want to publish is 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.200
 considered a piece of furniture, if you do not know 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.010
 that what is going to post a spoiler 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.590
 you can send an email or get in 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.150
 contact with the company defeat 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.450
 game cross star game effect through 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.909
 next mail copyright text game 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:05.030
 dotcom I repeat it again copyright 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:07.730
 oil game dotcom and there you go to 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.590
 send him what he wants to do and what 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.859
 that will publish and they will tell you 100 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.579
 if you can upload it or not the third point 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:18.500
 that stands out on the page is the train the 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:21.709
 entertainment entertainment in the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.140
 game forgiveness that is the entertainment of 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.690
 game 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.180
 things like television shows and 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.950
 big taurus comic shows 4 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.420
 or the silent movies in red dead redemption 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.550
 we prefer that the fans experience them 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.560
 within the context of the game so 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.980
 any publication of this in form 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.020
 isolated will be marked for elimination 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.640
 similarly rotate informs that 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.880
 any content that you consider 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.130
 objectionable will be deleted from the network 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.940
 Well, saying that, what I recommend 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:58.840
 is that they do not start publishing yet in 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.000
 the missions but make small ones 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.060
 play or a gameplay to explore that the 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.900
 city ​​is not doing chaos in the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.110
 city ​​killing people exploring the bush 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.050
 chiles in the depths of the sea 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.890
 among other things as long as 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.180
 publish the 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:22.460
 the casinos or the cinematic scenes 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.550
 of the game or that they reveal much 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.610
 of history and then everything would be fine 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.050
 according to what comes out here but what 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.450
 What I recommend is that they have 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:38.180
 very careful when uploading these types of 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:43.580
 videos so send an email to 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:47.120
 to copyright 20.30 l if what they are going to 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.910
 climb or be asile if it's good what they 're going 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.039
 to go up they tell him what they are going to 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.650
 upload that is what the video describes and 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.560
 that and they will tell you yes yes yes it is safe 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.910
 upload and if it does not contain spoilers 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.900
 good until it is already arrived at this 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.430
 News 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.880
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.090
 in the next video remember to leave your 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.539
 commentary 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.539
 regards
