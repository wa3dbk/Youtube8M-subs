00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello everyone as you can 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.520
 see it today it's me who do 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.460
 mourning because my brother is not 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.130
 there he has a school trip or both 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.559
 savoie and so I'm going to film 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.509
 so that's why I do not come 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.830
 represent a magic trick because 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.869
 that would be completely good 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.060
 to smoke alone because I'm not 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.789
 very good but tomorrow is so I'm going 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.910
 rather present you a card game 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.769
 that was I talked about a performs 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.710
 so that's what I had to do 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.210
 I hope you enjoy it and 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.210
 let's go to the cards 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.730
 so first of all the study of the game with 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.040
 the written but what obviously the 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.559
 territory of the united states with the 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.260
 flag etc the series and so it's red 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.460
 white and blue series one 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.190
 as you can see my action does not 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.760
 still has not improved here the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.900
 slices of the holster so again with the 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:12.250
 saliva and on the back of the holster for 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:21.430
 find both of the cards now 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:25.990
 let's open so first we can see 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:29.080
 on the ends of the card that there is 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.320
 very beautiful gilded flourishes for his 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.880
 very pretty and otherwise the map is rather 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.110
 standard is rather that of watches 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.360
 sitl so with the symbol bicycle me that 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.289
 makes me think of an angel a bit on a 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.830
 bike here and all that and of course 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.830
 horizon 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.580
 the two cheeks she represents for 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.050
 me the two most famous symbols 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:03.630
 united states that are none other than 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.630
 culture of freedom and uncle sam 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.200
 after as each bicycle card the ace of 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.540
 spades has a small difference so 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.810
 here is the territory of the states 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.980
 United 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.850
 like the nights with the flag and he 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.940
 know we can see there the series so 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.980
 rolled of white and blue and made in 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.170
 usl i what for those who do not know 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.370
 6 hearts hearts cards are made 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.310
 in the United States it is rather a 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.959
 everything comes from the dog almost 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.000
 we can see that there are two cards 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.690
 faked indeed he if he is a 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.940
 majority of ce2 the tile with two of 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.069
 traitors and if that's one of the axes a 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.900
 majority of two of 13 with ace of 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.790
 tile 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.590
 so why not that's why not 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.209
 to have faked cards the problem 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.769
 it's then if I ever found a 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.870
 turn with his two cards you do not 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.000
 can not realize the one where before 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.950
 that I do not buy there is this package so I 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.560
 do not know if I will try to search 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.690
 a whole thing then so that's it 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.970
 just the originals between you show 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:25.230
 that they lead ace of diamonds and a 2 2 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:27.209
 normal clovers here the king of hearts so 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.319
 there you wonder why I 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:34.980
 watch guillaume simply you say here 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.920
 it's that little symbol there so that's 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.590
 the sign of the yankees that were created 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.590
 late nineteenth century early XXth century 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.950
 this is the minute culture and 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.120
 now it has been 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.760
 price often you see people the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.480
 just like that on who take the pose 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.629
 like that when we take a picture and 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.209
 so basically it's yankees and 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.790
 I think it's too cute to have but it 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.730
 on seven specific cases about what I'm showing 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.739
 this game of card games will find 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.170
 that he is very original and you want 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.160
 make you react 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.830
 then we can see the last 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.620
 particularity that the cards that are 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.660
 supposed to be black are actually blue 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.239
 even blue ones who almost shoot towards the 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.760
 electric blue so the gap holding its 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.220
 spades and clovers and balla they are of 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.910
 blue color here I do not know if 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.760
 we see well and against the cards 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.520
 reds are red 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.320
 here it is, where is it for its 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.810
 presentations is right after 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.610

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.229

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.550
 do it again for two 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:56.080
