00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.160 

we've<00:00:07.460> always<00:00:07.640> had<00:00:07.850> this<00:00:08.000> like<00:00:08.059> real<00:00:08.720> desire

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
we've always had this like real desire

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.540 
we've always had this like real desire
to<00:00:09.590> give<00:00:10.370> people<00:00:10.640> some<00:00:11.059> musical<00:00:12.160> control

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.550 
to give people some musical control

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.460 
to give people some musical control
I<00:00:13.580> think<00:00:14.000> the<00:00:14.060> guitar<00:00:14.330> solo<00:00:14.600> feature<00:00:15.080> that

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
I think the guitar solo feature that

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.740 
I think the guitar solo feature that
we're<00:00:15.650> working<00:00:15.770> on<00:00:16.129> is<00:00:16.519> the<00:00:16.789> pinnacle<00:00:17.240> of<00:00:17.570> the

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
we're working on is the pinnacle of the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.940 
we're working on is the pinnacle of the
fantasy

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.590

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
I was working on this stuff at the time

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.580 
I was working on this stuff at the time
it<00:00:25.750> was<00:00:25.840> like<00:00:25.870> oh<00:00:26.080> this<00:00:26.200> would<00:00:26.320> be<00:00:26.350> a<00:00:26.410> neat

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
it was like oh this would be a neat

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.040 
it was like oh this would be a neat
thing<00:00:26.740> to<00:00:26.770> work<00:00:26.980> on

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
thing to work on

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.140 
thing to work on
oh<00:00:28.109> well<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.310> freestyle<00:00:29.670> guitar<00:00:29.939> solo

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150

feature

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.270 

we<00:00:37.750> really<00:00:38.110> wanted<00:00:38.320> to<00:00:38.410> make<00:00:38.530> a<00:00:38.920> new<00:00:39.070> rock<00:00:39.250> band

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
we really wanted to make a new rock band

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.100 
we really wanted to make a new rock band
if<00:00:39.730> we<00:00:39.910> could<00:00:40.030> have<00:00:40.210> something<00:00:40.540> new<00:00:40.870> to<00:00:41.079> offer

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
if we could have something new to offer

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.400 
if we could have something new to offer
you<00:00:41.829> know<00:00:41.950> and<00:00:42.489> we<00:00:42.970> think<00:00:43.210> that<00:00:43.270> we<00:00:44.230> have<00:00:44.379> a

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
you know and we think that we have a

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.660 
you know and we think that we have a
bunch<00:00:44.650> of<00:00:44.739> features<00:00:44.890> in<00:00:45.160> the<00:00:45.250> game<00:00:45.370> which<00:00:45.579> we

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
bunch of features in the game which we

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.580 
bunch of features in the game which we
think<00:00:45.850> are<00:00:46.030> pushing<00:00:46.780> in<00:00:46.840> that<00:00:46.900> direction<00:00:46.989> and

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
think are pushing in that direction and

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.380 
think are pushing in that direction and
we<00:00:47.650> think<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.010> guitar<00:00:48.280> solo<00:00:48.489> feature<00:00:48.730> is<00:00:48.940> one

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
we think the guitar solo feature is one

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.390 
we think the guitar solo feature is one
of<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.629> strong<00:00:49.900> ones<00:00:50.110> about<00:00:50.680> a<00:00:50.739> year<00:00:51.040> ago<00:00:51.129> when

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
of the strong ones about a year ago when

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.390 
of the strong ones about a year ago when
we<00:00:51.430> first<00:00:51.820> decided<00:00:52.180> to<00:00:52.570> go<00:00:52.780> back<00:00:53.019> at<00:00:53.260> Rock<00:00:53.440> Alex

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
we first decided to go back at Rock Alex

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.119 
we first decided to go back at Rock Alex

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
asked Eric and myself to go think about

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:58.979 
asked Eric and myself to go think about
what<00:00:57.430> it<00:00:57.519> would<00:00:57.610> take<00:00:57.670> to<00:00:57.850> redo<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.720> guitar

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
what it would take to redo the guitar

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.259 
what it would take to redo the guitar
solo<00:00:59.440> feature<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.250> we've<00:01:00.400> been<00:01:00.489> talking

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.730 
about for really 10 years back then it
was<00:01:04.479> sort<00:01:04.600> of<00:01:04.629> like<00:01:04.720> exploring<00:01:05.320> it's<00:01:05.440> like<00:01:05.560> oh

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
was sort of like exploring it's like oh

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.080 
was sort of like exploring it's like oh
what<00:01:06.070> happens<00:01:06.340> if<00:01:06.400> I<00:01:06.460> do<00:01:06.520> this<00:01:06.700> what<00:01:07.060> happens

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.450 
satisfying interactions real musicians
they<00:01:13.600> start<00:01:13.869> just<00:01:14.110> learning<00:01:14.560> you<00:01:15.070> know<00:01:15.310> what

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
they start just learning you know what

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.279

find their own voice for me it's
definitely<00:01:21.190> like<00:01:21.490> a<00:01:21.520> wish-fulfilling<00:01:22.000> thing

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
definitely like a wish-fulfilling thing

player and a very mediocre guitar player
you<00:01:27.759> know<00:01:27.850> I<00:01:27.880> could<00:01:28.090> never<00:01:28.360> play<00:01:28.660> at<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.899> level

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
you know I could never play at the level

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.779 
you know I could never play at the level
that<00:01:29.380> this<00:01:29.530> thing<00:01:29.740> of<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:30.160> know<00:01:30.220> allows<00:01:30.759> you

that this thing of you know allows you

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.210 
that this thing of you know allows you
to<00:01:31.119> play<00:01:31.630> at<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.289> I<00:01:32.320> think<00:01:32.619> that<00:01:32.800> this<00:01:32.979> future

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
to play at and I think that this future

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.540 
to play at and I think that this future
sort<00:01:33.729> of<00:01:34.440> shows<00:01:35.440> that<00:01:35.619> right<00:01:35.770> in<00:01:35.890> your<00:01:35.979> face<00:01:36.190> I

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
sort of shows that right in your face I

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.310 
sort of shows that right in your face I
just<00:01:37.210> look<00:01:37.330> forward<00:01:37.539> to<00:01:37.630> cranking<00:01:38.080> it<00:01:38.200> up

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
just look forward to cranking it up

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.990 
just look forward to cranking it up
because<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:38.860> know<00:01:39.039> it<00:01:39.310> really<00:01:39.429> gives<00:01:39.729> me<00:01:39.820> this

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
because you know it really gives me this

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.730 
because you know it really gives me this
superpower<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:40.780> I<00:01:40.840> would<00:01:41.140> never<00:01:41.319> never

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
superpower that I would never never

those like stinging notes coming out and
flying<00:02:38.790> around<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.239> fretboard<00:02:39.420> really

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
flying around the fretboard really

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.740 
flying around the fretboard really
quickly<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.340> feels<00:02:41.610> amazing<00:02:41.910> it's<00:02:42.480> one<00:02:42.660> of

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
quickly and it feels amazing it's one of

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.330 
quickly and it feels amazing it's one of
those<00:02:42.840> things<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.530> seems<00:02:43.830> like<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.069> pipe

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
those things that seems like a pipe

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.820 
those things that seems like a pipe
dream<00:02:44.519> like<00:02:44.940> if<00:02:45.330> he<00:02:45.510> told<00:02:45.780> me<00:02:45.959> before<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.349> saw

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
dream like if he told me before I saw

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.670 
dream like if he told me before I saw
the<00:02:47.190> initial<00:02:47.519> prototype<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:49.380> wanted<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
the initial prototype that you wanted to

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.710 
the initial prototype that you wanted to
add<00:02:49.830> this<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.040> rock<00:02:50.340> band<00:02:50.550> 4<00:02:50.849> I<00:02:51.120> would<00:02:51.630> have

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
add this to rock band 4 I would have

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.780 
add this to rock band 4 I would have
said<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.260> know<00:02:52.290> that's<00:02:52.560> that's<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.580> cool<00:02:53.760> idea

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
said you know that's that's a cool idea

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:06.290 
said you know that's that's a cool idea
I<00:02:54.180> don't<00:02:55.110> see<00:02:55.739> how<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.980> really<00:02:56.130> works

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.060 

we<00:03:06.810> did<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.020> bunch<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.440> stuff<00:03:07.650> over<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.010> last

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
we did a bunch of stuff over the last

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.740 
we did a bunch of stuff over the last
few<00:03:08.460> years<00:03:08.490> where<00:03:08.850> that<00:03:09.000> was<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.270> first<00:03:09.510> time

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
few years where that was the first time

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.480 
few years where that was the first time
we<00:03:09.900> put<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.110> lot<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.500> effort<00:03:10.800> into<00:03:10.950> trying<00:03:11.370> to

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
we put a lot of effort into trying to

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.690 
we put a lot of effort into trying to
unlock<00:03:12.150> player<00:03:12.920> creativity<00:03:13.920> basically<00:03:14.610> we've

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
unlock player creativity basically we've

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.600 
unlock player creativity basically we've
created<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.450> whole<00:03:15.860> audio<00:03:16.860> playback<00:03:17.130> system

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
created a whole audio playback system

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.910 
created a whole audio playback system
that<00:03:18.120> once<00:03:18.510> we<00:03:18.630> had<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.810> were<00:03:19.200> like<00:03:19.350> oh<00:03:19.530> well

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
that once we had that were like oh well

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.740 
that once we had that were like oh well
now<00:03:20.040> we<00:03:20.100> can<00:03:20.310> do<00:03:20.430> this<00:03:20.550> thing<00:03:20.730> with<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.600> we

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
now we can do this thing with it and we

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.750 
now we can do this thing with it and we
just<00:03:21.780> started<00:03:22.200> working<00:03:22.410> on<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.760> prototype

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
just started working on a prototype

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.850 
just started working on a prototype
that's<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.270> think<00:03:24.330> very<00:03:24.720> true<00:03:25.020> to<00:03:25.320> what<00:03:25.590> the

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
that's I think very true to what the

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.120 

well<00:03:45.660> there's<00:03:45.870> an<00:03:45.960> unlimited<00:03:46.170> number<00:03:46.590> of

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.480 

grid<00:03:55.260> we<00:03:56.130> can<00:03:56.160> get<00:03:56.490> a<00:03:56.520> huge<00:03:57.030> variety<00:03:57.300> of<00:03:58.490> very

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
grid we can get a huge variety of very

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:05.010 
grid we can get a huge variety of very
realistic

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.530

the kind of technique behind what we're

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.410 
the kind of technique behind what we're
doing<00:04:07.840> sort<00:04:08.110> of<00:04:08.230> is<00:04:08.950> this<00:04:09.130> mixture<00:04:09.490> of<00:04:09.790> stuff

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
doing sort of is this mixture of stuff

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.120 
doing sort of is this mixture of stuff
where<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.720> system<00:04:11.050> kind<00:04:11.200> of<00:04:11.290> helps<00:04:11.590> push

where the system kind of helps push

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.060 
where the system kind of helps push
along<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:13.630> helps<00:04:13.870> things<00:04:14.140> sound<00:04:14.350> good<00:04:14.590> think

still<00:04:23.530> gameplay<00:04:23.980> gives<00:04:24.310> you<00:04:24.400> prompts<00:04:24.910> but<00:04:25.120> you

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
still gameplay gives you prompts but you

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.360 
still gameplay gives you prompts but you
have<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.750> lot<00:04:25.900> of<00:04:26.020> freedom<00:04:26.230> within<00:04:26.530> that<00:04:26.920> to

kind of like take it whatever direction
you<00:04:29.410> want<00:04:29.650> we<00:04:30.340> often<00:04:30.610> forget<00:04:30.840> how<00:04:31.840> complicated

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
you want we often forget how complicated

you want we often forget how complicated
thing<00:04:33.190> is<00:04:33.280> really<00:04:33.460> AR<00:04:33.790> we<00:04:34.120> get<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.450> point

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
thing is really AR we get to the point

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.330 
thing is really AR we get to the point
where<00:04:34.750> like<00:04:34.780> we<00:04:35.350> think<00:04:35.590> all<00:04:35.770> of<00:04:35.800> this<00:04:36.010> stuff<00:04:36.190> is

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
where like we think all of this stuff is

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.010 
where like we think all of this stuff is
simple<00:04:36.700> and<00:04:36.910> we're<00:04:37.030> like<00:04:37.180> oh<00:04:37.300> wait<00:04:37.510> it's<00:04:37.780> based

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
simple and we're like oh wait it's based

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.080 
simple and we're like oh wait it's based
on<00:04:38.200> this<00:04:38.410> base<00:04:38.620> of<00:04:38.800> knowledge<00:04:38.950> that<00:04:39.460> we've

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
on this base of knowledge that we've

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.450 
on this base of knowledge that we've
taken<00:04:40.750> us<00:04:41.020> our<00:04:41.320> lifetimes<00:04:41.770> to<00:04:42.010> build<00:04:42.190> up<00:04:42.370> I

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
taken us our lifetimes to build up I

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.560 
taken us our lifetimes to build up I
think<00:04:42.670> we're<00:04:42.760> at<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:42.910> point<00:04:43.090> here<00:04:43.390> in<00:04:43.480> the

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
think we're at the point here in the

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.020 
think we're at the point here in the
studio<00:04:43.930> where<00:04:44.550> anybody<00:04:45.550> who's<00:04:45.700> playing<00:04:45.940> rock

studio where anybody who's playing rock

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.270 
studio where anybody who's playing rock
bands<00:04:46.480> like<00:04:46.810> no<00:04:47.200> one<00:04:47.380> is<00:04:47.500> like<00:04:47.680> pining<00:04:48.100> for<00:04:48.130> the

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
bands like no one is like pining for the

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.860 
bands like no one is like pining for the
day<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:48.700> know<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:48.880> old<00:04:49.060> days<00:04:49.150> when<00:04:49.600> we<00:04:49.720> had<00:04:49.840> to

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
it's pretty hard to sound bad if you

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.800 
it's pretty hard to sound bad if you
just<00:05:11.220> spam<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.520> buttons<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.240> input<00:05:12.660> eighth

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
it sounds pretty awesome like you end up

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.590 
it sounds pretty awesome like you end up
really<00:05:16.410> like<00:05:16.680> moving<00:05:16.920> around<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.670> having<00:05:18.510> a

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
really like moving around and having a

really like moving around and having a
really<00:05:18.750> good<00:05:18.900> time<00:05:19.080> with<00:05:19.260> it

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
really good time with it

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.450 
really good time with it
maybe<00:05:19.770> you<00:05:19.860> don't<00:05:20.010> understand<00:05:20.370> exactly

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
maybe you don't understand exactly

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.920 
maybe you don't understand exactly
what's<00:05:20.850> going<00:05:21.000> on<00:05:21.180> but<00:05:21.390> it<00:05:21.480> sounds<00:05:21.750> really

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
what's going on but it sounds really

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.080 
what's going on but it sounds really
cool<00:05:22.230> it's<00:05:22.650> more<00:05:22.890> fun<00:05:23.160> because<00:05:23.460> there's<00:05:23.910> less

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
cool it's more fun because there's less

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.630 
cool it's more fun because there's less
risk<00:05:24.420> and<00:05:25.080> I<00:05:25.200> think<00:05:25.410> this<00:05:25.560> is<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.740> good

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
risk and I think this is a good

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.050 
risk and I think this is a good
demonstration<00:05:26.820> of<00:05:27.450> one<00:05:27.750> you<00:05:28.740> know<00:05:28.860> one<00:05:29.340> solid

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
demonstration of one you know one solid

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.760 
demonstration of one you know one solid
idea<00:05:30.420> about<00:05:30.660> like<00:05:30.870> where<00:05:31.110> you<00:05:31.290> might<00:05:31.470> take

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
idea about like where you might take

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.490 
idea about like where you might take
music<00:05:31.950> gaming
