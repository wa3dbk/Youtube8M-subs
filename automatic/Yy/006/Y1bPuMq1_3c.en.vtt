00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello girls how are you today I come with a 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.970
 video that took a long time 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.429
 wanting to do but I did not get to it 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.080
 I did not decide and I finally collected all 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.639
 the information and all the products that 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.469
 I use and I want to teach you what 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.440
 I use at night in my routine 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.539
 night especially focusing on what is 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.400
 skin care and cleaning os 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.410
 I will tell first what is a little 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.109
 of history about my skin I had the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.869
 skin a year and a half ago two had the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.760
 mixed skin with tendency to fat always 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.309
 with brightness especially in the area by 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.320
 here around here also good you know what 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.450
 It is a greasy skin with many pimples 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.980
 here as everywhere more or 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.829
 I do not know if it's a winter 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.190
 that I do not take care of my skin and in that 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.129
 I was dehydrated 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.719
 very much and it has not become so fat 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.520
 as it was before but yes I have to 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.379
 deal very much the dehydration of the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.960
 skin that is not as if I had skin 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.969
 dry I keep having the skin with tendency 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.219
 to acne and if I put products that do not 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.660
 they work for me, they immediately come out 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.730
 so I have to be very careful 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.080
 with those very soft products that I do not 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.450
 irritate also 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.190
 tendency to redness but I need a lot 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.410
 hydration not nutrition because that's 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.120
 more going to the dry skins and what I 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.070
 It happens that the skin escapes a lot 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.140
 especially here on the forehead or here 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.240
 on the sides of the nose with the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.660
 makeup is very noticeable so 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.490
 Well, it is something that has to be dealt with and 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.070
 you have to worry about the skin and they are 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.720
 five minutes that is only for 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.460
 Alarte the street and put two little things 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.040
 so I'll explain it to you and it seems 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.440
 much slower but in reality it is 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.900
 very fast so I recommend you 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.850
 every day five minutes is nothing 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.010
 it's a time for you that I 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.350
 you take that you are going to have the skin 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.660
 rested you are going to leave relaxed 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.820
 even though I get very tired I know that 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.680
 after this I know that after doing 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.050
 this little routine and make me my 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.790
 masahito and make me like that I'm going to feel 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.340
 much better with me I will feel 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.280
 clean the skin well and I will feel 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.450
 better so I recommend 100% that 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.479
 try even if you think you do not have 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.520
 time is five minutes at night 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.390
 just before sleeping until the pies and 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.819
 ready 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.410
 and much better what I do is a 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.180
 double cleaning first I take off the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.459
 makeup and then I clean the skin in 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.840
 depth so it's clean because 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.790
 if not yes we just remove the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.000
 make up because there is always some 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.350
 rest and the skin is like it has not 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.120
 then cleaned the product that 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.090
 let's say later to moisturize or to 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.470
 nourish or for whatever your need 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.630
 Well it will not penetrate so much into the skin 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.489
 start removing make-up with this product 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.320
 of the honey that is micellar water and that 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.900
 surely you have heard many, many 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.300
 recommendations from him and it's simply 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.550
 a water that removes makeup very well not 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.930
 it irritates me at all eyes as you see 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.540
 I put it on a cotton disk and 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.300
 I just keep it pressed in the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.920
 eye then it is only to remove it the 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.390
 On the other side of the disc, it happens a bit 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.310
 in the face to withdraw also the 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.160
 rest of makeup that the truth is that 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.170
 at night and I did not stay long 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.970
 immediately went to soap my face 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.489
 to cleanse my skin well without the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.160
 makeup and for this he used this 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.320
 hostage cited hostage 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.630
 of roses in you folk and clean single is 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.910
 simply a gel is very very soft with 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.670
 the skin and it is that it has rose water and 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.530
 aloe vera that I'm starting to put a 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.350
 little bit of aloe vera that is very very 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.300
 moisturizer on the skin is a soap that 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.000
 He really likes it and has no parabens 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.420
 of sulfates or mineral oils nor 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.420
 fragrances or synthetic things or anything 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.250
 that can be taken out that is going to 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.140
 irritate the skin as I tell you very very 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.360
 soft very very good once I have the 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.640
 well cleansed skin step to the tonic and the 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.740
 tonic that I use is pixie is the 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.170
 tonic balloon which is a recommendation of 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.210
 a dermatologist and it's very very good 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.400
 also this good as you see I've already 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.230
 around here but I bought it like in October 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.980
 or so last year has no alcohol 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.270
 to begin with I invite you like the plague 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.940
 then this one has aloe vera 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.100
 one more time and ginseng that oxygenates the 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.750
 aloe vera skin what you have is acid 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.060
 hyaluronic that what it does is that 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.830
 cells retain all the water they can 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.380
 and so do not get dehydrated with so much 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.850
 ease but they hold water another 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.050
 element that has this tonic is 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.120
 as well 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.000
 and glycolic acid which is an exfoliant 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.239
 very soft is not like this other kind of 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.790
 students that with beats with little things 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.860
 that scratch our skin, let's say 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.960
 it is like that but it is therefore a liquid 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.470
 that you do not notice anything sometimes you can notice 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.990
 a little tingling but only a 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.270
 Tickling is not irritation or itches or 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.550
 nothing like that and this what he does is 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.590
 that removes dead cells 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.960
 once toned and cleaned my 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.150
 skin step to be or is a step is super 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.490
 important to me this product has been 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.790
 very very important and is already a little bit 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.340
 the last ones and is declarant elvis serum 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.950
 intensive anti its af 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.510
 Multi moisturizer is a serum whose 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.580
 element one of the elements 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.080
 main is once again the acid 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.570
 hyaluronic in addition to others that the 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.130
 I really do not know how to say but well I notice 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.260
 that hydrates a lot this 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.450
 has truly made a great 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.870
 difference of the dehydration 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:11.120
 skin and I love after this one being 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.830
 a super moisturizer the next step if 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.600
 you need it if you see that your skin 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.420
 I ask you it would be 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.180
 I do not use moisturizer cream 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.150
 moisturizing because I do not like them I see them 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:27.290
 I do not know, I'm not convinced 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:29.690
 moisturizer are pasty and I see that 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.460
 with the serum it works a lot better 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.860
 the hydration of living and the state is 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.070
 much better than with a column 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.380
 cream so I do not usually put me cream I 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.770
 started to use lately this 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.560
 product of which is the aroma water is 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.620
 another toner or others call it that but it's 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.470
 good as if it were a tonic but it is 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.420
 as for me it's like a final step of a 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.750
 little bit of hydration also because it's a 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.880
 water is moisturizing is making a 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.060
 oil has no oil has water of 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.150
 roses and lavender and once this is done 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.590
 I'm ready to go to bed like that 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.410
