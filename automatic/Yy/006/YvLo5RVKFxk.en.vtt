project was to Hydra blast the asphalt

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.660 
project was to Hydra blast the asphalt
off<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> road<00:00:37.079> but<00:00:37.739> at<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> time<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.489> didn't

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
off the road but at the time we didn't

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.369 
off the road but at the time we didn't
have<00:00:38.730> any<00:00:39.000> equipment<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> United<00:00:40.050> States

services there out of Pennsylvania and

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.400 
services there out of Pennsylvania and
we<00:00:50.670> talked<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.030> them<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.719> felt<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.140> that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
we talked to them they felt like that

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.740 
we talked to them they felt like that
with<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.340> equipment<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.760> they<00:00:54.000> are<00:00:54.180> used<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
with the equipment that they are used to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.549 
with the equipment that they are used to
take<00:00:55.020> rubber<00:00:55.649> off<00:00:56.270> runways<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.480> airports<00:00:58.050> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
take rubber off runways at airports that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.579 
take rubber off runways at airports that
they<00:00:58.710> should<00:00:59.219> be<00:00:59.340> able<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.670> do<00:00:59.820> this<00:00:59.969> process

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.260 

the<00:01:04.589> first<00:01:04.769> test<00:01:05.100> section<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.610> did<00:01:05.820> was<00:01:06.119> on

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the first test section we did was on

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.240 
the first test section we did was on
concrete<00:01:06.689> pavement<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.470> did<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.920> really<00:01:08.070> great

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
concrete pavement I did a really great

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.730 
concrete pavement I did a really great
job<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.820> us<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.119> removes<00:01:09.450> hot<00:01:09.930> mix<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.500> had

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
job for us it removes hot mix that had

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.130 
job for us it removes hot mix that had
fallen<00:01:11.430> out<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.939> whole<00:01:12.240> truck<00:01:12.570> that

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
fallen out of a whole truck that

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.469 
fallen out of a whole truck that
improves<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.740> friction<00:01:14.220> quite<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> bit<00:01:15.210> on

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
improves the friction quite a bit on

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.210 
improves the friction quite a bit on
that<00:01:15.659> roadway<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.439> that's<00:01:17.009> another

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
that roadway so that's another

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.670 
that roadway so that's another
application<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.479> as<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.530> have

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
application for this as to if you have

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.770 
application for this as to if you have
something<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.070> concrete<00:01:20.520> pavement<00:01:21.060> if<00:01:21.659> you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
something on concrete pavement if you

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.749 
something on concrete pavement if you
need<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.140> removed<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.860> won't<00:01:23.009> cut<00:01:23.220> into<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
need to be removed it won't cut into the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.789 
need to be removed it won't cut into the
concrete<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.420> rough<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> actual<00:01:25.560> surface

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
concrete and rough in the actual surface

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.330 
concrete and rough in the actual surface
of<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.220> concrete<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.360> will<00:01:27.509> remove

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
of the concrete but it will remove

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.090 
of the concrete but it will remove
material<00:01:29.340> from<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.700> concrete

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.539 

today<00:01:35.100> we're<00:01:35.929> removing<00:01:36.929> excess<00:01:37.560> asphalt<00:01:38.159> from

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
today we're removing excess asphalt from

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.539 
today we're removing excess asphalt from
a<00:01:38.850> silk<00:01:39.179> oh<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.929> flush<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:41.070> Chilcote

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
a silk oh that is flush this Chilcote

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.789 
a silk oh that is flush this Chilcote
was<00:01:41.700> placed<00:01:41.969> last<00:01:42.360> summer<00:01:42.719> at<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> end<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
was placed last summer at the end of the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.520 
was placed last summer at the end of the
summer<00:01:44.039> and<00:01:44.399> soon<00:01:44.759> afterwards<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.780> asphalt

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
summer and soon afterwards the asphalt

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.580 
summer and soon afterwards the asphalt
flush<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.789> will<00:01:48.149> pass<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.319> what<00:01:49.469> we're

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
flush in the will pass and so what we're

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.410 
flush in the will pass and so what we're
doing<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:50.100> we're<00:01:50.280> cutting<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.640> two<00:01:50.819> foot<00:01:51.060> strip

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
doing is we're cutting a two foot strip

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.469 
doing is we're cutting a two foot strip
in<00:01:51.960> each<00:01:52.229> wheel<00:01:52.500> path<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.100> remove<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:54.030> excess

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
in each wheel path to remove the excess

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.179 
in each wheel path to remove the excess
asphalt<00:01:56.840> there's<00:01:57.840> several<00:01:58.649> different<00:01:58.799> ways

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
asphalt there's several different ways

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.600 
asphalt there's several different ways
that<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.759> treat<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.360> flush<00:02:01.259> sealcoat<00:02:01.920> you

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that you can treat a flush sealcoat you

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.249 
that you can treat a flush sealcoat you
can<00:02:02.759> try<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.939> strip<00:02:03.270> see<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.509> again<00:02:03.810> but

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
can try to strip see you again but

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.080 
can try to strip see you again but
you're<00:02:04.979> not<00:02:05.069> always<00:02:05.250> guaranteed<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.939> will

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
you're not always guaranteed that will

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.639 
you're not always guaranteed that will
work<00:02:06.299> because<00:02:06.599> you're<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:07.500> putting

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
work because you're just putting

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.979 
work because you're just putting
additional<00:02:08.280> asphalt<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.810> real

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
additional asphalt on and it's real

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.500 
additional asphalt on and it's real
finicky<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:11.220> could<00:02:11.370> also<00:02:11.549> level<00:02:12.209> up<00:02:12.329> with

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
finicky you could also level up with

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.750 
finicky you could also level up with
continents<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:13.920> if<00:02:14.130> you've<00:02:14.250> got<00:02:14.430> too<00:02:14.610> much

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
continents but if you've got too much

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.339 
continents but if you've got too much
underlying<00:02:15.299> asphalt<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.989> will<00:02:16.079> come<00:02:16.230> up

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
underlying asphalt it will come up

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.960 
underlying asphalt it will come up
through<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.650> hot<00:02:16.799> mix<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.250> cause<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.760> rust

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
through the hot mix and cause it to rust

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.729 
through the hot mix and cause it to rust
there's<00:02:18.480> several<00:02:18.810> different<00:02:18.930> treatments<00:02:19.620> we

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
there's several different treatments we

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.289 
there's several different treatments we
can<00:02:19.769> do<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.190> are<00:02:20.280> more<00:02:20.489> expensive<00:02:20.849> and

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
can do that are more expensive and

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.199 
can do that are more expensive and
they're<00:02:22.170> not<00:02:22.290> always<00:02:22.500> guaranteed<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.970> work

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
they're not always guaranteed to work

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.240 
they're not always guaranteed to work
and<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.200> that's<00:02:25.380> why<00:02:25.530> we<00:02:25.680> were<00:02:25.799> looking<00:02:26.040> for

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
and so that's why we were looking for

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.030 
and so that's why we were looking for
something<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.819> didn't<00:02:27.090> add<00:02:27.299> additional

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
something that didn't add additional

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.490 
something that didn't add additional
asphalt<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.250> roadway<00:02:29.630> if<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.900> fill<00:02:31.379> the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
asphalt to the roadway if you fill the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.530 
asphalt to the roadway if you fill the
surface<00:02:31.890> before<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:32.430> fairly<00:02:32.700> smooth<00:02:33.180> where

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
surface before it's fairly smooth where

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.319 
surface before it's fairly smooth where
the<00:02:33.629> asphalt<00:02:34.099> about<00:02:35.099> even<00:02:35.459> with<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.970> top<00:02:36.269> of

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
the asphalt about even with the top of

the asphalt about even with the top of
the<00:02:36.599> aggregates<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.470> now<00:02:38.130> after<00:02:38.400> this

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
the aggregates and now after this

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.390 
the aggregates and now after this
process<00:02:39.090> has<00:02:39.269> come<00:02:39.480> through<00:02:39.840> we've<00:02:40.590> cut<00:02:40.859> about

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
process has come through we've cut about

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.970 
process has come through we've cut about
half<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.120> asphalt<00:02:42.510> out<00:02:42.750> from<00:02:43.019> around<00:02:43.290> the

half the asphalt out from around the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.680 
half the asphalt out from around the
aggregate<00:02:44.519> which<00:02:44.760> should<00:02:45.000> improve<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
aggregate which should improve the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:54.940 
aggregate which should improve the
friction<00:02:46.319> characteristics<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.190> roadway

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.320 

one<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.099> reasons<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.730> we're<00:02:57.030> doing<00:02:57.150> the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
one of the reasons that we're doing the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.760 
one of the reasons that we're doing the
implementation<00:02:57.959> project<00:02:58.470> with<00:02:58.650> multiple

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
implementation project with multiple

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.510 
implementation project with multiple
test<00:02:59.310> sections<00:02:59.849> we're<00:03:00.630> also<00:03:00.860> testing<00:03:01.860> with

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
test sections we're also testing with

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.490 
test sections we're also testing with
different<00:03:02.880> instruments<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.599> measure<00:03:03.720> texture

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
different instruments to measure texture

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.440 
different instruments to measure texture
and<00:03:04.800> also<00:03:04.920> skid<00:03:05.310> resistance<00:03:05.849> of<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.090> roadway

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
and also skid resistance of the roadway

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.050 
and also skid resistance of the roadway
so<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.590> when<00:03:07.980> we<00:03:08.160> write<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.550> specification

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
so that when we write a specification

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.530 
so that when we write a specification
for<00:03:09.720> this<00:03:09.959> operation<00:03:10.440> we'll<00:03:11.340> have<00:03:11.580> some<00:03:11.970> data

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
for this operation we'll have some data

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.069 
for this operation we'll have some data
to<00:03:12.780> use<00:03:12.989> that's<00:03:13.260> not<00:03:13.410> subjective
