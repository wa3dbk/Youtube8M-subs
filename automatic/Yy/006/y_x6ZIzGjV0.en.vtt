 that the motto is 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.949

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.570
 so since Tuesday 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.039
 pt attacker 8 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:25.410
 from 15 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.829
 in the right pane has all the data here 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.429
 we found or 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.519
 in egypt of model 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.010
 today 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.010
 nothing tourist barred stolen potatoes 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.590
 by extension the banon 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.970
 so here already in the month the program is already only is to change state filled 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.900
 replaced areas by the states of the moment 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.140
 Where do you work or live? 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.770
 The name of the doctor is now the name of the same doctor crm 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.680
 and so on 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.120
 Let's go to sleep 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.620
 document we created there 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.180
 protested raw attestations 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.650
 in model mode it was 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.390
 dispensation 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.770
 so here 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.410
 the attack was 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.240
 generator with highlight the patient's name 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.330
 he was 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.729
 the avaí opened the world cup and was replaced 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.500
 by the name of the patient maintaining the healing formatting 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.230
 was also replaced 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.820
 the date in full 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.500
 the doctor's name 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.130
 my name 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.050
 I give crm's number 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.450
 I realize that the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.070
 hugo is created in the document once only 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.250
 you can use it several times without having to leave the house and cissa 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.880
 keep copying and pasting 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.590
 meirelles reiterated 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.450
 model you've already done 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.009
 here you can also add information 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.830
 tribal gets blocked 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.840
 are how many documents do you write more 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.160
 but nothing 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
 then each of each time you design a good service 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.950
 you fill in the customer's data here 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.630
 so for every 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.140
 each service date and that will generate the evolution data. 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.999
 I doubt patient here 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.999
 as pure 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.260
 irati when we will have a given at all the pleasure in will calculate the imc 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.759
 of the patient 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:26.870
 Blessed are you in the 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.969
 other normal weight 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.119
 and it was a normal weight who enters 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:32.519
 in the 2 values 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.789
 // patient's age 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:36.049
 close to complete 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.109
 heart rate the temperature then are states that 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.430
 going to be is aggravated for this patient care 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.980
 for 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.259
 evolution monitoring 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:50.759
 in fradelos also sails on the prologue 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:51.880
 by others 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.920
 models 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.549
 if you pick or group 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.559
 and get injured 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.379
 the model 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.650
 report the arena menezes and is made according to the specialty of the patient 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.010
 a differentiated gain in the system is that it maintains a profile 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.159
 so he was able to inform us as the preferred field 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.659
 then you can generate scene menezes according to your specialty 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.019
 the character of the mind may be your 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.699
 according to your skill and use it 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:25.709
 during 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.329
 of working days 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.910
 then each department every year doctor would have their 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.960
 its various types of ananias according to the pch that it will attend you 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.960
 night 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.759
 remembering that 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:44.479
 the system allows you to choose you go at the time of printing and first 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.509
 head than the footer 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:49.199
 daring and especially the text 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.199
 you always take my head up to ri ri 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.469
 to look like shaved head have set 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:56.539
 according 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:59.879
 the other video that we explained about head carried by giving a 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.749
 look later 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:04.589
 if you do not want to print 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:06.939
 means that you may already have a 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.039
 a pre-printed form 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.809
 with the footer header 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:15.009
 already to the press was then if you only need to print the same body in the 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:17.620
 document 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.599
 another thing 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.590
 enough to have this kind of document images 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.719
 you can download images on the initiative right the images of the 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:26.790
 patient 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.790
 I'll get a picture here. 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.210
 and as we are going to be like this, it will become a miniature 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.909
 here on earth 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.620
 we took three pictures 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.379
 in the others the patient then 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.009
 are available here you can go 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.330
 view the actual size at which is the pictures are so bad that it was even 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.469
 but I can imagine the high resolution 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.539
 and this pressure the whole screen 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.430
 increase by decreasing 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.430
 patient image size 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.389
 you can also avoid the patient's picture picture 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.539
 we make money to do it 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.539
 any annotation 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.080
 so there is a crisis but passes home or for this party is about 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.080
 attendance 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.809
 the referee and top of roderick images in the images that have the text behind 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:35.039
 can also be 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.180
 I sang in the export part and turkey as you view the part of the 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.509
 document 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:41.820
 in own 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.950
 the document image of the windows hitler itself and image 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.939
 I do not believe in God 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:49.939
 that our cities have not been successful in the 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:54.479
 Let's see the part of him now. 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.949
 patient return 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.990
 of 80 each 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.729
 here is a soul the little book with some date means that for each date of 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:05.619
 sakineh 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:09.189
 was made a documentation was arrested documentation for the patient 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.150
 by descending order descending 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.889
 so on the 20th 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.180
 he generated fist 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.529
 the only exam day 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:21.529
 and we think it means that it was a test 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.249
 wall is saved or not 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:28.569
 and announces as wing 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:32.419
 the recent attitude with a camera would be annoying be made 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:33.139
 images 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:34.849
 if the patient has generated 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:37.979
 The young lady is the document already and for that 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.999
 quintão because of the pain 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:46.430
 each of atp 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.319
 the group 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.399
 the document is generated 

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:52.939
 and for each group you have the information if the 1 by visually 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:56.449
 from conception this was one in the written document or 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:57.930
 a little to the image 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.289
 after noting the patient 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:04.499
 I indicate the group that includes okazaki to score highlight was a report that 

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:05.550
 was generated 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.550
 it was the medical record 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:13.710
 another differential also what system we can 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.430
 emit housekeeping traction esp sbt 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.289
 - request for hospitalization 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:21.559
 the patient 

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:23.939
 for these agents will be another day 

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:26.999
 is coming through a care they are is the case 

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:32.049
 and when you opened it to make request it will appear until the 

00:07:32.049 --> 00:07:34.669
 date of the request because it dispenses with a peak 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:36.590
 three days from the request 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.610
 then this interaction
