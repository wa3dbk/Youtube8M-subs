 the cosmos is provided with a frontier not fixed by two magnets 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.070
 becomes 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.070
 behind it hide 15 4 2 5 inch drive bays 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.520
 the reform plans in it can be removed with a single action 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.550
 and just as easily move in again 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.320
 in a dazzling Steinke 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.840
 Adapter for a smaller Volker Finke should be attached soon 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.350
 the big pictures on the lid of the cosmos are visually appealing 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.830
 and when moving and carrying almost 17 pounds heavy housing 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.520
 extremely practical 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.450
 further they are on the lid 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.610
 a rubberized shelf 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.480
 and the control panel 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.950
 attached to this panel are four usb ports 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.650
 Audio connections for microphone and headphones on

 an external sata connection 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.780
 Power and Reset are bustling as well as two states and ethics 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.760
 at the back we find to colonel two passages for the hoses 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.430
 external water cooling 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.679
 including 120-millimeter fan 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.089
 the manpower volumes

 7 fades for expansion cards 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.499
 with ventilation 12 reduced 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.229
 and so and that the designated place for Israel 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.809
 different because of the cool Master Cosmos 1000 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:27.040
 and the four tested cool Master Cottbus 1000 b 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.379
 is this side window 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.230
 it is immaculately processed and for the very beautiful the whole of its cosmos 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.919
 on 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:37.579
 but it is a bit awkward graced so since I look the rather ugly 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.889
 Drive bays very visible 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.279
 who, for example, the area of ​​the cpu-cooler in the top left half way 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:45.049
 remains hidden 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.480
 Both sides can be removed very easily and without tools 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:56.829
 then reinstall the page 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.939
 what the shutter does not always immediately 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.939
 All in all, 10 of this mount but very good 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:13.169
 what protrudes here across the case is an agreement they made nations 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.169
 graphics Cards 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:20.399
 In total, then Kosmos four housing are attached 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.029
 to discover all other times as well as two others 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.029
 we convey the heated air out of the housing inside 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.720
 The levy is so praised about this tax on the profits of the backwards 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.709
 out of the case 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.289
 another fan is mounted in the bottom plate of the cosmos 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:42.629
 her last the case from below 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.419
 the ergonomic highlight of a cool Master Cosmos for this toolless 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.419
 Devices sensation of optical drives 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:53.889
 demanding away 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.889
 Insert the drive 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:01.059
 and because the push of a button is fixed 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.269
 it can hardly be much easier 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.420
 also for the hard disks became an unusual inflation method 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.260
 Each HDD is chosen to have its own removable festival banquet 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.589
 gets 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.589
 in this the hard disk is fastened with four screws 

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:26.059
 and finally pushed in the case 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.009
 and fixed with a chair 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:35.169
 for the power supply which is to and the housing is installed 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.669
 It is a padded he and thus easily above Zionsgemeinde storage area 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.969
 intended 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:45.210
 so that would be the power supply still under housing fan suck in too much dust 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.270
 There are two dust filters on the bottom 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.270
 which can be easily removed for agreement 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.129
 continue to note positively that Fulham is the motherboard around openings 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:58.180
 are attached 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.180
 which facilitate the laying and hiding of cables 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.319
 The case fans should be lighter at full speed than Buhmann 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.319
 and so that was not unpleasant to research 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.210
 down regulated by a fan control 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.210
 they are also suitable for line operation 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.389
 the case apparently in our test, although minor weaknesses 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:26.379
 first, the tail light and second, as already mentioned 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.749
 the somewhat unfavorable positioning of the Fanfest 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:32.749
 otherwise he has to convince them completely in the case 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.280
 before the powerless processing over the beautiful design 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.240
 up to the very good Habermehl in the cultivation of Ortner this is a product of 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.779
 class 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:46.119
 the cool Master Cosmos 3000 b help us the DAX Cosima Roth 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:51.179
 at the height of the forum you will find a picture of the detailed picture gallery 

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:53.830
 another detail about these houses 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.110
 There is also a big topic there 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.160
