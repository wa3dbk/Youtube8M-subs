 hitchhiker at very difficult auction 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.310
 find it this I have the save if 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.010
 I bought a game once 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.500
 pitching for my house 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.850

 fichines to face in my house in 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.310
 my trip of roses 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.799
 no news of technology if kaka 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.280
 until a few days ago the messages 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.410
 direct on twitter could only be 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.020
 send between people who followed us 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.209
 but this changed now previous 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.280
 authorization in the configuration of your 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.860

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.860
 direct messages from any follower 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.510
 a windows has a typical blue screen 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.790
 with an error that is clearly known as the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.859
 blue screen of dead or blue screen 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.430

 new iphone 5s the ones that report this 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.030
 kind of problems if blue screen for 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.030
 the Iphone 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.109
 apparently the problem would be 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.180
 originated by using several 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.549
 applications of the world at the same time 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.159
 from the sky steve jobs should be 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:16.169
 looking quite angry, forgive them 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.169
 you see they do not know what they do 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.970

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.520

 the entire home screen is key I know 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.370
 that many did not like the 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:46.160
 mosaics can now go back to the classic 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.160
 desk that we all love we hate 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.349
 of our video club but it's a bit 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.659

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.090
 For dinner, we bought a shelf of 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.830

 the iron man 123 to my son and it was offered and 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.730

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.290
 pm 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.419
 one of the things that most call the 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.150
 attention of this size or Cuba is the 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.590
 technology that you have inside is when 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.660
 turn on the car the first thing that goes 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.729
 to show here on the board that they are 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.020
 maps of car belts where you're going 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.870
 to sing not only if someone does not 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.090
 has put the belt behind the three

 can you tell who has the belt 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.250
 put and who does not but also where the 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.960
 car is walking that has traction 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.810
 integral that distributes traction 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.669
 integral intelligently we 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.009
 you can see there are errors kinds of 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.110
 traction if any skating just a 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.759
 detail of the there is the command 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.639
 central with this stereo are and with a 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:14.919
 powerful sound by the way you're a 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.500
 gps navigator is of course what 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.909
 you have is a navigator on a map and with 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.699
 this wheel that you can give the 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:23.139
 indications of where you want to go for 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.240
 that they make you on the route directly 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.460
 like any that weighs some of the 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.449
 many details of technology that has 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.449
 the fortune
