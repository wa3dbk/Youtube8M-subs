00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.859
 the blade of blade reinemann never managed to effectively bite the heart of 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.589
 public and criticism and even for some mysterious reason its name is handed down 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.869
 yours and still survives today 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.329
 if it will be able to face on downloadable circuits lined with one 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.560
 sparkling drive in high definition 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.790
 one who shouts Cassanmagnago I would say that primordial memories inserted in 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.320
 subsequent tivoli 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.170
 it is good to clarify something immediately 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.870
 even if you were to be skilled boyscout oblada in b traian will be 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.390
 really everything to tear the worst insults against saints from my lips 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.010
 apostles and relatives of the developers 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.600
 it is not simply a difficult game 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.030
 unfortunately in fact some choices of desainers have made the move still 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.030
 rain of some majestic girl they would have liked 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.640
 in plain it is rather classic for the genus 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.180
 at the disposal of the protagonist there are a sword and a gun 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.899
 entrusted respectively to a front button and the right side of the penis 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.890
 the left one serves instead for the chef's classic 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.430
 the analog to the left to move changes references with the blade 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.910
 another front will be dedicated to ferrari enemies in mid-air edamer 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.950
 in the blood 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.640
 this last possibility is very important to manage 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.700
 correctly 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.720
 the health bar will consume great speed under the attacks 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.480
 Enemies I search for a few seconds in peace for a true enemy 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.200
 fundamental to recover vitality 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.560
 the paragraph sistri soon turns out to be full of amusing possibilities 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.500
 It is complete enough to deal with a large number of different ones 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.590
 enemies regulated by very different attack patterns 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.440
 if faced individually they could prove to be moderately threatening 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.320
 moments when I play me at the river dozens of nights will literally lead 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.190
 sweat on the chest 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.370
 the levels naturally also offer chase platforms - moving blades platforms 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.060
 rotating elevators and many other row flights 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.850
 unfortunately in this case the control system turns out to be much less 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.820
 efficient 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.450
 the great leap when it comes to fighting is not precise enough for 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.209
 face the treacherous mobile platforms as well as double somersaults 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.290
 even the too high unical running speed is often revealed 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:18.849
 problematic to manage 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.290
 similar problems combat system the animations cannot be interrupted 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.279
 result in a very high percentage of unintentional damage 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.469
 also incomprehensible the management of the directions of the employee 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:34.059
 lower timer that attack will allow you to make a sweep should be premised 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:38.139
 the mind the downward direction does not lead to lowering with true nonsense 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.579
 when the plaform sections deceive mingling combat force a 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.050
 player enable lethal threats while raining down on me from all sides 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.630
 the level of difficulty in reaching paroxysm 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.800
 forcing the same sections to repeat an infinite number of times a trial and error now 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.719
 facilitated at the checkpoint and often too far apart 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.899
 the same applies to lemos faiths which will of course require a 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.899
 fair number of deaths before the enemy's pattern 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:10.729
 when you are not busy screaming resine deadline b trial it will seem like a 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:14.529
 great work both in terms of presentation and content 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:18.309
 very different levels between them presents the same original solutions as much 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:21.769
 visually as to the point of view of the internal animations are all 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.090
 very characteristic and design of enemy enemies and always a lot 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:26.279
 nailed it 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.889
 there are also the very first cocks in with dialogues represented by opportune 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.049
 comic style comics no shortage of collectibles as contest treasures in 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.049
 able to improve the characteristics of the protagonist 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.650
 if it wasn't so damn frustrating because of a design sometimes 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.309
 naive 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.569
 the Italian band could have represented the umpteenth success of the 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.279
 digital delivery circuit 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:54.389
 although I have not added a more bland level of difficulty, I am waiting for how 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.159
 maximum with the current would have been sufficient to compensate at least in part 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.189
 you have heavy defects in the controls 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.150
 just as the title can be recommended only to a restricted one 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.069
 mixes fans of the genre willing to do it literally 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.289
 subdue non-game play frustrating in every respect 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:12.649
 getting the credits will undoubtedly be a source of pride with friends 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:14.559
 but unfortunately the title will remain a missed opportunity
