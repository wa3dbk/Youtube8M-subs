now<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.560> directing<00:02:36.040> once<00:02:36.220> again<00:02:36.489> this<00:02:36.580> is

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
now the directing once again this is

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.309 
now the directing once again this is
from<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:36.970> guys<00:02:37.090> who<00:02:37.420> did<00:02:37.599> Blair<00:02:37.810> Witch<00:02:37.989> or<00:02:38.140> one

from the guys who did Blair Witch or one

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.360

of<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.500> guys<00:02:38.590> who<00:02:38.769> did<00:02:38.890> Blair<00:02:39.040> Witch<00:02:39.160> I<00:02:39.250> don't

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
of the guys who did Blair Witch I don't

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.410 
of the guys who did Blair Witch I don't
think<00:02:39.489> it's<00:02:39.580> both<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.849> them<00:02:39.940> because<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.180> was<00:02:40.269> -

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
think it's both of them because it was -

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.000 
think it's both of them because it was -
I<00:02:40.450> think<00:02:40.569> this<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:40.870> Eduardo<00:02:41.019> Sanchez<00:02:41.500> but<00:02:41.920> as

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
I think this is Eduardo Sanchez but as

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.650 
I think this is Eduardo Sanchez but as
far<00:02:42.190> as<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.370> movie<00:02:42.640> being<00:02:42.910> put<00:02:43.150> together<00:02:43.239> goes

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
far as the movie being put together goes

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.570 
far as the movie being put together goes
it<00:02:43.870> definitely<00:02:44.290> did<00:02:44.500> have<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:44.890> lot<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.190> tension

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
it definitely did have a lot of tension

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.940 
it definitely did have a lot of tension
and<00:02:45.970> really<00:02:46.930> made<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.230> cut<00:02:47.410> like<00:02:47.530> anybody

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
and really made you cut like anybody

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.440 
and really made you cut like anybody
that<00:02:48.130> covers<00:02:48.430> their<00:02:48.580> face<00:02:48.610> during<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.209> movie

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
that covers their face during the movie

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.880 
that covers their face during the movie
you'll<00:02:49.870> be<00:02:49.989> covering<00:02:50.260> your<00:02:50.440> face<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:50.769> this

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
you'll be covering your face in this

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.620 
you'll be covering your face in this
movie<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.250> definitely<00:02:51.730> builds<00:02:52.299> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
movie it definitely builds the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.199 
movie it definitely builds the
anticipation<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.530> tension<00:02:53.980> very<00:02:54.730> very

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
anticipation and the tension very very

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.390 
anticipation and the tension very very
well<00:02:55.540> it's<00:02:55.750> extremely<00:02:56.500> scary<00:02:56.860> in<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.160> sense

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
well it's extremely scary in that sense

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
well it's extremely scary in that sense
if<00:02:57.640> you're<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:57.940> type<00:02:58.060> of<00:02:58.090> person<00:02:58.209> that

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
with something as scary as what's in my

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.940 
with something as scary as what's in my
own<00:03:37.390> head<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:37.720> know<00:03:37.959> what<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.079> mean<00:03:38.290> I'm<00:03:38.590> one<00:03:38.829> of

own head you know what I mean I'm one of

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.349 
own head you know what I mean I'm one of
those<00:03:39.010> types<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.430> people<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.760> think<00:03:39.819> that<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.180> lot

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
those types of people I think that a lot

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:41.520 
those types of people I think that a lot
should<00:03:40.480> be<00:03:40.540> left<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.840> imagination<00:03:41.230> and

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
should be left of the imagination and

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.229 
should be left of the imagination and
this<00:03:41.890> movie<00:03:42.160> does<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.489> very<00:03:42.670> well<00:03:42.880> which<00:03:43.090> of

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
this movie does that very well which of

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.150 
this movie does that very well which of
course<00:03:43.269> if<00:03:43.720> you've<00:03:44.350> seen<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.620> Blair<00:03:44.799> Witch<00:03:44.829> I

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
course if you've seen the Blair Witch I

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.420 
course if you've seen the Blair Witch I
won't<00:03:45.310> give<00:03:45.400> anything<00:03:45.579> away<00:03:45.760> but<00:03:47.160> similar<00:03:48.160> a

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430

thought it was weird but I loved it my

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.890 
thought it was weird but I loved it my
jaw<00:04:06.579> hit<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:06.880> floor<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.329> was<00:04:07.690> like<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:10.540> was<00:04:10.690> very

cool<00:04:11.109> but<00:04:11.350> even<00:04:11.530> then<00:04:11.709> it<00:04:11.950> was<00:04:12.069> very<00:04:12.280> faint

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
cool but even then it was very faint

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.800 
cool but even then it was very faint
like<00:04:12.790> you<00:04:12.880> could<00:04:13.030> barely<00:04:13.180> see<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.569> that's<00:04:13.720> why

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
like you could barely see it that's why

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.960 
like you could barely see it that's why
everyone<00:04:14.109> in<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.350> theater<00:04:14.380> was<00:04:14.709> like<00:04:14.859> ah<00:04:15.040> ah

he's seeing this and other than that

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.620 
he's seeing this and other than that
though<00:04:18.579> everything<00:04:18.729> anything<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:19.329> was<00:04:19.479> left

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
though everything anything that was left

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.699 
though everything anything that was left
to<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.750> imagination<00:04:19.780> was<00:04:20.289> great<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.500> loved

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
to the imagination was great I loved

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.770 
to the imagination was great I loved
that<00:04:20.889> also<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.459> have<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:21.789> say<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.060> sound<00:04:22.360> design

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
that also I have to say the sound design

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.240 
that also I have to say the sound design
was<00:04:23.140> fantastic

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
was fantastic

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.600 
was fantastic
very<00:04:24.669> scary<00:04:25.090> sounds<00:04:25.810> very<00:04:26.409> well<00:04:26.710> done<00:04:26.979> and

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
very scary sounds very well done and

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.950 
very scary sounds very well done and
there's<00:04:27.879> this<00:04:28.090> voice<00:04:28.389> and<00:04:28.569> I<00:04:28.659> think<00:04:28.690> you<00:04:28.840> can

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
there's this voice and I think you can

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.760 
there's this voice and I think you can
actually<00:04:29.169> hear<00:04:29.259> it<00:04:29.289> in<00:04:29.379> the<00:04:29.440> trailer<00:04:29.650> but

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
actually hear it in the trailer but

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.800 
actually hear it in the trailer but
there's<00:04:30.310> this<00:04:30.430> like<00:04:30.610> it's<00:04:31.060> like<00:04:31.240> a<00:04:31.270> voice<00:04:31.569> that

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
there's this like it's like a voice that

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.839 
there's this like it's like a voice that
was<00:04:31.960> higher<00:04:32.349> and<00:04:32.740> in<00:04:32.979> editing<00:04:33.340> made<00:04:33.550> lower

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
was higher and in editing made lower

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.249 
was higher and in editing made lower
that's<00:04:34.150> what<00:04:34.270> it<00:04:34.360> sounds<00:04:34.690> like<00:04:34.720> at<00:04:34.900> least<00:04:35.080> and

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
that's what it sounds like at least and

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.170 
that's what it sounds like at least and
that<00:04:35.650> always<00:04:35.830> freaks<00:04:36.250> me<00:04:36.610> out<00:04:36.639> let<00:04:36.970> me<00:04:37.030> tell

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
excuse the language but I wrote it in

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.369 
excuse the language but I wrote it in
the<00:06:14.949> notes<00:06:15.099> so<00:06:15.340> I<00:06:15.370> have<00:06:15.550> to<00:06:15.639> say<00:06:15.819> it<00:06:15.969> and<00:06:16.259> so<00:06:17.259> it

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
the notes so I have to say it and so it

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.050 
the notes so I have to say it and so it
definitely<00:06:17.500> did<00:06:17.919> have<00:06:18.099> me<00:06:18.279> really<00:06:18.819> tense

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
definitely did have me really tense

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.519 
definitely did have me really tense
throughout<00:06:19.419> the<00:06:19.509> movie<00:06:19.690> and<00:06:19.719> that<00:06:19.840> is<00:06:20.050> great<00:06:20.319> I

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:20.529 
throughout the movie and that is great I

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:24.659 
throughout the movie and that is great I
thought<00:06:21.219> that<00:06:21.460> the<00:06:23.039> handycam<00:06:24.039> aspects<00:06:24.520> were

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
thought that the handycam aspects were

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:26.159 
thought that the handycam aspects were
done<00:06:24.849> well<00:06:25.029> they<00:06:25.270> weren't<00:06:25.419> too<00:06:25.690> much<00:06:25.930> and<00:06:26.110> they

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
done well they weren't too much and they

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.469 
done well they weren't too much and they
fit<00:06:26.409> into<00:06:26.529> the<00:06:26.620> story<00:06:26.949> well<00:06:27.159> and<00:06:27.430> I<00:06:28.090> thought

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479

fit into the story well and I thought
that<00:06:28.750> even<00:06:28.900> though<00:06:29.050> this<00:06:29.139> story<00:06:29.469> was<00:06:30.190> it

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
that even though this story was it

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.950 
that even though this story was it
escalated<00:06:31.060> towards<00:06:31.270> the<00:06:31.360> end<00:06:31.479> like<00:06:31.629> I<00:06:31.719> said<00:06:31.870> it
