00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
think it's a a bit interesting that it's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.180 
think it's a a bit interesting that it's
not<00:00:50.880> Jimmy<00:00:51.090> Brad<00:00:51.450> sitting<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:52.190> presenting

not Jimmy Brad sitting here presenting
the<00:00:53.310> next<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:54.680> during<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.890> research<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.850> I

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the next one during the research and I

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420 
the next one during the research and I
looked<00:00:57.870> at<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> lot<00:00:58.290> of<00:00:58.350> different<00:00:58.500> town<00:00:59.160> halls

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
looked at a lot of different town halls

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.520 
looked at a lot of different town halls
em<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.480> think<00:01:00.690> I've<00:01:00.780> tried<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.230> really

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
em and I think I've tried to really

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.499 
em and I think I've tried to really
capture<00:01:01.770> their<00:01:02.719> iconic<00:01:04.759> elements<00:01:05.759> in<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.270> town

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
capture their iconic elements in in town

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.230 
capture their iconic elements in in town
halls<00:01:06.750> as<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.860> see<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.399> very<00:01:08.430> tall

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
halls as you can see it's a very tall

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.030 
halls as you can see it's a very tall
building<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.899> it's<00:01:10.079> actually<00:01:10.469> the<00:01:10.649> tallest

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
building and it's actually the tallest

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.489 
building and it's actually the tallest
one<00:01:11.219> of<00:01:11.399> the<00:01:11.549> modular<00:01:12.060> buildings<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.719> we

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:13.499 
one of the modular buildings and we

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:16.969 
one of the modular buildings and we
wanted<00:01:13.829> the<00:01:14.039> town<00:01:14.399> hall<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.829> the<00:01:16.829> most

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
wanted the town hall to be this the most

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.620 
wanted the town hall to be this the most
impressive<00:01:17.639> in<00:01:17.999> its<00:01:18.090> size<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:21.149> have<00:01:21.299> three

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
impressive in its size and we have three

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.830 
impressive in its size and we have three
floors<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:23.149> also<00:01:24.149> when<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.299> did<00:01:24.539> the<00:01:24.659> research

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
floors and also when I did the research

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.219 
floors and also when I did the research
on<00:01:25.579> looks<00:01:26.579> of<00:01:26.850> town<00:01:27.119> halls<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.749> what<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.109> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
on looks of town halls and what is the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.010 
on looks of town halls and what is the
most<00:01:28.409> iconic<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.159> almost<00:01:29.909> ninety<00:01:30.389> percent<00:01:30.539> of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
most iconic and almost ninety percent of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.289 
most iconic and almost ninety percent of
all<00:01:31.529> the<00:01:31.709> buildings<00:01:31.889> were<00:01:32.299> asymmetrically

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
all the buildings were asymmetrically

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.340 
all the buildings were asymmetrically
built<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.549> so<00:01:35.549> I've<00:01:35.609> done<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.779> same<00:01:36.990> here

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
built and so I've done the same here

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.480 
built and so I've done the same here
with<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> entrance<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.939> center<00:01:39.499> m<00:01:40.499> and<00:01:40.889> then

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
with a entrance in the center m and then

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.959 
with a entrance in the center m and then
I've<00:01:41.670> done<00:01:41.929> tried<00:01:42.929> to<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.259> each<00:01:43.799> floor<00:01:44.459> in<00:01:44.729> a

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
I've done tried to have each floor in a

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.289 
I've done tried to have each floor in a
different<00:01:45.829> with<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.859> different<00:01:47.279> look<00:01:47.429> so<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.179> s

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
different with a different look so it s

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.889 
different with a different look so it s
more<00:01:48.659> variety<00:01:49.289> to<00:01:49.319> the<00:01:49.499> facade<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.789> also<00:01:51.689> it's

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
more variety to the facade and also it's

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.969 
more variety to the facade and also it's
it's<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.380> more<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.679> a<00:01:52.770> fun<00:01:53.039> M<00:01:53.369> built<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.979> color

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
it's a more of a fun M built and color

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.149 
it's a more of a fun M built and color
wise<00:01:56.490> I've<00:01:57.209> chosen<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.810> dark<00:01:58.139> orange<00:01:58.529> and

special quest for this building and it's
actually<00:02:34.120> billions<00:02:35.120> crest<00:02:35.990> villainous<00:02:36.950> a

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
actually billions crest villainous a

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.900 
actually billions crest villainous a
city<00:02:37.730> where<00:02:38.090> Lego<00:02:38.630> come<00:02:38.840> from<00:02:39.700> but<00:02:40.700> we<00:02:40.880> have

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
city where Lego come from but we have

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.060 
city where Lego come from but we have
used<00:02:41.180> this<00:02:41.450> pattern<00:02:41.960> and<00:02:42.170> then<00:02:42.380> designed<00:02:42.950> it

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
used this pattern and then designed it

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.790 
used this pattern and then designed it
in<00:02:43.190> an<00:02:43.340> old<00:02:43.550> style<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.660> it's<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.200> modular

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
in an old style so it's the modular

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.080 
in an old style so it's the modular
buildings<00:02:46.570> crest<00:02:47.570> now<00:02:48.250> on<00:02:49.250> top<00:02:49.460> of<00:02:49.520> that<00:02:49.820> we

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
buildings crest now on top of that we

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.420 
buildings crest now on top of that we
have<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.300> balcony<00:02:50.900> where<00:02:51.500> they<00:02:51.740> mayor<00:02:52.100> can

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430

greet<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.970> people<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.920> further<00:02:55.580> up<00:02:55.760> we<00:02:56.000> have

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
greet the people and further up we have

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.930 
greet the people and further up we have
the<00:02:56.870> year<00:02:57.550> 1891<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.800> that<00:03:00.800> defines<00:03:01.280> when<00:03:01.730> the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
the year 1891 and that defines when the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.770 
the year 1891 and that defines when the
building<00:03:02.360> was<00:03:03.350> built<00:03:03.880> but<00:03:04.880> it's<00:03:05.060> also<00:03:05.300> the

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
building was built but it's also the

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
coincidences that if you read it

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.410 
coincidences that if you read it
backwards<00:03:15.160> it's<00:03:16.160> actually<00:03:16.340> my<00:03:16.820> birth<00:03:17.120> year

backwards it's actually my birth year
and<00:03:18.340> further<00:03:19.340> up<00:03:19.550> you<00:03:19.730> see<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.120> clock<00:03:20.720> tower

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
and further up you see the clock tower

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.910 
and further up you see the clock tower
and<00:03:21.490> and<00:03:22.490> we<00:03:22.850> also<00:03:23.030> have<00:03:23.330> a<00:03:23.590> print<00:03:24.590> made

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
and and we also have a print made

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.840 
and and we also have a print made
specifically<00:03:25.580> for<00:03:25.730> this<00:03:26.330> model<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.640> nice

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
specifically for this model and the nice

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.400 
specifically for this model and the nice
thing<00:03:28.880> about<00:03:29.240> it<00:03:29.600> is<00:03:29.750> that<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:30.080> can<00:03:30.260> actually
