00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
checked it out 230 degrees is the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.210 
checked it out 230 degrees is the
melting<00:00:24.420> point<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:27.140> almost<00:00:28.140> at<00:00:28.590> work<00:00:28.830> but

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
melting point so it's almost at work but

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.270 
melting point so it's almost at work but
I<00:00:30.619> need<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.769> pull<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:34.010> took<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.160> off

his<00:03:45.180> heads<00:03:45.480> are<00:03:45.690> gonna<00:03:45.870> have<00:03:46.440> some<00:03:46.740> serious

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
his heads are gonna have some serious

00:03:47.250 --> 00:04:00.220 
his heads are gonna have some serious
flow

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.539 

so<00:04:00.920> it'll<00:04:01.190> be<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.310> whole<00:04:01.519> different<00:04:01.580> motor<00:04:03.549> now

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
so it'll be a whole different motor now

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.360 
so it'll be a whole different motor now
we're<00:04:04.940> going<00:04:05.120> to<00:04:05.209> put<00:04:05.360> it<00:04:05.480> in<00:04:05.599> there<00:04:05.840> with<00:04:06.080> the

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
we're going to put it in there with the

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.320 
we're going to put it in there with the
transaxle<00:04:09.519> so<00:04:10.519> I<00:04:10.580> think<00:04:11.120> I<00:04:11.299> got<00:04:11.540> everything

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
transaxle so I think I got everything

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.080 
transaxle so I think I got everything
ironed<00:04:14.330> out<00:04:14.780> should<00:04:15.409> be<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.620> pretty<00:04:15.890> easy

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
ironed out should be a pretty easy

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.460 
ironed out should be a pretty easy
install<00:04:17.769> one<00:04:18.769> thing<00:04:19.010> I<00:04:19.130> noticed<00:04:19.549> is<00:04:19.699> these

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
cables shifting cables are going to be

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.330 
cables shifting cables are going to be
longer<00:04:26.990> than<00:04:27.199> what<00:04:27.560> I<00:04:27.590> need<00:04:27.860> I'm<00:04:28.100> going<00:04:28.250> to

tubes and stuff in there so that should
be<00:05:48.710> pretty<00:05:48.889> good<00:05:49.370> I<00:05:49.780> should<00:05:50.780> keep<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.169> heat

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
be pretty good I should keep the heat

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.219 
be pretty good I should keep the heat
down<00:05:51.650> below<00:05:52.550> rather<00:05:53.150> than<00:05:53.450> let<00:05:53.690> it<00:05:53.840> come<00:05:54.050> up

have a different PCV system on it the
guy<00:07:19.289> that<00:07:19.440> did<00:07:19.470> my<00:07:19.740> motor<00:07:20.009> said<00:07:20.430> that<00:07:21.169> didn't

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:22.169 
guy that did my motor said that didn't

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:24.980 
guy that did my motor said that didn't
seem<00:07:22.409> right<00:07:22.729> in<00:07:23.729> fact<00:07:23.970> probably<00:07:24.389> just<00:07:24.750> an

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990 
seem right in fact probably just an

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.180 
seem right in fact probably just an
intake<00:07:25.440> leak<00:07:27.080> the<00:07:28.080> way<00:07:28.199> I<00:07:28.229> had<00:07:28.500> it<00:07:28.680> set<00:07:28.919> up<00:07:29.159> so

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.190 
intake leak the way I had it set up so

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.800 
intake leak the way I had it set up so
I'm<00:07:29.699> just<00:07:29.940> going<00:07:30.060> to<00:07:30.120> go<00:07:30.210> to<00:07:30.330> a<00:07:30.419> breather

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810 
I'm just going to go to a breather

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.399 
I'm just going to go to a breather
system<00:07:31.639> there<00:07:32.639> was<00:07:32.789> lots<00:07:33.030> of<00:07:33.330> oil<00:07:33.539> in<00:07:33.930> the

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:34.409 
system there was lots of oil in the

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:38.029 
system there was lots of oil in the
cylinders<00:07:35.810> so<00:07:36.810> obviously<00:07:37.289> something<00:07:37.770> modern

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 
cylinders so obviously something modern

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:41.029 
cylinders so obviously something modern
right<00:07:38.810> so<00:07:39.810> yep<00:07:40.050> we're<00:07:40.320> going<00:07:40.380> to<00:07:40.530> go<00:07:40.710> with<00:07:40.889> the

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 
right so yep we're going to go with the

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:48.439 
right so yep we're going to go with the
breather<00:07:41.280> system<00:07:41.820> and<00:07:42.120> the<00:07:45.740> transaxle<00:07:47.449> needs

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:48.449 
breather system and the transaxle needs

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:50.300 
breather system and the transaxle needs
a<00:07:48.659> breather<00:07:48.900> on<00:07:49.080> it<00:07:49.440> also<00:07:49.860> so<00:07:50.130> I'll<00:07:50.219> just

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:50.310 
a breather on it also so I'll just

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.249 
a breather on it also so I'll just
probably<00:07:50.729> run<00:07:51.000> them<00:07:51.180> all<00:07:51.300> together<00:07:51.509> I<00:07:51.960> would

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:52.259 
probably run them all together I would

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:59.650 
probably run them all together I would
imagine

00:07:59.650 --> 00:07:59.660 

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.720 

you
