00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.269
 sleeping prouz in terms of start just 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.269
 then text wet big tits 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:31.499
 all let's say depth you need to be 60 font 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:35.610
 any i'll take as well if you don't have it 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:41.960
 I put a link in the description and I myself 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:45.120
 and the sources of the act papaya street c4d 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:49.670
 find you can equal books all on on 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.670
 your own record 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:01:02.150
 with copy the text by clamping the counter 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:08.040
 and drag so let's color 2 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:14.450
 text our threat of failure go in during 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.290
 ostrich and break into 100 pieces 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.040
 it's all now instead 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.350
 click break we should be it 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.350
 breaks it for you it per second 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:33.410
 everything came to an end the process we fill the cat 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:38.630
 further we do the following we clamp the control 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:46.070
 no, we have 1 go in but the graph effectors 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:51.960
 case effector and tick 2 3 4 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.180
 so further we copy we select everything and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.600
 we copy 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:09.520
 before acceptance 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:12.989
 so that little lady buttons move that 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.989
 me Vladimir Nikolaevich 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.519
 in this way we leave it and proudly 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.519
 broken 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.600
 how is it further we will push the text 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.710
 Dixie choose an animated cartoon 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.710
 what was and 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:47.500
 but all pigs are wonderful 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.500
 so let's ska translate it 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.349
 copy 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:04.580

 love text 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:43.090
 then place the atomic lattice 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.720
 11 X insert in this I decided to go 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:51.060
 concerns there we go from a different lattice 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.060
 object 2 cylinder 1 cm 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:10.900
 we get such a bezel further 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:10.900
 paint our text need to be asked to 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:24.220
 green no such llama wish we would choose 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.220

00:04:50.219 --> 00:05:02.639
 Generally no width height 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:17.060
