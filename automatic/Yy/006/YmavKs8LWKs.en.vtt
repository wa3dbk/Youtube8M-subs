00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 silence 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.740
 let's say everything was much more 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.600
 complicated because we came to this 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.550
 I think it had not rained in four 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.169
 months with which the 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.980
 Pyrenees thinking that you get to work 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.020
 about a green environment and such 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.390
 and it turns out that everything was brown the idea 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.280
 early on I started changed 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.400
 completely 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.590
 and the most 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.320
 more practice that I saw was to take everything 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.720
 to a more neutral point to give it a 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.070
 a little bit more different in the 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.680
 part of the garden to be always 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.040
 marcelo working we tried to make it out 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.450
 a little more at more central hours of 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.180
 day where the soil is trinitarian in 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.660
 that feeling more than hardness of effort 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.660
 heat 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.649
 a little to emphasize that not everything was 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.899
 so easy everything is so pretty so 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.030
 there is a recognizable style I think it is 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.920
 quite natural is above all in what 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.020
 we were basing ourselves to work the 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.920
 naturalness of the characters and a little 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.890
 try to merge 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.420
 the environment or the rural environment in which 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.540
 we were with the costumes of the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.540
 characters 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.720
 the mouse 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.270
 in general how the whole pull was recorded and 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.850
 we are jumping from chapter 1 to chapter 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.159
 10 for example the atmospheric issue 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.840
 that we were in different points of the 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.160
 year had to be very careful 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.770
 with the sun and I also remembered the house of 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.020
 control a lot if in chapter 11 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.300
 that had to be very destroyed then 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.210
 in chapter 3 that was noticing 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.119
 that little evolution and that seemed 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.100
 real before all the art team was 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.729
 super reduced in the first 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.110
 just how it was from the beginning 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.680
 since pre-production, I was only 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.290
 the most critical was perhaps the outside that 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.659
 we had in 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.390
 in the car did not study night there was 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.310
 inside a car 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.660
 and all that in the end we solve 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.660
 illuminating with a mobile 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.610
 we play with a real house that 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.950
 has been reformed recently and then 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.459
 it was a house that was not in ruins 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.720
 clearly then we had to cover 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.980
 wooden windows new meter 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.240
 weeds everywhere so that 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.959
 it seems that there really has not been 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.940
 there is a house inside free in 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.100
 reality are three different houses the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.630
 first house that appears when they 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.150
 they arrive at the town is a house that was 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.590
 in rehabilitation and then 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.200
 two other houses 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.630
 they were in another different town and one of 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.230
 they were also used to record the 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.230
 exterior 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.700
 the limitations that the fact of 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.709
 have very little light 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.069
 they made me have to demand the 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.019
 actors a little bit more 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.030
 of care when doing things 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.620
 and in that aspect those that behaved very 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.620
 well they helped me a lot 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.200
 with child who is a photo director 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.630
 we tried to see each plane when it 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.780
 made the plane to see if you could 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.370
 improve with art issues or what 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.900
 otherwise its over something 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.400
 could always improve that work that 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.220
 We were doing someone 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.440
 surprised in principle the clarity of 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.870
 ideas that I had saw that all to be 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.209
 a person so young that I 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.500
 I arrived at the beginning I came from another sector 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.750
 let's say with many more years 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.620
 and good to meet him and see him with 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.620
 everything so clear is so well prepared 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.780
 in many moments he said this 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.580
 this guy knows a lot about where he goes and 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.349
 he knows very well what he wants me to do 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.760
 I was trying to take my way 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.760
 but then we do mine 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.410
 different let's say not to get a shoot in 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.570
 the one that you find yourself living in a 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.090
 rural house with so many people with so few 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.730
 means because you're used to other 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.030
 things but the truth is that it was fast and it's going 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.480
 with optimism wanting to get hooked 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.480
 it's the group 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.410
 and it worked proteste at some point 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.480
 good had people are angry but the 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.120
 result of the costumes and the art of 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.000
 free above all is thanks to all the 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.000
 people who collaborated all the actors 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.620
 they left thousands of things for the locker room 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.660
 but not only for them but for 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.370
 other characters and for people who do not 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.670
 they knew nothing they overturned 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.720
 absolutely to private companies we 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.790
 they asked for material also in exchange for 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.330
 nothing practically to participate and 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.340
 collaborate on the project the whole team 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.740
 technician turned to the maximum with the equipment 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.570
 of art because as it was only me 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.590
 in the team especially going locked 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:24.140
 that in the end I adopted it and it has been the 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.190
 second the second on board the team 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.080
 of art 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.880
 and nothing from free to thank all the 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.230
 world that I participate that we are very 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.310
 grateful that thanks to them he has 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.310
 could this come out
