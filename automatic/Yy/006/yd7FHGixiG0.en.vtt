to be one of those people that were

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.170 
to be one of those people that were

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
madam I think so what I can do now as

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.850 
madam I think so what I can do now as
you<00:05:22.760> can<00:05:22.910> see<00:05:23.060> there<00:05:23.300> if<00:05:24.170> you<00:05:24.440> can<00:05:24.590> see<00:05:24.740> on<00:05:24.800> the

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
you can see there if you can see on the

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.200 
you can see there if you can see on the
camera<00:05:25.160> that<00:05:25.340> there<00:05:25.580> was<00:05:25.670> ratings<00:05:25.970> there<00:05:26.180> a

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
camera that there was ratings there a

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.680 
camera that there was ratings there a
second<00:05:26.480> ago

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
second ago

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.080 
second ago
there<00:05:27.440> you<00:05:27.530> go<00:05:27.710> it's<00:05:28.100> four<00:05:28.640> and<00:05:28.700> a<00:05:28.760> half<00:05:28.790> star

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090
