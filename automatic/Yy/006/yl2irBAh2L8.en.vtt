well<00:03:57.769> although<00:03:58.190> I<00:03:58.370> do<00:03:58.549> have<00:03:58.819> some<00:03:59.030> dry<00:03:59.299> spots

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
well although I do have some dry spots

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.930 
well although I do have some dry spots
around<00:03:59.840> here<00:04:00.380> currently<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:01.640> it<00:04:01.730> was<00:04:01.820> like

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
around here currently and it was like

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.560 
around here currently and it was like
really<00:04:02.180> really<00:04:02.510> windy<00:04:02.870> at<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.049> game<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:03.650> um<00:04:04.579> so

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
really really windy at the game so um so

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.690 
really really windy at the game so um so
it's<00:04:05.870> like<00:04:06.049> a<00:04:06.079> powdery<00:04:06.590> finish<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.310> doesn't

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
it's like a powdery finish it doesn't

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.020 
it's like a powdery finish it doesn't
work<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.959> best<00:04:09.200> on<00:04:09.440> dry<00:04:10.040> skin<00:04:10.070> as<00:04:10.609> it<00:04:10.820> normally

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
work the best on dry skin as it normally

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.699 
work the best on dry skin as it normally
would<00:04:11.239> but<00:04:11.660> I<00:04:11.720> think<00:04:12.079> that<00:04:12.140> if<00:04:12.290> you<00:04:12.320> have<00:04:12.470> oily

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
would but I think that if you have oily

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.860 
would but I think that if you have oily
skin<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:13.190> would<00:04:13.280> be<00:04:13.340> perfect<00:04:13.910> it's<00:04:14.420> not<00:04:14.600> bad

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
skin it would be perfect it's not bad

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.270 
skin it would be perfect it's not bad
for<00:04:15.079> dry<00:04:15.230> skin<00:04:15.260> though<00:04:15.709> you<00:04:15.769> just<00:04:15.980> have<00:04:16.130> to

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
for dry skin though you just have to

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.190 
for dry skin though you just have to
like<00:04:16.400> make<00:04:16.640> sure<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:16.970> exfoliate<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:17.720> really

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
like make sure you exfoliate and really

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.500 
like make sure you exfoliate and really
more<00:04:18.440> stress<00:04:18.739> before<00:04:18.950> you<00:04:19.190> use<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:19.430> but<00:04:20.359> yeah

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
more stress before you use it but yeah

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.789
