Hi my name is Sarah and I work at Mountain Warehouse 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.540
 I'm here today to show you how to reproof your waterproof jacket either with a wash in or reproof spray

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.540
If you start to notice that your jacket is absorbing water instead of repelling water, it is probably time to reproof it. 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.355
You should always wash your jacket first before re-proofing

00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:30.474
Waterproof jackets should never be washed with your normal everyday detergent or fabric softener, 

00:00:30.474 --> 00:00:33.834
Always use a cleaner designed for technical outwear. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.180
Before washing, brush off any loose mud or dirt. Do up any zips and close any flaps.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:52.060
Make sure the detergent compartment of your washing machine is clean of any detergent or softener before pouring in the appropriate amount of cleaner. 

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.535
Place your jacket into the drum. 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.280
Do not wash more than two waterproof garments at the same time. 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.540
Allow the washing machine to run through the complete wash and rinse cycle following garment care instructions

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.994
After washing your jacket it can be left to air dry or be tumble dried on a low or medium heat if garment care instructions allow.

00:01:12.994 --> 00:01:15.690
Proofers should not alter the look of the fabric

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.980
 It is however recommended that you test our products on a small area before spraying or washing the garment

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.780
First pour the appropriate amount of proofer into the detergent compartment

00:01:26.814 --> 00:01:32.094
As a rule this should be two caps full for one jacket and three caps for two jackets

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.680
Allow the washing machine to run through the complete wash and rinse cycle at 30 degrees

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.994
Heat helps to activate the product, so if the jacket’s care instructions allow it you can tumble dry the jacket on a low or medium heat

00:01:45.994 --> 00:01:50.403
It is possible to buy products that will wash and proof your jacket at the same time

00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:52.995
This will mean you will not need to wash your jacket first 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.520
The other option you have when reproofing a waterproof jacket is a spray proofer

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.674
When the product is washed and dried, spray the reproofer evenly on the outside of the jacket from approximately 15-20 cm away

00:02:11.674 --> 00:02:15.936
 Check the jacket carefully to ensure no areas of the fabric have been missed 

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.274
wipe off any excess with a damp cloth

00:02:18.274 --> 00:02:24.934
For high abrasion areas such as the elbows and shoulders, it’s recommended that a second coat of proofer is applied

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.680
Allow the jacket to dry naturally

00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:31.909
And that's how you reproof a waterproof jacket. Thanks for watching!
