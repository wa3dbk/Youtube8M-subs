blade there okay it's relatively thin
and<00:01:10.340> it's<00:01:11.340> uh<00:01:12.030> what<00:01:12.570> appears<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.020> me<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.470> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and it's uh what appears to me to be a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.679 
and it's uh what appears to me to be a
really<00:01:13.920> quality<00:01:14.369> saw<00:01:14.729> one<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.420> things<00:01:15.540> I

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
really quality saw one of the things I

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.240 
really quality saw one of the things I
like<00:01:15.900> about<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> fact<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> blade

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
like about it is the fact that the blade

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.719 
like about it is the fact that the blade
locks<00:01:17.520> open<00:01:18.030> as<00:01:18.180> well<00:01:18.869> as<00:01:18.930> locking<00:01:19.259> closed<00:01:19.979> and

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
locks open as well as locking closed and

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.219 
locks open as well as locking closed and
if<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.909> watch<00:01:21.119> some<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.420> my<00:01:21.479> other<00:01:21.540> videos<00:01:22.049> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
if you watch some of my other videos you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.899 
if you watch some of my other videos you
know<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:22.740> looking<00:01:23.009> at<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> COG<00:01:23.580> lens

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.690 
know that I was looking at the COG lens
a<00:01:24.180> cierra<00:01:24.960> saw<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.710> doesn't<00:01:26.159> lock<00:01:26.340> one

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
a cierra saw and that doesn't lock one

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.890 
a cierra saw and that doesn't lock one
of<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> things<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.090> didn't<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.390> about<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.840> it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
of the things I didn't like about it it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.679 
of the things I didn't like about it it
wouldn't<00:01:28.110> lock<00:01:28.229> closed<00:01:29.189> okay<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.390> there's<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
wouldn't lock closed okay so there's a

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.539 
wouldn't lock closed okay so there's a
locking<00:01:30.900> device<00:01:31.140> for<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.740> lock<00:01:31.920> open<00:01:32.400> but

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
locking device for it to lock open but

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.340 
locking device for it to lock open but
it<00:01:32.700> would<00:01:32.820> come<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.170> things

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
it would come out and that's one things

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.469 
it would come out and that's one things
I<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.130> Browning<00:01:35.729> camp<00:01:36.000> size<00:01:36.210> it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.850 
locks closed and it's slightly smaller
and<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.479> thought<00:01:39.659> man<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> great<00:01:40.680> little

a<00:03:42.979> lot<00:03:43.979> of<00:03:44.010> different<00:03:44.400> wood<00:03:44.549> out<00:03:44.669> here<00:03:44.879> today

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
a lot of different wood out here today

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.559 
a lot of different wood out here today
and<00:03:47.010> have<00:03:47.280> been<00:03:47.400> really<00:03:47.669> unimpressive<00:03:48.299> to

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
and have been really unimpressive to

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.259 
and have been really unimpressive to
give<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.780> guys<00:03:48.959> kind<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.409> a<00:03:49.639> test<00:03:50.639> sample<00:03:50.879> I

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
just threw this in my pocket because I

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.429 
just threw this in my pocket because I
thought<00:03:53.519> I<00:03:53.579> might<00:03:53.790> do<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.150> review<00:03:54.359> today<00:03:54.629> and

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
thought I might do this review today and

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.689 
thought I might do this review today and
I<00:03:55.739> was<00:03:55.889> sure<00:03:56.069> that<00:03:56.099> I<00:03:56.310> was<00:03:56.370> going<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.549> be

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
I was sure that I was going to be

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.280 
I was sure that I was going to be
impressed<00:03:57.239> because<00:03:57.510> I'd<00:03:57.750> use<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.049> saw<00:03:58.260> a

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
impressed because I'd use this saw a

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.080 
impressed because I'd use this saw a
little<00:03:58.500> bit<00:03:58.769> I<00:03:58.889> obviously<00:03:59.189> used<00:03:59.669> on<00:03:59.790> something

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
little bit I obviously used on something

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.939 
little bit I obviously used on something
that<00:04:00.329> was<00:04:00.449> really<00:04:00.659> easy<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.139> solve<00:04:01.439> I've<00:04:01.739> tried

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
that was really easy to solve I've tried

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.099 
that was really easy to solve I've tried
it<00:04:02.040> on<00:04:02.549> a<00:04:02.609> bunch<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.090> different<00:04:03.419> pieces<00:04:03.930> of

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
it on a bunch of different pieces of

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.699 
it on a bunch of different pieces of
wood<00:04:04.199> the<00:04:04.290> day<00:04:04.409> I<00:04:04.590> just<00:04:05.430> threw<00:04:05.729> my<00:04:06.299> little

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
wood the day I just threw my little

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.899 
wood the day I just threw my little
Swiss<00:04:07.709> Army<00:04:07.979> knife<00:04:08.099> in<00:04:08.250> my<00:04:08.370> pocket<00:04:08.400> this<00:04:08.849> is

Swiss Army knife in my pocket this is

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.909 
Swiss Army knife in my pocket this is
something<00:04:09.269> I've<00:04:09.359> had<00:04:09.540> for<00:04:10.409> the<00:04:10.439> better<00:04:10.650> part

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
something I've had for the better part

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:15.059 
something I've had for the better part
of<00:04:12.229> something<00:04:13.229> like<00:04:13.319> 18<00:04:13.799> years<00:04:13.879> okay

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
of something like 18 years okay

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.170 
of something like 18 years okay
and<00:04:15.640> I've<00:04:15.790> carried<00:04:16.030> this<00:04:16.329> with<00:04:17.130> me<00:04:18.130> a<00:04:18.280> lot<00:04:18.669> and

and I've carried this with me a lot and
one<00:04:19.509> of<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.660> reasons<00:04:19.900> I<00:04:19.989> did<00:04:20.139> is<00:04:20.259> it<00:04:20.350> has<00:04:20.440> a

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
one of the reasons I did is it has a

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.439 
one of the reasons I did is it has a
couple<00:04:20.799> knife<00:04:20.949> blades<00:04:21.190> on<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:21.699> what<00:04:22.419> I

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
see that just saw right through it no

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:33.629 
see that just saw right through it no
problem<00:05:12.250> I'll<00:05:12.759> begin<00:05:13.120> right<00:05:13.509> here<00:05:32.639> right

problem I'll begin right here right
through<00:05:33.849> it<00:05:37.199> that's<00:05:38.199> how<00:05:38.500> this<00:05:38.680> saw<00:05:38.919> is

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
through it that's how this saw is

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.480 
through it that's how this saw is
working<00:05:39.430> and<00:05:40.770> this<00:05:41.770> is<00:05:42.039> to<00:05:42.130> give<00:05:42.250> you<00:05:42.340> guys

working and this is to give you guys
another<00:05:42.610> little<00:05:43.000> test<00:05:43.180> of<00:05:43.389> it<00:05:43.510> this<00:05:43.659> is<00:05:43.720> how

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
another little test of it this is how

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.050 
another little test of it this is how
this<00:05:44.919> saw<00:05:45.099> is<00:05:45.130> working

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
this saw is working

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.970 
this saw is working
I<00:05:48.930> don't<00:05:49.930> know<00:05:49.990> whether<00:05:50.169> the<00:05:50.290> plate<00:05:50.620> is<00:05:50.830> too

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
I don't know whether the plate is too

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.490 
I don't know whether the plate is too
thick<00:05:51.250> it's<00:05:52.030> not<00:05:52.060> too<00:05:52.389> thick<00:05:52.660> you<00:05:52.960> can<00:05:53.320> see

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
thick it's not too thick you can see

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.010 
thick it's not too thick you can see
there<00:05:54.300> they're<00:05:55.300> basically<00:05:55.660> the<00:05:55.840> same

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
there they're basically the same

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.300 
there they're basically the same
thickness<00:05:56.290> this<00:05:56.590> might<00:05:56.800> even<00:05:56.950> be<00:05:57.070> a<00:05:57.100> little

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
thickness this might even be a little

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.960 
thickness this might even be a little
bit<00:05:57.430> thicker<00:05:57.669> I<00:05:58.530> don't<00:05:59.530> know<00:05:59.680> I<00:05:59.860> really<00:05:59.950> do<00:06:00.790> not

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
bit thicker I don't know I really do not

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.470 
bit thicker I don't know I really do not
know<00:06:01.030> what's<00:06:01.510> going<00:06:01.780> on<00:06:01.960> I'm<00:06:02.710> probably<00:06:03.040> gonna

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
know what's going on I'm probably gonna

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.090 
know what's going on I'm probably gonna
toss<00:06:04.480> this<00:06:04.810> saw<00:06:05.050> and<00:06:05.290> get<00:06:05.470> rid<00:06:05.680> of<00:06:05.710> it<00:06:05.919> and<00:06:05.980> that

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
toss this saw and get rid of it and that

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.970 
toss this saw and get rid of it and that
breaks<00:06:06.370> my<00:06:06.490> heart<00:06:06.580> it<00:06:06.910> was<00:06:07.030> a<00:06:07.360> gift<00:06:07.930> it<00:06:08.800> seems

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
breaks my heart it was a gift it seems

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.930 
breaks my heart it was a gift it seems
like<00:06:09.100> a<00:06:09.130> sturdy<00:06:09.760> design<00:06:10.169> it's<00:06:11.169> got<00:06:11.940> great

potential to be a great tool but in its

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.460 
potential to be a great tool but in its
current<00:07:04.390> form<00:07:04.750> at<00:07:05.590> least<00:07:05.680> the<00:07:06.010> end<00:07:06.220> of<00:07:06.490> 2013
