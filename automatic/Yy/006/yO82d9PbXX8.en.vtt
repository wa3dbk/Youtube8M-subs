00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.090
 desire to escape from reality 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.619
 always met 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.479
 but 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.119
 especially 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.359
 it develops in desire in two 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:20.130
 cases 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.460
 First of all 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.410
 when reality is so much 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.579
 favorably 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.319
 what 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.949
 leaving her we have not experienced any 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.279
 of problems 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.810
 when 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.760
 parents 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.210
 in droves follow the slogan 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.520
 feed children two pension children can 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.850
 afford 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.520
 all sorts of 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.720
 games 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.300
 valid until 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.400
 old age 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.630
 here with the second 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.320
 reason to escape from reality 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.260
 when will recover 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.750
 too 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.980
 heavy dangerous and painful 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.010
 its hard 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.220
 to withstand the development of the crisis 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.400
 more often observed 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.900
 but it is this motive of escape from reality 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.600
 any 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.890
 are trying 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.070
 Well, firstly the same role-playing games 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.430
 like 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.740
 actor kenya and somali just force yourself 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.580
 forget 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.670
 percent 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.410
 in the harsh 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.150
 weekdays 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.540
 work fish prices in general ooo 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.010
 throw it all done 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.910
 and go there where life is cheaper in 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.030
 hope 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.130
 what 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.410
 some accumulated savings 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.820
 will allow the lid term distant edges 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.880
 crack moment 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.229
 this percentage 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.190
 it seems 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.750
 to say the least not optimal 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.690
 because 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.560
 as faster and did not run also edition 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.569
 she will not stop it and if 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.789
 for man 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.719
 with spending free time on 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.909
 forget from their service 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.819
 responsibilities exchange to 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.069
 read 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.739
 a couple more books related to these 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:22.789
 duties 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:25.240
 in order to perform them better 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.629
 he is very much at risk that 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.539
 in his place 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:32.179
 will take 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.179
 someone who preferred 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.539
 swing 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.739
 and friske ball 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.819
 percentage read 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.589
 boring and book blots 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:46.539
 similarly 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:49.809
 helps a little 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.469
 departure 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.109
 in hot countries like let's say goa 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.329
 rather popular 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.329
 from those who hope to escape anzhi zenith 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.870
 but not to mention anything else 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.540
 living on savings is certainly nice to 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.099
 so long with these savings 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.919
 nothing happened 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.919
 percentage of prompt savings in rubles 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:19.519
 process the onset of the crisis depreciated 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.169
 one and a half times true so far from further 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.619
 there was no devaluation 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:28.079
 foreseen similarly 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.869
 let's say savings in dollars seems to be 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:33.009
 even went up 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:36.649
 but there are some very likely 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.339
 crisis scenario 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:40.619
 by which 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.129
 the dollar will very soon turn into 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.029
 pretty cheap wallpaper 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.699
 and one wonders what 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.229
 it's the same thing 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.089
 if trapped there are a couple of these 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.999
 wallpaper 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:57.079
 not enough even for a return ticket to run 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.729
 from reality 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:00.209
 of course 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.189
 always nice until she you 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:03.959
 caught up 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.429
 the catch rate can 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:08.469
 at any moment son any direction 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:09.829
 text 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.129
 if you go virtual 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:13.499
 reality 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:14.729
 that 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.769
 would not be bad 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.889
 for a start be sure that 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.519
 enough money 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.389
 to pay 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.699
 but the internet pen there by the way 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.199
 bringing in remembered and wonderful 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.870
 a curse 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.690
 so that you at the wedding guests only here he 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.849
 offered 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.009
 similarly 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.490
 percent 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.360
 pass yue balls and raincoats 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.039
 need more 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.809
 have 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:47.059
 look for war what he did virtual 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:48.069
 reality 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:49.439
 it is only 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.449
 small part 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:52.689
 real 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:55.689
 closing her eyes she already has 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.759
 the percentage must be remembered that life is sometimes 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.669
 opens eyes 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.710
 surgical we will heal 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.710
 here puts dollars for napoli 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.779
 Prince von Bismarck he than House 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:11.629
 said non-participation in politics not 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:14.580
 frees her after 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.720
 so here it is not only applies to politics 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.939
 in the end 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:20.919
 escape 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.319
 Tajiks 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.360
 creates no less problems than 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.809
 solve 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:29.909
 most often creates much more 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.360
 so 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.159
 better still 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.589
 don't run anywhere 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.389
 acts in your workplace and 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.639
 cultivate at the first 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.120
 opportunities 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.710
 I swear to you that 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.589
 to cultivate 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:48.789
 official duties 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.439
 no less interesting and much more 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:52.309
 is useful 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:54.069
 what to improve 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:55.729
 in manipulation 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.819
 ball and joystick 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:00.819
 and run like that 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:02.949
 also 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.800
 dangerously 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.150
 so shameful how to escape from the battlefield 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:11.599
 Do not forget that 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.559
 experience at least past ten 

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:17.319
 thousand years of fighting 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.729
 showed 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.490
 left his place in the country and st and 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.770
 tried to escape have incomparably 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.020
 more chance to die 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.029
 than that 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:31.889
 who stayed 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.889
 next to friends 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:37.749
 act with him 

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:40.680
 run actress 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.990
 and even more useless 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.719
 because 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:45.789
 a crisis 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:47.479
 given 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:50.479
 to such changes compared to which 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.159
 even relocation 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:56.379
 with arbatov on 2 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:58.779
 roughly equivalent to transition 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:01.259
 of prices 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:02.960
 sleeping in the corridors 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.339
 in accre here 

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:06.580
 offer us all 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.210
 much bigger changes and in 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.370
 much more 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.419
 people who would 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:14.899
 we could 

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:17.110
 do it yourself 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.460
 to run 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.309
 from crisis 

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:21.610
 this 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:22.969
 means 

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:26.299
 difficult to put yourself at serious risk 

00:07:26.299 --> 00:07:29.689
 the fact that the problems are catching up on yourself 

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:32.309
 a place where you just can't solve them 

00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:34.389
 it means broadcast lose 

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:35.509
 mass 

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:38.279
 fascinating features 

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:41.279
 change your life 

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:43.309
 right on the ground 

00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:44.169
 so that 

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:47.330
 do not run away from crisis have lunch with 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.159
 the crisis 

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:50.969
 and try to get ahead of him 

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:52.559
 where he is not you all
