paper scissors video I was absolutely
exhausted<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.350> just<00:00:16.890> want<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.130> get<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.430> video<00:00:17.609> out

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
exhausted I just want to get a video out

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.830 
exhausted I just want to get a video out
there<00:00:17.910> quick<00:00:18.330> for<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.570> guys<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.460> feel<00:00:20.840> that's

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
me apologizing but i also have a purpose

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.650 
me apologizing but i also have a purpose
for<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.830> video<00:00:26.160> i'm<00:00:27.090> going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> show<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.570> how

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
for this video i'm going to show you how

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.970 
for this video i'm going to show you how
to<00:00:27.779> build<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.349> 3-bit<00:00:29.660> logic<00:00:30.660> gates<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.920> i

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
to build the 3-bit logic gates that i

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.150 
to build the 3-bit logic gates that i
showed<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.640> video<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.500> my<00:00:34.500> rock<00:00:34.800> pepsi

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
showed in that video in my rock pepsi

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.580 
showed in that video in my rock pepsi
this<00:00:35.309> video<00:00:35.630> so<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.719> want<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:36.989> five<00:00:37.290> thing

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
this video so you want to do five thing

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.810 
this video so you want to do five thing
by<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:39.140> rid<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:41.030> do<00:00:42.030> not<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:43.820> put

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
by that rid of that do not and that put

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.520 
by that rid of that do not and that put
redstone<00:00:45.120> here<00:00:45.600> nor<00:00:46.379> there<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:48.140> this<00:00:49.140> this

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
redstone here nor there and this this

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.889 
redstone here nor there and this this
type<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.129> design<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.610> very<00:00:50.640> useful<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.360> can

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
type of design is very useful as it can

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.700 
type of design is very useful as it can
allows<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:53.239> do<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.510> three<00:00:54.780> inputs<00:00:55.230> so

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
allows you to do it for three inputs so

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.779 
allows you to do it for three inputs so
an<00:00:56.010> auditor<00:00:56.430> number<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.789> inputs<00:00:58.579> which<00:00:59.579> is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
an auditor number of inputs which is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.340 
an auditor number of inputs which is
useful<00:01:00.000> if<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.899> number<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.620> variables

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
useful if you have a number of variables

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.590 
useful if you have a number of variables
so<00:01:04.350> we've<00:01:04.500> got<00:01:04.619> our<00:01:04.650> inputs<00:01:05.159> there<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.600> then

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
so we've got our inputs there and then

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.740 
so we've got our inputs there and then
we<00:01:06.720> want<00:01:06.900> our<00:01:07.110> output<00:01:08.180> they're<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:09.570> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
we want our output they're in there and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.590 
we want our output they're in there and
they're<00:01:13.580> just<00:01:14.580> making<00:01:14.850> two<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.420> these<00:01:15.540> and

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
they're just making two of these and

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.160 
they're just making two of these and
gates<00:01:16.140> then<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.220> also<00:01:17.340> want<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.710> just<00:01:19.710> fix<00:01:20.400> up<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
gates then we also want to just fix up a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.240 
gates then we also want to just fix up a
little<00:01:22.170> bit<00:01:22.320> there

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:37.120 

grab<00:01:28.250> some<00:01:28.640> levers<00:01:29.299> Oh<00:01:35.409> stay<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:36.530> right<00:01:36.680> no

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
grab some levers Oh stay the right no

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.749 
grab some levers Oh stay the right no
wrong<00:01:37.490> way<00:01:37.640> around<00:01:40.630> hey<00:01:41.630> Tilly<00:01:41.960> there<00:01:42.350> we<00:01:42.560> go

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
wrong way around hey Tilly there we go

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.139 
wrong way around hey Tilly there we go
have<00:01:43.759> to<00:01:43.909> be<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.119> same<00:01:44.180> way<00:01:44.920> okay<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:46.490> there<00:01:47.119> we

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
have to be the same way okay so there we

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.719 
have to be the same way okay so there we
go<00:01:48.640> so<00:01:50.049> turning<00:01:51.049> that<00:01:51.200> one<00:01:51.409> off<00:01:51.729> doesn't

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
go so turning that one off doesn't

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.950 
go so turning that one off doesn't
affect<00:01:52.970> anything<00:01:54.340> if<00:01:55.340> we<00:01:55.580> turn<00:01:56.090> both<00:01:56.659> of<00:01:56.720> those

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
affect anything if we turn both of those

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.690 
affect anything if we turn both of those
off<00:01:58.210> owning<00:01:59.210> that<00:01:59.360> one's<00:01:59.569> on<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:01.420> if<00:02:02.500> we<00:02:03.700> do

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
off owning that one's on and if we do

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.690 
off owning that one's on and if we do
say<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:05.780> one<00:02:06.409> and<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.590> one<00:02:07.030> now<00:02:08.030> puts<00:02:08.420> on

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.680 

yes

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.610 

yeah<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.420> that's<00:02:21.420> my<00:02:21.600> three<00:02:21.930> bit<00:02:22.110> logic<00:02:22.440> gate

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
yeah and that's my three bit logic gate

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.830 
yeah and that's my three bit logic gate
I<00:02:23.210> just<00:02:24.210> want<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.390> thank<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.630> guys<00:02:24.750> for

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
I just want to thank you guys for

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.350 
I just want to thank you guys for
watching<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.440> we'll<00:02:26.480> say<00:02:27.480> nice<00:02:28.080> day<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:30.030> see
