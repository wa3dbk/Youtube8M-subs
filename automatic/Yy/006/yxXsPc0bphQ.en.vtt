answer this question let's first talk

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.750 
answer this question let's first talk
about<00:00:33.530> something<00:00:34.100> else<00:00:34.300> why<00:00:35.300> a<00:00:35.719> microscope

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
about something else why a microscope

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.040 
about something else why a microscope
well<00:00:37.760> a<00:00:37.790> microscope<00:00:38.360> is<00:00:38.540> used<00:00:38.570> for<00:00:38.899> studying

a use a little scope you need to look at
something<00:00:47.660> that's<00:00:47.900> really<00:00:48.200> really<00:00:48.440> tiny<00:00:48.620> too

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
something that's really really tiny too

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.750 
something that's really really tiny too
small<00:00:49.160> for<00:00:49.340> your<00:00:49.460> eye<00:00:49.520> to<00:00:49.670> see<00:00:49.790> any<00:00:50.450> blow<00:00:50.660> out

small for your eye to see any blow out

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.220 
small for your eye to see any blow out
this<00:00:52.760> turns<00:00:53.060> out<00:00:53.150> to<00:00:53.210> be<00:00:53.329> really<00:00:53.570> really<00:00:53.690> handy

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
this turns out to be really really handy

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.590 
this turns out to be really really handy
if<00:00:54.440> you<00:00:54.860> want<00:00:55.100> to<00:00:55.190> study<00:00:55.430> cells<00:00:56.030> for<00:00:56.570> example

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
if you want to study cells for example

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.870 
if you want to study cells for example
like<00:00:57.260> bacteria<00:00:58.070> you<00:00:58.220> want<00:00:58.399> to<00:00:58.460> understand

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
like bacteria you want to understand

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.220 
like bacteria you want to understand
food<00:00:59.060> poisoning<00:00:59.510> you<00:00:59.630> want<00:00:59.780> to<00:00:59.870> understand

food poisoning you want to understand
disease<00:01:00.350> you<00:01:00.950> want<00:01:01.160> to<00:01:01.250> understand<00:01:01.730> how

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
disease you want to understand how

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.100 
disease you want to understand how
viruses<00:01:02.149> spread<00:01:02.450> you<00:01:02.600> got<00:01:02.720> to<00:01:02.809> be<00:01:02.899> able<00:01:02.989> to

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
viruses spread you got to be able to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.810 
viruses spread you got to be able to
actually<00:01:03.500> look<00:01:03.680> at<00:01:03.800> them<00:01:03.980> to<00:01:04.129> see<00:01:04.309> them<00:01:04.460> if<00:01:04.640> you

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
actually look at them to see them if you

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.280 
actually look at them to see them if you
can<00:01:05.000> understand<00:01:05.449> how<00:01:05.600> big<00:01:05.899> they<00:01:06.079> are<00:01:06.110> how

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
can understand how big they are how

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.350 
can understand how big they are how
small<00:01:06.710> they<00:01:06.920> are<00:01:06.950> what<00:01:07.520> their<00:01:07.700> shapes<00:01:08.090> are

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
small they are what their shapes are

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.600 
small they are what their shapes are
what<00:01:08.869> their<00:01:09.049> form<00:01:09.590> is<00:01:09.979> if<00:01:10.159> you<00:01:10.250> can<00:01:10.369> get<00:01:10.460> the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
what their form is if you can get the

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.920 
what their form is if you can get the
form<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:11.030> can<00:01:11.180> get<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:11.390> function<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:11.869> you

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
form you can get the function and you

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.959 
form you can get the function and you
can<00:01:11.990> get<00:01:12.290> some<00:01:12.560> understanding<00:01:13.310> you<00:01:13.700> want<00:01:13.880> to

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
can get some understanding you want to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.760 
can get some understanding you want to
build<00:01:14.090> a<00:01:14.149> microchip<00:01:14.659> you<00:01:15.110> need<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.350> microscope

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
build a microchip you need a microscope

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.140 
build a microchip you need a microscope
now<00:01:18.100> that<00:01:19.100> means<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:19.520> microscope<00:01:20.000> is

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
now that means that a microscope is

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.550 
now that means that a microscope is
really<00:01:20.390> really<00:01:20.570> useful<00:01:20.930> for<00:01:21.049> looking<00:01:21.440> at

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
really really useful for looking at

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.690 
really really useful for looking at
things<00:01:21.650> that<00:01:21.830> are<00:01:21.890> too<00:01:22.070> small<00:01:22.280> now<00:01:22.460> let's

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
things that are too small now let's

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.960 
things that are too small now let's
consider<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.950> kinds<00:01:24.950> of<00:01:25.070> questions<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.790> we

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
consider the kinds of questions that we

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.170 
consider the kinds of questions that we
answer<00:01:26.299> with<00:01:26.690> statistics<00:01:27.790> we<00:01:28.790> talk<00:01:29.000> about

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
answer with statistics we talk about

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.539 
answer with statistics we talk about
things<00:01:29.390> like<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:30.229> population<00:01:30.770> of<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.190> United

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
that's statistics so you won't
