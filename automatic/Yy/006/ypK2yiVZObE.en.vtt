00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.370
 It was the itu where it was detailed that in 1938 at this point I was going to teach 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.040
 they should do it when the citi unit disappears by the audio unit 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.369
 for this week they start 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.849
 all the programs 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.769
 an accessory 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.769
 and he the deputy 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.470
 already here he writes between armies 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.320
 5 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.730
 and already without reilly points 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.729
 refuse to accept 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:34.080
 and it is in this window 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.570
 are given here in the plot part of this one seems that local machin bark 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.830
 Silvan attend 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.830
 get control c 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.280
 control 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.860
 and here they are going to unclog people says the state petite perisic classes 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.040
 na-dyn 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.640
 and here they must choose the file 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.739
 that is exactly the same as what I'm going to leave in the description of the bid 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.850
 they must be very careful they must make sure they are the same letters 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.550
 same number 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.470
 because if they can choose what is not 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.470
 will be worth the problem later 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.870
 and here in exile 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.870
 these two are going to come out 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.670
 which are the ones that you should erase 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.210
 this minute mind those two I'm also going to watch it to be seen 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.750
 carefully and make no mistake 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.020
 I'm telling you because you can leave these messi tours 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.100
 with the difference that they have the point backs 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.150
 these do not touch them by p 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
 they are not the ones that really correspond to the sports unit 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.680
 dot pack not the top ten 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.030
 they are only this is the ons the filters high kiva jobs 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.119
 good and this way they want 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.690
 before showing it 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.550
 they can make a copy 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.999
 for silvia in case they can not 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.489
 she needs later 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.569
 for weaning they go towards meager 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.679
 and they give him to export 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:21.529
 I saw it you were beside you do not know to the folder so give you want 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.539
 so you can locate it quickly in case you need it 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.289
 already here then if not more the arch well 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.179
 they give you right click by age delete 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:37.029
 once removed they close 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.159
 I started on the computer 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:45.749
 and when they turn it on they will realize what each resemblance is 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.619
 citi unit 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:53.019
 it's all as I told you as I told you previously it worked because it happened to me 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.169
 to me 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:59.309
 immediately restart it I realized that situation affects 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:00.879
 good i like this 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.149
 I hope the tutorial is useful 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.139
 and see you in the next 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:05.849
