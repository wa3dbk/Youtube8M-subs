00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
welcome to my first vegetable garden

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.370 
welcome to my first vegetable garden
today<00:00:02.550> I<00:00:02.580> want<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.879> talk<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.300> you<00:00:03.389> about<00:00:04.020> the

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
today I want to talk to you about the

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.200 
today I want to talk to you about the
three<00:00:04.560> main<00:00:04.830> ingredients<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:05.730> are<00:00:05.879> used<00:00:05.910> to

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
three main ingredients that are used to

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.639 
three main ingredients that are used to
make<00:00:06.359> seed<00:00:06.660> starting<00:00:07.080> mix<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.500> is

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
make seed starting mix and this is

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.680 
make seed starting mix and this is
really<00:00:08.220> my<00:00:08.429> first<00:00:08.670> video<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.330> series<00:00:09.360> of

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
really my first video in a series of

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.650 
really my first video in a series of
videos<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.290> show<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.590> how<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:11.490> can<00:00:11.880> start

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
videos to show you how you can start

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.150 
videos to show you how you can start
seeds<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.110> doors<00:00:13.290> grow<00:00:13.679> your<00:00:13.860> own

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
seeds and doors grow your own

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.760 
seeds and doors grow your own
transplants<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.179> save<00:00:15.780> some<00:00:16.049> money<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.560> main

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
transplants and save some money the main

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.700 
transplants and save some money the main
ingredients<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.430> seed<00:00:17.609> starting<00:00:18.029> mix<00:00:18.240> are

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
ingredients in seed starting mix are

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.650 
ingredients in seed starting mix are
perlite<00:00:19.710> which<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> volcanic<00:00:20.760> glass<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
perlite which is a volcanic glass and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.240 
perlite which is a volcanic glass and
it's<00:00:22.260> actually<00:00:22.680> heated<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> high

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
it's actually heated to a high

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.700 
it's actually heated to a high
temperature<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.240> expands<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.109> will

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
temperature and it expands and this will

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.790 
temperature and it expands and this will
add<00:00:25.890> aeration<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.000> drainage<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:28.470> your<00:00:28.590> seed

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
add aeration and drainage to your seed

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.849 
add aeration and drainage to your seed
starting<00:00:29.189> mix<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.550> vermiculite<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.859> silicon

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
starting mix is vermiculite is a silicon

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.430 
starting mix is vermiculite is a silicon
and<00:00:32.070> when<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.700> heated<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.600> also<00:00:33.780> expands

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
and when this is heated it also expands

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.830 
and when this is heated it also expands
so<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.130> adds<00:00:35.370> aeration<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.180> drainage<00:00:36.630> to

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
so this adds aeration and drainage to

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.290 
so this adds aeration and drainage to
your<00:00:36.960> seed<00:00:37.140> starting<00:00:37.530> mix<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.850> peat<00:00:39.120> moss

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
your seed starting mix this is peat moss

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.549 
your seed starting mix this is peat moss
and<00:00:39.710> peat<00:00:40.710> moss<00:00:41.480> really<00:00:42.480> absorbs<00:00:42.960> water<00:00:43.230> this

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
and peat moss really absorbs water this

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.260 
and peat moss really absorbs water this
is<00:00:43.620> going<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> retain<00:00:44.309> water<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:45.000> going<00:00:45.210> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
is going to retain water it's going to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.389 
is going to retain water it's going to
retain<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:46.469> nutrients<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.129> may<00:00:47.340> be

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
retain the nutrients that you may be

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.060 
retain the nutrients that you may be
putting<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.090> form<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> liquid<00:00:49.110> fertilizers

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
putting in in form of liquid fertilizers

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.560 
putting in in form of liquid fertilizers
but<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.879> going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> hold<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> moisture

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
but this is going to hold the moisture

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.479 
but this is going to hold the moisture
these<00:00:52.440> two<00:00:52.710> are<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.039> help<00:00:53.219> with

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
these two are going to help with

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.520 
these two are going to help with
aeration<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.300> drainage<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.020> these<00:00:55.350> are

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
aeration and drainage and these are

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.720 
aeration and drainage and these are
really<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.070> three<00:00:56.399> main<00:00:56.550> ingredients

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
really just the three main ingredients

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.479 
really just the three main ingredients
that<00:00:57.390> make<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> seed<00:00:57.989> starting<00:00:58.469> mix<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.250> reason

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
that make a seed starting mix the reason

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.830 
that make a seed starting mix the reason
I<00:00:59.550> wanted<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.820> show<00:00:59.910> them<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.719> so

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
less expensive to make the seed starting

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.620 
less expensive to make the seed starting
mix<00:01:23.340> yourself<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> video<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.450> that

moss<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.820> see<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.450> perlite<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.409> it's

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
moss and you can see the perlite so it's

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.679 
moss and you can see the perlite so it's
nothing<00:01:46.920> fancy<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.060> about<00:01:48.390> four

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
nothing fancy and this is about four

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.690 
nothing fancy and this is about four
dollars<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.229> twenty-five<00:01:49.619> cents<00:01:49.920> maybe<00:01:50.579> a

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
dollars and twenty-five cents maybe a

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.700 
dollars and twenty-five cents maybe a
little<00:01:51.000> bit<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.329> little<00:01:51.659> bit<00:01:51.810> more<00:01:51.930> per<00:01:52.500> bag

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
little bit a little bit more per bag

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.859 
little bit a little bit more per bag
this<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> good<00:01:53.729> way<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.299> really<00:01:54.509> start

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
this is a good way to really start

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.840 
this is a good way to really start
because<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.200> also<00:01:55.350> has<00:01:55.530> fertilizer<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> so

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
because it also has fertilizer in it so

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.209 
because it also has fertilizer in it so
all<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.390> do<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:58.229> buy<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.979> then

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
all you have to do is buy this and then

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.859 
all you have to do is buy this and then
set<00:01:59.490> up<00:01:59.520> your<00:01:59.640> seed<00:01:59.939> cells<00:02:00.270> or<00:02:00.420> your<00:02:00.509> cups<00:02:00.719> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
set up your seed cells or your cups and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.330 
set up your seed cells or your cups and
I'm<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.170> show<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.649> how<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.890> do<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.250> in
