I'm<00:01:31.990> hoping<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.590> small<00:01:32.830> box<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.590> yep<00:01:35.980> this<00:01:36.190> is

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
I'm hoping the small box and yep this is

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.210 
I'm hoping the small box and yep this is
the<00:01:36.460> camera<00:01:37.330> itself<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:38.470> get<00:01:38.620> out<00:01:38.800> of<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.980> box

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
the camera itself to get out of the box

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.340 
the camera itself to get out of the box
put<00:01:39.490> this<00:01:39.610> small<00:01:39.880> bus<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.720> back<00:01:40.930> over<00:01:41.140> here

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
put this small bus to the back over here

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.910 
put this small bus to the back over here
and<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:42.610> is<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:43.090> camera<00:01:43.650> really<00:01:44.650> nicely

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
and this is the camera really nicely

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.850 
and this is the camera really nicely
packaged

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.640 

let's<00:01:52.850> take<00:01:53.000> this<00:01:53.150> clip<00:01:53.540> boy<00:01:53.780> out<00:01:53.990> right<00:01:54.320> here

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
let's take this clip boy out right here

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.960 
let's take this clip boy out right here
and<00:01:55.360> this<00:01:56.360> is<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.750> camera<00:01:57.230> looks<00:01:57.970> pretty

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
and this is the camera looks pretty

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.870 
and this is the camera looks pretty
small<00:01:59.330> honestly<00:02:00.170> if<00:02:00.290> you<00:02:00.410> ask<00:02:00.590> me<00:02:00.800> as<00:02:01.070> compared

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
small honestly if you ask me as compared

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.190 
small honestly if you ask me as compared
to<00:02:01.910> you<00:02:02.030> like<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.270> teeth<00:02:02.480> free<00:02:02.750> I<00:02:02.780> think<00:02:03.080> it's

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
to you like the teeth free I think it's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.580 
to you like the teeth free I think it's
a<00:02:03.260> little<00:02:03.380> smaller<00:02:03.800> so<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:05.000> kind<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.480> a<00:02:05.630> good
