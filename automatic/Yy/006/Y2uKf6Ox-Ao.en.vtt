00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.420
 and 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.010
 for everyone in miguel rivera and good 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.350
 we continue with kazmir with one of the 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.910
 most curious parts especially for the 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.430
 theme of the tuning that we discussed in 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.920
 the first video we have refined the first 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.960
 rope in the and the second did not forgive the 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.570
 first rope in network one tone less 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.610
 it's usually we watch it go down re and the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.290
 second in which it is also a tone 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.140
 less usually it is in if we lower it 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.449
 to and what it does in this area if you 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.850
 you fix with the little finger on the 12th fret 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.940
 the first string the 3 finger also in 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.100
 the 12th of the third and the 2th finger in the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.500
 fourth string also fret 12 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.530
 the second that is the note talk is 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.300
 it's on the air and it's going to play all the time 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.650
 doing the same thing do not touch these four 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.690
 ropes from the room below 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.000
 and then change finger 3 to finger 1 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.450
 that will be put on the 11th fret of the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.450
 third 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.580
 our same 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.830
 it repeats in 10 putting these three 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.140
 fingers are 10 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.860
 then in 7 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.520
 5 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.520
 and three 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.010
 then it stays 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.500
 do not 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.280
 we have all placed in fa because 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.280
 make family 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.759
 the whole family of 324 repeats to the air 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.940
 and come back here taking advantage of the fourth 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.940
 air 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.540
 and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.610
 When I return to the river, go to this part 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.480
 where you use your finger a third 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.400
 rope and finger three in 5a 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.470
 it does not start from the beginning like 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.360
 when we did the rest good this is 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.850
 the part of 1000 houses that is quite 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.890
 curiously good this has been another part of 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.770
 the great song of led zeppelin smith 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.420
 I hope you like it even though 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.580
 cat that we have to send the financing 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.200
 of the strings but good if something wants 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.350
 something costs so that nothing we see the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.350
 next
