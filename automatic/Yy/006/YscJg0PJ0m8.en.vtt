to<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> UK<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.760> one<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.789> only<00:00:24.090> build

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
to the UK this is the one and only build

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.929 
to the UK this is the one and only build
that<00:00:24.980> was<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.130> ultimate<00:00:26.220> build<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:26.880> it

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
that was the ultimate build so it

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.490 
that was the ultimate build so it
actually<00:00:27.090> comes<00:00:27.359> with<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.599> clear<00:00:27.960> side<00:00:28.170> panel

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
actually comes with a clear side panel

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.669 
actually comes with a clear side panel
which<00:00:29.160> I've<00:00:29.310> quite<00:00:29.789> made<00:00:30.060> yet<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.679> we

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
which I've quite made yet and we

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.459 
which I've quite made yet and we
finished<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.489> entire<00:00:32.910> case<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:34.320> I'll<00:00:34.410> show

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
finished the entire case so I'll show

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.380 
finished the entire case so I'll show
you<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> inside<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> second<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.760> he's

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
you the inside in a second and he's

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.209 
you the inside in a second and he's
taken<00:00:36.750> advantage<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> engraving<00:00:37.860> option

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
taken advantage of the engraving option

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.139 
taken advantage of the engraving option
which<00:00:38.370> some<00:00:38.690> has<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:40.079> Mirissa<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.730> front

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
which some has in Mirissa on the front

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.660 
which some has in Mirissa on the front
and<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.360> top<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.020> he<00:00:43.860> hasn't<00:00:44.129> chosen<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.489> put

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
and the top and he hasn't chosen to put

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.670 
and the top and he hasn't chosen to put
anything<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> front<00:00:45.360> panel<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.260> on

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
anything on the front panel on the on

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.369 
anything on the front panel on the on
this<00:00:46.860> panel<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:47.420> that's<00:00:48.420> up<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> him<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.050> looks

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
this panel but that's up to him it looks

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.850 
this panel but that's up to him it looks
really<00:00:50.190> good<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:52.590> switch

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
really good I really like it just switch

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.270 
really good I really like it just switch
to<00:00:53.039> manual<00:00:53.340> focus<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.739> you<00:00:55.739> see<00:00:56.010> what<00:00:56.129> we've

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
to manual focus and you see what we've

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.720 
to manual focus and you see what we've
done<00:00:57.469> you'll<00:00:58.469> see<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.859> there's<00:00:59.160> still<00:00:59.520> some

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
done you'll see that there's still some

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.630 
done you'll see that there's still some
bits<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.120> I've<00:01:00.270> got<00:01:00.420> polish<00:01:01.340> I'm<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.579> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
bits that I've got polish I'm going to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.140 
bits that I've got polish I'm going to
be<00:01:02.730> doing<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.090> quite<00:01:04.080> soon<00:01:04.439> anyway<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.990> yeah

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
be doing that quite soon anyway and yeah

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.850 
be doing that quite soon anyway and yeah
looks<00:01:09.150> fairly<00:01:09.930> good<00:01:12.260> there<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.380> go<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.770> can

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
looks fairly good there you go you can

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.800 
looks fairly good there you go you can
see<00:01:14.070> everything<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:15.299> main<00:01:15.509> difference

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
see everything the main difference

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.450 
see everything the main difference
between<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.830> prototype<00:01:17.280> is

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
between this and the prototype is

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.390 
between this and the prototype is
there's<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.790> lot<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.060> profile<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.830> side

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
there's a lot of profile and the side

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.340 
there's a lot of profile and the side
I'm<00:01:21.119> trying<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:21.630> focus<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.110> side

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
I'm trying to the right focus the side

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.830 
I'm trying to the right focus the side
door<00:01:22.530> actually<00:01:22.920> acts<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.090> vent<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.689> you've

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
door actually acts as a vent so you've

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.929 
door actually acts as a vent so you've
got<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.049> vent<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:25.740> which<00:01:26.520> goes<00:01:26.729> all<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
got this vent here which goes all the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.240 
got this vent here which goes all the
way<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.259> major<00:01:28.470> change<00:01:28.829> was<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
way in and the major change was that

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.789 
way in and the major change was that
sucks<00:01:30.150> air<00:01:30.329> from<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.570> bottom<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.140> from<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
sucks air from the bottom and from the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.120 
sucks air from the bottom and from the
side<00:01:32.009> as<00:01:32.189> well<00:01:32.630> which<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.659> good<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.890> then<00:01:34.979> as

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
side as well which is good and then as

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.920 
side as well which is good and then as
we<00:01:35.280> lift<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.640> case<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:36.090> you'll<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.659> able<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
we lift the case up you'll be able to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.649 
we lift the case up you'll be able to
see<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.380> hexagon<00:01:37.860> grid<00:01:38.130> which<00:01:38.970> allows<00:01:39.240> air<00:01:39.630> to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
see the hexagon grid which allows air to

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.149 
see the hexagon grid which allows air to
go<00:01:39.930> into<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.320> 140<00:01:41.100> mm<00:01:41.280> fan<00:01:42.649> I'll<00:01:43.649> open<00:01:43.920> up<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
go into the 140 mm fan I'll open up the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.940 
go into the 140 mm fan I'll open up the
case<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.729> see<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.840> intern<00:01:46.200> it's

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
case so you can see the the intern it's

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.050 
case so you can see the the intern it's
actually<00:01:47.250> quite<00:01:47.340> difficult<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.820> explain

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
actually quite difficult to explain

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.880 
actually quite difficult to explain
everything<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:48.899> fit<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:49.409> you'd<00:01:49.740> be
