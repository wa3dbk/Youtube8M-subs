game however the game was pretty and I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.870 
game however the game was pretty and I
don't<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.229> kind<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.710> slow<00:01:41.040> paced<00:01:41.369> after

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
don't know it's kind of slow paced after

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.480 
don't know it's kind of slow paced after
that<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.990> had<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.380> go<00:01:43.409> ultra<00:01:43.829> attacking<00:01:44.340> in

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that and I had to go ultra attacking in

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.520 
that and I had to go ultra attacking in
the<00:01:44.520> second<00:01:45.090> half<00:01:45.299> most<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:45.990> anyway<00:01:46.140> and

back of the net to give him the 3-1
victory<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.860> much<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.189> could<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.520> had<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.939> go

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
victory not much I could do I had to go

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.460 
victory not much I could do I had to go
up<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.329> attacking<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.049> counter-attack

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
up to attacking and the counter-attack

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
up to attacking and the counter-attack
was<00:01:55.770> always<00:01:56.159> there<00:01:56.369> for<00:01:56.579> him<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.000> fast

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
was always there for him with the fast

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.999 
was always there for him with the fast
players<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.780> had<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> team<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.380> you

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
players that you had in the team and you

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.100 
players that you had in the team and you
see<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.399> we<00:01:59.549> end<00:01:59.700> up<00:01:59.909> taking<00:02:00.420> no<00:02:00.600> points<00:02:00.990> from

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
see that we end up taking no points from

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.139 
see that we end up taking no points from
my<00:02:01.229> first<00:02:01.409> game<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.009> new<00:02:02.369> division<00:02:02.909> so

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
my first game in the new division so

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.899 
my first game in the new division so
that's<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:03.869> good<00:02:04.079> going<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:05.460> may<00:02:05.700> mean

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
that's not good going and it may mean

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.160 
that's not good going and it may mean
that<00:02:05.969> we're<00:02:06.180> not<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.689> even<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:06.960> able<00:02:07.049> to

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
that we're not going to even be able to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.050 
that we're not going to even be able to
challenge<00:02:07.439> for<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> title<00:02:08.429> we'll<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:08.940> to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
challenge for the title we'll have to

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.180 
challenge for the title we'll have to
see<00:02:09.179> how<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.330> next<00:02:09.539> few<00:02:09.840> goals<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:10.619> games<00:02:10.860> go

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
see how the next few goals all games go

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.260 
see how the next few goals all games go
so<00:02:11.760> our<00:02:12.090> next<00:02:12.450> game<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.900> again

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
so our next game is again

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.420 
so our next game is again
a<00:02:13.420> pretty<00:02:14.110> much<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> full<00:02:14.560> silver<00:02:14.950> team<00:02:15.130> by<00:02:15.370> the

a pretty much a full silver team by the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.520 
a pretty much a full silver team by the
fact<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:15.730> he's<00:02:15.880> got<00:02:16.120> Walker<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:17.380> that

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
of the net in the very first so it was a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.550 
of the net in the very first so it was a
bit<00:02:49.300> of<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.420> backwards<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:49.870> forwards<00:02:50.140> game<00:02:50.320> as

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
bit of a backwards and forwards game as

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.870 
bit of a backwards and forwards game as
you<00:02:50.680> see<00:02:50.860> here<00:02:51.130> he<00:02:51.190> came<00:02:51.370> down<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.700> wing

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
have been an equal gain if not we should

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.730 
have been an equal gain if not we should
have<00:05:59.539> won<00:05:59.720> because<00:05:59.930> we<00:06:00.140> had<00:06:00.260> slightly<00:06:00.500> more

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
have won because we had slightly more

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.080 
have won because we had slightly more
chances<00:06:01.190> maybe<00:06:01.490> we<00:06:01.669> should<00:06:01.820> have<00:06:01.910> been<00:06:01.970> more

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090

see that we are playing cargo at center

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.930

attacking<00:06:25.010> mid<00:06:25.160> even<00:06:25.490> though<00:06:25.610> we're<00:06:25.789> using

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
attacking mid even though we're using

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.460

his left mid version Arizona getting
five<00:06:27.620> chemistry<00:06:28.100> but<00:06:28.520> he<00:06:28.789> played<00:06:29.090> fantastic

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
five chemistry but he played fantastic

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.240 
five chemistry but he played fantastic
haven't<00:06:30.440> really<00:06:30.620> been<00:06:30.740> enjoying<00:06:30.919> using

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
haven't really been enjoying using

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.219 
haven't really been enjoying using
cleverly<00:06:31.700> as<00:06:31.820> the<00:06:31.940> backup<00:06:32.270> center<00:06:32.840> attacking

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
cleverly as the backup center attacking

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:34.980 
cleverly as the backup center attacking
mid<00:06:33.350> for<00:06:33.500> Rooney<00:06:33.680> so<00:06:34.190> I<00:06:34.220> thought<00:06:34.430> I'd<00:06:34.580> put

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
mid for Rooney so I thought I'd put

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.240 
mid for Rooney so I thought I'd put
taggarak<00:06:35.990> there<00:06:36.229> and<00:06:36.409> he<00:06:36.470> played<00:06:36.710> so<00:06:36.950> good<00:06:36.979> I

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
taggarak there and he played so good I

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.250 
taggarak there and he played so good I
mean<00:06:37.580> you<00:06:38.000> see<00:06:38.180> here<00:06:38.539> that<00:06:38.570> you<00:06:38.840> ends<00:06:39.110> up

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
mean you see here that you ends up

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.940 
mean you see here that you ends up
