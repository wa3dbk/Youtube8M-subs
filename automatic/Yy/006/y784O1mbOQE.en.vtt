00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
are your helicopters a beautiful sky is

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.369 
are your helicopters a beautiful sky is
has<00:00:44.309> beautiful<00:00:44.820> bowing<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.230> little

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
has beautiful bowing and it's a little

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.660 
has beautiful bowing and it's a little
tricky<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:46.950> we're<00:00:47.399> going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> change

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
tricky because we're going to change

00:00:47.670 --> 00:01:00.020 
tricky because we're going to change
strings<00:00:48.239> pretty<00:00:48.629> fast

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.810 

and<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> trick<00:01:01.110> here<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:02.100> know<00:01:02.520> that

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and the trick here is to know that

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.280 
and the trick here is to know that
you're<00:01:02.970> going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.210> change<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.630> strings<00:01:04.050> and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you're going to change the strings and

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.240 
you're going to change the strings and
have<00:01:04.920> your<00:01:05.220> bow<00:01:05.460> hair<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:07.230> close<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
have your bow hair be close to the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.550 
have your bow hair be close to the
string<00:01:08.580> you're<00:01:08.790> going<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.570> sew<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:13.140> close<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
string you're going to sew so close to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.110 
string you're going to sew so close to
the<00:01:13.680> e<00:01:13.710> I'm<00:01:14.130> almost<00:01:14.520> touching<00:01:14.940> it<00:01:16.730> how<00:01:17.730> smooth

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
the e I'm almost touching it how smooth

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.480 
the e I'm almost touching it how smooth
is<00:01:18.300> that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.660 

so<00:01:24.120> practice<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.570> until<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.500> are<00:01:25.670> smoother

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
so practice that until you are smoother

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.420 
so practice that until you are smoother
than<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.970> am<00:01:27.229> dr.<00:01:28.229> Suzuki<00:01:28.530> said<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> student

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
than I am dr. Suzuki said the student

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.540 
than I am dr. Suzuki said the student
should<00:01:29.610> always<00:01:29.760> be<00:01:30.060> better<00:01:30.240> than<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> teacher

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
should always be better than the teacher

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.859 
should always be better than the teacher
then<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.940> next<00:01:33.180> part<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.510> little<00:01:33.600> tricky

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
then the next part is a little tricky

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.719 
then the next part is a little tricky
for<00:01:34.380> fingers<00:01:34.800> we're<00:01:35.130> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> start<00:01:35.610> with

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
for fingers we're going to start with

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.570 
for fingers we're going to start with
our<00:01:35.880> third<00:01:36.090> finger<00:01:36.360> all<00:01:36.750> by<00:01:36.960> itself<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.710> come

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
our third finger all by itself and come

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.540 
our third finger all by itself and come
down<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.390> be<00:01:39.540> careful<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.020> keep<00:01:40.080> your

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
down so be careful to keep your

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.520 
down so be careful to keep your
helicopters<00:01:44.930> then<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> same<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
helicopters then the same on the a

00:01:46.530 --> 00:02:00.680 
helicopters then the same on the a
string<00:01:52.640> break<00:01:53.640> your<00:01:53.909> elbow<00:01:54.240> under

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.040 

so<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.500> helicopter<00:02:01.950> challenge<00:02:02.700> time<00:02:03.060> so

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
so this is helicopter challenge time so

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.470 
so this is helicopter challenge time so
let's<00:02:04.320> watch<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:05.070> again<00:02:05.220> this<00:02:06.180> time<00:02:06.240> a

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
let's watch that again this time a

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:23.270 
let's watch that again this time a
little<00:02:06.660> faster

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.370 

as<00:02:24.120> soon<00:02:24.330> as<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.690> do<00:02:24.810> your<00:02:24.960> left<00:02:25.170> hand

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
as soon as you can do your left hand

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.620 
as soon as you can do your left hand
immediately<00:02:26.130> go<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.520> bow<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.030> try<00:02:27.570> to

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
immediately go to the bow and try to

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:42.550 
immediately go to the bow and try to
make<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:27.900> really<00:02:28.440> smooth

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.949 

and<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.370> challenge<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.150> get<00:02:44.270> coordinated

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
and the challenge is to get coordinated

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.840 
and the challenge is to get coordinated
your<00:02:45.470> left<00:02:45.709> hand<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.310> right<00:02:46.490> hand<00:02:46.550> with

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
your left hand and right hand with

beautiful posture a beautiful tone and
here<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:49.910> is<00:02:49.970> all<00:02:50.180> together

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.809 

and<00:03:26.819> that's<00:03:27.049> halfway<00:03:28.049> through<00:03:28.439> the<00:03:28.590> song<00:03:28.829> and

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
and that's halfway through the song and

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.580 
and that's halfway through the song and
you<00:03:29.969> play<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.329> another<00:03:30.659> time<00:03:30.989> all<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.439> way

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
you play it another time all the way

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:40.640 
you play it another time all the way
through<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.249> end<00:03:38.569> it's<00:03:39.569> really<00:03:39.959> undo<00:03:40.469> your
