00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:13.250
 good afternoon as i promised i will show how 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:17.390
 I cooked and painted eggs for Easter as I 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.939
 I'll send you a sample now 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.640
 clearly and then I will do myself 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.099
 it will be pure thursday or saturday i 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.320
 I will paint the eggs and this is me for 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.840
 visibility made for them painted 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.030
 I tried the first time to paint in blue 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:41.820
 cabbage blue blue cabbage juice I took 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.480
 I cut them into a saucepan 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.469
 flooded with water 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:53.760
 added salt to one pot another 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.090
 added vinegar like the internet then this 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.920
 in general, then laid eggs and I praised that 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.120
 I cooked each pot separately 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.070
 one egg each 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.739
 start there and there is nothing 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.409
 happened I do not know why but I 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.200
 nothing happened drown brought this 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:17.220
 water and this is all night and half a day with me 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:20.580
 this egg was standing here in this water in 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.220
 this is his grandfather well, that is, it turned out the egg 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.689
 it's like a little blue 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.060
 but I didn't like it, I like it 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.850
 mothers how much she shot it here 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.360
 worked on him that is but maybe 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.470
 I did something wrong I do not know but 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.060
 no color is saturated 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.939
 uneven such a paint not but not 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.220
 It came therefore I will certainly stop 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.939
 like all previous waters 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.790
 I will paint an egg show husk without me 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.640
 I understood everything was clear for this 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.820
 the husk and and opened it here to us not that is 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.030
 what did I say lyrical peel well 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.759
 but such are light we are all one 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.710
 cancellation protection in onion skins so I 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.440
 I collected this view when showing it 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.560
 boiled well she did not really 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:19.370
 and here are two eggs I cooked in 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:23.930
 and onion peel here is this egg 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.550
 brown egg this white egg 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.880
 slightly lighter this one slightly or darker 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.569
 I like the color uniform 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.300
 now it’s ecologically clean but it’s also 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.220
 classic pure cabbage but light i 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.870
 design can be a jester and taken 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.900
 even went special internet 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.640
 look may be really necessary 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.250
 somehow there might be something different 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.080
 need another satisfied not replace me not 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.239
 I liked absolutely I did not like 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.080
 but now you see what I did I 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.600
 put a sunflower on this table 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.120
 oil and here I clearly show how I 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.970
 touched by dipped egg 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.890
 it rubs here's a matte 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:11.549
 turns but brilliant beautiful such 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.440
 Here I say such a dark dark cherry 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.209
 generally a long time ago like plum blossom 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.620
 but it turns out I recommend 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.630
 I recommend myself more 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.920
 such experiments will not do well 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.620
 chemical dyes i never 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.060
 I did not want to change this. 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.329
 red onion peel 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.280
 so I will continue to paint here well 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:37.160
 see for yourself see rate me 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.160
 It seems that it is worthy of attention
