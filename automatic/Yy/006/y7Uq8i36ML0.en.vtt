00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.120
 another video here on alexis day with 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.570
 a short video to two cool iphone 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.000
 cases for the iphone 4 and iphone 4s of 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.440
 Many thanks to the company arri on the spot 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.470
 because they have the cases for me 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.869
 provided and yes if we 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.900
 once on the right side the brushed 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.359
 steelcase in silver and here the soft 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.340
 Case in white, I know the short side 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.080
 and we look at short softkeys 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.550
 on 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.920
 and yes it often cases out of a gel 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.270
 plastic like that here now 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.399
 is transparent then there is in whole 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.430
 many different colors here 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.030
 as I said white almost transparent and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.559
 yes the cheese pretty cool protects that 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.059
 iphone pretty good you have hands 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.270
 Of course the opening for the camera 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.059
 Do you have the foil button is covered 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.399
 the new switches free up here 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.129
 Of course, the headphone input 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.469
 Free the power button is also covered 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.090
 and and dock connectors on the free that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.309
 means he gets on really well 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.899
 and yes as I said is one 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.250
 pretty simple the case may last 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.939
 but of course there are gaudy ones 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.560
 to dye 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.409
 that is not human that me 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.210
 still cool and protects it 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.710
 iphone well offended any case because that 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.259
 So over here too is over 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.330
 this edge, so to speak, even if 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.439
 it lies so it is not on the glass 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.150
 but also on the case of therefore 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.990
 pretty cool too could just go off 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.880
 because it is quite flexible 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.490
 as I said so from the case pretty well 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.380
 processed plastic anyway 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.750
 said so there are no sharp and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.979
 clean edges or something but said 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.299
 Everything was done pretty well 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.189
 it continues with the industry case that 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.290
 Looks like that and here you have to 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.450
 watch out now at the very beginning 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.310
 Small hint and that's how you do it 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.299
 whole makes you push this, so to speak 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.799
 here so pure because it is pretty tight 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.020
 because as I said the aluminum is 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.670
 So do not be scared or anything 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.280
 but just put it in then 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.939
 click a bit and yes it looks like that 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.560
 whole out 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.800
 on the back you have the 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.980
 camera free and my side you have 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.450
 here the protection once and here that 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.790
 means all the connections are anyway 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.450
 completely free and what I think cool 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.230
 think this is the case really 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.140
 pretty thin is very elastic 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.580
 this applies here over this edge 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.620
 that is, he has indeed here this edge of 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.569
 the glass that is here about it 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.390
 and that's why it's really direct 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.880
 on lying on the iphone 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.730
 and sitting cool as I said 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.019
 pretty hard the case again 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.549
 I really have to do it 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.650
 somehow the first time five minutes 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.150
 needed because it is as said so 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.220
 attention to me sitting inside the can 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.840
 maybe improve somehow 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.730
 However, if you do that then improved 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.959
 of course not so tight that sits 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.400
 I have to think about what you have there 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.739
 want to do or what you would prefer 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.650
 wants something as she said 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.840
 pretty cool and I like it 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.299
 good is also pretty easy the case 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.790
 only 36 grams 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.459
 and yes that's it for those two 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.410
 cases if you are interested in these 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.030
 then win cases easily 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.500
 stay tuned and continue into the canal 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.109
 pursue because there will be soon 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.400
 a nice competition and otherwise 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.900
 do that for this video 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.609
 Thank you for watching us see you 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.609
 in the next video slot 1 until then
