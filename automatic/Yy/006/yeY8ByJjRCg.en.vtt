koten<00:01:36.200> hooklink<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:36.680> without<00:01:36.920> doubt<00:01:37.190> the

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
koten hooklink so without doubt the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.070 
koten hooklink so without doubt the
number<00:01:37.610> one<00:01:37.760> choice<00:01:38.000> for<00:01:38.060> carp<00:01:38.450> anglers<00:01:38.900> I

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
number one choice for carp anglers I

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.930 
number one choice for carp anglers I
think<00:01:39.650> because<00:01:39.860> it's<00:01:39.980> very<00:01:40.130> easy<00:01:40.400> to<00:01:40.670> use

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
think because it's very easy to use

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.150 
think because it's very easy to use
they're<00:01:41.600> very<00:01:41.780> versatile<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.800> they<00:01:42.920> bounce

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
they're very versatile and they bounce

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.890 
they're very versatile and they bounce
angle<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:43.910> let's<00:01:43.940> have<00:01:44.240> a<00:01:44.270> look<00:01:44.420> at<00:01:44.480> our<00:01:44.570> range

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
angle so let's have a look at our range

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.840 
angle so let's have a look at our range
and<00:01:45.200> talk<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:45.830> through<00:01:45.950> when<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.430> use<00:01:46.610> each

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
and talk you through when to use each

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.210 
and talk you through when to use each
one<00:01:46.880> so<00:01:47.360> first<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.810> all<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.440> end<00:01:48.590> trap<00:01:48.860> soft

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
one so first of all the end trap soft

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.820 
one so first of all the end trap soft
this<00:01:49.820> is<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.120> one<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.420> superseded<00:01:51.320> the

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
this is the one that superseded the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.610 
this is the one that superseded the
hybrid<00:01:52.280> soft<00:01:52.630> basically<00:01:53.630> said<00:01:53.810> ìiím<00:01:54.230> a<00:01:54.260> core

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
hybrid soft basically said ìiím a core

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.070 
hybrid soft basically said ìiím a core
so<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:54.920> braided<00:01:55.250> core<00:01:55.700> with<00:01:56.390> a<00:01:56.420> plastic<00:01:56.900> coating

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
so a braided core with a plastic coating

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.690 
so a braided core with a plastic coating
on<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.470> outside<00:01:57.500> comes<00:01:58.280> in<00:01:58.430> three<00:01:58.670> colors

this is the gravel brown one so perfect

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.430 
this is the gravel brown one so perfect
for<00:02:01.550> here<00:02:01.670> at<00:02:01.820> gigantica<00:02:02.570> there's<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.110> weedy

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
for here at gigantica there's a weedy

smaller<00:02:24.950> fish<00:02:25.310> I'd<00:02:25.850> probably<00:02:26.090> use<00:02:26.240> that

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
smaller fish I'd probably use that

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.660 
smaller fish I'd probably use that
because<00:02:26.660> it's<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.930> little<00:02:27.080> more<00:02:27.260> subtle<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:28.220> 20

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
because it's a little more subtle the 20

because it's a little more subtle the 20

for doubles with this one as well very
very<00:02:37.310> versatile<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.780> see<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.050> this<00:02:39.200> one

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
very versatile and you see on this one

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.560 
very versatile and you see on this one
he's<00:02:39.890> fishing<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.370> all<00:02:40.550> straight<00:02:41.150> all<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.450> way

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
he's fishing it all straight all the way

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.360 
he's fishing it all straight all the way
through<00:02:41.900> there's<00:02:42.110> no<00:02:42.260> break<00:02:42.590> in<00:02:42.769> it<00:02:42.860> at<00:02:42.950> all

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
through there's no break in it at all

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.009 
through there's no break in it at all
it's<00:02:43.700> right<00:02:43.940> up<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.360> hook<00:02:44.570> and<00:02:44.780> even

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
it's right up to the hook and even

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.720 
it's right up to the hook and even
they're<00:02:45.140> not<00:02:45.170> he's<00:02:45.890> out<00:02:46.100> of<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.340> coated

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
they're not he's out of the coated

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.390 
they're not he's out of the coated
material<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.480> then<00:02:47.870> he<00:02:47.989> stripped<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.530> away<00:02:48.590> at

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
material and then he stripped it away at

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.550 
material and then he stripped it away at
the<00:02:49.519> top<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.910> knot<00:02:50.120> there<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:51.290> he's<00:02:51.410> got<00:02:51.530> a

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
the top of the knot there so he's got a

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.800 
the top of the knot there so he's got a
soft<00:02:51.860> hair<00:02:52.130> basically<00:02:52.370> so<00:02:53.030> he's<00:02:53.360> combining

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
soft hair basically so he's combining

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.660 
soft hair basically so he's combining
that<00:02:53.900> with<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:54.080> shoddy<00:02:54.350> hook<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.890> it's<00:02:55.280> turning

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
that with a shoddy hook and it's turning

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.009 
that with a shoddy hook and it's turning
the<00:02:55.730> hook<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.030> catching<00:02:56.360> hold<00:02:56.510> very<00:02:56.750> quickly

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
the hook and catching hold very quickly

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.780 
the hook and catching hold very quickly
and<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.320> see<00:02:57.470> at<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.650> other<00:02:57.680> end<00:02:58.040> he's<00:02:58.580> got<00:02:58.760> a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
and you see at the other end he's got a

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.240 
and you see at the other end he's got a
grin<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.150> not<00:02:59.330> tied<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.320> a<00:03:00.350> hybrid<00:03:00.590> LED<00:03:00.980> clip

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
grin and not tied to a hybrid LED clip

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.040 
grin and not tied to a hybrid LED clip
and<00:03:01.700> what's<00:03:01.880> basically<00:03:02.060> gonna<00:03:02.420> happen<00:03:02.810> on<00:03:02.930> the

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
and what's basically gonna happen on the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.990 
and what's basically gonna happen on the
cast<00:03:03.290> because<00:03:03.590> there's<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.950> hinge<00:03:04.190> in<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.730> hook

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
cast because there's a hinge in the hook

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000 
cast because there's a hinge in the hook
link<00:03:05.150> at<00:03:05.360> that<00:03:05.480> point<00:03:05.750> he's<00:03:06.230> gonna<00:03:06.350> fold<00:03:06.680> back

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
link at that point he's gonna fold back

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.190 
link at that point he's gonna fold back
next<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:07.940> dark<00:03:08.180> matter<00:03:08.420> tubing<00:03:09.019> and

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
next to the dark matter tubing and

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.080 
next to the dark matter tubing and
that's<00:03:09.590> basically<00:03:09.980> gonna<00:03:10.220> stop<00:03:10.459> it<00:03:10.610> tangling

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
that's basically gonna stop it tangling

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.880 
that's basically gonna stop it tangling
and<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:11.660> see<00:03:11.840> he's<00:03:11.930> got<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:12.050> big<00:03:12.260> lump<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.560> party

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
and you see he's got a big lump of party

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.080 
and you see he's got a big lump of party
in<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.070> middle<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.489> that's<00:03:13.700> molded

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
in the middle of that that's molded

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.910 
in the middle of that that's molded
around<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.420> sinker<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.260> that<00:03:15.440> just<00:03:15.650> helps

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
around a sinker and that just helps

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.740 
around a sinker and that just helps
everything<00:03:16.250> sink<00:03:16.550> down<00:03:16.760> on<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:16.940> bottom<00:03:17.300> all

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
everything sink down on the bottom all

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.050 
everything sink down on the bottom all
these<00:03:18.080> materials<00:03:18.620> sink<00:03:18.890> on<00:03:19.070> their<00:03:19.220> own<00:03:19.370> but<00:03:19.970> if

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
these materials sink on their own but if

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.460 
these materials sink on their own but if
you<00:03:20.120> put<00:03:20.330> that<00:03:20.450> on<00:03:20.600> there<00:03:20.780> as<00:03:20.900> well<00:03:21.080> if<00:03:21.320> there's

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
you put that on there as well if there's

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.650 
you put that on there as well if there's
any<00:03:21.709> little<00:03:21.920> contours<00:03:22.519> in<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.760> bottom<00:03:23.090> the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
any little contours in the bottom the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.390 
any little contours in the bottom the
hook<00:03:23.810> link<00:03:23.959> will<00:03:24.110> sink<00:03:24.380> into<00:03:24.620> them<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.250> it's

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
hook link will sink into them and it's

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.550 
hook link will sink into them and it's
much<00:03:25.700> much<00:03:25.910> harder<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.450> see<00:03:26.660> if<00:03:27.110> it's<00:03:27.290> pinned

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
much much harder to see if it's pinned

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.430 
much much harder to see if it's pinned
to<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.769> bottom<00:03:28.130> now<00:03:28.820> I've<00:03:29.570> got<00:03:29.780> 30<00:03:30.050> pound

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
to the bottom now I've got 30 pound

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.860 
to the bottom now I've got 30 pound
version<00:03:30.709> here<00:03:31.280> that's<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.030> end<00:03:32.180> trap<00:03:32.390> soft<00:03:32.690> in

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
version here that's the end trap soft in

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
30 pounds still quite a fine hook link

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.699 
30 pounds still quite a fine hook link
for<00:03:35.269> 30<00:03:35.450> pounds<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.019> know<00:03:36.140> a<00:03:36.170> lot<00:03:36.380> of<00:03:36.410> people

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
use this as their number one choice as a

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.420 
use this as their number one choice as a
guide<00:03:38.900> linear<00:03:39.290> at<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.500> moment<00:03:39.890> that<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.250> know

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
guide linear at the moment that I know

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.000 
guide linear at the moment that I know
really<00:03:40.670> well<00:03:40.790> only<00:03:41.330> uses<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.110> 30<00:03:42.320> pound<00:03:42.740> and

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
really well only uses the 30 pound and

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.100 
really well only uses the 30 pound and

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
he absolutely rinses it I said why don't

going<00:03:50.210> to<00:03:50.270> keep<00:03:50.420> using<00:03:50.630> it<00:03:50.840> forever

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
going to keep using it forever

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.230 
going to keep using it forever
this<00:03:51.800> wasn't<00:03:52.010> set<00:03:52.280> up<00:03:52.310> for<00:03:52.640> if<00:03:52.700> I'm<00:03:52.820> fishing<00:03:53.030> at

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
this wasn't set up for if I'm fishing at

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.780 
this wasn't set up for if I'm fishing at
gigantica<00:03:54.020> or<00:03:54.290> any<00:03:54.620> sort<00:03:54.890> of<00:03:54.950> clean<00:03:55.190> bottom<00:03:55.640> if

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
gigantica or any sort of clean bottom if

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.580 
gigantica or any sort of clean bottom if
I'm<00:03:55.910> boilie<00:03:56.270> fishing<00:03:56.300> so<00:03:57.140> it's<00:03:57.260> about<00:03:57.410> eight

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
I'm boilie fishing so it's about eight

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.860 
I'm boilie fishing so it's about eight
inches<00:03:57.950> long<00:03:58.010> got<00:03:58.730> a<00:03:58.760> size<00:03:58.970> four<00:03:59.270> caps<00:03:59.540> a<00:03:59.660> curve

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
inches long got a size four caps a curve

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.660 
inches long got a size four caps a curve
on<00:04:00.050> there<00:04:00.350> and<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.860> little<00:04:01.040> bit<00:04:01.160> by<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.460> hook

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
on there and a little bit by the hook

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.550 
on there and a little bit by the hook
there<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.030> can<00:04:02.180> see<00:04:02.390> there's<00:04:03.080> a<00:04:03.110> little<00:04:03.410> bit

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
there you can see there's a little bit

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.800 
there you can see there's a little bit
strip<00:04:03.860> back<00:04:04.100> so<00:04:04.790> that<00:04:04.940> hook<00:04:05.120> can<00:04:05.270> lift<00:04:05.450> up<00:04:05.660> and

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
strip back so that hook can lift up and

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.450 
strip back so that hook can lift up and
catch<00:04:05.990> hold<00:04:06.290> but<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.560> hook<00:04:06.680> link<00:04:06.800> so<00:04:07.100> soft

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
catch hold but the hook link so soft

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.190 
catch hold but the hook link so soft
anyway<00:04:07.850> to<00:04:07.910> be<00:04:08.060> honest<00:04:08.420> it's<00:04:08.810> going<00:04:09.020> to<00:04:09.080> move

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
anyway to be honest it's going to move

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.470 
anyway to be honest it's going to move
very<00:04:09.500> easily<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:10.280> go<00:04:10.730> up<00:04:10.880> into<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.180> fish's

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
very easily and go up into the fish's

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.020 
very easily and go up into the fish's
mouth<00:04:11.510> you<00:04:12.290> know<00:04:12.410> really<00:04:12.770> quickly<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.820> then

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
mouth you know really quickly and then

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.330 
mouth you know really quickly and then
the<00:04:14.300> next<00:04:14.570> one<00:04:14.750> which<00:04:14.900> is<00:04:15.050> a<00:04:15.080> new<00:04:15.350> one<00:04:15.590> lots<00:04:16.160> of

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
the next one which is a new one lots of

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.580 
the next one which is a new one lots of
people<00:04:16.640> have<00:04:16.760> asked<00:04:17.030> us<00:04:17.090> for<00:04:17.239> this<00:04:17.420> this<00:04:18.320> is

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
people have asked us for this this is

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.560 
people have asked us for this this is
the<00:04:18.739> entrapped<00:04:19.130> semi<00:04:19.550> stiff<00:04:19.910> so<00:04:20.180> straightaway

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
the entrapped semi stiff so straightaway

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.780 
the entrapped semi stiff so straightaway
if<00:04:20.840> I<00:04:20.959> push<00:04:21.230> the<00:04:21.350> hook<00:04:21.470> link<00:04:21.620> together<00:04:21.830> you<00:04:22.610> can

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
if I push the hook link together you can

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.090 
if I push the hook link together you can
see<00:04:22.970> it's<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.180> little<00:04:23.540> bit<00:04:23.720> stiffer<00:04:24.200> than<00:04:24.950> the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
see it's a little bit stiffer than the

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.160 
see it's a little bit stiffer than the
soft<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:26.000> basically<00:04:26.390> it's<00:04:26.540> going<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:26.720> push<00:04:26.960> the

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
soft so basically it's going to push the

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.720 
soft so basically it's going to push the
hook<00:04:27.290> bite<00:04:27.500> away<00:04:27.650> from<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.130> lid<00:04:28.280> that<00:04:28.490> little

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
hook bite away from the lid that little

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.730 
hook bite away from the lid that little
bit<00:04:28.850> better<00:04:29.000> still<00:04:29.540> a<00:04:29.570> brilliant<00:04:30.080> all-rounder

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
bit better still a brilliant all-rounder

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.920 
bit better still a brilliant all-rounder
you<00:04:31.220> can<00:04:31.370> use<00:04:31.520> a<00:04:31.550> soft<00:04:31.850> anywhere<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:32.630> can<00:04:32.780> use

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
you can use a soft anywhere you can use

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.690 
you can use a soft anywhere you can use
this<00:04:33.080> pretty<00:04:33.350> much<00:04:33.560> anywhere<00:04:33.740> as<00:04:34.160> well<00:04:34.190> I'd

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
this pretty much anywhere as well I'd

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.730 
this pretty much anywhere as well I'd
probably<00:04:35.120> avoid<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:35.720> in<00:04:35.810> really<00:04:36.200> heavy<00:04:36.380> weed

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
probably avoid it in really heavy weed

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.010 
probably avoid it in really heavy weed
just<00:04:37.280> because<00:04:37.610> it<00:04:37.970> can<00:04:38.150> come<00:04:38.360> to<00:04:38.540> rest<00:04:38.780> and

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
just because it can come to rest and

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.750 
just because it can come to rest and
because<00:04:39.200> of<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.440> stiffness<00:04:39.650> of<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.550> bike

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
because of the stiffness of it the bike

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.730 
because of the stiffness of it the bike
can<00:04:40.910> end<00:04:41.090> up<00:04:41.180> sitting<00:04:41.480> up<00:04:41.660> in<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.870> weed<00:04:42.110> then

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
can end up sitting up in the weed then

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.350 
can end up sitting up in the weed then
I'd<00:04:42.860> want<00:04:43.040> to<00:04:43.070> go<00:04:43.190> to<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.400> softer<00:04:43.760> hook<00:04:43.940> me<00:04:44.090> but

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
I'd want to go to a softer hook me but

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.870 
I'd want to go to a softer hook me but
for<00:04:44.780> absolutely<00:04:45.260> everything<00:04:45.560> else<00:04:45.920> this<00:04:46.730> is

back<00:05:18.410> near<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.680> hook<00:05:18.980> so<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.700> hook<00:05:19.850> can<00:05:19.970> lift

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
back near the hook so the hook can lift

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.310 
back near the hook so the hook can lift
up<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:20.480> catch<00:05:20.630> hold<00:05:20.900> and<00:05:20.990> that's<00:05:21.050> really

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
up and catch hold and that's really

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.140 
up and catch hold and that's really
important<00:05:21.890> with<00:05:21.950> stiff<00:05:22.220> coated<00:05:22.640> hook<00:05:22.820> links

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
important with stiff coated hook links

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.240 
important with stiff coated hook links
they<00:05:23.540> should<00:05:23.810> be<00:05:23.960> some<00:05:24.290> kind<00:05:24.590> of<00:05:24.740> break<00:05:24.980> in

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
they should be some kind of break in

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.970 
they should be some kind of break in
them<00:05:25.460> so<00:05:25.940> that<00:05:25.970> hook<00:05:26.450> can<00:05:26.660> lift<00:05:26.900> up<00:05:27.140> turn<00:05:27.950> and

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
them so that hook can lift up turn and

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.920 
them so that hook can lift up turn and
catch<00:05:28.400> hold<00:05:28.730> and<00:05:29.000> then<00:05:29.480> I've<00:05:29.600> got<00:05:29.720> the<00:05:29.810> old

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
catch hold and then I've got the old

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.390 
catch hold and then I've got the old
favorite<00:05:30.260> rig<00:05:30.440> ring<00:05:30.620> on<00:05:30.770> there<00:05:31.010> and<00:05:31.160> bit<00:05:31.310> of

favorite rig ring on there and bit of

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.520 
favorite rig ring on there and bit of
shrink<00:05:31.610> tube<00:05:31.820> as<00:05:31.970> well<00:05:32.150> to<00:05:32.780> help<00:05:32.930> that<00:05:33.140> cap<00:05:33.350> to

shrink tube as well to help that cap to

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.500 
shrink tube as well to help that cap to
curve<00:05:33.770> turn<00:05:34.550> over<00:05:34.970> and<00:05:35.150> then<00:05:35.270> at<00:05:35.390> the<00:05:35.480> other

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
curve turn over and then at the other

you<00:05:39.560> could<00:05:39.710> tie<00:05:39.860> a<00:05:39.890> half-blood<00:05:40.400> knot<00:05:40.670> or<00:05:40.850> grin

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
you could tie a half-blood knot or grin

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.700 
you could tie a half-blood knot or grin
or<00:05:41.210> in<00:05:41.300> that<00:05:41.510> but<00:05:41.810> because<00:05:42.020> it<00:05:42.140> is<00:05:42.260> stiff<00:05:42.530> it<00:05:42.650> is

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
or in that but because it is stiff it is

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.250 
or in that but because it is stiff it is
a<00:05:42.770> little<00:05:43.040> bit<00:05:43.160> harder<00:05:43.460> to<00:05:43.490> do<00:05:43.790> so<00:05:44.480> by<00:05:44.750> crimping

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
a little bit harder to do so by crimping

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.930 
a little bit harder to do so by crimping
it<00:05:45.380> just<00:05:45.590> makes<00:05:45.770> the<00:05:45.890> whole<00:05:45.920> job<00:05:46.280> easier<00:05:46.730> and

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
it just makes the whole job easier and

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.260 
it just makes the whole job easier and
it's<00:05:47.360> very<00:05:47.630> very<00:05:47.840> strong<00:05:48.260> as<00:05:48.410> well<00:05:48.620> so<00:05:49.610> that's

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
it's very very strong as well so that's

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.760 
it's very very strong as well so that's
