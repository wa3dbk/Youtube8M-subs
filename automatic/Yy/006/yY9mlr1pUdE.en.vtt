00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.750
 at the moment has a lot to do and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.270

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.349
 Hanging reason here eternally on the same 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.059

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.519
 very suspicious because there are 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.340
