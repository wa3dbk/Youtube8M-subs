00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 if we knew what saints is a team that 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.750
 always always seeks to offend always 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.330
 look for the opposite goal they were going to 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.090
 have their opportunities and still I think 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.240
 how good we started the match well 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.820
 having the ball after the goal maybe 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.020
 we come a little bit down them 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.970
 they continued creating opportunities could 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.490
 have sentenced and the second time 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.550
 well, like the last matches, 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.500
 I think pushing the local team 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.050
 enclosing it generating occasions but 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.410
 we lack the success to finish those 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.910
 plays and good and that are reflected in the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.239
 final score what we 're going with the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.239
 empty hands 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.260
 if we take many weeks saying 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.060
 it depends on us who follows 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.550
 depending on us 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.020
 if it's true or not but there are two left 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.809
 six points remain and you have to 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.590
 add the maximum points possible if not 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.760
 there will come a time when no longer 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.760
 salvation depends on us 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.710
 Well, the pressure we had during 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.680
 all the football year that's not what 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.210
 change not since we got together in the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.920
 June preseason we had clear that 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.840
 We were going to suffer that we're going to have to 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.130
 work and fight a lot and that's how it is 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.469
 being throughout the year 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.240
 how is that handled because then try 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.219
 recover as quickly as possible and the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.990
 Monday and be working for the 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.040
 next match against veracruz that is 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.200
 the most important one that is 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.670
 surely the most important game in 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.740
 the season because good because of 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.690
 add the three points we would approach 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.190
 that goal and we have already lost many 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.690
 points at home and I think it's important 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.690
 that we do not lose more 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.470
 Well, for me it was to go back home 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.360
 two and a half years ago here with very 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.940
 good times with very bad moments 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.229
 but also because I'm always very 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.540
 grateful grateful for the opportunity 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.100
 that gave me saints to come and play 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.130
 Mexico if it were not for so many today 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.720
 no I would not be Mexican I would not have a son 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.390
 Mexican would not have Mexican family 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.459
 then very very very grateful in that 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.410
 sense and good now it takes me to another 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.690
 institution 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.530
 I am totally involved in the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.900
 institution 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.270
 to which I belong right now and therefore 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.620
 try to solve this problem that 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.720
 we have not this problem where we 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.330
 We have gotten in and try to get out as soon as possible 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.900
 possible to get permanence what 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.900
 soon as possible 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.080
 It is the first experience of the previous 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.330
 this is a strange feeling because 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.630
 Well, I've never touched myself here 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.720
 play if it was not with the verdiblanca and 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.730
 well that's weird is nice too 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.010
 say hello to many friends that I made here 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.070
 for two and a half years but that's good 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.870
 that is until warming up 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.210
 just before the match starts 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.570
 what at the end does not stop being a party 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.190
 more with three points for us very 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.620
 important because we left life 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.780
 three points that escape us three 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.240
 points that we had in mind for 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.710
 try to ensure no longer 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.750
 but do take an important step in the 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.010
 permanence and good for the truth we 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.010
 we are quite disappointed 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.310
 I believe that if something has characterized 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.190
 this team is that it has been lifted from 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.709
 blows by own mistakes blows by 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.080
 mistakes of others if we had not 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.880
 raised during the two tournaments 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.950
 during this in football today in 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.180
 day we would not be able to 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.110
 say that it is still in our 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.459
 hands 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.459
 the permanence the salvation 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.200
 if it is still in our hands but 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.680
 we have to add there is that I think today 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.050
 the team faced a team that 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.300
 good that is usually very offensive that 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.330
 usually they always look for the rival goal 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.340
 It usually generates many opportunities 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.340
 I honestly do not think they created 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.900
 more than 34 clear clear opportunities 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.280
 goal I think we do too 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.180
 having a difference is that they have 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.180
 got good we
