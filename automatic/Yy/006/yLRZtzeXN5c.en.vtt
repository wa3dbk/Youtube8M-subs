00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
siphon area and pretty much all it is is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.600

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
would be to go ahead and deeper all of

would be to go ahead and deeper all of
those<00:00:50.550> suckers<00:00:50.910> off<00:00:51.210> because<00:00:51.780> when<00:00:52.050> i<00:00:52.079> took

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
drainpipe that's where your level will

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.310 
drainpipe that's where your level will
drain<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.790> only<00:01:39.420> technical<00:01:39.869> part<00:01:40.079> about<00:01:40.259> that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320

from the top of the bed so mine

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.399 
from the top of the bed so mine
obviously<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.939> not<00:01:51.119> looking<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.200> it

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
obviously is not looking like that it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.530 
obviously is not looking like that it
looks<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.950> three<00:01:53.189> quarters<00:01:53.579> or<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.509> I

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
looks like three quarters or so so I

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.840 
looks like three quarters or so so I
might<00:01:54.750> need<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.049> modify<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.680> but<00:01:56.549> then<00:01:56.700> on

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
might need to modify that but then on

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.840 
might need to modify that but then on
the<00:01:56.939> bottom<00:01:57.090> side<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.040> mail<00:01:59.219> you

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the bottom side just on the mail you

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.910 
the bottom side just on the mail you
just<00:02:00.030> put<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> female<00:02:00.600> screw<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.409> right<00:02:01.649> onto

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
just put a female screw that right onto

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.310 
just put a female screw that right onto
the<00:02:02.009> female<00:02:02.399> or<00:02:02.759> onto<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> mail<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.479> then<00:02:04.079> add

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
the female or onto the mail and then add

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.550 
the female or onto the mail and then add
a<00:02:04.350> downspout<00:02:04.939> put<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> 90<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.570> then<00:02:06.869> another<00:02:07.110> 90

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
a downspout put a 90 and then another 90

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.580 
a downspout put a 90 and then another 90
the<00:02:07.860> purpose<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.580> 90<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.989> can<00:02:10.170> angle

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the purpose of this 90 is you can angle

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.440 
the purpose of this 90 is you can angle
it<00:02:10.679> up<00:02:10.890> more<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.849> angle<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.180> down

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
it up more and you can angle it down

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.980 
it up more and you can angle it down
more

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
more

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.270 
more
and<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.290> will<00:02:13.380> turn<00:02:13.590> your<00:02:13.770> system<00:02:14.130> off

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
and that will turn your system off

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.810 
and that will turn your system off
quicker<00:02:14.580> or<00:02:14.880> turn<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.210> on<00:02:15.420> quicker<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:17.580> key<00:02:17.790> to

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
quicker or turn it on quicker the key to

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.750 
quicker or turn it on quicker the key to
the<00:02:18.030> adjustment<00:02:18.630> took<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.620> one<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:20.070> if

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the adjustment took to this one is if

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.630 
the adjustment took to this one is if
you<00:02:20.850> need<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.630> water<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.080> turn<00:02:22.320> on<00:02:22.500> earlier<00:02:23.160> if

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
you need the water to turn on earlier if

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.460 
you need the water to turn on earlier if
it<00:02:23.850> will<00:02:24.000> start<00:02:24.540> flowing<00:02:24.990> but<00:02:25.140> not<00:02:25.290> actually

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
it will start flowing but not actually

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.120 
it will start flowing but not actually
catch<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.910> start<00:02:27.210> tilting<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.690> up<00:02:27.960> that<00:02:28.920> way

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
catch you start tilting it up that way

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.040 
catch you start tilting it up that way
it<00:02:29.220> will<00:02:29.310> cause<00:02:29.550> more<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.120> siphon<00:02:30.630> inside

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
it will cause more of a siphon inside

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.960 
it will cause more of a siphon inside
the<00:02:31.200> pipe<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.710> only<00:02:32.040> drip<00:02:32.340> out<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.490> little<00:02:32.760> bit

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
the pipe and only drip out a little bit

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.580 
the pipe and only drip out a little bit
and<00:02:33.210> then<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.660> will<00:02:33.900> actually<00:02:34.140> cause<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
and then that will actually cause the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.610 
and then that will actually cause the
siphon<00:02:35.220> start<00:02:36.030> earlier<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.440> same

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
siphon start earlier but in the same

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.460 
siphon start earlier but in the same
time<00:02:38.010> if<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.730> won't<00:02:39.150> shut<00:02:39.510> off<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:40.080> just<00:02:40.290> keeps

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
time if it won't shut off it just keeps

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.900 
time if it won't shut off it just keeps
on<00:02:40.680> raining<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.280> raining<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.730> raining

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
on raining and raining and raining

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.540 
on raining and raining and raining
either<00:02:42.720> adjust<00:02:42.900> your<00:02:43.380> amount<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.160> water<00:02:44.310> going

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
either adjust your amount of water going

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.270 
either adjust your amount of water going
in<00:02:44.910> or<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.600> can<00:02:45.750> adjust<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.290> sucker<00:02:46.590> more

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
in or you can adjust this sucker more

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.390 
in or you can adjust this sucker more
down<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.660> that's<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.470> little<00:02:49.590> key<00:02:49.860> on<00:02:50.100> how<00:02:50.340> you

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
down so that's a little key on how you

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.490 
down so that's a little key on how you
make<00:02:51.030> adjustments<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.990> bottom<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.380> the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
make adjustments to the bottom of the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.560 
make adjustments to the bottom of the
bell<00:02:52.740> siphon<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:54.030> was<00:02:54.210> one<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
bell siphon that was one of the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.870 
bell siphon that was one of the
trickiest<00:02:55.200> parts<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.740> entire<00:02:56.040> thing<00:02:56.100> you

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
trickiest parts of the entire thing you

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.310 
trickiest parts of the entire thing you
just<00:02:57.030> need<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.330> mess<00:02:57.510> with<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.840> until<00:02:58.290> you

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
just need to mess with that until you

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.920 
just need to mess with that until you
get<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.680> right<00:02:58.710> about<00:02:59.070> where<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.400> want<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.760> and

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
get it right about where you want it and

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.400 
get it right about where you want it and
I<00:03:00.930> wouldn't<00:03:01.970> suggest<00:03:02.970> gluing<00:03:03.570> anything<00:03:03.960> just

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
I wouldn't suggest gluing anything just

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.380 
I wouldn't suggest gluing anything just
because<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.980> all<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.640> chemicals<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.180> are<00:03:06.210> in

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
because of all the chemicals that are in

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.360 
because of all the chemicals that are in
the<00:03:06.510> glue<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.750> I'm<00:03:07.200> trying<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.740> be<00:03:07.860> completely

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
the glue and I'm trying to be completely

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.510 
the glue and I'm trying to be completely
organic<00:03:08.840> but<00:03:09.840> if<00:03:10.320> you<00:03:10.470> can<00:03:10.650> do<00:03:10.770> that<00:03:10.980> simple

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
organic but if you can do that simple

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.610 
organic but if you can do that simple
little<00:03:11.670> assembly<00:03:12.290> pretty<00:03:13.290> much<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.590> only

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
little assembly pretty much the only

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.350 
little assembly pretty much the only
thing<00:03:13.950> you're<00:03:14.100> missing<00:03:14.130> is<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.670> tank<00:03:15.060> for<00:03:15.210> your

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
thing you're missing is a tank for your

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.260 
thing you're missing is a tank for your
fish<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.990> a<00:03:16.440> tank<00:03:16.710> water<00:03:17.130> tight<00:03:17.430> tank<00:03:17.760> for

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
fish and a tank water tight tank for

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.650 
fish and a tank water tight tank for
your<00:03:18.990> plants<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.950> that's<00:03:20.550> it<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:21.450> put<00:03:21.630> the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
your plants and that's it you put the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.930 
your plants and that's it you put the
sucker<00:03:21.990> all<00:03:22.170> together<00:03:22.460> when<00:03:23.460> it<00:03:23.550> gets<00:03:23.640> all<00:03:23.850> the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
sucker all together when it gets all the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.370 
sucker all together when it gets all the
way<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.180> top<00:03:24.210> there<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.990> it<00:03:25.080> starts

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
way to the top there and it starts

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.800 
way to the top there and it starts
overflowing<00:03:25.650> in<00:03:26.150> pretty<00:03:27.150> much<00:03:27.210> you<00:03:27.480> start

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
overflowing in pretty much you start

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.260 
overflowing in pretty much you start
getting<00:03:27.930> at<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.260> drain<00:03:28.530> out<00:03:28.740> there<00:03:29.270> obviously

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
getting at the drain out there obviously

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.180 
getting at the drain out there obviously
and<00:03:31.050> see<00:03:31.200> how<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:31.350> will<00:03:31.620> pick<00:03:31.830> up<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.070> little

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
and see how that will pick up a little

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.920 
and see how that will pick up a little
bit<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.790> actually<00:03:33.180> get<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.480> going<00:03:33.690> like

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
bit you actually get that going like

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.920 
bit you actually get that going like
that<00:03:34.580> when<00:03:35.580> this<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:35.910> on<00:03:36.060> when<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.510> bell

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
that when this is on when the bell

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.410 
that when this is on when the bell
siphon<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.560> on<00:03:37.770> there<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.190> literally<00:03:38.940> drains

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
siphon is on there that literally drains

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.640 
siphon is on there that literally drains
it<00:03:39.570> all<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.750> way<00:03:39.870> down<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.080> these<00:03:40.350> holes

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
it all the way down to these holes

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.550 
it all the way down to these holes
actually<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:41.790> air<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.810> break<00:03:43.080> there<00:03:43.290> but

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
actually to the air to break there but

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.720 
actually to the air to break there but
it's<00:03:43.680> trying<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.100> go<00:03:44.190> all<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.370> way<00:03:44.490> down<00:03:44.550> to

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
it's trying to go all the way down to

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.420 
it's trying to go all the way down to
those<00:03:44.910> holes<00:03:45.210> so<00:03:46.110> it'll<00:03:46.260> drain<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.680> completely

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
those holes so it'll drain it completely

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.520 
those holes so it'll drain it completely
all<00:03:47.550> the<00:03:47.670> way<00:03:47.760> down<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.180> there<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.720> that's

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
all the way down to there and that's

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.150 
all the way down to there and that's
your<00:03:49.740> water<00:03:49.980> level<00:03:50.430> at<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.820> bottom<00:03:51.090> and

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
your water level at the bottom and

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.460 
your water level at the bottom and
that's<00:03:53.160> it

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
that's it

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.700 
that's it
all<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.130> need<00:03:55.280> to<00:03:55.310> do<00:03:55.550> then<00:03:56.180> is<00:03:56.390> add<00:03:57.290> a<00:03:57.320> pump

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
all you need to do then is add a pump

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.220 
all you need to do then is add a pump
which<00:03:57.980> is<00:03:58.340> right<00:03:58.520> there<00:03:58.550> and<00:03:59.510> then<00:03:59.930> have<00:04:00.200> that

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
which is right there and then have that

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.310 
which is right there and then have that
sucker<00:04:00.820> feed<00:04:01.820> your<00:04:01.970> beds<00:04:02.210> and<00:04:02.930> I<00:04:03.020> put<00:04:03.230> an

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
sucker feed your beds and I put an

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.470 
sucker feed your beds and I put an
overflow<00:04:03.770> just<00:04:04.070> for<00:04:04.310> excess<00:04:04.880> and<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:05.210> put<00:04:05.450> a

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
overflow just for excess and I put a

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.570 
overflow just for excess and I put a
shutoff<00:04:05.990> on<00:04:06.230> both<00:04:06.440> beds<00:04:06.710> so<00:04:06.950> i<00:04:06.980> can<00:04:07.190> cut<00:04:07.400> back

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
shutoff on both beds so i can cut back

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.940 
shutoff on both beds so i can cut back
the<00:04:07.760> water<00:04:07.970> turn<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.570> on<00:04:08.690> more<00:04:08.930> you<00:04:09.860> know

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
the water turn it on more you know

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.830 
the water turn it on more you know
whatever<00:04:10.130> i<00:04:10.310> need<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.670> i<00:04:10.910> also<00:04:11.120> put<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.450> shut<00:04:11.720> up

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
whatever i need to i also put a shut up

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.800 
whatever i need to i also put a shut up
right<00:04:12.020> there<00:04:12.230> on<00:04:12.320> that<00:04:12.350> overflow<00:04:12.950> line<00:04:13.880> just

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
right there on that overflow line just

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.280 
right there on that overflow line just
so<00:04:15.020> i<00:04:15.260> could<00:04:15.320> have<00:04:15.620> more<00:04:15.890> force<00:04:16.310> going<00:04:16.850> through

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
so i could have more force going through

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.140 
so i could have more force going through
the<00:04:18.290> two<00:04:18.500> beds<00:04:18.769> if<00:04:19.040> i<00:04:19.190> need<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.579> to<00:04:19.790> clean<00:04:20.000> them

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
the two beds if i need to to clean them

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.500 
the two beds if i need to to clean them
out<00:04:20.269> or<00:04:20.600> do<00:04:21.320> whatever<00:04:21.580> but<00:04:22.580> that's<00:04:22.640> it<00:04:23.060> if<00:04:23.300> you

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
out or do whatever but that's it if you

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.320 
out or do whatever but that's it if you
do<00:04:23.810> it<00:04:23.840> correctly<00:04:24.140> and<00:04:24.650> assemble<00:04:25.460> it<00:04:25.550> oh<00:04:25.580> it

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
do it correctly and assemble it oh it

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.540 
do it correctly and assemble it oh it
will<00:04:26.810> sputter<00:04:27.440> like<00:04:27.710> that<00:04:27.920> a<00:04:27.950> bunch<00:04:28.190> of<00:04:28.340> times

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
will sputter like that a bunch of times

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.450 
will sputter like that a bunch of times
and<00:04:28.820> you'll<00:04:29.270> hear<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:30.140> air<00:04:30.290> site<00:04:30.590> can<00:04:30.830> break

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
and you'll hear the air site can break

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.710 
and you'll hear the air site can break
right<00:04:31.760> in<00:04:31.910> there<00:04:33.430> and<00:04:34.430> that's<00:04:34.580> it<00:04:34.850> stops

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
right in there and that's it stops

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.680 
right in there and that's it stops
draining<00:04:36.230> you<00:04:37.190> get<00:04:37.340> that<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.640> work<00:04:37.670> then<00:04:38.570> all

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
draining you get that to work then all

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.980 
draining you get that to work then all
you<00:04:38.780> have<00:04:38.810> to<00:04:38.960> do<00:04:39.140> is<00:04:39.410> pretty<00:04:40.070> much<00:04:40.870> get<00:04:41.870> on

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
you have to do is pretty much get on

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.800 
you have to do is pretty much get on
your<00:04:42.170> internet<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.740> look<00:04:43.160> up<00:04:43.340> how<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.210> cycle

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
your internet and look up how to cycle

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.750 
your internet and look up how to cycle
on<00:04:44.930> an<00:04:45.020> aquaponic<00:04:45.590> garden<00:04:45.950> you<00:04:46.310> can<00:04:46.460> do<00:04:46.610> it

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
on an aquaponic garden you can do it

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.270 
on an aquaponic garden you can do it
with<00:04:47.360> plants<00:04:47.870> and<00:04:47.990> no<00:04:48.200> fish<00:04:48.500> or<00:04:48.890> you<00:04:49.040> could<00:04:49.190> do

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
with plants and no fish or you could do

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.970 
with plants and no fish or you could do
it<00:04:49.400> with<00:04:49.610> plans<00:04:50.020> or<00:04:51.020> I<00:04:51.080> believe<00:04:51.320> it's<00:04:51.680> no

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
it with plans or I believe it's no

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.220 
it with plans or I believe it's no
plants<00:04:52.370> and<00:04:52.490> no<00:04:52.580> fish<00:04:52.880> I<00:04:53.120> don't<00:04:53.600> know<00:04:53.690> i<00:04:53.900> did

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
plants and no fish I don't know i did

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.980 
plants and no fish I don't know i did
with<00:04:54.440> plants<00:04:54.890> and<00:04:55.160> fish<00:04:55.430> and<00:04:55.960> pretty<00:04:56.960> much

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
with plants and fish and pretty much

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.050 
with plants and fish and pretty much
that<00:04:57.320> just<00:04:57.530> took<00:04:57.770> longer<00:04:58.070> i<00:04:58.460> believe<00:04:58.760> it<00:04:58.880> takes

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
that just took longer i believe it takes

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.850 
that just took longer i believe it takes
an<00:04:59.180> extra<00:04:59.419> two<00:04:59.630> weeks<00:04:59.660> or<00:05:00.169> so<00:05:00.380> if<00:05:00.530> you<00:05:00.620> do<00:05:00.740> it

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
an extra two weeks or so if you do it

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.130 
an extra two weeks or so if you do it
that<00:05:01.040> way<00:05:01.220> but<00:05:01.430> once<00:05:01.640> it<00:05:01.820> happened<00:05:02.150> growth

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
that way but once it happened growth

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.670 
that way but once it happened growth
started<00:05:03.530> taking<00:05:03.860> off<00:05:03.980> like<00:05:04.190> crazy<00:05:04.490> i<00:05:05.560> need<00:05:06.560> to

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
started taking off like crazy i need to

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
the time calls for it fill up the beds

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.420 
the time calls for it fill up the beds
with<00:05:13.370> some<00:05:13.729> rock<00:05:14.110> use<00:05:15.110> pea<00:05:15.410> gravel<00:05:15.620> I've<00:05:16.070> heard

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
with some rock use pea gravel I've heard

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.490 
with some rock use pea gravel I've heard
that<00:05:16.750> actually<00:05:17.750> some<00:05:17.930> of<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.080> bigger<00:05:18.260> Rock

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
that actually some of the bigger Rock

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.560 
that actually some of the bigger Rock
you<00:05:18.770> can<00:05:18.979> grow<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:19.550> lot<00:05:19.729> better<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.180> roots<00:05:20.390> like

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
you can grow a lot better the roots like

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.659 
you can grow a lot better the roots like
the<00:05:20.690> go<00:05:20.870> through<00:05:21.320> them<00:05:21.440> a<00:05:21.470> lot<00:05:21.620> easier<00:05:21.800> pick
