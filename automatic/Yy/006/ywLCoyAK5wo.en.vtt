here<00:01:43.759> in<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.060> valley<00:01:44.240> here's<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:45.080> microcurrent

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
here in the valley here's a microcurrent

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.499 
here in the valley here's a microcurrent
stimulator<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:46.670> these<00:01:47.030> little<00:01:47.299> cotton

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
stimulator and these little cotton

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.840 
stimulator and these little cotton
q-tips<00:01:48.110> actually<00:01:48.590> deliver<00:01:48.950> these<00:01:49.250> very<00:01:49.520> tiny

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
q-tips actually deliver these very tiny

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.670 
q-tips actually deliver these very tiny
currents<00:01:50.600> which<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:50.900> can<00:01:51.020> almost<00:01:51.170> not<00:01:51.470> even

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
currents which you can almost not even

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.620 
currents which you can almost not even
feel<00:01:51.920> because<00:01:52.159> they're<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:52.490> gentle<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:53.090> if

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
feel because they're so gentle and if

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.550 
feel because they're so gentle and if
you<00:01:53.750> look<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:53.990> see<00:01:54.140> there's<00:01:54.409> actually

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
you look you see there's actually

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.109 
you look you see there's actually
colored<00:01:55.100> light<00:01:55.369> coming<00:01:55.850> out<00:01:55.909> of<00:01:56.030> these

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
colored light coming out of these

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.630 
colored light coming out of these
fiber-optic<00:01:56.869> cables<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:58.070> we<00:01:58.189> can<00:01:58.340> actually

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
fiber-optic cables and we can actually

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.090 
fiber-optic cables and we can actually
change<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.060> color<00:01:59.210> to<00:02:00.170> any<00:02:00.409> one<00:02:00.619> of<00:02:00.650> 12

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
change the color to any one of 12

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.210 
change the color to any one of 12
different<00:02:01.390> wavelengths<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.979> each<00:02:03.979> of<00:02:04.130> these

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
different wavelengths and each of these

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.859 
different wavelengths and each of these
colors<00:02:04.700> has<00:02:04.909> very<00:02:05.180> different<00:02:05.420> healing

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
colors has very different healing

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.660 
colors has very different healing
properties<00:02:06.380> Wow

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
properties Wow

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.399 
properties Wow
okay<00:02:08.179> now<00:02:08.329> this<00:02:08.509> started<00:02:08.929> as<00:02:09.019> one<00:02:09.200> thing<00:02:09.379> and

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 
okay now this started as one thing and

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.380 
okay now this started as one thing and
became<00:02:09.890> something<00:02:10.610> else<00:02:10.819> because<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.239> the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
became something else because of the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.699 
became something else because of the
side<00:02:11.599> effects<00:02:12.049> that<00:02:12.079> you<00:02:12.170> learn<00:02:12.349> Rochelle<00:02:12.620> do

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
side effects that you learn Rochelle do

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:13.750 
side effects that you learn Rochelle do
you<00:02:12.769> want<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:12.950> tell<00:02:13.069> us<00:02:13.189> about<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.459> because

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
you want to tell us about that because

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.819 
you want to tell us about that because
it's<00:02:13.939> not<00:02:14.090> just<00:02:14.120> about<00:02:14.420> aesthetic<00:02:15.409> changes

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
it's not just about aesthetic changes

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.860 
it's not just about aesthetic changes
here<00:02:16.099> right<00:02:16.639> well<00:02:16.909> this<00:02:17.029> actually

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
here right well this actually

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.839 
here right well this actually
was<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.440> side<00:02:18.799> effect<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:19.280> was<00:02:19.370> found<00:02:19.610> when<00:02:19.819> a

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
was a side effect that was found when a

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.729 
was a side effect that was found when a
doctor<00:02:20.299> was<00:02:20.420> treating<00:02:20.629> Bell's<00:02:20.959> palsy<00:02:21.260> and

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
doctor was treating Bell's palsy and

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.270 
doctor was treating Bell's palsy and
after<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:23.120> patient<00:02:23.510> was<00:02:23.629> cured<00:02:24.409> she<00:02:24.680> came

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
after the patient was cured she came

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.949 
after the patient was cured she came
back<00:02:25.459> she<00:02:25.519> said<00:02:25.849> you<00:02:25.940> have<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.180> do<00:02:26.659> my<00:02:26.810> other

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
back she said you have to do my other

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.839 
back she said you have to do my other
side<00:02:27.260> because<00:02:27.650> she<00:02:27.980> had<00:02:28.099> gotten<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> face<00:02:28.580> she

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
side because she had gotten the face she

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.070 
side because she had gotten the face she
had<00:02:29.000> such<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.239> look<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.540> asked<00:02:29.659> you<00:02:29.810> go<00:02:29.959> ahead

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
had such a look and asked you go ahead

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.300 
had such a look and asked you go ahead
and<00:02:30.319> show<00:02:30.440> this<00:02:30.560> on<00:02:30.739> Adelle

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
and show this on Adelle

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.000 
and show this on Adelle
so<00:02:31.489> this<00:02:31.700> is<00:02:31.909> the<00:02:32.239> Ashley<00:02:33.010> non-surgical

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
so this is the Ashley non-surgical

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.160 
so this is the Ashley non-surgical
facelift<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:35.239> would<00:02:35.390> see<00:02:35.629> or<00:02:35.989> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
facelift that you would see or the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.289 
facelift that you would see or the
facial<00:02:36.530> rejuvenation<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:37.849> guess<00:02:38.060> it's

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
facial rejuvenation and I guess it's

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.119 
facial rejuvenation and I guess it's
done<00:02:38.450> in<00:02:38.569> several<00:02:38.810> phases<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.620> what<00:02:40.010> I'm

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
done in several phases and what I'm

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.390 
done in several phases and what I'm
doing<00:02:40.459> now<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:41.000> basically<00:02:41.810> showing<00:02:42.379> you<00:02:42.530> the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
doing now is basically showing you the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.250 
doing now is basically showing you the
sliding<00:02:43.819> technique<00:02:44.180> which<00:02:44.450> oxygenates<00:02:45.140> the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
sliding technique which oxygenates the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.500 
sliding technique which oxygenates the
skin<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.400> brings<00:02:46.670> circulates<00:02:47.299> blood

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
skin and it brings circulates blood

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.349 
skin and it brings circulates blood
energy<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.739> fluids<00:02:49.280> throughout<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:50.060> face

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
energy and fluids throughout the face

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.890 
energy and fluids throughout the face
and<00:02:50.750> then<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.890> will<00:02:52.040> be<00:02:52.579> also<00:02:53.239> doing<00:02:53.720> other

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
and then you will be also doing other

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.949 
and then you will be also doing other
things<00:02:54.319> such<00:02:54.980> as<00:02:55.390> retraining<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.510> muscles

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
things such as retraining the muscles

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.559 
things such as retraining the muscles
this<00:02:57.319> is<00:02:57.470> a<00:02:57.650> holding<00:02:58.280> technique<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.030> you're

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
this is a holding technique and you're

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.530 
this is a holding technique and you're
actually<00:02:59.900> you<00:02:59.989> would<00:03:00.140> be<00:03:00.230> plumping<00:03:00.769> up<00:03:00.950> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
actually you would be plumping up the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.210 
actually you would be plumping up the
wrinkles<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:03.109> wrinkles<00:03:03.440> do<00:03:03.590> actually

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
wrinkles and the wrinkles do actually

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.940 
wrinkles and the wrinkles do actually
lessen<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.269> then<00:03:05.420> can<00:03:05.629> disappear<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:06.769> this

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
lessen and then can disappear so this

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.740 
lessen and then can disappear so this
would<00:03:07.099> be<00:03:07.220> an<00:03:07.310> alternative<00:03:07.459> to<00:03:07.909> Botox<00:03:08.480> on<00:03:08.629> the

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
would be an alternative to Botox on the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.770 
would be an alternative to Botox on the
forehead<00:03:09.079> and<00:03:09.109> absolutely<00:03:10.030> face<00:03:11.030> yes

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
forehead and absolutely face yes

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.270 
forehead and absolutely face yes
but<00:03:12.049> it's<00:03:12.170> actually<00:03:12.590> working<00:03:12.799> from<00:03:13.129> the

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
but it's actually working from the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.940 
but it's actually working from the
inside<00:03:13.730> out<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:14.959> using<00:03:15.319> the<00:03:15.440> body's<00:03:15.769> own

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
inside out so it is using the body's own

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.479 
inside out so it is using the body's own
energy<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:16.730> its<00:03:16.970> own<00:03:17.180> cells<00:03:17.599> to<00:03:17.870> regenerate

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
energy and its own cells to regenerate

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.890 
energy and its own cells to regenerate
counted<00:03:19.489> collagen<00:03:20.090> but<00:03:20.269> how<00:03:20.390> frequently

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
counted collagen but how frequently
