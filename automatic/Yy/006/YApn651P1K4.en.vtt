obviously everybody else in those the

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.440 
obviously everybody else in those the
Sun<00:02:09.759> if<00:02:10.509> we<00:02:10.570> look<00:02:10.869> up<00:02:11.670> Suns<00:02:12.670> going<00:02:12.910> down<00:02:13.060> right

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
Sun if we look up Suns going down right

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.470 
Sun if we look up Suns going down right
over<00:02:14.350> there<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.370> west<00:02:15.579> so<00:02:16.030> we're<00:02:16.269> good<00:02:16.390> to

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
over there so it's west so we're good to

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.830 
over there so it's west so we're good to
go

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
go

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.350 
go
so<00:02:17.829> we<00:02:18.130> wanted<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.400> go<00:02:18.579> north<00:02:18.790> if<00:02:19.090> we<00:02:19.180> had<00:02:19.269> to

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
so we wanted to go north if we had to
