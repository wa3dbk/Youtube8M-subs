00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
you're talking in radio world when you

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.830 
you're talking in radio world when you
say<00:06:12.190> Latin<00:06:12.460> music<00:06:12.910> that<00:06:13.120> gets<00:06:13.270> lumped<00:06:13.599> into<00:06:13.720> a

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
say Latin music that gets lumped into a

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.810 
say Latin music that gets lumped into a
very<00:06:14.080> small<00:06:14.169> box<00:06:14.680> and<00:06:15.070> I<00:06:15.130> feel<00:06:15.280> like<00:06:15.310> we<00:06:15.669> don't

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
very small box and I feel like we don't

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.339 
very small box and I feel like we don't
necessarily<00:06:16.419> fit<00:06:16.599> in<00:06:16.750> that<00:06:16.780> box<00:06:17.080> you<00:06:17.260> know

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:17.349 
necessarily fit in that box you know

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:18.659 
necessarily fit in that box you know
because<00:06:17.530> we're<00:06:17.620> not<00:06:17.650> really<00:06:17.979> playing<00:06:18.070> Tejano

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
because we're not really playing Tejano

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.330 
because we're not really playing Tejano
music<00:06:18.789> or<00:06:19.360> you<00:06:20.020> know<00:06:20.139> regional<00:06:20.620> Mexican<00:06:21.039> music

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.460 
music or you know regional Mexican music
which<00:06:21.520> in<00:06:21.849> Texas<00:06:22.479> is<00:06:22.630> a<00:06:22.660> lot<00:06:22.840> of<00:06:22.930> the<00:06:23.020> stations

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470

which in Texas is a lot of the stations
and<00:06:23.680> i<00:06:23.710> think<00:06:23.919> around<00:06:24.250> the<00:06:24.520> country<00:06:24.880> that's<00:06:25.060> a

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
and i think around the country that's a

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.149 
and i think around the country that's a
lot<00:06:25.270> of<00:06:25.300> the<00:06:25.449> latin<00:06:25.750> stations<00:06:26.139> or<00:06:26.380> its<00:06:26.740> latin

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:27.159

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.289 
pop music and we don't kind of fit in

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.170 
pop music and we don't kind of fit in
any<00:06:29.440> of<00:06:29.530> those<00:06:29.710> so<00:06:29.979> it's<00:06:30.070> like<00:06:30.280> you<00:06:31.030> know
