00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:12.250
 then square because they believe that at home 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.250
 at home 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.329
 what a way 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.329
 sorry 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.949
 I'm not giving authorizations 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.470
 from the castle 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.890
 after several roxane speculations 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.690
 Castilians is ready to reach the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.379
 altar by the hand of his current partner 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.120
 ricardo sanz 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.860
 but there is no date very dated then 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.510
 study because even with the ring there 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.769
 there is going to be a date because you have a 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.510
 ring so start planning and you 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.220
 will release the date really when 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.440
 everything is armed but we do not have a 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.259
 date but if it is our intention the 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.210
 next year maybe also because if the 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.670
 driver goes through one of the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.729
 best stages of your life and that is that the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.290
 love is your biggest unhappy motivation yo 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.229
 I love my boyfriend with all my soul who is 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.659

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.000

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.649
 situation this is then father 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.560

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.440
 original tone of bad and is in a 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.440
 process of curing a condition that 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.909
 suffered for more than 20 years with much 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.429
