00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
okay in this video I'm going to talk

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.800 
okay in this video I'm going to talk
about<00:00:03.990> an<00:00:04.520> LPG<00:00:05.520> related<00:00:06.420> issue

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
about an LPG related issue

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.759 
about an LPG related issue
the<00:00:07.379> car<00:00:07.710> has<00:00:08.300> LPG<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.480> gasoline<00:00:10.080> also<00:00:10.260> this

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
the car has LPG and gasoline also this

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.850 
the car has LPG and gasoline also this
is<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.130> fuel<00:00:12.000> selector<00:00:12.389> switch<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.679> right

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
is the fuel selector switch on the right

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.660 
is the fuel selector switch on the right
side<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.490> set<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.030> run<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.599> LPG<00:00:16.130> in<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.279> middle

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
side is set to run on LPG in the middle

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.810 
side is set to run on LPG in the middle
it's<00:00:18.029> neutral<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.439> car<00:00:19.770> won't<00:00:19.980> get<00:00:20.279> any<00:00:20.460> fuel

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
it's neutral the car won't get any fuel

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.019 
it's neutral the car won't get any fuel
and<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.600> left<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:22.680> will<00:00:22.949> receive<00:00:23.400> gasoline

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
and on the left it will receive gasoline

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.529 
and on the left it will receive gasoline
I'm<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.380> shut<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.070> off<00:00:26.430> just<00:00:26.939> for<00:00:27.300> this

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
I'm going to shut it off just for this

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.410 
I'm going to shut it off just for this
demonstration<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:29.279> won't<00:00:29.519> receive<00:00:30.300> any

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
demonstration so it won't receive any

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.709 
demonstration so it won't receive any
fuel<00:00:30.840> right<00:00:31.080> now<00:00:31.369> so<00:00:32.369> let's<00:00:32.579> say<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.239> set

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
fuel right now so let's say that is set

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:44.090 
fuel right now so let's say that is set
on<00:00:33.960> two<00:00:34.380> LPG<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:38.180> whoops<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:42.649> you're<00:00:43.649> turning

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
on two LPG and whoops and you're turning

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:53.959 
on two LPG and whoops and you're turning
the<00:00:44.280> key<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.870> engine<00:00:49.289> will<00:00:49.469> start<00:00:52.969> okay

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
the key and the engine will start okay

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.500 
the key and the engine will start okay
in<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.449> case<00:00:55.879> let's<00:00:56.879> set<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.480> valve<00:00:57.719> back<00:00:59.510> in

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
in this case let's set the valve back in

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.060 
in this case let's set the valve back in
this<00:01:00.719> case<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:02.600> check<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.070> electric

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
this case you can check the electric

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.289 
this case you can check the electric
valves<00:01:05.489> which<00:01:05.880> are<00:01:06.590> opening<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.950> closing<00:01:08.299> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
valves which are opening and closing the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.469 
valves which are opening and closing the
LPG<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.680> example<00:01:11.189> here's<00:01:11.520> an<00:01:11.700> electric<00:01:12.240> valve

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
LPG for example here's an electric valve

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.270 
LPG for example here's an electric valve
this<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:14.159> has<00:01:14.520> one<00:01:15.420> positive<00:01:16.280> connection

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
this one it has one positive connection

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.030 
this one it has one positive connection
and<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:18.299> negative<00:01:19.080> connection<00:01:19.560> which<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and a negative connection which is the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.550 
and a negative connection which is the
body<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.640> car<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.810> here's<00:01:22.320> another

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
body of the car and here's another

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
body of the car and here's another
electro<00:01:23.549> valve<00:01:24.259> this<00:01:25.259> one

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.410 

and<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:31.080> has<00:01:31.470> two<00:01:32.070> connections<00:01:32.790> visible

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and this one has two connections visible

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.880 
and this one has two connections visible
this<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.430> positive<00:01:36.290> it's<00:01:37.290> connected

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
this one is the positive it's connected

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.630 
this one is the positive it's connected
to<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.370> other<00:01:38.430> valve<00:01:40.040> okay<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.580> other

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
to the other valve okay and the other

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.410 
to the other valve okay and the other
one<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.510> negative<00:01:42.720> because<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.830> goes<00:01:44.070> to

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
one is the negative because it goes to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.280 
one is the negative because it goes to
the<00:01:45.420> body<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.080> car<00:01:47.540> okay<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:49.140> you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the body of the car okay and what you

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.670 
the body of the car okay and what you
can<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:50.160> to<00:01:50.640> use<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.480> symbol<00:01:51.840> cable<00:01:52.290> and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
can do is to use the symbol cable and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.030 
can do is to use the symbol cable and
use<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.670> two<00:01:53.970> ends<00:01:54.330> of<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.630> cable<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.710> put

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
use the two ends of the cable to put

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.450 
use the two ends of the cable to put
some<00:01:56.280> current<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.420> these<00:01:57.690> valves<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.460> you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
some current to these valves and you

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.980 
some current to these valves and you
should<00:01:59.730> hear<00:02:00.030> them<00:02:00.270> click<00:02:01.460> okay<00:02:02.460> let's<00:02:02.730> do<00:02:02.940> it

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.840

connection okay put one end of the cable
here<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.989> other<00:02:34.230> end<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.860> cable<00:02:35.040> onto

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
here and the other end of the cable onto

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.110 
here and the other end of the cable onto
the<00:02:36.239> positive<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.430> clicking<00:02:38.430> sound<00:02:38.760> should

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
the positive and clicking sound should

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:49.340 
the positive and clicking sound should
be<00:02:39.180> heared<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:47.000> that<00:02:48.000> means<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:49.080> just

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
be heared and that means that you just

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.570 
be heared and that means that you just
powered<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:50.930> electro<00:02:51.930> valve<00:02:52.230> built

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
powered the electro valve built

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.300 
powered the electro valve built
electricity<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.750> will<00:02:54.959> either<00:02:55.350> open<00:02:55.739> it

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
electricity and that will either open it

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.040 
electricity and that will either open it
or<00:02:56.580> close<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.860> in<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:59.040> way<00:02:59.280> the<00:03:00.050> fuel

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
or close it and in this way the fuel

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.540 
or close it and in this way the fuel
from<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.760> LPG<00:03:02.760> system<00:03:02.970> should<00:03:03.570> reach

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
from the LPG system should reach

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.600 
from the LPG system should reach
theoretically<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:06.090> engine<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.890> this<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.400> one

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
theoretically the engine so this is one

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.810 
theoretically the engine so this is one

them<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.750> little<00:03:25.050> bit<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.440> check<00:03:25.980> them<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.900> see

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
them a little bit and check them to see

the Apogee reservoir in the trunk of the
car<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.580> I<00:03:36.060> will<00:03:36.239> do<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.570> same<00:03:36.900> thing

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
car and I will do the same thing

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.630 
car and I will do the same thing
I<00:03:37.800> will<00:03:38.310> power<00:03:38.640> those<00:03:39.450> two<00:03:40.220> electrodes<00:03:41.220> with

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
I will power those two electrodes with

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.339 
I will power those two electrodes with
the<00:03:42.000> positive<00:03:42.480> from<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.900> better

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
the positive from the better

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.009 
the positive from the better
and<00:03:43.860> let's<00:03:44.220> see<00:03:44.430> if<00:03:44.640> it's<00:03:44.849> clicking<00:03:45.360> here<00:03:45.720> also

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
and let's see if it's clicking here also

00:03:46.019 --> 00:04:05.630 
and let's see if it's clicking here also
or<00:03:46.890> not<00:04:01.250> okay<00:04:02.569> that's<00:04:03.569> it<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:05.250> was<00:04:05.459> the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
or not okay that's it that was the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.079
