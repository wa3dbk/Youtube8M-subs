00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.830
 is 2009 and nickelodeon is very far from 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.960
 be that successful channel that was although in 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.830
 his beginnings had successes like rugrats 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.420
 now nick is very lost and proof of 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.760
 this was the intrusion into the channel 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.920
 fanboy and chum chum who had the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.289
 opportunity to be one of the many 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.350
 nicktoons that probably you 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.390
 return fame and respect to nick 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.240
 however despite its many 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.830
 references to pop culture this was not 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.420
 what he promised to be 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.789
 [Music] 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.070
 fanboy and chum son was a series with 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.899
 several errors and the first error that 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.589
 he committed started from his campaign 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.899
 advertising campaign advertised fanboy 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:51.289
 and chum are like a premium brand stroke 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.719
 maybe the new govern put and that was 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.390
 give many expectations to a series 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.579
 whose future was unknown based 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.159
 only in the references they made 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.100
 and only in the first impressions 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:07.670
 of the characters that looked like two 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.520
 classic nerds sincerely watching the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.509
 promotional it looked like cambodia chum 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.130
 chum would be a good stroke but it was not like that 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:19.580
 the series did not reach what he talked about in his 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.100
 campaign and here all the errors are derived 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.229
 and destroying the error then 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.289
 would be the fanboy character a 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.289
 awkward desperate character and with the 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.060
 most selfish intention that exists 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.100
 let's try to polish and improve 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.649
 a funny way to the stereotype of 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.890
 nerd guy comic book reader who according 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.710
 represents but does not do it in its place 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.990
 makes it a stereotype p 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.330
 and if you are Mexican, you will remember a show 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.780
 called the rose of guadeloupe in which 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.369
 illustrates the otaku culture in a way 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.500
 ridiculous in an episode with two 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.280
 protagonists who wear a cosplay all 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.979
 the good day imagine that same 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.280
 stereotype but in animation and changes 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:09.110
 otaku culture by the nerds and ready 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.750
 it's the same a lousy lousy stereotype 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.010
 lousy that instead of it helping you 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.810
 people know better the 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.820
 behavior of people with 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.480
 that they live the strange and 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.330
 fools and this weirdness of the show 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.519
 he boasts having that nonsense that 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.030
 do the characters make them 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.380
 an annoying and exasperating couple both 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.840
 frank boyle as champions are 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.670
 characters that cry cry they move 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.890
 frantically thanks to its excessive 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.350
 consumption of sugar and do not have any 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.380
 respect towards others if we see them 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.720
 well they act exactly like bob 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.959
 sponge and patrician in their worst 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.760
 moments and if moments in which 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.510
 they do not really have a 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.129
 pisca moral because because if bob 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.409
 sponge and patrician have tortured 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.700
 squid fanboy and chum are not have 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.519
 no problem in setting fire 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.069
 accidentally with more already fell to 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.409
 electrocute the verb kombu or do that 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.629
 incinerate the seller lenny and not 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.489
 they show not a small part of 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.310
 conscience or repentance with 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.400
 regarding their actions for them not 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.319
 they do not care at all that 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.200
 allen and what in a plane turbine and 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.720
 apart they die because if they read and they 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.489
 disintegrated in an episode when the 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.709
 champions never become 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.950
 responsible for their actions everything is 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.440
 fun and this fun is something that 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.280
 the show does not have and go for the mistakes 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.959
 catastrophic in your script which are 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.730
 too many of what it's worth to use 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.859
 references to pop culture like the 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.170
 'mechanical orange' star wars or saving 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.629
 to the soldier ryan if you're going to use jokes 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.209
 eschatological five seconds after 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.069
 do it because create characters based 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.470
 in the emperor for skate of star wars 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.430
 or terminator if you are going to use them as 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.430
 ornament and you will not explode them 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.769
 good the best of them because to do 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.859
 scripts so badly written with jokes 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.560
 ridiculous the plot errors are 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:10.500
 massive in the series and this does not help 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.329
 in nothing even the moments of greatest 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.239
 climaxes have narrative rhythm errors 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:19.049
 and it can be very fast or slow in 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:22.680
 Sometimes the series lacks the rhythm and 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.570
 that's something very serious and talking about 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.759
 other kinds of mistakes like the characters 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.919
 secondary is very sad that of their 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.289
 nine characters as good as you 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.990
 mobile teacher or dollar nate or or the 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.849
 arctic man the few episodes that he 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.310
 save are those who use these 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.960
 characters as principals for example 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.789
 when the Arctic man freezes everyone 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.550
 children or when you want to get to 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:46.169
 valhalla but unfortunately most 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.169
 of the episodes have an aesthetic 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.820
 plot that is composed of 1 egg and 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.849
 champions in the frosty market 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.979
 lenny bothering egg or two rambo and 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.380
 chum chum ruining life falls the 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.560
 Several ways 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.430
 the scripts are the same script repeated 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.650
 mostly and it's not good and the 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.830
 writers as well as directors have 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.290
 most of the blame 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.820
 fanboy and chum chum is the perfect 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.990
 example that the scriptwriters strike 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.450
 from 2007 to 2008 it left havoc and if not 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.490
 you have a good scriptwriter in your series 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.650
 you dont have anything 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.530
 [Music] 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.479
 and without exceeding the time limit this 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.490
 It's all for me I'm your che 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.250
 CalderÃ³n and see you next week 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.320
 with a new video here in the 'area 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.240
 zero ' thanking people who 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.520
 they voted on facebook for the realization 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.560
 from this time we see each other
