00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.910
 Bad mood has mourned in this place now 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.809
 more info under Linux 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.640
 one of his employees has the malware can drive a tree 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.210
 and that in the middle of today's birds st the damage 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.439
 is not insignificant 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.560
 Harry Kopelman 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.869
 from Coleen has residence 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.869
 No are so already 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.850
 Something like that does not need mourning now 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.090
 he is a stand-up male 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.090
 south of Berlin and he stops driving a ferry 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.469
 44 riders 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.469
 have her horses lodged with him 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.260
 his whole pride will be his Herforth 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.440
 his new marketing strategy 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.440
 he left the newborn calves it is one year to slaughter 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.100
 there customers pay 50 euros at the moment 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.440
 at the other 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.010
 where you have to say now for 50 euros not more 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.900
 Percent would be calculated on a tax consultant was probably how to do that 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.530
 doing so 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.840
 and we have to 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.500
 70 euros net per month 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.290
 currently more than five 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.450
 Branca her baskets 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.820
 to the butcher the question on which the conductor Bern 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.880
 Percent increased 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.520
 as well as the amount 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.370
 the train has reached 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.350
 Percent of Oberadener butchers 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.050
 or in the book of my page 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.300
 virtual currency is only meant for slaughter 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.630
 Percent on my part were determined because you have several factors 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.350
 made 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.360
 in order to 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.160
 come from there and so on 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.670
 because we want the customer 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.240
 Deliver print quality 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.510
 and which one already heavy so we are not 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.369
 In the first place we will be the game but lack of clientele 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.919
 the 20 his animals are in the moment for that 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.919
 Over 500 customers are on a waiting list 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.009
 Sophie Demand he can not handle 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:21.589
 The breakthrough came with an article in a local newspaper 4 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.949
 and that was very hard to get over entrepreneurial to get in there 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.129
 get 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.489
 but at the beginning I had painted about newspapers per channel and the commercials 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.399
 should be alleviated 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:39.399
 Of course it is not optimal 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.209
 thereby preventing having point 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.340
 who entered earlier so over the years at 4 pm left at 18 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.790
 Clock 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.769
 but weak in the year 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.869
 the breakthrough comes earlier 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:56.409
 by which the ESL will be late 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:57.649
 there come 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:59.969
 Villiger sense though from the colleagues 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.799
 or the purchase Opera Turbo Porsche brought about the cause because Egypt 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:04.829
 Internet 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.290
 to have a pinch on my homepage with the new rb7 and therefore percent 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.839

 He holds back Kellberg as a reserve 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:20.510
 If one of his lease cattle dies, he is still looking for weaners 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:25.409
 he wants his flock to be solved the big demand explains Gerd cowering 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.709
 because consumers want to understand where their meat is coming from 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.199
 coming 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.889
 Too much closeness to his leasing customers and slaughter cattle that does not huddle 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:36.449
 to 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:40.519
 The customers get the numbers of dog tags under any circumstances the 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.259
 Calves took 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:43.959
 Experience is that is 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.840
 Children want but we do not want them 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.160
 we want children to participate 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.669
 Manzano in the district north of the Koelnmesse 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:56.019
 to get in the underpass and in battles and hate 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.270
 and already found but on white marble block 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.670
 and in the end it says 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.539
 occurred full confidence back 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.279
 the economic situation of the enterprise 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.309
 has improved significantly by the struggle of Liesing 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:12.799
 The tower now always has cash in its pocket 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.999
 Be tomorrow 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:17.999
 of the Erfurt lead in the overall standings 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.100
 Human Resource HR Mark Webber has one

 to the CDU and FDP are 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.129
 in Europe 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.900
 one can 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.740
 nowhere else 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.280
 2% brand York Ofen Fulda back inner peace again as big as RÃ¼gen tour 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.220
 or just 3 euros for its doors to Europe 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.790
 And if a customer does not pay his leasing rate 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.900
 heard that slaughter and automatically growls again greedy 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.139
 it is in the lease contract
