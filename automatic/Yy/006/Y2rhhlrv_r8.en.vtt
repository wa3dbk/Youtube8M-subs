00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.580 
Google Nexus 7 and this is it one
surprising<00:00:15.000> fact<00:00:15.480> about<00:00:15.629> it<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.139> there<00:00:16.410> when

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
surprising fact about it is there when

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.519 
surprising fact about it is there when
you<00:00:16.710> open<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.850> tablet<00:00:18.630> automatically

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
you open it the tablet automatically

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.200 
you open it the tablet automatically
lights<00:00:20.339> up<00:00:20.580> or<00:00:20.880> turns<00:00:21.570> on<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.490> same<00:00:23.939> thing

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
lights up or turns on and it same thing

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.050 
lights up or turns on and it same thing
goes<00:00:24.240> as<00:00:24.929> far<00:00:25.289> as<00:00:25.529> closing<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.730> will

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
goes as far as closing it it will

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.189 
goes as far as closing it it will
automatically<00:00:27.779> shut<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:29.070> screen<00:00:29.339> off<00:00:30.199> so

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
automatically shut the screen off so

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.530 
automatically shut the screen off so
that<00:00:31.230> was<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> surprising<00:00:32.279> thing<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.090> see<00:00:33.300> I

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
that was a surprising thing to see I

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.049 
that was a surprising thing to see I
wanted<00:00:34.470> you<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> see<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.220> construction<00:00:35.520> I

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
wanted you to see the construction I

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.080 
wanted you to see the construction I
think<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.770> reasonably<00:00:38.270> well<00:00:39.270> made<00:00:39.949> product

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
think it's reasonably well made product

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.410 
think it's reasonably well made product
for<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> price<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.809> mean<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.350> was<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.670> total<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.820> I

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
for the price I mean it was a total of I

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.930 
for the price I mean it was a total of I
believe<00:00:45.960> five<00:00:46.410> dollars<00:00:46.949> it's<00:00:47.190> crazy<00:00:47.520> how<00:00:47.760> they

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
believe five dollars it's crazy how they

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.790 
believe five dollars it's crazy how they
can<00:00:48.149> actually<00:00:50.149> manufacture<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.269> and<00:00:51.769> ship<00:00:52.769> it

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
can actually manufacture it and ship it

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.509 
can actually manufacture it and ship it
for<00:00:53.100> five<00:00:53.370> dollars<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.539> has<00:00:54.780> magnets<00:00:55.679> right

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
for five dollars it has magnets right

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.259 
for five dollars it has magnets right
here<00:00:56.910> here<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.789> it<00:00:59.789> locks

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
here here here and here so it it locks

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.259 
here here here and here so it it locks
with<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> magnet<00:01:01.829> action<00:01:02.339> you<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.730> notice<00:01:02.910> that

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
with a magnet action you can notice that

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:10.210 
with a magnet action you can notice that
right<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.960> back<00:01:07.170> has<00:01:07.640> this<00:01:08.640> little

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
right there the back has this little

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.910 
right there the back has this little
notch<00:01:11.220> where<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.940> could<00:01:12.650> flip<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.860> thing

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
notch where you could flip this thing

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.700 
notch where you could flip this thing
over<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.790> put<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.300> under<00:01:15.690> I<00:01:15.930> found<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.680> be

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
over and put it under I found this to be

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.790 
over and put it under I found this to be
a<00:01:16.860> little<00:01:17.690> irritating<00:01:18.690> because<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.260> not<00:01:19.470> too

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
a little irritating because it's not too

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.900 
a little irritating because it's not too
easy<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.310> put<00:01:20.580> under<00:01:20.960> but<00:01:21.960> once<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.320> do<00:01:22.910> you

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
easy to put under but once you do you

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.399 
easy to put under but once you do you
can<00:01:24.240> rock<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.440> thing<00:01:25.500> too

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.320 

again<00:01:31.550> functionality<00:01:32.550> wise<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:33.060> this

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
again functionality wise on this

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.570 
again functionality wise on this
propping<00:01:35.360> action<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:37.050> that<00:01:37.290> great<00:01:37.500> but<00:01:37.800> it

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
propping action is not that great but it

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.500 
propping action is not that great but it
does<00:01:38.790> work<00:01:39.440> it<00:01:40.440> also<00:01:40.650> has<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> place<00:01:41.880> here<00:01:41.910> for

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
does work it also has a place here for

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.980 
does work it also has a place here for
either<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.780> pen<00:01:43.170> or<00:01:43.440> one<00:01:44.400> of<00:01:44.430> those<00:01:44.670> styluses<00:01:45.450> if

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
like this and it's not going to fall

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.740 
like this and it's not going to fall
from<00:02:09.360> your<00:02:09.450> hand<00:02:10.489> not<00:02:11.489> sure<00:02:11.760> how<00:02:11.940> practical<00:02:12.450> it

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
from your hand not sure how practical it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.949 
from your hand not sure how practical it
is<00:02:12.870> but<00:02:13.640> because<00:02:14.640> when<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:15.000> flip<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.480> over<00:02:15.630> it

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
is but because when you flip it over it

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.290 
is but because when you flip it over it
kinda<00:02:16.290> goes<00:02:17.190> down<00:02:17.520> on<00:02:18.320> another<00:02:19.320> note<00:02:20.209> let<00:02:21.209> me

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
kinda goes down on another note let me

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.160 
kinda goes down on another note let me
turn<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.660> on<00:02:21.780> again<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:27.090> screen<00:02:27.810> doesn't

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
turn it on again the screen doesn't

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.720 
turn it on again the screen doesn't
align<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.650> great<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.280> can<00:02:29.400> see<00:02:29.580> that

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
align that great you can see that

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.110 
align that great you can see that
there's<00:02:29.910> more<00:02:30.239> bezel<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:30.959> this<00:02:31.500> side<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.190> its
