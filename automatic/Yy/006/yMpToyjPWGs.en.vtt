um I tried and putting LEDs on my tail
turning<00:02:44.459> lights<00:02:44.670> as<00:02:44.910> well<00:02:44.989> but<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.170> didn't

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
turning lights as well but that didn't

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.400 
turning lights as well but that didn't
work<00:02:46.500> out<00:02:46.830> because<00:02:47.870> there's<00:02:48.870> some<00:02:49.110> kind<00:02:49.350> of

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
work out because there's some kind of

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.290 
work out because there's some kind of
resistor<00:02:49.920> issue<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.610> makes<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.060> hyper

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
resistor issue and it makes it hyper

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.270 
resistor issue and it makes it hyper
blink<00:02:51.660> which<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:52.860> basically<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:53.850> just<00:02:54.260> so

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
blink which it's basically it's just so

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.100 
blink which it's basically it's just so
quick<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.519> just<00:02:56.730> seems<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.239> it's<00:02:57.510> just<00:02:57.750> the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
quick it just seems like it's just the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.840 
quick it just seems like it's just the
lights<00:02:58.230> are<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.950> doesn't<00:02:59.250> blink<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.700> it

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
lights are on it doesn't blink like it

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.320 
lights are on it doesn't blink like it
like<00:03:00.690> this<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:02.190> blinks<00:03:02.640> much<00:03:02.880> quicker<00:03:03.150> than

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
like this it blinks much quicker than

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.440 
like this it blinks much quicker than
that<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.050> I<00:03:04.319> had<00:03:05.069> to<00:03:05.100> abandon<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:05.850> idea<00:03:05.910> till

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
that so I had to abandon that idea till

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.740 
that so I had to abandon that idea till
I<00:03:06.540> can<00:03:06.690> find<00:03:06.959> some<00:03:07.459> solution<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:08.750> already

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
I can find some solution to that already

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.500 
I can find some solution to that already
thanks<00:03:10.319> bye
