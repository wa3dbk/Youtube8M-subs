00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.639
 Welcome once again to Kuyt blog on 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.860
 theme that I bring you today as you can 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.410
 see are problems when it comes to flirting 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.360
 the university and the one that you have been 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.550
 attentive to my life although neither 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.970
 he is very attentive to her because what happens 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.320
 is that 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.220
 and I thought it was going to be a little bit 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.460
 easier not to destroy the sense 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.420
 because I study also but I came 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.160
 with an idea of ​​flirting if they give and come to 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.410
 the university to bind practically and 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.300
 Of course I thought it was going to be a path 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.970
 of roses where we were all older than 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.590
 age was going to be easier and such and it turns out 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.730
 that not by the way 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.500
 forgive me if I'm talking a little bit 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.600
 short but it is that my companions of 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.670
 floor are sleeping and look what the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.300
 crazy I'm recording 2 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.500
 that's how they are already and maybe when you see 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.239
 the video is daytime but I'm 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.350
 recording weeks before at 2 o'clock 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.600
 morning and clear 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.690
 if you tell me good but it is 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.550
 easy if you have in the gay give a little 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.290
 well functioning, it will be fine but 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.690
 is that I 've never had to give that 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.300
 I have never known that they see that 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.490
 it's more I'm having problems now 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.920
 because I'm the kind of gay to you 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.330
 like a gay that is made past because 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.070
 I do not know what will happen but I have 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.140
 little pen the problem is that the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.540
 college gays you can detect 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.450
 are the ones that have a lot of proof then 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.909
 if you see a boy screaming with a 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.329
 with a pink folder and hugging her 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.740
 friends that help has activated the 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.360
 problem is that I do not like this 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.799
 kind of gay not for nothing in particular 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.950
 I just like that they have less 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:46.460
 pen and clear if you had the university 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.810
 and the guys without feathers are the ones that 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.880
 They look like heteros, so you have a 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.770
 very fat problem because you have to 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.810
 learn to differentiate heteros from 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.380
 the gays and of course if they do not have pen like 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.380
 you will know 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.790
 but then I was that I had a 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.950
 system and that is that I was gay 2.0 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.229
 because because it's not me anymore 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.310
 problems on the street what happens is that 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.619
 I like more to arrive in the networks 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.260
 social because you arias a stranger 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.540
 you tell him now I've seen your photos what 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.310
 handsome you could be someday not 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.740
 stay as is and we'll walk you 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.360
 but the street I'm too shy 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.020
 like to tell someone hello 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.340
 you are very handsome you leave me your number because 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.970
 they do not come out I would laugh 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.380
 I would laugh at the face that is another 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.390
 Of course that is the problem that now in the 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.120
 university like so many people are not 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.070
 you will find it on social networks 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.170
 then what he thought he always 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.630
 finds in party very well could 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.250
 get with them and if you do not fuck me but 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.380
 what happens in the environment there is a 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.870
 problem that there are guys who do not 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.209
 like to go to the environment and of course 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.129
 to I do not like I am that I have 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.260
 why go to a specific bar for 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.000
 flirt but of course in a disco not my 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.739
 current you can find gays and not 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.659
 gays then how do you know who 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.659
 enter it is the great dilemma of bei 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.829
 and nothing I would like to know how about your 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.780
 the first days in classes that already 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.249
 that charge is developed started and 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.620
 If there is a boy that you like or that 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:15.849
 be beautiful or such by certain I leave by 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.230
