this<00:03:43.630> increased<00:03:44.079> volatility<00:03:44.620> here<00:03:45.100> on<00:03:45.250> this

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
this increased volatility here on this

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.420 
this increased volatility here on this
old<00:03:46.180> lifetime<00:03:46.660> high<00:03:46.840> here<00:03:47.079> at<00:03:47.200> about<00:03:47.430> 160

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
old lifetime high here at about 160

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.550 
old lifetime high here at about 160
maybe<00:03:48.700> it's<00:03:48.850> 170<00:03:49.480> but<00:03:49.959> they<00:03:50.079> want<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.350> pull

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
maybe it's 170 but they want to pull

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.710 
maybe it's 170 but they want to pull
back<00:03:50.769> and<00:03:50.980> pull<00:03:51.280> back<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:52.000> became<00:03:52.660> a

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
back and pull back and that became a

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.470 
back and pull back and that became a
support<00:03:53.380> before<00:03:54.030> resistance<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.209> then<00:03:55.390> you

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
support before resistance and then you

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.840 
support before resistance and then you
moved<00:03:55.720> higher<00:03:56.130> what's<00:03:57.130> so<00:03:57.280> powerful<00:03:57.519> about

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
moved higher what's so powerful about

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.690 
moved higher what's so powerful about
this<00:03:58.239> is<00:03:58.420> it<00:03:58.600> just<00:03:58.810> seems<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.230> work<00:03:59.470> so<00:04:00.040> much<00:04:00.370> if

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
this is it just seems to work so much if

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.880 
this is it just seems to work so much if
we<00:04:01.180> zoom<00:04:01.209> in<00:04:01.570> on<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.930> same<00:04:02.140> price<00:04:02.530> chart<00:04:02.799> you

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
we zoom in on the same price chart you

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.940 
we zoom in on the same price chart you
can<00:04:02.920> tell<00:04:03.370> this<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.360> 15<00:04:04.840> months<00:04:05.140> of<00:04:05.230> data<00:04:05.350> you

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
can tell this is 15 months of data you

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.380 
can tell this is 15 months of data you
don't<00:04:06.190> really<00:04:06.310> get<00:04:06.489> a<00:04:06.549> lot<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.790> information

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
don't really get a lot of information

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.270 
don't really get a lot of information
even<00:04:07.690> if<00:04:07.810> we<00:04:07.959> were<00:04:08.049> back<00:04:08.079> here<00:04:08.500> yeah<00:04:08.890> there<00:04:09.160> was

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
even if we were back here yeah there was

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.160 
even if we were back here yeah there was
one<00:04:09.310> recent<00:04:09.850> point<00:04:10.120> but<00:04:10.269> you<00:04:10.360> can't<00:04:10.660> tell<00:04:10.930> how

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
one recent point but you can't tell how

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.360 
one recent point but you can't tell how
powerful<00:04:11.890> that<00:04:12.130> move<00:04:12.910> is<00:04:13.120> going<00:04:13.420> higher<00:04:13.900> and

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
powerful that move is going higher and

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.729 
powerful that move is going higher and
so<00:04:15.370> these<00:04:15.519> resistance<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:16.540> these<00:04:17.140> supports

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
so these resistance and these supports

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.560 
so these resistance and these supports
or<00:04:17.859> you<00:04:17.950> can<00:04:18.100> think<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.370> them<00:04:18.519> as<00:04:18.549> ceilings<00:04:19.209> and

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
or you can think of them as ceilings and

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.070 
or you can think of them as ceilings and
floors<00:04:20.070> what<00:04:21.070> used<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.400> be<00:04:21.459> a<00:04:21.820> ceiling<00:04:22.599> becomes

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
floors what used to be a ceiling becomes

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.309 
floors what used to be a ceiling becomes
a<00:04:23.200> floor

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:25.319 
a floor

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:28.350 
a floor
can<00:04:26.319> be<00:04:26.440> very<00:04:26.650> powerful<00:04:26.919> now<00:04:27.699> take<00:04:27.970> that<00:04:28.180> to

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
can be very powerful now take that to

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.999 
can be very powerful now take that to
this<00:04:28.479> price<00:04:28.780> chart<00:04:29.050> here<00:04:29.379> which<00:04:29.530> is<00:04:29.680> a<00:04:29.710> price

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
this price chart here which is a price

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.960 
this price chart here which is a price

chart of GD x what used to be a floor or
a<00:04:34.060> support<00:04:34.810> back<00:04:35.050> here<00:04:35.349> in<00:04:35.440> jun<00:04:35.680> 26<00:04:36.370> this<00:04:36.610> year

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
a support back here in jun 26 this year

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.379 
a support back here in jun 26 this year
if<00:04:37.210> you<00:04:37.780> zoom<00:04:37.810> forward<00:04:38.440> GDX<00:04:39.430> broke<00:04:39.819> below<00:04:40.090> that

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
if you zoom forward GDX broke below that

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.439 
if you zoom forward GDX broke below that
jun<00:04:40.629> 26<00:04:41.319> and<00:04:41.530> is<00:04:42.039> looking<00:04:42.250> like<00:04:42.669> that<00:04:43.000> floor<00:04:43.419> is

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
jun 26 and is looking like that floor is

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.369 
jun 26 and is looking like that floor is
becoming<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:44.110> ceiling<00:04:44.560> now<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.979> GD<00:04:45.970> x<00:04:46.090> is

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:46.379 
becoming a ceiling now and GD x is

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.010 
becoming a ceiling now and GD x is
condensing<00:04:47.379> or<00:04:48.060> back<00:04:49.060> filling<00:04:49.659> is<00:04:49.810> what

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
condensing or back filling is what

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.529 
condensing or back filling is what
people<00:04:50.229> sometimes<00:04:50.919> say<00:04:51.009> and<00:04:51.460> when<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:52.150> happens

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
people sometimes say and when it happens

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.779 
people sometimes say and when it happens
below<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:53.349> ceiling<00:04:53.680> or<00:04:54.129> below<00:04:54.759> the

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
below the ceiling or below the

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.999 
below the ceiling or below the
resistance<00:04:55.210> that<00:04:56.080> means<00:04:56.349> from<00:04:56.500> a<00:04:56.650> technical

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
resistance that means from a technical

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:58.170 
resistance that means from a technical
point<00:04:57.250> of<00:04:57.370> view<00:04:57.430> there's<00:04:57.819> a<00:04:57.879> higher

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
point of view there's a higher

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.689 
point of view there's a higher
probability<00:04:58.539> of<00:04:58.960> it<00:04:59.110> moving<00:04:59.440> lower<00:04:59.770> before<00:05:00.610> it

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
probability of it moving lower before it

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.999 
probability of it moving lower before it
moves<00:05:00.909> higher<00:05:01.240> and<00:05:01.629> so<00:05:02.530> that<00:05:02.560> is<00:05:02.830> something

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 
moves higher and so that is something

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:04.950 
moves higher and so that is something
that<00:05:03.219> I<00:05:03.370> noticed<00:05:03.909> in<00:05:04.060> GD<00:05:04.360> X<00:05:04.509> and<00:05:04.690> even<00:05:04.840> though

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
that I noticed in GD X and even though

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.100 
that I noticed in GD X and even though
GDX<00:05:05.440> up<00:05:05.650> until<00:05:06.099> this<00:05:06.219> point<00:05:06.280> is<00:05:07.150> down<00:05:07.449> about<00:05:07.690> I

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
GDX up until this point is down about I

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.700 
GDX up until this point is down about I
think<00:05:08.680> fifty<00:05:09.280> percent<00:05:10.110> that<00:05:11.110> doesn't<00:05:11.469> mean<00:05:11.590> it

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
think fifty percent that doesn't mean it

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.920 
think fifty percent that doesn't mean it
can't<00:05:11.919> go<00:05:12.219> lower<00:05:12.460> because<00:05:13.090> here<00:05:13.479> we<00:05:13.599> are<00:05:13.750> with

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
can't go lower because here we are with

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.320 
can't go lower because here we are with
GD<00:05:14.319> X<00:05:14.469> at<00:05:14.620> about<00:05:14.830> 21<00:05:15.190> dollars<00:05:15.699> and<00:05:15.940> the<00:05:16.030> next

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
GD X at about 21 dollars and the next

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.640 
GD X at about 21 dollars and the next
major<00:05:16.750> major<00:05:18.300> really<00:05:19.300> support<00:05:19.900> for<00:05:20.110> GD<00:05:20.349> X<00:05:20.469> is

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
major major really support for GD X is

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.189 
major major really support for GD X is
about<00:05:20.919> fifteen<00:05:21.580> dollars<00:05:22.030> so<00:05:22.780> having<00:05:23.169> that

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
about fifteen dollars so having that

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.350 
about fifteen dollars so having that
extra<00:05:23.469> benefit<00:05:24.069> of<00:05:24.159> looking<00:05:24.430> at<00:05:24.550> supports<00:05:25.150> and

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
extra benefit of looking at supports and

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.969 
extra benefit of looking at supports and
resistance<00:05:25.930> and<00:05:26.110> this<00:05:26.229> is<00:05:26.349> really<00:05:26.650> simple

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
resistance and this is really simple

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.170 
resistance and this is really simple
straightforward<00:05:27.400> stuff<00:05:27.789> this<00:05:27.940> is<00:05:28.060> not

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
straightforward stuff this is not

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.990 
straightforward stuff this is not
getting<00:05:28.569> crazy<00:05:28.990> deep<00:05:29.380> into<00:05:30.000> technical

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
getting crazy deep into technical

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.089 
getting crazy deep into technical
analysis<00:05:31.509> this<00:05:31.840> is<00:05:32.020> just<00:05:32.199> looking<00:05:32.440> at<00:05:32.620> pattern

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
analysis this is just looking at pattern

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.550 
analysis this is just looking at pattern
and<00:05:33.279> having<00:05:33.490> pattern<00:05:33.849> recognition<00:05:34.300> and<00:05:34.690> using

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
and having pattern recognition and using

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.379 
and having pattern recognition and using
that<00:05:35.590> to<00:05:35.710> your<00:05:36.009> benefit<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:37.060> it's<00:05:37.210> something

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
that to your benefit and it's something

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.689

pretty hard for that
yeah<00:06:39.850> but<00:06:40.660> then<00:06:40.780> when<00:06:40.930> that<00:06:41.050> dollar<00:06:41.260> comes<00:06:41.620> in

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
yeah but then when that dollar comes in

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.320
