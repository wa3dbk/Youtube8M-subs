00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:13.860
 we went to see them and necessary tests to 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.860
 make this recipe for mold bread 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:22.949
 35 grams of milk 265 grams of water 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.050
 of the tap that has rested for a while or 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.820
 mineral water reminds you of the importance 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.090
 to introduce the secrets at temperature 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.590
 environment 20 23 degrees 500 grams of 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.440
 bread flour or 55 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.340
 20 grams of sugar that as I have 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.270
 commented 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.960
 I prefer unrefined brown sugar 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.400
 a half tablespoon of salt coffee a 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.400
 about baker's yeast 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:55.840
 35 grams of butter and a spoonful 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.520
 of coffee from the juice of a lemon I remember 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.440
 that these ingredients are thought 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.050
 for a shellfish with a rate of 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.730
 humidity to 60% if your looks like now 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.030
 has a different humidity rate 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.080
 you have to adjust the relationship of 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.820
 solid liquids of the recipe 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.950
 he also taught us the digital scale 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.080
 to remind you of the importance of 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.080
 Dosing the ingredients accurately 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.410
 well we went to properly perform the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.480
 recipe for this bread first thing 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.610
 what we are going to do is prepare the 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.740
 butter with the necessary texture 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.659
 to be able to insert the tray with the 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.159
 rest of ingredients 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.289
 the butter has to have a 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.569
 soft texture and that we're going to 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:43.079
 get introducing in the microwave 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:43.079
 at maximum power about 34 seconds 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.120
 as you can see once outside the 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.450
 microwave the butter already has that 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.980
 soft atlanta consistency sought and what 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.330
 The only thing we do now is to mix a 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.590
 little to homogenize the butter and 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.570
 now we will have that is for 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.330
 insert it in the bucket in a moment 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.070
 adequate we separate it 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.590
 and we take the bucket from the bakery 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.900
 we introduce the ingredients in the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.300
 Order that recommends the instructions 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.280
 of the breadmaker in my case first 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.240
 the liquids and then the solids with the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.730
 which we enter first the water 265 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:29.580
 grams of tap water that there is 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.580
 rest a while or mineral water 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.430
 if the mind 35 grams of milk 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:50.490
 then we introduce a 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.490
 teaspoon of coffee from a lemon juice 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.520
 you will reach the turn of the butter that 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.900
 we have prepared previously 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.900
 35 grams of butter 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.690
 once we have the 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.710
 butter is the time to introduce 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:22.290
 the solids in the recipe 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:26.480
 500 grams of force flour or 55 grams 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.849
 we introduce carefully into the bucket 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.140
 and once we have all the flour in the 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:34.990
 bucket with the help of 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.730
 and the spoon we are going to make a hole in 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.190
 the medium that will be where we will put the 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:44.110
 yeast to avoid mixing 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:47.080
 with the salt and sugar of the recipe 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.120
 we simply introduce the sugar 20 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.160
 grams of sugar that as has been 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.300
 commented above 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.450
 I prefer unrefined brown sugar 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.230
 we introduce the sugar in one of the 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.230
 sides of the bucket 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.000
 and at the other end of the hole that 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.579
 we have made in flour 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.530
 we will introduce the salt a spoonful of 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.530
 half of salt coffee 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.230
 As you can see, we enter the edge of the 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:23.170
 bucket 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.830
 and now the other half a tablespoon of coffee 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.830
 of salt 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.659
 once we have all the ingredients 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:37.300
 introduced only we have the 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:41.770
 yeast a sachet of yeast 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:44.409
 bakery that we will introduce in the 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.830
 hole that we left in the center of 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.830
 the flour 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.790
 Now we just connect the 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.790
 bakery 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.919
 select the desired program in this 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.919
 Case is the sandwich program 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:13.259
 introduce the breadmaker the bucket 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.259
 the breadmaker 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.129
 give it to the star and we have it ready
