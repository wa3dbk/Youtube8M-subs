00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
 two 

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.240
 i 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.890
 fundamental part in the preparation of 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.630
 Chinese byd al alex ariza 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.390
 many remember him for years 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.660
 compared many terms you must remember 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.930
 for the controversies that have arisen 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.840
 around her, few know that this alex 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.360
 Ariza is Colombian born in Bogota 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.880
 but really raised in the USA if 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.890
 We arrived here when I was 10 years old 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.560
 then as everyone says 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.440
 South American now but if I do not have 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.520
 I have family still in Bogota and 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.800
 I miss a lot but in the fight against 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.500
 broli rafael before physical improvement 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.420
 from Chinese to me particularly from it seems 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.879
 that he still had a little bit 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.219
 which I'm price a little bit did not do well 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.170
 but as it says if it lacked a little 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.170
 how we have been working like this 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.700
 still with rivers and with my king had to 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.939
 go to leave here maidana here 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.939
 a week when we left with mike and 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.119
 then I had to go to china that there are two 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.920
 weeks and also missing one plus three 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.040
 weeks here with 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.860
 I work with Chinese and if I was missing 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.060
 a little bit but we go well and strong 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.490
 because everything went well for is no 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.130
 excuse because you are 100% with the Chinese 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.710
 well here we are addicted almost seven 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.479
 whole weeks and not this time we're going to 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.810
 enter one hundred percent in sign and if 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.810
 no more 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:46.110
 which is different in the ariza system 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.810
 so that of these results 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.450
 when they ask me that is that I 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.820
 I have almost 13 years in this sport I am 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.520
 I know the box and how to train a 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.210
 boxer so I think a fight of 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.720
 box is almost 80 percent of conditions 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.180
 and so the style training which 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.210
 technique that coaches teach 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.070
 they can not do that without condition and 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.720
 a person that inside with all with 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.750
 condition condition can be done 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.720
 any technique that you are taught and for 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.600
 that I want to put more condition more 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.300
 attention to that especially with respect 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.540
 to the kilo truth he had to adapt to 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.610
 your style was used to another 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.090
 form of cotillo of pietro then he never 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.400
 said nothing he is a person as well as if 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.549
 people know her well quiet and 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.090
 he comes to work he never told me he is 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:45.040
 very hard nor is it very easy either but 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.280
 there is an I I see that there are some things that 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.519
 they are a bit difficult for him but he 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.799
 he is a person that not well well good 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.650
 worker gives me yes hundred presented in 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.439
 the morning and if it is cold if it is whatever 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.480

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.970

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:09.180
