 hello gamers how are you on the day 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:08.259
 today my name is good I will teach 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.389
 is a trick that is to lock the boss 0 the 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:12.849
 king of fighters 2000 can be with 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.889
 any less character is made to you 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.600
 we have to choose it from good striker 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.610
 stop it from striker but to choose 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.320
 damon a damon is the one that we have to 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.880
 choose because he is the one who is going to 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.950
 serve for the trick 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.200
 I'm going to use Georgia then later at 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.210
 start of the fight you have to take out damon 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.610
 but they get away from as much as possible and when 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.129
 throws it to zero you have to run towards 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.670
 him when he gets up skip we go towards 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.239
 go ahead and this 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.239
 here we go 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.670
 and well this is how this trick depends 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.000
 what they do if they want to leave everything 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.740
 tie in life and in the blood you 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.320
 win by the amount of characters 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.000
