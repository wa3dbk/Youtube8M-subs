00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.570
 belgacom to be able to say is that this point over 60 years 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.000
 at the depression applaudimeter makes a strong impression but not only in 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.959
 bleachers 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:14.139
 on the ground also thanks to the coal number 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.460
 from the 3rd minute sculpin is there to register the first points 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.730
 he will reoffend in the 10th minute 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.199
 in the 12th minute the little anne-sophie pic 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.840
 we are at sport 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.840
 on a site 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.460
 but the coup de grace will come on this action the ball out of the fray 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.010
 he will fall into the hands of coal which him a fallback 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.570
 3 to 9 then it will be 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.650
 3 12 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.380
 thank you sir chapron 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.380
 side a try in the first half it is true that 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.120
 the blues with their new jersey 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.050
 he undergoes two parts 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.340
 yes it's the complicated half-time is one can not watch himself play little 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.560
 things 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.640
 difficult we missed a lot of points at the foot in the first half I think 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 that it could have helped to pick up the score fast enough 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.720
 at the recovery annecy not enough to return to the score 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.720
 but success will not be on the side of goal scorers 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.400
 the Annecy small sanctuary pressure 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.130
 % 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.219
 it is, however, what will score three more points 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
 this new penalty 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.250
 3 18 the cause was heard 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.900
 we did equal play in the second half 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.230
 97 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.230
 at the end of the match aof 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.890
 the f1 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.719
 for that the recent rebound as it is nicknamed in the hen 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.890
 but I knew he was coming here to make a result with a big 

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:07.299
 big motivation and only one was very difficult 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.750
 I think we are too shy we watched them play in the first half at 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.959
 aix and that's the 3d the second half is 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.449
 the fcc three points 2 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.369
 in the second half with two clear chances of testing for us 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:21.690
 and a foot success that usually 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.040
 we are at the rendezvous and who accuse him was not 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.920
 I made you an even game in semi-tone assured the best 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.349
 a big contribution of water from the dam report of the substitutes 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.270
 % and drivers can be 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.370
 dunga speech in the locker room a change of mindset of the players 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.930
 who has anyway if we have nothing to lose we'll try a little 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.599
 little 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.280
 Now it's time to play and it's time for the team to take 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:44.989
 aware that she can do it 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.759
 in 2008 in particular 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.539
 in the Bressan scrum is a very good scrum 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.039
 working on the go the team has made tremendous progress I remember 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.979
 of the match we made a novel 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:58.289
 today we've been really over two minutes good today we've been 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.630
 the 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.960
 when we were dominated but we did not crack we were dominated by not 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.859
 cracked 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.509
 further in accordance 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:06.629
 we touch the usa a little annoyed 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.059
 we knew it was their strong point 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:10.429
 we call summer 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:11.579
 enough to win 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.859
 we are still sick of other patients should not continue on this path there 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.059
 and as we said 'it's like we say players in India 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:21.239
 publisher's victory for 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.239
 I continue on this momentum the objective is to climb ever higher 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.259
 so I'm not sure given the ranking of the climb 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:32.909
 no no no my goal was hard for the rise early season so saw the 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.949
 ranking had not yet 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.849
 the storm was not yet relevant according to guy chabrout why 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.399
 gold we thought that nicolas the therapists 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:45.759
 debian reentry 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:49.579
 sculpin fought for a moment it's a way to get in areas 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.489
 very 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.079
 if we are a team where everyone day of 23 25 tons today that 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.979
 you want it is a story of passion 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.989
 we wanted because we were criticized even more in the end 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.419
 match 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:05.389
 we lost two games and we've always been here so we went 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.389
 said that we get a match and we win 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:13.439
 here we really wanted it a little earlier 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.819
 in afghanistan and a little 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.759
 we had a little wind in the back in the 7th 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.749
 also for us want it 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:22.749
 when one is helpless before having to content oneself with that 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:26.979
 we're planning a second half but that's not bad not because 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.689
 on the second half 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.119
 but here are some details to settle and hummer small worries in 

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:34.550
 scrum again and then after 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.479
 a little more success and I think that arcep can think of doing more 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:38.249
 teams 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:40.779
 I think I took the dimension of peace will have him no 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.809
 why we start to play better than it sends ben here it is one of the most 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:46.509
 big teams who could see her in this hen today a very 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:47.860
 very big scrum 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.500
 ea for in a year it goes I think we start to get started and their help 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.219
 to fall to other teams 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:57.659
 but we have to hang on the next home game will be held on the 28th 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.099
 november face bobigny 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.059
 here again read on the site 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:02.229
 we will need his audience
