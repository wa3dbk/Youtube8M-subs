00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.540 
okay so here's the comparison as you can
see<00:06:02.060> though<00:06:02.650> the<00:06:03.650> ultra<00:06:04.160> has<00:06:06.160> has<00:06:07.160> a<00:06:07.190> little

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
see though the ultra has has a little

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.160 
see though the ultra has has a little
blue<00:06:07.970> tint<00:06:08.390> to<00:06:08.990> it

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.770 

bluish<00:06:12.170> content<00:06:12.890> and<00:06:13.790> we<00:06:14.060> can<00:06:14.240> see<00:06:14.450> it<00:06:14.630> it's

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
bluish content and we can see it it's

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.430 
bluish content and we can see it it's
kind<00:06:15.050> of<00:06:15.140> late<00:06:15.590> right<00:06:15.830> now<00:06:16.360> and<00:06:17.360> the<00:06:18.170> other<00:06:18.290> one

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
kind of late right now and the other one

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.510 
kind of late right now and the other one
is<00:06:18.620> clear<00:06:20.230> um<00:06:21.230> I<00:06:21.440> was<00:06:21.560> expecting<00:06:22.010> for<00:06:22.190> this<00:06:22.310> to

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
is clear um I was expecting for this to

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.290 
is clear um I was expecting for this to
have<00:06:22.700> a<00:06:23.170> high<00:06:24.170> and<00:06:24.350> low<00:06:24.500> beam<00:06:24.800> but<00:06:25.760> I<00:06:25.790> guess<00:06:26.120> it

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
have a high and low beam but I guess it

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.320 
have a high and low beam but I guess it
since<00:06:26.630> it's<00:06:26.870> the<00:06:27.050> h7<00:06:27.680> they<00:06:27.890> did<00:06:28.100> am<00:06:28.220> only<00:06:29.090> one

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
since it's the h7 they did am only one

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.370 
since it's the h7 they did am only one
filament<00:06:30.320> so<00:06:31.250> it<00:06:31.370> should<00:06:31.520> be<00:06:31.610> only<00:06:31.840> only<00:06:32.840> one

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
filament so it should be only only one

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.810 
filament so it should be only only one
output<00:06:34.870> thing<00:06:35.870> is<00:06:36.230> none<00:06:37.100> of<00:06:37.340> this<00:06:37.490> ones<00:06:37.700> are

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
output thing is none of this ones are

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.140 
output thing is none of this ones are
gonna<00:06:38.000> be<00:06:38.090> the<00:06:38.210> bright<00:06:38.390> ones<00:06:39.910> well<00:06:40.910> I<00:06:40.940> guess

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
gonna be the bright ones well I guess

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:51.790 
gonna be the bright ones well I guess
we'll<00:06:41.300> find<00:06:41.510> out<00:06:50.290> all<00:06:51.290> right<00:06:51.440> here's<00:06:51.680> a<00:06:51.740> little

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
we'll find out all right here's a little

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.200 
we'll find out all right here's a little
tricky<00:06:52.310> but<00:06:52.520> I'm<00:06:52.700> pretty<00:06:52.910> sure<00:06:52.970> you'll<00:06:53.150> get<00:06:53.300> it

tricky but I'm pretty sure you'll get it

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.610 
tricky but I'm pretty sure you'll get it
the<00:06:56.210> little<00:06:56.510> spike<00:06:57.020> that<00:06:57.200> you<00:06:57.320> see<00:06:57.500> right

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620
