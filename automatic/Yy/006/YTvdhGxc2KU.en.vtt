00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.400
 since the appearance of the new system of 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.379
 currency purchases and maddi the dollar 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.150
 black instead of going down or controlling it 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.790
 has gone up to more than 200 bolivars 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.890
 to know what happens we have someone 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.930
 better than an economist ladies and 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.539
 first men the first 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.880
 statements of the black dollar hello hello 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.800
 what are the first things I want 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.449
 to clarify is that that dollar term 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.239
 I do not like black I find it degrading 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.400
 to pardon he did not know how you want it 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.040
 let's call dollar afrodescendant 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.980
 last night and how can you think of my dollar 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.110
 parallel or dollar alternative ok ok sir 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.570
 parallel can you explain what has 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.969
 happened because it goes up and up without anything 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.640
 You can do about it, I'll tell you 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.410
 is that something something something is doing wrong 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.050
 you Venezuelans definitely 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.170
 because I in other countries can not 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.649
 exist 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.850
 but what happens what happens from up here is 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.309
 I'm going up with a fair price 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.290
 right now but why should not 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.780
 be at the same price or very close to 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.820
 regulator is that that's the problem the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.799
 regulated should interview him 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.360
 although that already has disorders of 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.159
 personality because it has like three 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.700
 different prices the poor one does not even know 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.860
 what to do 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.140
 Aha but do not think you're doing it 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.920
 an evil going up so much you do not suffer from 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.890
 Vertigo 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.649
 good good that's what happens that I 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.690
 I am here tranquilito I am a lazy to me 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.640
 I do not like to move, you are the ones 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.330
 come down and what can I do what can I do 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.850
 do we go down yes yes of course yes 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.619
 here since they do not bring my cousin dollar 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.830
 free and they start printing tickets 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.170
 like crazy they go down I just the 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.479
 I see there but do not become the victim that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.270
 you are benefited from all this good 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.920
 that 's true but do not believe yourself anymore 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.299
 there comes a point when it gives me pain 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.840
 because I feel like I'm doing 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.179
 bullying the strong bolivar but what 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.750
 happens is that I am here one day and the 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.840
 another day 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.850
 dollar 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.280
 well I think it came back up and I do not let 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.599
 or we went back down and I do not know how is the 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.950
 thing all I know is that I lost the 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.950
 chance to buy it that price
