well I'm pretty sure there's a one way

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.530 
well I'm pretty sure there's a one way
to<00:00:50.300> get<00:00:50.600> to<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.200> exit<00:00:51.320> back<00:00:52.270> where<00:00:53.270> is<00:00:53.390> the

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
to get to the exit back where is the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.430 
to get to the exit back where is the
exit<00:00:53.600> oh<00:00:54.310> wait<00:00:55.310> there<00:00:55.550> it<00:00:55.610> is<00:00:55.810> so<00:00:56.810> we're<00:00:57.350> not

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
exit oh wait there it is so we're not

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.490
