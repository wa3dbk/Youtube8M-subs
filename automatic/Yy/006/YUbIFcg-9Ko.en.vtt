the Wong is marketed as a 57-millimeter
cube<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.420> found<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.930> be<00:00:18.960> just<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.320> little

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
cube but I found it to be just a little

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.080 
cube but I found it to be just a little
bit<00:00:19.680> smaller<00:00:19.980> than<00:00:20.039> other<00:00:20.279> 57-millimeter

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
bit smaller than other 57-millimeter

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.599 
bit smaller than other 57-millimeter
cubes<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> market<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.859> seems<00:00:23.070> closer<00:00:23.400> to

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
cubes on the market this seems closer to

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.849 
cubes on the market this seems closer to
56<00:00:24.150> millimeters<00:00:24.390> but<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:25.470> really<00:00:25.650> not

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
56 millimeters but it's really not

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.490 
56 millimeters but it's really not
noticeable<00:00:26.460> at<00:00:26.609> all<00:00:26.730> when<00:00:26.970> solving<00:00:27.289> this<00:00:28.289> has

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
noticeable at all when solving this has

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.710 
noticeable at all when solving this has
a<00:00:28.529> very<00:00:28.769> similar<00:00:28.980> feel<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> u<00:00:29.760> Ying<00:00:29.970> except

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
a very similar feel to the u Ying except

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.810 
a very similar feel to the u Ying except
it's<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.929> bit<00:00:31.109> less<00:00:31.260> crunchy<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.009> more<00:00:32.430> smooth

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
it's a bit less crunchy and more smooth

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.459 
it's a bit less crunchy and more smooth
it's<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.690> very<00:00:33.870> good<00:00:34.079> balance<00:00:34.410> between

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
it's a very good balance between

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.100 
it's a very good balance between
smoothness<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.579> Chris<00:00:36.149> penis<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.020> it

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
smoothness and Chris penis but it

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.720 
smoothness and Chris penis but it
definitely<00:00:37.260> leans<00:00:37.739> more<00:00:37.860> towards<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> side

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
definitely leans more towards the side

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.330 
definitely leans more towards the side
of<00:00:38.940> Krispies<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:40.230> very<00:00:40.469> light<00:00:40.739> cube<00:00:41.070> and

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
of Krispies it's very light cube and

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.790 
of Krispies it's very light cube and
feels<00:00:41.640> very<00:00:41.879> Airy<00:00:42.149> when<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.510> turn<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.649> one

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
feels very Airy when you turn it but one

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.350 
feels very Airy when you turn it but one
downside<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.910> doesn't<00:00:45.120> feel<00:00:45.300> very

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
downside is that this doesn't feel very

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.900 
downside is that this doesn't feel very
stable<00:00:45.840> on<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.770> current<00:00:46.980> tensions<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.610> feels<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
stable on my current tensions it feels a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.630 
stable on my current tensions it feels a
bit<00:00:47.940> flimsy<00:00:48.329> which<00:00:49.079> causes<00:00:49.469> lock<00:00:49.649> ups<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.579> I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
bit flimsy which causes lock ups but I

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.189 
bit flimsy which causes lock ups but I
have<00:00:50.820> tried<00:00:51.059> other<00:00:51.149> hua<00:00:51.420> Long's<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.960> this

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
have tried other hua Long's and this

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.779 
have tried other hua Long's and this
seems<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.559> because<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.010> my<00:00:53.129> tensions<00:00:53.579> and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
seems to be because of my tensions and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.360 
seems to be because of my tensions and
not<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> cube<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.350> be<00:00:55.530> warned<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.219> is

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
not the cube but be warned this is

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.680 
not the cube but be warned this is
definitely<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:56.850> as<00:00:57.000> stable<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.390> something

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
definitely not as stable as something

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.229 
definitely not as stable as something
like<00:00:57.780> an<00:00:57.930> how<00:00:58.020> long<00:00:58.230> version<00:00:58.469> 2<00:00:59.090> it's<00:01:00.090> also

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
like an how long version 2 it's also

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.330 
like an how long version 2 it's also
very<00:01:00.600> fast<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.680> not<00:01:01.800> nearly<00:01:02.219> as

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
very fast it's not nearly as

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.789 
very fast it's not nearly as
uncontrollable<00:01:03.149> as<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> Guan<00:01:03.690> Yin<00:01:03.930> was<00:01:04.140> but

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
uncontrollable as the Guan Yin was but

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.250 
uncontrollable as the Guan Yin was but
it's<00:01:04.949> still<00:01:05.040> very<00:01:05.250> fast<00:01:05.880> out<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> box<00:01:07.020> it

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it's still very fast out of the box it

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.840 
it's still very fast out of the box it
was<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> bit<00:01:07.619> hard<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.010> me<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.189> control<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
was a bit hard for me to control and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.090 
was a bit hard for me to control and
even<00:01:09.330> after<00:01:09.720> looping<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.080> with<00:01:10.200> tractus<00:01:10.560> 50k

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
even after looping it with tractus 50k

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.190 
even after looping it with tractus 50k
it's<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.760> little<00:01:12.030> bit<00:01:12.150> more<00:01:12.270> controllable<00:01:12.869> but

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
it's a little bit more controllable but

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.630 
it's a little bit more controllable but
it's<00:01:13.350> still<00:01:13.619> hard<00:01:13.830> for<00:01:13.860> me<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.159> control<00:01:14.490> at

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
it's still hard for me to control at

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.880 
it's still hard for me to control at
times<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.780> design<00:01:16.110> really<00:01:16.320> isn't<00:01:16.650> anything

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
times the design really isn't anything

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.130 
times the design really isn't anything
special<00:01:17.159> mo<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.119> seems<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.659> taken<00:01:19.020> what

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
special mo you seems to have taken what

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.140 
special mo you seems to have taken what
they<00:01:19.259> already<00:01:19.470> had<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.130> modified<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
they already had and modified it just a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.600 
they already had and modified it just a
little<00:01:21.450> bit<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.840> make<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> new<00:01:22.229> cube<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.310> edges

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
little bit to make a new cube the edges

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.670 
little bit to make a new cube the edges
resemble<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.180> along<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> little<00:01:24.900> bit<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
resemble and along a little bit but the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.050 
resemble and along a little bit but the
corners<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> slightly<00:01:26.520> different<00:01:26.759> design

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
corners have a slightly different design

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.999 
corners have a slightly different design
they<00:01:27.840> are<00:01:27.869> hollowed<00:01:28.320> out<00:01:28.409> which<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.799> haven't

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
they are hollowed out which I haven't

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.710 
they are hollowed out which I haven't
noticed<00:01:29.369> affect<00:01:29.640> performance<00:01:29.790> at<00:01:30.180> all<00:01:30.299> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
noticed affect performance at all it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.480 
noticed affect performance at all it
just<00:01:30.750> contributes<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.710> light<00:01:31.950> airy<00:01:32.159> feel

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
just contributes to that light airy feel

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.490 
just contributes to that light airy feel
that<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.790> get<00:01:33.000> when<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.270> turn<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.689> I've<00:01:34.409> done

not<00:01:38.939> sure<00:01:39.119> I've<00:01:39.240> even<00:01:39.479> come<00:01:39.600> close<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.290> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
not sure I've even come close to one and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
twists are the real flaw here they

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.969

aren't<00:01:45.869> as<00:01:45.990> bad<00:01:46.170> as<00:01:46.320> something<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.680> an<00:01:46.829> hour

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
like replacing your stickers but I've

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.969 
like replacing your stickers but I've
opted<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.750> replace<00:02:10.140> them<00:02:10.349> with<00:02:10.470> my<00:02:10.590> preferred

gotta<00:02:14.070> have<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:15.180> what's<00:02:15.330> my<00:02:15.450> conclusion<00:02:15.960> I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
gotta have it so what's my conclusion I

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.860 
gotta have it so what's my conclusion I
really<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.310> 3x3<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.270> love<00:02:18.570> how<00:02:18.720> it

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
really like this 3x3 and I love how it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.840 
really like this 3x3 and I love how it
feels<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.800> only<00:02:20.040> downside<00:02:20.490> that<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.640> can

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
feels the only downside that I can

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.370 
feels the only downside that I can
really<00:02:20.970> find<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:21.960> doesn't<00:02:22.110> feel<00:02:22.320> as

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
really find is that it doesn't feel as

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.260 
really find is that it doesn't feel as
stable<00:02:22.680> as<00:02:22.860> other<00:02:23.010> cubes<00:02:23.400> which<00:02:24.030> ultimately

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
stable as other cubes which ultimately

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.180 
stable as other cubes which ultimately
might<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:25.050> what<00:02:25.200> prevents<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.740> from<00:02:25.950> being

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
might be what prevents this from being

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.430 
might be what prevents this from being
my<00:02:26.370> main<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.820> really<00:02:27.540> like<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:27.870> my<00:02:28.140> cubes

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
my main I really like to have my cubes

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.710 
my main I really like to have my cubes
to<00:02:28.530> be<00:02:28.650> stable<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.310> for<00:02:29.940> me<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.210> is<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.390> slight

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
to be stable so for me this is a slight

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.140 
to be stable so for me this is a slight
deal-breaker<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:32.040> if<00:02:32.130> stability<00:02:32.640> isn't<00:02:32.850> as

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
deal-breaker but if stability isn't as

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.640 
deal-breaker but if stability isn't as
huge<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.510> thing<00:02:33.690> for<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.620> like
