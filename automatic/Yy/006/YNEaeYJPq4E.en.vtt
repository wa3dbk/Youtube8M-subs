like he is I think the stage is set for

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.220 
like he is I think the stage is set for
him<00:03:32.940> for<00:03:33.940> him<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.180> have<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.600> best<00:03:34.630> opportunity

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
him for him to have the best opportunity

him for him to have the best opportunity
to<00:03:36.100> emerge<00:03:36.459> as<00:03:36.730> one<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.060> best<00:03:37.269> in<00:03:37.450> the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
to emerge as one of the best in the

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.970 
to emerge as one of the best in the
conference<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.140> don't<00:03:38.290> think<00:03:38.500> he<00:03:38.620> could<00:03:38.769> ask

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
conference I don't think he could ask

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.250 
conference I don't think he could ask
for<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.310> better<00:03:39.489> opportunity<00:03:40.239> i<00:03:40.450> love<00:03:41.079> the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
for the better opportunity i love the

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.080 
for the better opportunity i love the
way<00:03:41.290> he's<00:03:41.530> prepared<00:03:41.980> himself<00:03:42.160> I<00:03:42.640> like<00:03:42.850> what<00:03:43.060> I

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
way he's prepared himself I like what I

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.940 
way he's prepared himself I like what I
see<00:03:43.150> right<00:03:43.390> now<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.989> his<00:03:44.109> leadership<00:03:44.320> and<00:03:44.829> his

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
see right now and his leadership and his

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.490 
see right now and his leadership and his
in<00:03:45.190> his<00:03:45.250> mental<00:03:45.850> state<00:03:46.090> physically<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:47.049> think

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
in his mental state physically I think

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.190 
in his mental state physically I think
he's<00:03:47.680> finally<00:03:47.920> healthy<00:03:48.540> which<00:03:49.540> he<00:03:49.720> struggled

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
he's finally healthy which he struggled

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.080 
he's finally healthy which he struggled
to<00:03:50.290> be<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.560> last<00:03:50.739> two<00:03:51.010> seasons<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.820> still

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
been very competitive he's got the

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.729 
been very competitive he's got the
competitive<00:03:54.400> juices<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:55.540> don't<00:03:55.720> need<00:03:55.870> that

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
competitive juices you don't need that

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.310 
competitive juices you don't need that
anymore<00:03:56.950> but<00:03:57.850> I<00:03:58.060> really<00:03:58.660> like<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.049> way<00:03:59.079> he's

the<00:04:05.470> process<00:04:05.500> for<00:04:06.070> your<00:04:06.160> program<00:04:06.340> trying<00:04:06.790> to

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
the process for your program trying to

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.789 
the process for your program trying to
take<00:04:07.090> that<00:04:07.299> step<00:04:07.359> forward<00:04:08.109> and<00:04:08.170> as<00:04:08.410> a<00:04:08.440> coach

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.699 
take that step forward and as a coach
what<00:04:09.130> goes<00:04:09.340> into<00:04:09.780> really<00:04:10.780> developing<00:04:11.470> that

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
what goes into really developing that

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.160 
what goes into really developing that
culture<00:04:12.310> of<00:04:12.489> getting<00:04:13.209> everybody<00:04:13.570> on<00:04:13.810> board

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
culture of getting everybody on board

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.680 
culture of getting everybody on board
with<00:04:14.380> winning<00:04:14.640> well<00:04:15.640> I<00:04:15.670> think<00:04:15.820> we're<00:04:16.359> ahead<00:04:16.479> of

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
with winning well I think we're ahead of

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.710 
with winning well I think we're ahead of
schedule<00:04:16.840> I<00:04:17.470> had<00:04:18.340> no<00:04:18.549> clue<00:04:19.060> that<00:04:19.180> we<00:04:19.479> would

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
schedule I had no clue that we would

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.659 
schedule I had no clue that we would
have<00:04:19.840> gone<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.229> two<00:04:20.530> bowl<00:04:20.769> games<00:04:20.799> when<00:04:21.549> we

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
have gone to two bowl games when we

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.730 
have gone to two bowl games when we
first<00:04:21.909> got<00:04:22.150> there<00:04:22.419> in<00:04:22.539> 12<00:04:22.780> so<00:04:23.289> I<00:04:23.320> think<00:04:23.409> we're

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
first got there in 12 so I think we're

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.060 
first got there in 12 so I think we're
ahead

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
ahead

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.500 
ahead
scheduled<00:04:24.460> I<00:04:24.580> think<00:04:24.820> some<00:04:25.120> of<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.300> things

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
scheduled I think some of the things

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.540 
scheduled I think some of the things
that<00:04:25.600> got<00:04:25.840> us<00:04:25.990> there<00:04:26.230> number<00:04:27.130> one<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.340> would

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
that got us there number one I would

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.160 
that got us there number one I would
point<00:04:27.820> to<00:04:28.030> accountability<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:28.960> being

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
point to accountability and being

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.960 
point to accountability and being
accountable<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.950> little<00:04:30.220> things<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:30.790> don't

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
accountable to the little things I don't

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.970 
accountable to the little things I don't
think<00:04:31.240> any<00:04:31.420> team<00:04:31.660> can<00:04:31.870> be<00:04:32.020> successful<00:04:32.680> without

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
think any team can be successful without

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.400 
think any team can be successful without
