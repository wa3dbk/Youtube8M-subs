00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
say the production at garrett had on my

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.660 
say the production at garrett had on my
field<00:01:51.310> speaks<00:01:51.670> for<00:01:51.880> itself<00:01:51.909> yeah<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:54.250> I<00:01:54.460> mean

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
field speaks for itself yeah but I mean

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.770 
field speaks for itself yeah but I mean
our<00:01:55.030> goal<00:01:55.720> was<00:01:56.079> to<00:01:56.820> maybe<00:01:57.820> go<00:01:58.090> into<00:01:58.479> it<00:01:58.630> and

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
our goal was to maybe go into it and

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.499 
our goal was to maybe go into it and
recruit<00:01:59.189> different<00:02:00.189> types<00:02:00.429> of<00:02:00.640> guys<00:02:00.820> maybe<00:02:01.210> to

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
recruit different types of guys maybe to

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.700 
recruit different types of guys maybe to
fit<00:02:01.720> our<00:02:01.750> scheme<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.170> little<00:02:02.439> bit<00:02:02.560> better

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
fit our scheme a little bit better

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.950 
fit our scheme a little bit better
whether<00:02:03.610> they<00:02:03.789> were<00:02:03.850> bigger<00:02:04.149> guys<00:02:04.479> arrange

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
whether they were bigger guys arrange

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.410 
whether they were bigger guys arrange
your<00:02:05.140> guys<00:02:05.350> or<00:02:05.740> faster<00:02:06.369> guys<00:02:06.579> or<00:02:06.939> you<00:02:07.299> know

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
your guys or faster guys or you know

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.509 
your guys or faster guys or you know
there<00:02:07.630> were<00:02:07.689> different<00:02:07.720> things<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.590> for<00:02:09.399> the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
there were different things and for the

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.460 
there were different things and for the
most<00:02:09.670> part<00:02:09.789> I<00:02:09.970> think<00:02:10.000> we<00:02:10.330> feel<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:11.140> needs<00:02:11.380> that

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
most part I think we feel the needs that

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.910 
most part I think we feel the needs that
we<00:02:11.560> want<00:02:11.890> with<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.220> guys<00:02:12.430> we<00:02:12.700> have

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
we want with the guys we have

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.110 
we want with the guys we have
defensively<00:02:14.920> though<00:02:15.190> if<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.489> look<00:02:15.700> at<00:02:15.849> our

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
defensively though if you look at our

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.270 
defensively though if you look at our
signees<00:02:16.660> from<00:02:16.989> top<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.230> bottom<00:02:17.380> we're

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
signees from top to bottom we're

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.670 
signees from top to bottom we're
offensive<00:02:19.030> heavy<00:02:19.269> so<00:02:20.110> there's<00:02:20.380> still<00:02:20.650> a

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
offensive heavy so there's still a

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.199 
offensive heavy so there's still a
little<00:02:20.890> bit<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.190> work<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.370> do<00:02:21.610> recruiting<00:02:22.030> wise

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
little bit of work to do recruiting wise

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.910 
little bit of work to do recruiting wise
on<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.450> defensive<00:02:22.930> side<00:02:22.989> which<00:02:23.410> is<00:02:23.530> part<00:02:23.799> of

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
on the defensive side which is part of

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.890 
on the defensive side which is part of
it<00:02:24.069> there's<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.310> lot<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.489> kids<00:02:24.760> who<00:02:24.910> are<00:02:25.030> still

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
it there's a lot of kids who are still

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.360 
it there's a lot of kids who are still
inside<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.560> kind<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.769> waiting<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.099> little<00:02:27.280> bit

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
inside and kind of waiting a little bit

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.850 
inside and kind of waiting a little bit
that<00:02:28.180> we're<00:02:28.480> in<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.720> mix<00:02:28.959> with<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.470> that's

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
that we're in a mix with and that's

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.530 
that we're in a mix with and that's
hopefully<00:02:30.519> that<00:02:30.670> comes<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:31.090> little<00:02:31.269> bit<00:02:31.360> later

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
hopefully that comes a little bit later

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.410 
hopefully that comes a little bit later
down<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.780> road<00:02:32.069> but<00:02:33.069> i<00:02:33.310> think<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.180> kids

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
down the road but i think that the kids

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.280 
down the road but i think that the kids
that<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:34.569> did<00:02:34.840> bring<00:02:35.110> in<00:02:35.670> they<00:02:36.810> fit<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:38.140> or

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
that we did bring in they fit that or

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.680 
that we did bring in they fit that or
they<00:02:38.410> fit<00:02:38.739> specific<00:02:39.099> needs<00:02:39.819> that<00:02:40.150> we<00:02:40.480> needed

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
they fit specific needs that we needed

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.690 
they fit specific needs that we needed
whether<00:02:41.019> again<00:02:41.680> whether<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.040> was<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.190> position

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
whether again whether it was a position

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.240 
whether again whether it was a position
based<00:02:42.910> or<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.180> size<00:02:43.420> based<00:02:43.720> or<00:02:43.959> whatever<00:02:44.349> we

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
based or a size based or whatever we

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.670 
based or a size based or whatever we
were<00:02:45.400> able<00:02:45.549> to<00:02:45.849> go<00:02:46.030> after<00:02:46.239> certain<00:02:47.109> kids<00:02:47.410> with

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
of a little bit more depth offensively

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.030 
of a little bit more depth offensively
up<00:03:06.130> front<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:08.019> guys<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.410> we<00:03:08.530> signed<00:03:08.829> we

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
up front and the guys that we signed we

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.979 
up front and the guys that we signed we

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
think are good players and some of them

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.750 
think are good players and some of them
may<00:03:13.989> fit<00:03:14.319> in<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.470> more<00:03:14.650> specific<00:03:14.920> need<00:03:15.430> with

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760
