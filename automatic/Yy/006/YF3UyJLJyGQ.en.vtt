00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.070 
showing you how I do it this is how I do
it<00:04:00.680> good<00:04:01.310> dokie<00:04:01.610> to<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.910> third<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.480> final<00:04:02.959> way

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
it good dokie to the third and final way

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.470 
it good dokie to the third and final way
that<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.319> do<00:04:03.440> it<00:04:03.739> is<00:04:03.890> still<00:04:04.549> with<00:04:04.730> powder<00:04:05.000> but

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
that I do it is still with powder but

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.600 
that I do it is still with powder but
this<00:04:05.810> time<00:04:06.140> there<00:04:06.470> is<00:04:06.590> no<00:04:06.620> contouring<00:04:07.430> powder

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
this time there is no contouring powder

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.149 
this time there is no contouring powder
it's<00:04:07.940> only<00:04:08.269> highlighting<00:04:08.989> matte<00:04:09.379> and<00:04:09.709> shimmer

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
it's only highlighting matte and shimmer

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.280 
it's only highlighting matte and shimmer
I'm<00:04:10.459> gonna<00:04:10.610> take<00:04:10.849> this<00:04:11.090> brush<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.810> highlight

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
I'm gonna take this brush to highlight

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.009 
I'm gonna take this brush to highlight
it's<00:04:13.099> basically<00:04:13.610> reverse<00:04:13.940> contouring<00:04:14.540> where

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
it's basically reverse contouring where

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.870 
it's basically reverse contouring where
you're<00:04:15.440> highlighting<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.130> side<00:04:16.370> of<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:16.609> nose

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
you're highlighting the side of the nose

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.659 
you're highlighting the side of the nose
so<00:04:17.510> that<00:04:17.720> gives<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.229> illusion<00:04:18.739> that<00:04:19.070> you

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
so that gives the illusion that you

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.150 
so that gives the illusion that you
contour<00:04:20.269> it<00:04:20.389> because<00:04:20.690> your<00:04:20.900> skin<00:04:21.260> is<00:04:21.620> darker

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
contour it because your skin is darker

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.980 
contour it because your skin is darker
than<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.520> powder<00:04:22.850> that<00:04:23.090> you're<00:04:23.240> applying<00:04:23.449> so

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
than the powder that you're applying so

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.450 
than the powder that you're applying so
you're<00:04:24.110> kind<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.410> creating<00:04:24.800> a<00:04:24.860> shadow<00:04:25.160> on<00:04:25.400> the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
you're kind of creating a shadow on the

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.250 
you're kind of creating a shadow on the
side<00:04:25.699> of<00:04:25.910> your<00:04:26.060> nose<00:04:26.180> see<00:04:26.750> what<00:04:26.900> I'm<00:04:26.990> trying<00:04:27.110> to

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
side of your nose see what I'm trying to

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.439 
side of your nose see what I'm trying to
say<00:04:27.440> is<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:28.190> want<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.490> imagine<00:04:28.729> that<00:04:29.060> you're

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
say is you want to imagine that you're

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.600 
say is you want to imagine that you're
cleaning<00:04:29.780> up<00:04:30.020> and<00:04:30.260> highlighting<00:04:30.949> the<00:04:31.220> size<00:04:31.460> of

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
cleaning up and highlighting the size of

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.969 
cleaning up and highlighting the size of
your<00:04:31.760> nose<00:04:31.940> as<00:04:32.270> if<00:04:32.419> you<00:04:32.630> drew<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.380> contoured

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
your nose as if you drew the contoured

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.200 
your nose as if you drew the contoured
lines<00:04:35.080> then<00:04:36.080> you're<00:04:36.229> just<00:04:36.350> gonna<00:04:36.500> take<00:04:36.889> some

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
lines then you're just gonna take some

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.719 
lines then you're just gonna take some
shimmery<00:04:38.210> highlight<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.340> place<00:04:40.340> that<00:04:40.580> down

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
shimmery highlight and place that down

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.189 
shimmery highlight and place that down
the<00:04:40.880> bridge<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.210> your<00:04:41.240> nose<00:04:41.360> because<00:04:41.960> this<00:04:42.110> is

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
the bridge of your nose because this is

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.320 
the bridge of your nose because this is
going<00:04:42.380> to<00:04:42.470> bring<00:04:42.620> your<00:04:42.800> nose<00:04:42.979> forward<00:04:43.400> but<00:04:44.300> I

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
going to bring your nose forward but I

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.850 
going to bring your nose forward but I
like<00:04:44.630> this<00:04:44.810> way<00:04:44.960> because<00:04:45.200> it<00:04:45.530> looks<00:04:45.710> a<00:04:45.830> bit

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
like this way because it looks a bit

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.920 
like this way because it looks a bit
more<00:04:46.039> natural<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.940> this<00:04:47.120> is<00:04:47.270> something<00:04:47.690> you

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
more natural and this is something you

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.960 
more natural and this is something you
definitely<00:04:48.169> Rock<00:04:48.800> in<00:04:48.979> the<00:04:49.070> daytime<00:04:49.430> it

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
definitely Rock in the daytime it

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.430 
definitely Rock in the daytime it
doesn't<00:04:50.270> necessarily<00:04:50.810> make<00:04:50.960> your<00:04:51.139> nose<00:04:51.289> look

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
doesn't necessarily make your nose look

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.650 
doesn't necessarily make your nose look
super<00:04:52.010> thin<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:52.490> chiseled<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:53.120> contoured

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
super thin and chiseled and contoured

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.940 
super thin and chiseled and contoured
but<00:04:54.020> it<00:04:54.139> does<00:04:54.349> give<00:04:54.620> it<00:04:54.650> a<00:04:54.740> bit<00:04:54.919> more

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
but it does give it a bit more

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.700 
but it does give it a bit more
definition<00:04:55.310> it<00:04:56.000> gives<00:04:56.240> us<00:04:56.419> a<00:04:56.599> life<00:04:56.960> where

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
definition it gives us a life where

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.640 
definition it gives us a life where
those<00:04:58.099> are

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
those are

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.860 
those are
