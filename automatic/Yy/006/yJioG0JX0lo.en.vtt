00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
the articulation will be cleaner if you

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.510 
the articulation will be cleaner if you
be<00:01:56.049> sure<00:01:56.349> that<00:01:56.649> you've<00:01:56.799> practiced<00:01:57.069> your

section<00:02:00.159> can<00:02:00.640> be<00:02:00.670> practiced<00:02:01.390> slurred<00:02:06.209> in<00:02:07.470> that

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
section can be practiced slurred in that

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.410 
section can be practiced slurred in that
way<00:02:08.649> your<00:02:08.829> fingers<00:02:09.220> become<00:02:09.610> even<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.239> the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
Takata Takata is going to be even on top

Takata Takata is going to be even on top
of<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.739> another<00:02:14.739> important<00:02:15.370> thing<00:02:15.549> to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
of that another important thing to

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.000 
of that another important thing to
consider<00:02:15.819> is<00:02:16.359> that<00:02:16.959> this<00:02:17.079> opens<00:02:17.620> with<00:02:17.829> an

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
consider is that this opens with an

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.819 
consider is that this opens with an
eighth<00:02:18.220> note<00:02:18.250> which<00:02:18.819> is<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:19.030> duple<00:02:19.750> rhythm<00:02:20.170> it's

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
eighth note which is a duple rhythm it's

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.640 
eighth note which is a duple rhythm it's
followed<00:02:21.370> by<00:02:21.400> triplets<00:02:22.359> so<00:02:22.600> that<00:02:23.109> first<00:02:23.410> C

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
followed by triplets so that first C

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.979 
followed by triplets so that first C
sharp<00:02:24.010> is<00:02:24.220> ever<00:02:24.489> so<00:02:24.730> slightly<00:02:25.090> longer<00:02:25.600> than

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
sharp is ever so slightly longer than

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.530 
sharp is ever so slightly longer than
this<00:02:26.530> then<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.190> triple<00:02:28.030> tonguing<00:02:28.180> that

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
this then the triple tonguing that

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.410 
this then the triple tonguing that
follows<00:02:29.019> it<00:02:29.340> another<00:02:30.340> important<00:02:30.910> point<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.359> to

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
follows it another important point is to

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.930 
follows it another important point is to
make<00:02:31.720> sure<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:32.139> in<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.380> fourth<00:02:32.709> line<00:02:33.010> your

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
make sure that in the fourth line your

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.330 
make sure that in the fourth line your
pick<00:02:34.450> up<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.170> triplets<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.889> the<00:02:36.010> slurred

pick up to the triplets to the slurred

pick up to the triplets to the slurred
chromatic<00:02:37.060> section<00:02:37.600> is<00:02:37.829> definitely<00:02:38.829> a

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
chromatic section is definitely a

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.280 
chromatic section is definitely a
sixteenth<00:02:39.519> note<00:02:39.639> rather<00:02:40.569> than<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.079> eighth

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
sixteenth note rather than the eighth

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.460 
sixteenth note rather than the eighth
notes<00:02:41.739> that<00:02:42.609> sometimes<00:02:43.299> precede<00:02:43.810> these<00:02:44.049> we

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
notes that sometimes precede these we

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.080 
notes that sometimes precede these we
have<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.650> couple<00:02:44.769> of<00:02:45.130> phrases<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.730> have<00:02:45.880> those

have a couple of phrases that have those

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.960 
have a couple of phrases that have those
sixteenth<00:02:46.660> note<00:02:46.900> pickups<00:02:47.319> so<00:02:47.560> be<00:02:48.430> sure<00:02:48.639> you<00:02:48.790> do
