 give that hint of satisfaction of caretakers satisfaction at the end of each meal on 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.800
 problem and that dooolci involve a high caloric intake 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.890
 they are often composed of nutrients not recommended because they are rich in fats 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.960
 of those simple sugars and the people who follow a weight loss diet or who 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.140

 they are often unable to consume the Turks 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.670
 and we have also seen that the Mediterranean diet 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.729
 foresees in its pyramid although at the top a share of desserts that 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.010
 pleasures we say of the del desert in our food how to do for 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.410
 reconciling these two needs on the one hand the pleasure of cooking there 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.769
 satisfaction of eating sweet and sometimes the inability to consume them 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.379

 celiac ie intolerance to gluten the inability 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.630
 by some people to digest a protein on the page

 kelkoo ti ne 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.979
 and desserts are often made to give them celiac disease as a result 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.770
 they cannot consume 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.400

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.220
 a weight loss diet. they can't often 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.760
 for reasons we have said eating sweets can add up so because they are 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.890
 some components have been replaced instead of butter 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.670

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.729
 chopped yoghurt. fruit for which we are faced with a dessert with 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.670
 low calorie voice and that can often be consumed even by people who 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.670
