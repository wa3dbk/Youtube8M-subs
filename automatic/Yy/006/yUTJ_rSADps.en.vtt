it<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.619> gotta<00:00:29.099> say<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.490> Ward's<00:00:29.820> end<00:00:30.029> is

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
it but I gotta say this Ward's end is

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.240 
it but I gotta say this Ward's end is
doing<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.480> lot<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.720> work<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.740> really<00:00:31.920> cool

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
doing a lot of work it's a really cool

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.400 
doing a lot of work it's a really cool
word<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:33.180> really<00:00:33.570> looks<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.170> shouldn't

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
word it really looks like it shouldn't

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.190 
word it really looks like it shouldn't
be<00:00:34.620> possible<00:00:34.649> like<00:00:35.640> off<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.390> mat<00:00:36.600> basically

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
be possible like off the mat basically

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.049 
be possible like off the mat basically
but<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.770> hardest<00:00:38.129> lane<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.520> push<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:38.940> them

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
but the hardest lane to push for them

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.729 
but the hardest lane to push for them
the<00:00:39.540> bottom<00:00:39.840> lane<00:00:39.989> would<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.230> easier<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the bottom lane would be easier to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.780 
the bottom lane would be easier to
spread<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.489> get<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> right

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
spread out in and get the right

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.819 
spread out in and get the right
positioning<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.480> would<00:00:42.660> feel<00:00:42.840> especially<00:00:43.559> now

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
positioning I would feel especially now

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.319 
positioning I would feel especially now
when<00:00:44.070> they<00:00:44.190> run<00:00:44.340> into<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.550> wall<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.879> six<00:00:45.059> wards

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
when they run into a wall of six wards

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.639 
when they run into a wall of six wards
what<00:00:45.510> actually<00:00:45.870> should<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.110> doing<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.410> all

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
what actually should be doing is all

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.779 
what actually should be doing is all
wait<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> second<00:00:47.250> they're<00:00:47.340> actually<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
wait a second they're actually going to

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.299 
wait a second they're actually going to
drop<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> wards<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.250> can

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
drop the wards for this but not if I can

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.060 
drop the wards for this but not if I can
get<00:00:50.629> a<00:00:51.629> way<00:00:51.750> another<00:00:52.350> ward<00:00:52.620> gets<00:00:52.829> stolen

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
get a way another ward gets stolen

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.490 
get a way another ward gets stolen
that's<00:00:53.309> actually<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> huge<00:00:54.059> pick<00:00:54.360> up<00:00:54.539> here<00:00:54.809> he

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that's actually a huge pick up here he

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.470 
that's actually a huge pick up here he
drops<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.920> already<00:00:56.219> why<00:00:56.370> k<00:00:56.730> YX<00:00:57.000> white<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.360> eye
