00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
speaker is a different design to the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.949 
speaker is a different design to the
other<00:02:38.030> ones<00:02:38.240> which<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.570> really<00:02:38.900> good<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:43.959> think

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
other ones which is really good I think

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.390 
other ones which is really good I think
it<00:02:45.200> looks<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.470> lot<00:02:45.650> better<00:02:45.800> when<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.250> have<00:02:46.370> a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
it looks a lot better when you have a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.240 
it looks a lot better when you have a
different<00:02:46.760> design<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.420> center<00:02:47.750> speaker

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
different design to the center speaker

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.490 
different design to the center speaker
as<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.340> can<00:02:49.640> see<00:02:49.880> it's<00:02:50.060> fairly<00:02:50.270> well<00:02:50.570> packaged

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
as you can see it's fairly well packaged

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.100 
as you can see it's fairly well packaged
and<00:02:51.739> boxed<00:02:52.160> it'll<00:02:53.000> write<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.330> me<00:02:53.590> via<00:02:54.590> mail<00:02:55.580> so

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
and boxed it'll write to me via mail so

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.390 
and boxed it'll write to me via mail so
no<00:02:57.110> problems<00:02:57.530> there<00:02:57.770> everything<00:02:58.160> was<00:02:58.280> in

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
no problems there everything was in

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.850 
two holes for the allen key that tighten
up<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.970> base<00:04:52.180> to<00:04:52.900> you<00:04:53.050> stop<00:04:53.349> it<00:04:53.470> from<00:04:53.590> rotating

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
up the base to you stop it from rotating

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.980 
up the base to you stop it from rotating
and<00:04:54.250> moving<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:55.180> sticker<00:04:55.389> on<00:04:55.509> the<00:04:55.569> back<00:04:55.660> comes

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
and moving the sticker on the back comes

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.469 
and moving the sticker on the back comes
off<00:04:56.169> so<00:04:56.800> you<00:04:57.789> don't<00:04:58.000> have<00:04:58.090> to<00:04:58.210> worry<00:04:58.360> about

off so you don't have to worry about

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.409 
off so you don't have to worry about
that<00:04:58.780> that's<00:04:59.020> and<00:04:59.949> gives<00:05:00.759> you<00:05:00.819> an<00:05:00.910> idea<00:05:01.150> of<00:05:01.210> the

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
that that's and gives you an idea of the

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.309 
that that's and gives you an idea of the
size<00:05:02.259> of<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:03.090> whole<00:05:04.090> unit<00:05:04.599> including<00:05:05.080> several

size of the whole unit including several
foreign<00:05:05.650> all<00:05:05.800> satellites<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:08.020> I'll<00:05:08.139> just

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
foreign all satellites and I'll just

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.980 
foreign all satellites and I'll just
briefly<00:05:08.440> talk<00:05:08.830> about<00:05:08.860> what<00:05:09.820> I've<00:05:10.330> discovered

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
briefly talk about what I've discovered

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.650 
briefly talk about what I've discovered
since<00:05:11.800> I<00:05:12.009> first<00:05:12.340> purchased<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:13.000> speakers<00:05:13.419> and

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
since I first purchased the speakers and

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.710 
since I first purchased the speakers and
put<00:05:14.590> them<00:05:14.770> through<00:05:14.800> my<00:05:15.099> amplifier<00:05:15.720> initially

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
put them through my amplifier initially

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.870 
put them through my amplifier initially
of<00:05:16.840> course<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:17.710> speakers<00:05:18.160> are<00:05:18.400> not<00:05:18.639> going<00:05:18.820> to

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
of course the speakers are not going to

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.080 
of course the speakers are not going to
sound<00:05:19.139> probably<00:05:20.139> as<00:05:20.349> as<00:05:21.160> amazing<00:05:21.699> as<00:05:21.789> what<00:05:21.970> you

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
sound probably as as amazing as what you

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.170 
sound probably as as amazing as what you
would<00:05:22.240> like<00:05:22.449> but<00:05:23.460> given<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:24.550> time<00:05:24.580> to<00:05:24.820> run

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
would like but given the time to run

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.450 
would like but given the time to run
them<00:05:25.389> in<00:05:25.509> around<00:05:25.750> about<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:26.080> month<00:05:26.409> I've<00:05:26.680> got<00:05:27.340> to

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460
