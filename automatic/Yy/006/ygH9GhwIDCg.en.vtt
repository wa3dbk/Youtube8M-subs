00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello and welcome example 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.650
 it's already with me childrens toy 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.750
 a little longer ago 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.910
 it lacks the last intelligent kneading 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.980
 have presented and today it is 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.340
 finally time again a new 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.230
 smart play milky way lights up in the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.939
 darken I am already curious how 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.800
 that looks like you remember for sure 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.340
 intelligent kneading sc reisbach splitter 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.810
 ball jumps and she is stretchy and we 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.330
 of course also want to test if that at 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.500
 this one is like this too 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:37.700
 but I see she already knows that 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.700
 try to get him out 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.829
 actually quite plain white from the 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.980
 I had expected that there yet 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.140
 somewhere so blitzer particles are in it 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:58.510
 or anything else but looks easy 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:01:01.210
 milk milk frosted white without glitter 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.210
 Article might be a slight shimmer 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.409
 and as always we do the test 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.270
 if this is achievable 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:17.640
 because you must always have the power 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.640
 but yes it was just risky here 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.359
 splintered works with us 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.520
 you can probably do it with the hammer 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:32.289
 women and then splintered that 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.819
 unfortunately I have never gotten there 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.530
 I will probably do that cold too 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:39.630
 I can not get it done 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.630
 just go off and watch me bring 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:51.750
 she jumps and the train pulls like 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.750
 chewing gum 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.650
 and the special thing about this one is 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.650
 that shines in the dark 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.180
 I will do as possible and then 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.390
 Let's take a look at the effect 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:21.400
 Knowing a little bit can believe a bit 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.250
 you can see it's like those stars 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.109
 it also gives you this somewhere 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.109
 can glue the glow in the dark 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.739
 but you really do not think so 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.840
 I just can not get it completely dark 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.129
 but of course I have it too 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.599
 Grad already tried a bit and 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.219
 It made me so in the hands and 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.889
 since coming in and it really lights 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:57.799
 what lights up as well as likes the 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:03:00.620
 one knows it has this color , too 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.700
 it shines brightly and in the dark 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.560
 experience so nice mobile 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.329
 I turned the light on again and 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.590
 I really have to say a total of me 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:15.260
 I really enjoy smart kneading 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.510
 nice exciting and interesting what you 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.439
 so that everything can do it totally 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.000
 a lot of fun just to knead that and 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.189
 I 'm always really happy 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.689

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.969
