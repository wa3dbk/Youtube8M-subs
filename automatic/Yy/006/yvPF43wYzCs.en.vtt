00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:14.219
 michel a better way to advance the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.000
 mythical negation pass first the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.450
 go down it's the climb it's 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.220
 even more complicated the dga goes for 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.760
 the basis of equality as a nightmare 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.760
 every year 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.899
 she introduces herself is a mountain 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.399
 in front of us and we could not 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.230
 to know what could happen is 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.940
 scary really hard to have to 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.230
 face the pass of negar with our 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.930
 buttocks do not like curiosity it's 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.940
 what is it that at some point there is 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.019
 someone who is wrong 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.230
 when we get there 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.540
 and this trace takes you to the top of 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.800
 dunes and after there is nothing left there 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.990
 has more than dunes there are more 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.369
 holes we no longer know where we are and all the 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.630
 world is starting to turn in a round of a 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.850
 single trace 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.649
 there are hundreds that go in 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.820
 all the senses and even starts to 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:22.640
 raining in these months of January is raining 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.210
 sand is as wet wet and we 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.890
 so we were all scared 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.509
 from the base because they could do without 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.960
 a lot of things but that was the case 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.000
 there is no time I see a mark on 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.740
 a rock to move away 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.780
 we do a lot of things on foot from 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.759
 recognition foot just to the fate 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.439
 first but we're right 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.990
 in my opinion we also arrive first 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.990
 like seven-thirty at night 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.570
 from 15 to gas in a few years we 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.370
 had no idea of â€‹â€‹the weather 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.659
 had lost the others had lost 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.820
 so we were trying to do some calculations 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.560
 we lost time but then if they 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.820
 they lost so much so do we 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.440
 is always in the lead by this 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.940
 is only at the end of the day 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.360
 could know our position at 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.880
 ranking but the gaps were 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.330
 colossal Thursday meal in minute by 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.650
 second 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.450
 their extraordinary but memories 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.930
 that I would not want to get erased for anything at 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.930
