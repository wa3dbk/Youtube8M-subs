00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 just as before leaving Maspalomas 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.790
 psv and also a picture with the hotel 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.830
 managing board 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.630
 as it should be with this type of travel and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.190
 soaked in gran canaria that was meant to 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.110
 to be ready for the second 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.599
 competition half and that is according to 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.420
 phillip cocu succeeded well 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.320
 good training camp many trainings 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.580
 have rejected worked well have one 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.350
 closed with two matches where 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.029
 everyone got them playing minutes 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.699
 everyone actually added to it 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.380
 sure match played we think so 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.390
 always nice for that 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.559
 as a player, that is your club that you 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.540
 can work somewhere 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.210
 the start of the week was decent 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.200
 we then train heavily 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.789
 as the thumb of the week came 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.280
 go together once a week or one 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.260
 Start training so that they fish 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.239
 for which the for the matches and two 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.000
 good opponents with cell thick and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.980
 sparta prague yes and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.960
 at the won so we can about that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.879
 they also rubbed what did you say that you were 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.109
 want to do 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.680
 they are of course practice games 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.159
 but they are just opponents 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.860
 in with an entire team are here and 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.600
 who also went out of our way 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.180
 to win 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.890
 and if you win those matches 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.229
 what gives us a good feeling and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.720
 that is important to bring that feeling back 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.040
 to take to the city of the competition 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.670
 you also very fit that yes yes 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.409
 we have made many many hours 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.490
 necessary loop work must have been done and 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.860
 start whatever is weeks conscious 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.150
 a bit down to it 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.400
 end of the week and then you see them 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.860
 that they are fit in the competitions and also 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.580
 a final part of the competition 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.750
 excellent to come through 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.000
 keep your own eager to it 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.890
 make the difference as large as possible 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.870
 with the fit out 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.410
 it is all right in the premier division 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.080
 psv is 4 points ahead of number 2 ajax 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.360
 the motto of coupÃ© is that difference 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.450
 must become larger and therefore the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.600
 make the team one extra step to where 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.530
 we read match can see minutes 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.840
 sparta prague 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.420
 that we have just two moments 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.250
 be inattentive and then you get 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.470
 unnecessary counter goal , we must see 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.940
 to prevent 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.980
 productivity is good effectiveness 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.290
 have also gone up a lot 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.940
 people just have fun 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.260
 so we'll have to hold on to that 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.370
 Most importantly, we need it 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.290
 defensive 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.200
 once again become a bit stable 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.390
 and get fewer goals against that is 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.030
 a step that we have to take says 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.470
 this training camp later when you enter 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.060
 arnhem is going to play 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.220
 then say something that results that you were 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.360
 to get is that there is that depends on 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.450
 each other together 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.020
 or is that week doing animal in between now 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.840
 yet 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.650
 yes van de may affect but we 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.329
 go when they are back then 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.670
 From Tuesday we will go to the competition 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.140
 Saturday to work naturally and 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.000
 then it's just another one of the 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.040
 seventeen games who we who still 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.870
 have to go play there in zellik 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.180
 competition is important so the competition 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.640
 against vitesse too but we have to 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.099
 approach and and should feel like you 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.500
 is going to play around the gap with the rest 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.019
 bigger and make and as we do so in 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.900
 are then more pressure is added 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.510
 to lie to me as a competitor 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.640
 that is the game that we do of season 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.579
 is going to start and you can taste that 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.609
 boys are really looking forward to it 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.409
 yes I'm looking forward to it so a 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:33.109
 huge drive in the groups and that is 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.480
 nice to see and it also ensures 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.470
 that you achieve optimum performance 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.389
 come 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.340
 we must above all stick to it 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:44.290
 throughout the second half of the season 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.290
 but also in the cup and European
