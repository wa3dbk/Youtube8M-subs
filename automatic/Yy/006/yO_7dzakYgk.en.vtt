00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
we get another trailer or another

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.010 
we get another trailer or another
picture<00:05:41.279> I<00:05:41.490> just<00:05:41.729> get<00:05:41.849> more<00:05:42.150> and<00:05:42.300> more<00:05:42.479> excited

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.200 
picture I just get more and more excited
and<00:05:43.169> I<00:05:43.680> can't<00:05:43.979> even<00:05:44.159> believe<00:05:44.460> that<00:05:45.029> there's

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
and I can't even believe that there's

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.629 
and I can't even believe that there's
still<00:05:45.300> so<00:05:45.750> much<00:05:45.930> we<00:05:46.139> haven't<00:05:46.380> seen<00:05:46.800> we<00:05:47.279> haven't

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
still so much we haven't seen we haven't

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.640 
still so much we haven't seen we haven't
seen<00:05:47.819> anything<00:05:48.060> from<00:05:48.419> Midway<00:05:48.840> Games<00:05:49.139> we

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
seen anything from Midway Games we

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.499 
seen anything from Midway Games we
haven't<00:05:49.889> seen<00:05:50.009> anything<00:05:50.340> from<00:05:50.550> ghostbusters

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
haven't seen anything from ghostbusters

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.300
