00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
the areas for the rest of us here I

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.330 
the areas for the rest of us here I
certainly<00:00:20.170> got<00:00:20.260> a<00:00:20.349> bit<00:00:20.529> to<00:00:20.650> go<00:00:20.800> with<00:00:20.950> some<00:00:21.130> rain

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
certainly got a bit to go with some rain

certainly got a bit to go with some rain
but<00:00:21.550> like<00:00:22.060> we're<00:00:22.240> lucky<00:00:22.420> to<00:00:22.570> and<00:00:23.350> finished<00:00:23.710> out

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
but like we're lucky to and finished out

I've<00:00:32.980> been<00:00:33.100> doing<00:00:33.160> some<00:00:33.430> work<00:00:33.699> on<00:00:33.879> it<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.420> some

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
I've been doing some work on it the some

I've been doing some work on it the some
good<00:00:35.290> research<00:00:35.620> so<00:00:35.890> we'll<00:00:36.070> just<00:00:36.100> give<00:00:37.000> you<00:00:37.059> a

good research so we'll just give you a
bit<00:00:37.300> of<00:00:37.330> an<00:00:37.420> idea<00:00:37.809> of<00:00:37.840> what<00:00:38.050> we<00:00:38.170> found<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.680> what

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
bit of an idea of what we found and what

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.660 
bit of an idea of what we found and what
it<00:00:39.670> means<00:00:39.820> to<00:00:39.910> you<00:00:41.010> fleabane<00:00:42.010> is<00:00:42.220> a<00:00:42.250> weed<00:00:42.489> that
