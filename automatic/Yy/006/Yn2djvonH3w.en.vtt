00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.030
 hello to the most abandoned corners 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 and looking ugly as forgotten 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.890
 we can form a leafy and colorful 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.840
 solid that owed this garden for 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.730
 get it around this tree 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.099
 we will form a massif with different 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.040
 heights grouping and separating species 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.840
 with 3-inch logs in addition to 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.800
 be able to walk in between we will make a 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.800
 path on villas 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.180
 Yes Yes 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.100
 as a first task we have to prepare 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.600
 the earth always when we set aside a 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.980
 plantation we have to ensure the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.980
 drainage and organic matter 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.850
 for that there is that who wants to say 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.289
 remove the earth after you have to 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.760
 apply was used that helps 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.559
 disconnect so that water and 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.559
 nutrients reach the roots better 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.440
 so 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.440
 then sand from the underworld for drainage 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.700
 the organic matter we throw new earth 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.260
 now with these stakes you think we are going to 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.690
 live the step on four floors 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.460
 around the tree each one will form a 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.460
 Massive tour from lowest to highest 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.920
 your choice 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.230
 We will define the planters with 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.330
 these polynes that come impregnated 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.250
 to protect them from moisture, can 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.660
 cut with manual or electric saw 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.870
 That will depend on what most 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.870
 accommodate 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.189
 we will have three heights of logs 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:59.829
 thirty forty-two feet 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.020
 the amount will depend on the size of the 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.090
 solid but as it is put on one side 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.530
 On the other, you have to have at least 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.530
 25 pieces per strip 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.780
 we are going to bury the skids 10 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.860
 centimeters we will make a small ditch 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.860
 so they can be affirmed 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:42.290
 and to contain the earth and not to leave 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.780
 through the middle of the polis we are going to 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.340
 in stapling a tight denim mesh and 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.340
 black so you do not notice 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.140
 Y 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.860
 we will start the plantation from above 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.930
 down the highest species the 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.540
 we will use to cover views in this case 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.670
 the tambourine this is a bush 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.130
 very resistant perennial and that is common 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.500
 see it on the roads in the south the 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.900
 retamo can be planted in the sun or semi 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.240
 shadow is undemanding in terms of 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.950
 nutrients the only thing is that you need a 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.260
 soil with good drainage and quite 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.600
 humidity is very resistant to frost 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.310
 and the pests and you just have to do pruning 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.760
 frequent because it messes with 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.760
 ease 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.950
 in this second level we are going to plant 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.600
 roses and veronicas roses in this 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.610
 epoch gets very pretty but with 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.410
 temperature and some humidity can 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.900
 appear a white fungus called 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.570
 heard to fight it you have to apply a 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.580
 specialized fungicide to control 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.040
 the ear you have to make applications every 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.450
 ten days until it disappears and avoid 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.490
 water at night since the leaves 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.210
 wet ones are a good environment for 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.100
 proliferate 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.600
 and with regard to roses we have the 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.940
 asks the lady of sepulveda 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.710
 who tells us that he has aphids on his 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.230
 roses and you want to know how to fight the 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.360
 aphids is a very common pest in 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.430
 this time mainly attack the 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.170
 buttons weakening the bloom and the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.970
 plant growth for 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.550
 fight them you have to apply a 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.980
 specialized insecticide sprinkling 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.410
 over the foliage three times with 15 days 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.690
 of interval another question is about 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.460
 buttercups that are these bulb flowers 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.380
 that bloom in spring and that 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.900
 we are going to plant in the third level of 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.580
 our massif edward wants to know if 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.290
 once they finish their development should 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.630
 remove the potato from the ground 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.820
 effectively you have to remove them 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.950
 store them in a dry and protected place 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.410
 the cold and you can re-plant them 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.110
 next year other species that 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.180
 we will put in the massif are to want and 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.910
 you vermont that for your flowers 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.980
 reach a very good height and in 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:56.230
 lower levels almost creepy 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.230
 we planted the blue l and rayito de sol 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.250
 on the path we are going to put gravel that 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.750
 We'll spreading to the masses 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.259
 to achieve unity among the 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.259
 different levels 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.420
 the gravel road will serve us 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.520
 to be able to travel and perform 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.110
 maintenance tasks such as for example 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.150
 cut the flowers before they 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.010
 wither that way we stimulate the 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.960
 bloom that's all for today see you 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.220
 next week in another do it yourself 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.220
 same we leave in people
