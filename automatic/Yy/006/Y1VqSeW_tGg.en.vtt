00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello north face friends we are for 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.370
 Present the astral enduro today 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.410
 2012 competition of 30 marathon a body 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.039
 starting this year on the holy estate 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.289
 martina we have drawn a circuit of 80 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.640
 kilometers which incorporates within 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.679
 this layout the 50 21 and 10 kilometers and 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.769
 what makes all the competitors 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.690
 are very well followed throughout 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.340
 travel and which also have 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.890
 some very good supply points 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.180
 and control the 80-kilometer circuit 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.240
 with departure santa martina goes towards his 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.400
 first zone of 15 kilometers by the 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.530
 cattle land is tilted a 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.960
 place that has many trails very 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.970
 markets that your motorcycle enjoy 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.580
 we will have lighting at some points 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.490
 the firefly species that also 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.900
 marking where the path is all 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.510
 the trails that could have 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.640
 variations or detour are going to be very 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.140
 well marked with huincha the view to 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.570
 the 80 kilometers is orange 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.790
 China is always little of the signage 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.130
 what does that color mean now 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.110
 you are running 50 kilometers and you look at 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.270
 blue wincha or the brands of 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.130
 blue while 21 is 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.310
 yellow color and on color days 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.050
 red another interesting fact to know 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.390
 of the circuits is that we will have 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.370
 supplies every 10 km in these 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.290
 supplies positions according to 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.990
 distance include the route we will have 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.940
 different types of hydration and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.810
 food can also find 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.640
 water they will be able to find 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.290
 some kind of groceries like they can 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.490
 be some nuts fruits of the 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.560
 season and some drops varieties of 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.079
 food that they will be able to check 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.689
 days before the competition in the 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.270
 detail that we would have of the positions of 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.159
 supply by distance the court goes 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.049
 to compete important data of 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.229
 security will be that we will have 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.049
 in the field a field hospital 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.420
 installed and we will have two tents of 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.269
 medical assistance en route in the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.000
 kilometer 40 of 1000 kilometers 60 in the 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:18.049
 kilometer 40 that post this foundation is 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.750
 common for circuit of the 50 and the 80 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.690
 that is being for the 50 kilometers 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.230
 kilometer 30 and for 80 km 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.849
 40 that carp america are completely 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.170
 equipped and if you are the one who has some 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.670
 kind of problem for that day or 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.769
 directly from your posts now 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.780
 each checkpoint also has a 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.540
 paramedic to which you are going to be able 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.670
 come in case of need 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.010
 a helicopter will be in the field of 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.810
 north face to be able to assist in the case 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.739
 of having a medical emergency 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.180
 difficult access with which if it is 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.120
 absolutely necessary can reach 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.360
 be rescued air all rescues 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.880
 can be 4x4 vehicles days or for their 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.190
 own means we will have paramedics in 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.220
 each checkpoint if you want to say 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.920
 that the 80 kilometers have 7 for 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.530
 measure it on the entire circuit 250 has 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.150
 four paramedics and the 21 days we have 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.819
 Paramedic to cover positions 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.920
 to foundations plus all the control of 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.019
 security that we have in the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.590
 travel centuries in state stature in 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.150
 2012 we will go through different types 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.610
 of land all of the area 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.010
 precordillerana departing by sectors 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.920
 which are quite expensive with trails 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.290
 of muleteer animals in which no 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.900
 they are so marked they have enough 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.189
 stone can 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.290
 when walking with a lot of production to 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:44.500
 move to high mountain trails where 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.709
 they are much cleaner but narrower but 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.349
 you can have a much 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.569
 better pace after this middle zone 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.640
 that travels in the 80 kilos the circuit 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.730
 of 80 kilometers from kilometer 1 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.370
 until kilometer 30 after we went to 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.930
 trails of a place that is very 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.519
 transited by bicycles by which 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.439
 the whole ones are very clean very easy 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.120
 to touch and to pass a wide path 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.370
 which is the exact path of nature 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.859
 the release dance from kilometer 40 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.370
 up to kilometer 60 that all the time 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:17.280
 it's going to be on a high road 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.600
 4x4 vehicle reaching large 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.139
 altitudes we will reach up to 2 thousand 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.440
 800 meters above sea level for 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:29.160
 then begin the descent towards jumps 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.910
 Martin decline to around 20 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.770
 kilometers that the first one will go through 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.960
 vegetation or landscape is high 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.610
 mountain range to then move to an area 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.400
 typical forest of the central zone 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.660
 Chileans so I invite you to meet them 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.370
 the unloading circuits enter the
