00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.940
 Hello, how about youtube friends today? 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.910
 come here to make a new tutorial 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.700
 in this case also with the program 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.190
 photoscape a very simple tutorial 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.520
 we are simply going to learn to put 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.610
 this frame to our photographs we are going 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.640
 then first to open what is 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.759
 the photoscape 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.400
 as I have done the previous tutorial 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.980
 remember that it is a totally program 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.770
 free and once we open the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.520
 photoscape we look for where 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.540
 we have our photography 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.500
 that we want to frame in this case we're going 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:51.590
 up because here a photograph 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.710
 [Music] 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.040
 all right 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.079
 here we have a picture come on now 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.390
 to choose 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.600
 here in the option where it says object 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.259
 can see here 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.509
 and we are going to enter you says photo the first 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:13.229
 icon that you can see on the side 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:16.560
 left of the screen we click and 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.659
 we choose then where says photo in 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.790
 this photo option is going to open 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.500
 then the menu where we are going to look 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.330
 our picture that we have this case I 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.299
 I have a desk 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.590
 I have downloaded some frames also what 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.770
 you can find is 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.829
 in google in google images you 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.890
 they put frames for photography in PNG and 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.750
 will disappear, we do not know, we were looking for 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.350
 be more in agreement with the photo that 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.350
 we want 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.229
 what we are on the beach these pictures 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.990
 on the beach we are going to be able then this 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.780
 more or less well once we have 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.290
 chosen we accept you here where 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.290
 says photo 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.390
 and once we give in to accept the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.890
 stars we can simply expand 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.690
 so keep this in mind whenever the 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.150
 framework that you have downloaded be 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.760
 png is to say a frame that has no background 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.920
 there allows us us then you 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.170
 can accommodate as best you want 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.800
 image 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.800
 all right 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.150
 I want you to cover here 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.460
 [Music] 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.590
 and you take wide well 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.330
 well once we have put frame 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.400
 our photo we give you in store 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.340
 in this case I will save in the folder 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.980
 chosen from the program we click all 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.780
 so and if they catch the mind is already saved 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.870
 now let's see how the 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.930
 photograph finally saved good 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.050
 let's find where it is in this case 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.710
 the output is recorded by default then 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.920
 we can see here as our 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.319
 photography with frame 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.830
 an excellent quality as I say has 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.830
 also this photoscape program 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.680
 and we see how ready to print well 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.290
 Well friends, that's all 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.870
 I hope it has been very helpful this 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.720

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.360
