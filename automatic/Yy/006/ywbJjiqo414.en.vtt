00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
blow to us and hopefully next year we

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.500

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.350 

they've<00:02:23.189> got<00:02:23.370> some<00:02:23.549> good<00:02:23.670> players<00:02:23.879> over<00:02:24.239> there

which<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.840> know<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:24.989> think<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.739> lot<00:02:25.890> more<00:02:25.920> played

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
which you know I think a lot more played

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.640 
which you know I think a lot more played
in<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.459> World<00:02:26.640> Cup<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.989> up<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.379> difficult

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
in the World Cup so it up a difficult

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.920 
in the World Cup so it up a difficult
game<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.280> we've<00:02:29.879> got<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> couple<00:02:30.629> of<00:02:30.750> games

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
game and we've got a couple of games

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.110 
game and we've got a couple of games
before<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.349> too<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:32.370> get<00:02:32.489> ourselves<00:02:32.640> going

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
before that too to get ourselves going

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.240 
before that too to get ourselves going
hopefully<00:02:33.840> by<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.319> time<00:02:34.409> comes<00:02:34.860> around<00:02:34.950> will

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
hopefully by the time comes around will

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.610 
hopefully by the time comes around will
will<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:35.879> readying<00:02:36.239> like<00:02:36.989> yourself<00:02:37.379> that<00:02:37.409> we

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
will be readying like yourself that we

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.490 
will be readying like yourself that we
can<00:02:37.739> in<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.010> room

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.130 

it's<00:02:44.500> not<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:45.010> much<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.310> time<00:02:45.460> to<00:02:45.640> relax<00:02:45.910> you

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
it's not so much the time to relax you

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.140 
it's not so much the time to relax you
know<00:02:47.140> it's<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.410> busy<00:02:48.400> time<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.730> year<00:02:48.790> for<00:02:49.090> us

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
know it's a busy time of the year for us

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.470 
know it's a busy time of the year for us
to<00:02:49.500> South<00:02:50.500> time<00:02:50.860> when<00:02:51.190> we<00:02:51.880> need<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.150> get<00:02:52.240> fit

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
to South time when we need to get fit

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.110 
to South time when we need to get fit
for<00:02:52.600> that<00:02:52.660> for<00:02:52.960> the<00:02:53.080> start<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.560> season

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
for that for the start of the season

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.330 
for that for the start of the season
that's<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.210> most<00:02:55.360> important<00:02:55.750> thing<00:02:55.780> will<00:02:56.140> be

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
that's the most important thing will be

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.770 
that's the most important thing will be
trading<00:02:57.340> probably<00:02:57.610> twice<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:57.850> day<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.660> I'm

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
trading probably twice a day and I'm

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.380 
trading probably twice a day and I'm
playing<00:02:59.020> our<00:02:59.200> games<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.790> in<00:03:00.790> quite<00:03:01.060> wild

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
playing our games and in quite wild

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.770 
playing our games and in quite wild
weather<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:01.780> it's<00:03:01.930> come<00:03:02.890> difficult<00:03:03.400> but

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
weather so it's come difficult but

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.820 
weather so it's come difficult but
hopefully<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.900> standing<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.320> standards<00:03:05.710> in

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
hopefully of standing the standards in

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.350 
hopefully of standing the standards in
Gustavo<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.520> for<00:03:06.760> when<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:06.940> season<00:03:07.210> begins

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.330 

yeah<00:03:11.530> we're<00:03:12.530> not<00:03:12.560> really<00:03:12.860> interested<00:03:13.040> in

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
yeah we're not really interested in

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.370 
yeah we're not really interested in
seeing<00:03:13.460> the<00:03:13.610> cities<00:03:13.940> it's<00:03:14.150> well<00:03:14.690> I<00:03:14.930> say<00:03:15.350> no

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
seeing the cities it's well I say no

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.170 
seeing the cities it's well I say no
interested<00:03:15.890> it's<00:03:16.010> obviously<00:03:16.310> nice<00:03:16.490> to<00:03:16.640> stay

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
interested it's obviously nice to stay

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.330 
interested it's obviously nice to stay
in<00:03:17.270> place<00:03:17.450> like<00:03:17.630> Chicago<00:03:17.660> looks<00:03:18.290> this<00:03:19.040> looks<00:03:19.100> a

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
in place like Chicago looks this looks a

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.030 
in place like Chicago looks this looks a
fantastic<00:03:19.820> place<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.530> I'm<00:03:21.530> sure<00:03:21.710> the<00:03:21.890> rest

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
fantastic place and I'm sure the rest

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.560 
fantastic place and I'm sure the rest
will<00:03:22.280> be<00:03:22.370> good<00:03:22.490> place<00:03:22.700> as<00:03:22.850> well<00:03:23.030> but<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:23.240> think

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
will be good place as well but I think

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.230 
will be good place as well but I think
our<00:03:23.930> main<00:03:24.140> focus<00:03:24.620> while<00:03:25.370> we're<00:03:25.580> is<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:25.880> get<00:03:26.030> fit

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
our main focus while we're is to get fit

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.120 
our main focus while we're is to get fit
and<00:03:26.420> ready<00:03:26.480> for<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.780> start<00:03:26.960> of<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.260> English
