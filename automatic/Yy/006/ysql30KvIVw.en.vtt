traditional<00:00:13.290> snowflake<00:00:13.650> as<00:00:13.799> well<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:15.240> it's

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
traditional snowflake as well and it's

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.180 
traditional snowflake as well and it's
very<00:00:15.420> easy<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.560> made<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.740> bunch<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.980> these<00:00:17.070> in

very easy so I made a bunch of these in
pastel<00:00:17.580> colors<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:17.970> hung<00:00:18.510> them<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.810> my

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900

pastel colors and hung them in my
kitchen<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.670> and<00:00:20.670> they're<00:00:20.850> just<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.119> pretty

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
kitchen and and they're just so pretty

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.730 
kitchen and and they're just so pretty
when<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.689> heat<00:00:22.050> catches<00:00:22.410> them<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.680> they

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
when the heat catches them and they

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.529 
when the heat catches them and they
twirl<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.310> swirl<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.910> they're<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.300> pretty

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539

a die-cutting file if you don't want to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.540 
a die-cutting file if you don't want to
do<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> cutting<00:00:28.920> but<00:00:29.220> I'm<00:00:29.279> gonna<00:00:29.369> show<00:00:29.490> you

how<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.640> do<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> cutting<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.330> not<00:00:30.449> very

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
how to do the cutting so it's not very

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.089 
how to do the cutting so it's not very
difficult<00:00:31.439> but<00:00:31.560> if<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.710> do<00:00:31.800> want<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:31.980> purchase

video description if you want to if you
want<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> see<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.329> basically<00:00:39.809> what<00:00:40.110> you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
want to see that so basically what you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.180 
want to see that so basically what you
need<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:42.170> squares<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.410> paper<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:43.860> using<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
need is squares of paper and I'm using a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.549 
need is squares of paper and I'm using a
6x6<00:00:44.579> size<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.660> zoom<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> little<00:00:46.140> bit<00:00:46.350> for

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
6x6 size you zoom in a little bit for

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.340 
6x6 size you zoom in a little bit for
you<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:48.360> want<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.600> fold<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you and then you want to fold it to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.260 
you and then you want to fold it to
corner<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.649> corner<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.460> hopefully<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
corner to corner and hopefully it's a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.939 
corner to corner and hopefully it's a
square<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:51.960> then<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.620> adjust

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
square if not then you can just adjust

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.970 
square if not then you can just adjust
it<00:00:53.340> trim<00:00:53.940> off<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.329> sticky<00:00:54.899> bits<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.800> good

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
it trim off the sticky bits it's good

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.889 
it trim off the sticky bits it's good
enough<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.250> think<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.940> then<00:00:57.120> what<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.329> did<00:00:57.420> here

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
enough I think and then what I did here

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.750 
enough I think and then what I did here
oh<00:00:58.050> here's<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.710> I've<00:00:58.800> already<00:00:58.890> cut<00:00:59.190> just

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
oh here's one that I've already cut just

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.490 
oh here's one that I've already cut just
for<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.969> for<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> prototype<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.050> was<00:01:01.289> trying<00:01:01.440> to

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
for a for a prototype I was trying to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.680 
for a for a prototype I was trying to
remember<00:01:01.649> how<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.859> did<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:03.449> then<00:01:03.600> after

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
remember how I did it and so then after

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.329 
remember how I did it and so then after
I<00:01:03.840> cut<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.229> actually<00:01:04.290> made<00:01:04.500> myself<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:05.189> little

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
I cut it I actually made myself a little

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.980 
I cut it I actually made myself a little
jig<00:01:05.610> by<00:01:05.729> taking<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.119> quarter<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.689> piece<00:01:06.960> of

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
jig by taking a quarter of a piece of

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.570 
jig by taking a quarter of a piece of
paper<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.530> making<00:01:07.860> little<00:01:07.950> tikki<00:01:08.310> marks

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
paper and just making little tikki marks

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.469 
paper and just making little tikki marks
where<00:01:09.560> where<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> should<00:01:10.830> be<00:01:11.040> cutting<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.909> what

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
where where I should be cutting so what

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.390 
where where I should be cutting so what
I'm<00:01:12.570> doing<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.840> I'm<00:01:12.930> holding<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:14.040> against

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
I'm doing is I'm holding this up against

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
just kind of trying to keep with the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
just kind of trying to keep with the
same<00:01:28.170> angle<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.920> same<00:01:29.130> 45-degree<00:01:29.729> angle

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
same angle that same 45-degree angle

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.670 
same angle that same 45-degree angle
there<00:01:30.180> I'm<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.720> cutting<00:01:30.840> from<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> folded

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
there I'm just cutting from the folded

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.319 
there I'm just cutting from the folded
edge<00:01:32.540> to<00:01:33.540> about<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.860> quarter<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.700> an<00:01:35.850> inch<00:01:36.000> from

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
edge to about a quarter of an inch from

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.380 
edge to about a quarter of an inch from
my<00:01:36.630> paper<00:01:36.810> jig<00:01:37.259> here<00:01:37.579> okay<00:01:38.579> now<00:01:39.060> I'm<00:01:39.270> gonna

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
my paper jig here okay now I'm gonna

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.499 
my paper jig here okay now I'm gonna
move<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.840> over<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:42.030> I'm<00:01:42.150> gonna<00:01:42.240> do<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
move this over here and I'm gonna do the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.109 
move this over here and I'm gonna do the
same<00:01:42.659> thing<00:01:43.250> just<00:01:44.250> aiming<00:01:44.520> for<00:01:44.820> those<00:01:44.909> little

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
same thing just aiming for those little

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
Tiki marks that I put there I want about

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.410 
Tiki marks that I put there I want about
a<00:01:48.899> quarter<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.470> an<00:01:49.590> inch<00:01:49.790> until<00:01:50.790> then<00:01:51.149> cuz<00:01:51.329> I

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
a quarter of an inch until then cuz I

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.880 
a quarter of an inch until then cuz I
because<00:01:51.659> otherwise<00:01:52.200> I'll<00:01:52.560> end<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.710> with<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
because otherwise I'll end up with a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.170 
because otherwise I'll end up with a
bunch<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.130> little<00:01:53.220> squares<00:01:53.369> cut<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.149> I

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
bunch of little squares cut out and I

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.260 
bunch of little squares cut out and I
won't<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.479> anything<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:54.930> fold<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:57.060> there

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
won't have anything I can fold and there

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.670 
won't have anything I can fold and there
we<00:01:57.360> go<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.689> even<00:01:57.810> if<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.200> perfect<00:01:58.259> don't

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
we go and even if it's not perfect don't

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.780 
we go and even if it's not perfect don't
worry<00:01:58.829> about<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.130> cuz<00:01:59.310> it'll<00:01:59.549> turn<00:01:59.729> out

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
worry about it cuz it'll turn out

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
alright I'm using a hot glue gun and his

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.389 
alright I'm using a hot glue gun and his
hallway<00:02:03.689> he's<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.140> love<00:02:04.320> my<00:02:04.409> hot<00:02:04.560> glue<00:02:04.680> gun<00:02:04.740> so

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
hallway he's I love my hot glue gun so

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.130 
hallway he's I love my hot glue gun so
you<00:02:05.460> want<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.640> open<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.939> up<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.450> you've<00:02:06.990> got

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you want to open this up and you've got

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.930 
you want to open this up and you've got
something<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.500> looks<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.099> what<00:02:08.819> you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
something that looks like this what you

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.330 
something that looks like this what you
want<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.209> do<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.660> take<00:02:10.110> your<00:02:10.259> inner<00:02:10.530> two<00:02:10.830> pieces

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
want to do is take your inner two pieces

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.030 
want to do is take your inner two pieces
and<00:02:11.730> you're

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
and you're

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.530 
and you're
overlapped<00:02:12.700> them<00:02:12.849> you're<00:02:13.000> gonna<00:02:13.060> glue<00:02:13.330> them

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
overlapped them you're gonna glue them

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.059 
overlapped them you're gonna glue them
where<00:02:13.689> they<00:02:13.750> overlap<00:02:13.870> I'm<00:02:14.680> gonna<00:02:14.920> put<00:02:15.040> a

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
where they overlap I'm gonna put a

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.000 
where they overlap I'm gonna put a
little<00:02:15.189> bit<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.430> glue<00:02:15.549> there<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:20.010> without

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
little bit of glue there and without

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.500 
little bit of glue there and without
running<00:02:21.250> myself<00:02:21.370> hopefully<00:02:21.760> I'm<00:02:22.090> going<00:02:22.390> to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
running myself hopefully I'm going to

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.690 
running myself hopefully I'm going to
glue<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.530> right<00:02:23.920> on<00:02:24.069> there<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.340> hold<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.579> for

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
glue that right on there and hold it for

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.179 
glue that right on there and hold it for
a<00:02:24.790> second<00:02:25.180> but<00:02:26.019> in<00:02:26.110> my<00:02:26.260> studio<00:02:26.590> was<00:02:26.769> very<00:02:26.980> cold

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
a second but in my studio was very cold

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.910 
a second but in my studio was very cold
right<00:02:27.610> now<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.810> glue<00:02:29.140> takes<00:02:29.409> no<00:02:29.769> time

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
right now so the glue takes no time

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.559 
right now so the glue takes no time
it'll<00:02:30.129> have<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.340> try<00:02:30.549> all<00:02:30.819> right<00:02:31.299> now<00:02:31.480> we're

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
it'll have to try all right now we're

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.210 
it'll have to try all right now we're
gonna<00:02:31.659> do<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.840> same<00:02:31.959> thing<00:02:32.019> right<00:02:32.349> here<00:02:35.220> it's

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
gonna do the same thing right here it's

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.550 
gonna do the same thing right here it's
very<00:02:36.640> very<00:02:37.060> easy<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.510> actually<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:38.109> think<00:02:38.140> goes

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
very very easy and actually I think goes

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.660 
very very easy and actually I think goes
I<00:02:38.680> think<00:02:38.799> I'm<00:02:39.010> doing<00:02:39.190> these<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.340> lot<00:02:39.519> quicker

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
I think I'm doing these a lot quicker

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.160 
I think I'm doing these a lot quicker
than<00:02:39.849> I<00:02:40.030> did<00:02:40.180> last<00:02:40.209> time<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.659> made<00:02:40.930> these<00:02:41.109> a

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
than I did last time I made these a

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.220 
than I did last time I made these a
couple<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.560> years<00:02:41.709> ago<00:02:42.180> now<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.209> did<00:02:43.629> not<00:02:43.780> design

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
couple of years ago now I did not design

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.619 
couple of years ago now I did not design
this<00:02:44.560> project<00:02:45.010> this<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.489> moldy<00:02:46.180> oldie<00:02:46.599> I

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
this project this is a moldy oldie I

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:47.880 
this project this is a moldy oldie I
think<00:02:46.900> my<00:02:46.989> mother<00:02:47.230> showed<00:02:47.500> me<00:02:47.530> how<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.769> make

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
think my mother showed me how to make

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.140 
think my mother showed me how to make
these<00:02:48.569> years<00:02:49.569> ago<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:51.700> just<00:02:51.909> it's<00:02:52.090> just

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
these years ago it's just it's just

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.800 
these years ago it's just it's just
pretty<00:02:52.450> though

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
pretty though

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.360 
pretty though

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
and I know Martha Stewart makes a

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.569 
and I know Martha Stewart makes a
template<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.819> make<00:02:54.940> these<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:56.129> yeah<00:02:57.129> it's<00:02:57.430> a

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
template to make these so yeah it's a

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.240 
template to make these so yeah it's a
it's<00:02:57.609> pretty<00:02:57.970> traditional<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.829> I'm<00:03:00.069> using

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
it's pretty traditional and I'm using

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
right on top of each other like that mid

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.520 
right on top of each other like that mid
the<00:04:41.120> hot<00:04:41.270> glue<00:04:41.510> that<00:04:41.600> wasn't<00:04:41.900> quite<00:04:41.990> like<00:04:42.500> that

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
the hot glue that wasn't quite like that

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.320 
the hot glue that wasn't quite like that
before<00:04:42.919> was<00:04:43.100> pretty<00:04:43.520> completely<00:04:44.000> drugs<00:04:44.210> I

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
before was pretty completely drugs I

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.670 
before was pretty completely drugs I
could<00:04:44.450> see<00:04:44.570> it<00:04:44.690> slid<00:04:44.990> around<00:04:45.110> a<00:04:45.350> little<00:04:45.560> bit

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
could see it slid around a little bit

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.780 
could see it slid around a little bit
but<00:04:45.860> that's<00:04:45.950> not<00:04:46.220> a<00:04:46.250> big<00:04:46.400> deal

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
but that's not a big deal

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.790 
but that's not a big deal
so<00:04:47.150> I'm<00:04:47.210> gonna<00:04:47.330> be<00:04:47.480> patient<00:04:48.020> this<00:04:48.230> time<00:04:48.470> and

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
so I'm gonna be patient this time and

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.780 
so I'm gonna be patient this time and
hold<00:04:49.040> this

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
hold this

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
hold this
well<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.900> glue<00:04:51.080> sets<00:04:51.380> up<00:04:51.620> and<00:04:52.610> now<00:04:53.210> well

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
well the glue sets up and now well

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.210 
well the glue sets up and now well
that's<00:04:54.260> I<00:04:54.380> think<00:04:54.440> that's<00:04:54.560> gonna<00:04:54.710> be<00:04:54.800> fine<00:04:54.919> and

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
that's I think that's gonna be fine and

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.960 
that's I think that's gonna be fine and
then<00:04:55.790> I'm<00:04:55.970> gonna<00:04:56.090> go<00:04:56.270> around<00:04:56.360> I'm<00:04:56.750> gonna<00:04:56.870> glue

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
from Oriental Trading this year very

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:37.180 
from Oriental Trading this year very
very<00:05:30.380> pretty<00:05:30.590> stuff<00:05:35.860> maybe<00:05:36.860> I<00:05:36.950> should've

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
very pretty stuff maybe I should've

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.180 
very pretty stuff maybe I should've
glued<00:05:37.340> them<00:05:37.460> together<00:05:37.610> a<00:05:37.820> little<00:05:37.910> bit<00:05:38.180> lower

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
glued them together a little bit lower

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.290 
glued them together a little bit lower
like<00:05:40.190> I'm<00:05:40.280> kind<00:05:40.490> of<00:05:40.550> squishing<00:05:40.970> it<00:05:41.090> a<00:05:41.120> little

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
like I'm kind of squishing it a little

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.940 
like I'm kind of squishing it a little
bit<00:05:41.479> I<00:05:41.810> think<00:05:42.080> it's<00:05:42.169> gonna<00:05:42.289> spread<00:05:42.530> out<00:05:42.680> nicely

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
bit I think it's gonna spread out nicely

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.279 
bit I think it's gonna spread out nicely
once<00:05:43.280> I<00:05:43.430> glue<00:05:44.180> that<00:05:44.390> last<00:05:44.630> piece<00:05:44.840> I'll<00:05:45.020> kind<00:05:45.200> of

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
once I glue that last piece I'll kind of

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.460 
once I glue that last piece I'll kind of
stretch<00:05:45.440> everything<00:05:45.680> out<00:05:46.810> I<00:05:47.810> reckon<00:05:48.380> you

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
stretch everything out I reckon you

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.140 
stretch everything out I reckon you
could<00:05:48.590> probably<00:05:48.800> use<00:05:49.010> staples<00:05:49.220> too<00:05:49.760> for<00:05:50.030> this

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
could probably use staples too for this

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.490 
could probably use staples too for this
if<00:05:50.360> you<00:05:50.419> didn't<00:05:50.600> want<00:05:50.720> to<00:05:50.750> use<00:05:50.900> hot<00:05:51.050> glue

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
if you didn't want to use hot glue

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.290 
if you didn't want to use hot glue
and<00:05:51.979> if<00:05:52.070> glue<00:05:52.250> dots<00:05:52.430> weren't<00:05:52.729> quite<00:05:53.000> strong

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
and if glue dots weren't quite strong

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.719 
and if glue dots weren't quite strong
enough<00:05:53.539> and<00:05:54.110> then<00:05:54.950> what<00:05:55.220> I<00:05:55.250> would<00:05:55.400> do<00:05:55.610> is

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
enough and then what I would do is

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.430 
enough and then what I would do is
either<00:05:55.820> punch<00:05:56.120> a<00:05:56.210> hole<00:05:56.330> or<00:05:56.630> just<00:05:56.930> loop<00:05:57.139> a<00:05:57.229> piece

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
either punch a hole or just loop a piece

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.190 
either punch a hole or just loop a piece
of<00:05:57.620> fishing<00:05:57.800> line<00:05:58.070> in<00:05:58.400> there<00:05:58.970> so<00:05:59.690> we<00:05:59.840> can<00:05:59.870> hang

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
of fishing line in there so we can hang

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.750 
of fishing line in there so we can hang
it<00:06:00.350> invisibly<00:06:00.830> from<00:06:01.010> your<00:06:01.130> ceiling<00:06:01.550> and<00:06:01.700> they

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
it invisibly from your ceiling and they

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.070 
it invisibly from your ceiling and they
can<00:06:01.880> just<00:06:02.000> kind<00:06:02.180> of<00:06:02.210> float<00:06:02.450> in<00:06:02.539> the<00:06:02.630> air<00:06:02.780> and<00:06:02.990> be
