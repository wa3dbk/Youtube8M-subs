especially these three sizes that we've
got<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:37.559> okay<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.280> when<00:00:38.969> you're<00:00:39.059> talking

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
got here okay so when you're talking

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.880 
got here okay so when you're talking
about<00:00:39.300> doubling<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.870> lasting<00:00:40.170> sup<00:00:40.410> what<00:00:40.829> are

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
about doubling and lasting sup what are

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.369 
about doubling and lasting sup what are
the<00:00:40.980> main<00:00:41.129> benefits<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.809> main<00:00:42.989> benefit

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the main benefits in the main benefit

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.350 
the main benefits in the main benefit
really<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.800> how<00:00:43.920> soft<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> strike<00:00:44.940> you

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
really is how soft is on the strike you

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.139 
really is how soft is on the strike you
basically<00:00:45.719> get<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.730> strength<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> basically

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
basically get the strength is basically

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.540 
basically get the strength is basically
what<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.289> packet<00:00:49.649> if<00:00:50.129> using<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
what it is on the packet if using a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.069 
what it is on the packet if using a
sixth<00:00:50.850> way<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.329> six<00:00:51.600> straight<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
sixth way it is six straight on the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.319 
sixth way it is six straight on the
strike<00:00:52.350> because<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.370> doubled<00:00:53.640> up<00:00:53.820> soon<00:00:54.300> that

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
strike because it's doubled up soon that

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.810 
strike because it's doubled up soon that
starts<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.809> stretch<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.800> pair<00:00:56.039> comes<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.550> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
starts to stretch the pair comes in and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.459 
starts to stretch the pair comes in and
then<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.059> becomes<00:00:57.420> what<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.870> actually

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
then it becomes what it is actually

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.229 
then it becomes what it is actually
double<00:00:58.739> elastic<00:00:59.190> at<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.609> six<00:00:59.879> would<00:01:00.030> become

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
double elastic at so six would become

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.240 
double elastic at so six would become
more<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> twelve<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.739> get<00:01:01.890> to

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
more like a twelve so you can get to

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.070 
more like a twelve so you can get to
bunk<00:01:02.579> less<00:01:02.760> fish<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.390> still<00:01:03.660> learn<00:01:03.780> carp

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
bunk less fish we can still learn carp

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.020 
bunk less fish we can still learn carp
and<00:01:04.260> double<00:01:04.530> picked<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.890> okay<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.790> you've<00:01:06.000> got

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
and double picked on okay so you've got

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.730 
and double picked on okay so you've got
a<00:01:06.180> top<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:06.840> threaded<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.560> all

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
a top get here threaded up with it all

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.260 
a top get here threaded up with it all
the<00:01:07.920> way<00:01:08.040> through<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> other<00:01:08.760> end<00:01:09.000> where

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the way through to the other end where

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.820 
the way through to the other end where
you've<00:01:09.420> got<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> puller<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you've got a puller so this is the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.740 
you've got a puller so this is the
perfect<00:01:11.070> sail<00:01:11.430> maybe<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:12.060> today's

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
perfect sail maybe for today's

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.960 
perfect sail maybe for today's
commercials<00:01:13.350> that's<00:01:13.619> that's<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.040> perfect<00:01:14.790> I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
commercials that's that's it perfect I

commercials that's that's it perfect I
mean<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.600> puller<00:01:15.810> bung<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:16.950> get

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
mean the puller bung if you do get

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.429 
mean the puller bung if you do get
anything<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.759> pushing<00:01:18.360> double<00:01:18.600> figures<00:01:18.930> then

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
anything is pushing double figures then

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.800 
anything is pushing double figures then
you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.710> land<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.040> quite<00:01:20.220> easily<00:01:20.509> okay<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
you can land it quite easily okay so the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810 
you can land it quite easily okay so the
benefits<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.619> double<00:01:23.070> elastic<00:01:23.490> over<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
benefits of a double elastic over a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.080 
benefits of a double elastic over a
single<00:01:24.210> or<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.630> hollow<00:01:25.340> smoothness<00:01:26.340> you've<00:01:26.880> got

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
single or a hollow smoothness you've got

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.640 
single or a hollow smoothness you've got
that<00:01:27.240> rich<00:01:27.390> sort<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.689> reserve<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.170> power<00:01:28.200> there

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
that rich sort of reserve of power there

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.890 
that rich sort of reserve of power there
that's<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> mean<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.119> soft<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> strike

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
that's a I mean it's soft on the strike

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.649 
that's a I mean it's soft on the strike
so<00:01:31.530> you're<00:01:31.860> not<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.159> bump<00:01:32.280> fish<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.880> if

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
so you're not going to bump fish and if

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.179 
so you're not going to bump fish and if
you<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.930> hook<00:01:34.140> something<00:01:34.409> bigger<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.979> can

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you do hook something bigger you can

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.100 
you do hook something bigger you can
land<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.579> whereas<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.090> if<00:01:36.329> you're<00:01:36.509> gonna

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
land it whereas if you if you're gonna

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.749 
land it whereas if you if you're gonna
just<00:01:37.590> target<00:01:37.920> bigger<00:01:38.100> fish<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.490> might<00:01:38.610> have

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
just target bigger fish you might have

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.190 
just target bigger fish you might have
like<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> sixteen<00:01:39.450> lastik<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.020> anything

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
like a sixteen lastik for anything

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.380 
like a sixteen lastik for anything
