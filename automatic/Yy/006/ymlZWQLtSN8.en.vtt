00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
were just on the passenger side of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.690 
were just on the passenger side of
Motorhome<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.950> was<00:00:44.070> talking<00:00:44.399> about<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
Motorhome I was talking about the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.729 
Motorhome I was talking about the
radiator<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.629> cooling<00:00:45.960> effects<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
radiator in the cooling effects of the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.119 
radiator in the cooling effects of the
of<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.610> radiator<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.629> was<00:00:48.960> an<00:00:49.829> actual

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
of the radiator that was an actual

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.529 
of the radiator that was an actual
radiator<00:00:50.520> mounted<00:00:50.850> behind<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.239> that's<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
radiator mounted behind it that's the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.260 
radiator mounted behind it that's the
a/c<00:00:51.690> condenser<00:00:52.110> on<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.829> passenger<00:00:53.309> side<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
a/c condenser on the passenger side the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.020 
a/c condenser on the passenger side the
actual<00:00:54.960> engine<00:00:55.500> radiator<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.309> here<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
actual engine radiator is here on the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.430 
actual engine radiator is here on the
driver<00:00:57.300> side<00:00:57.449> when<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:57.899> into<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.140> driver's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
driver side when we go into the driver's

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.840 
driver side when we go into the driver's
side<00:00:58.559> you'll<00:00:58.739> see<00:00:58.770> another<00:00:58.980> louvered<00:00:59.460> panel

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
side you'll see another louvered panel

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.639 
side you'll see another louvered panel
so<00:01:00.000> that's<00:01:00.210> for<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> that's<00:01:01.109> for<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.320> actual

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
so that's for the that's for the actual

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.479 
so that's for the that's for the actual
engine<00:01:02.160> cooling<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.409> also<00:01:04.409> located<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.280> here

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
engine cooling so also located in here

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.520 
engine cooling so also located in here
is<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.240> got<00:01:06.330> oil<00:01:06.540> pressure<00:01:06.810> gauge<00:01:06.960> water

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
is you got oil pressure gauge water

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.929 
is you got oil pressure gauge water
temperature<00:01:08.010> gauge<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.490> then<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.790> also

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
temperature gauge and then you can also

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.609 
temperature gauge and then you can also
start<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.450> stop<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.689> engine<00:01:10.110> smack<00:01:10.350> here<00:01:10.470> so

it's up in this up position we can see a
little<00:01:46.830> bit<00:01:46.950> easier<00:01:47.190> but<00:01:47.280> we<00:01:47.369> do<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.580> some

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
little bit easier but we do have some

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.310 
little bit easier but we do have some
scratches<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.240> come<00:01:48.600> down<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.290> a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
scratches that come down here with a

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.760 
scratches that come down here with a
little<00:01:49.470> bit<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.770> fiberglass<00:01:50.330> stress<00:01:51.330> cracks

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
little bit of fiberglass stress cracks

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.260 
little bit of fiberglass stress cracks
so<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.399> when<00:01:53.580> it's<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> lower<00:01:54.030> position

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
so but when it's in the lower position

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.210 
so but when it's in the lower position
you<00:01:54.659> know<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.649> pretty<00:01:55.860> hard<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
you know it's it's pretty hard to

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.370 
you know it's it's pretty hard to

actually see just up above you got your

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.490 
actually see just up above you got your
backup<00:02:01.800> camera<00:02:02.570> mounted<00:02:03.570> up<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
backup camera mounted up there in the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.990 
center coming around to the driver's
side<00:02:08.820> got<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> little<00:02:09.989> bit<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.200> fiberglass

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
side got a little bit of fiberglass

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
radiator itself like I said before

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.560 
radiator itself like I said before
yokohama<00:02:50.670> tires<00:02:50.940> on<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.180> side<00:02:51.360> also

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
yokohama tires on this side also

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.370 
yokohama tires on this side also
everything<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.560> same<00:02:53.010> same<00:02:53.670> date<00:02:53.910> code<00:02:54.380> this

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
everything a same same date code this

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.949 
everything a same same date code this
side<00:02:55.590> does<00:02:55.799> have<00:02:56.010> some<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:56.760> checking<00:02:57.750> on

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
side does have some of that checking on

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.630 
side does have some of that checking on
the<00:02:58.140> darker<00:02:58.530> colors<00:02:58.890> like<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.220> was<00:02:59.340> talking

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
the darker colors like I was talking

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.740 
the darker colors like I was talking
about<00:02:59.700> on<00:02:59.880> the<00:02:59.940> other<00:03:00.030> side<00:03:00.269> Phest<00:03:00.510> it's

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
about on the other side Phest it's

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.360 
about on the other side Phest it's
definitely<00:03:01.200> something<00:03:01.890> about<00:03:01.950> this<00:03:02.160> side

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
definitely something about this side

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.440 
definitely something about this side
maybe<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.640> way<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:02.970> was<00:03:03.090> sitting<00:03:03.269> is

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
maybe the way that it was sitting is

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.560 
maybe the way that it was sitting is
it's<00:03:03.600> not<00:03:03.750> as<00:03:03.959> pronounced<00:03:04.709> as<00:03:04.970> as<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.239> was<00:03:06.420> on

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
it's not as pronounced as as it was on

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.090 
it's not as pronounced as as it was on
that<00:03:06.690> side<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:06.989> it's<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.560> lot<00:03:07.709> harder<00:03:07.890> to

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
that side so it's a lot harder to

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.410 
that side so it's a lot harder to
actually<00:03:08.220> see<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.730> on<00:03:08.790> this<00:03:08.970> side<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.359> the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
actually see it on this side of the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.530 
actually see it on this side of the
coach<00:03:10.640> we're<00:03:11.640> going<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.850> open<00:03:11.970> these<00:03:12.090> Bay's<00:03:12.329> up

coach we're going to open these Bay's up
in<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.660> second<00:03:13.019> but<00:03:13.109> before<00:03:13.140> we<00:03:13.410> do<00:03:13.560> want<00:03:13.739> to
