00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
base of the machine so you need to lift

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:26.050 
base of the machine so you need to lift
it<00:02:14.900> up<00:02:19.420> there's<00:02:20.420> one<00:02:20.570> on<00:02:20.690> each<00:02:20.720> side<00:02:24.460> if<00:02:25.460> you

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
it up there's one on each side if you

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.280 
it up there's one on each side if you

you can pull the panel off don't take
the<00:02:52.010> screws<00:02:52.220> all<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.430> way<00:02:52.550> out

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
the screws all the way out

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.880 
the screws all the way out
just<00:02:53.300> loosen<00:02:53.480> them<00:02:53.720> enough<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.470> get<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.680> panel

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
just loosen them enough to get the panel

outside of the dryer and take the belt
off<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.790> pulley<00:03:06.489> it<00:03:07.489> just<00:03:07.670> lifts<00:03:07.850> it<00:03:07.970> out<00:03:08.030> of

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
off the pulley it just lifts it out of

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.620 
off the pulley it just lifts it out of
the<00:03:08.270> slot<00:03:09.400> here's<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.520> old<00:03:10.670> editor<00:03:10.790> ploy<00:03:11.209> next

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
the slot here's the old editor ploy next

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.420 
the slot here's the old editor ploy next
to<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.780> new<00:03:11.900> idler<00:03:12.260> pulley<00:03:12.470> as<00:03:12.650> you<00:03:13.130> can<00:03:13.280> tell

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
to the new idler pulley as you can tell

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.979 
to the new idler pulley as you can tell
they<00:03:13.550> look<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.820> little<00:03:13.910> different<00:03:14.360> they

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
they look a little different they

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.900 
they look a little different they
originally<00:03:15.920> years<00:03:16.160> ago<00:03:16.400> went<00:03:16.670> with<00:03:16.790> this

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
originally years ago went with this

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.090 
originally years ago went with this
design<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:17.540> then<00:03:17.930> they<00:03:18.260> change<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.709> this<00:03:18.860> and

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
design and then they change to this and

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.430 
design and then they change to this and
now<00:03:19.880> they're<00:03:20.030> back<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.300> this<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:21.200> it's<00:03:21.350> going

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
now they're back to this so it's going

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.720 
now they're back to this so it's going
to<00:03:21.530> look<00:03:21.620> a<00:03:21.739> little<00:03:21.800> bit<00:03:22.010> different<00:03:22.310> but<00:03:22.580> it's

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
to look a little bit different but it's

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.150 
to look a little bit different but it's
going<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:22.880> work<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.150> same<00:03:23.860> all<00:03:24.860> you<00:03:24.980> have<00:03:25.070> to

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
going to work the same all you have to

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.670 
going to work the same all you have to
do<00:03:25.280> when<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:25.520> put<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.760> new<00:03:25.880> one<00:03:26.000> in<00:03:26.150> is<00:03:26.590> put<00:03:27.590> it

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
do when you put the new one in is put it

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.070 
do when you put the new one in is put it
into<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:27.950> slots<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:29.480> rollers<00:03:29.810> should<00:03:30.019> be

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
into the slots the rollers should be

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.650 
into the slots the rollers should be
towards<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.410> center<00:03:30.709> of<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.860> dryer<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.660> then

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
towards the center of the dryer and then

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.220 
towards the center of the dryer and then
when<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.380> go<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.560> push<00:03:33.860> on<00:03:34.450> push<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:35.600> over<00:03:35.870> and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
when you go to push on push it over and

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.440 
when you go to push on push it over and
put<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.800> belt<00:03:36.950> on<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.850> push<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.209> towards<00:03:38.390> the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
put the belt on you push it towards the

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.500 
put the belt on you push it towards the
outside<00:03:38.780> of<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:38.959> dryer<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:41.120> have<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.330> make<00:03:41.480> a

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
outside of the dryer you have to make a

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.440 
outside of the dryer you have to make a
loop<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.050> go<00:03:42.410> in<00:03:42.650> between<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.700> pulley<00:03:44.120> in<00:03:44.390> the

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
loop and go in between the pulley in the

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.930 
loop and go in between the pulley in the
bracket<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:45.320> then<00:03:46.070> press<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.519> over<00:03:46.730> towards

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
bracket and then press it over towards

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.910 
bracket and then press it over towards
the<00:03:47.209> motor<00:03:47.390> pulley

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.720 

and<00:03:52.920> loop<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.370> around<00:03:55.340> now<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.520> we're<00:03:56.640> done

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
and loop it around now that we're done

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.979 
and loop it around now that we're done
with<00:03:56.910> repair<00:03:57.239> we<00:03:57.360> can<00:03:57.510> put<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.720> front<00:03:57.870> panel

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
with repair we can put the front panel

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.260 
with repair we can put the front panel
back<00:03:58.230> on

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
back on

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.960 
back on
remember<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.890> front<00:04:02.130> panel<00:04:02.400> locks<00:04:02.580> on<00:04:02.790> to

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
remember the front panel locks on to

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.870 
remember the front panel locks on to
these<00:04:03.090> little<00:04:03.300> teeth<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.620> stick<00:04:04.860> out<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:05.790> we

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
these little teeth that stick out so we
