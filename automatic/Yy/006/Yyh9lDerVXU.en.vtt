00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.510
 Hello and welcome to continue to pass this video and 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.850
 go now or have optimal signs 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 Here is a picture of distributed 9 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.549
 and off in the look 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.599
 and now have been pregnant once 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.199
 that is set for us 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.199
 Marie Zimmermann with Gimp 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.500
 Würselen that is not really times 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.400
 We paint and we see it is always the same must be the reprieve 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.650
 express 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.160
 For the last time, for example, quite easily you just do not do anything 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.330
 that does not matter at all and I have a sign of the world 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.070
 then you are still active exactly the same 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.730
 only what is guilt and they do not weigh wet 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.730
 everyone through these children with the so-called 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.300
 the British Tim Ahmed fifth-tier 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.730
 with ten points in the last games that do not happen Eckstein 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.570
 the men wanted 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.380
 because they love 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.840
 can remove the leaves 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.650
 Pilsen's name sounds 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.390
 Mitani different settings the other group speeds to case 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.120
 Which means the pressure means how strong Ludwig also 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.760
 Speed ​​according to the speeds 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.330
 and so Kolb catch more 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.670
 and then I just heard other attitude of the noise heard greetings 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.590
 how to do it, for example, when pressure Dieter Kraft Foods 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.010
 when does all this sound can do then it is against the one after 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.750
 do not draw the city 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.420
 WoW point of view a little bit stronger 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.710
 and again slowly 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.970
 not to beat 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.020
 that means also inside samples that can be realistic and true 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.510
 Want to show love 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.510
 while being very realistic 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.050
 maybe i am also doing great with course 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.050
 the Dresden team not thanks per flight 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.180
 Reduced size 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.180
 moz usage 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:14.219
 or I do it all with speed 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.219
 through reforms that had speed and 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:20.759
 the rider depending on how fast I draw 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.459
 here you will be discovered 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.459
 it depends 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.590
 how can i help others 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.179
 little home shopping 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:33.029
 I have the strength in handcuffing how strong these settings are in the world 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:34.209
 not directly 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.669
 whether this illness and death 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:40.749
 that the education Dinamit I find personally stands out clearly 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.759
 easier 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.399
 especially with those injured 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.199
 the sheer numbers 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.599
 So the sign is really great because of these types of dynamics 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:57.389
 There is nowhere behind it is different than 2006, be careful that one 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.589
 the bacteria and comes the place 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:03.589
 that also at Bremer the community with the users 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.179
 you know that 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.179
 and depending on the strong piece + Kock express 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.629
 you have the promi- 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.349
 all sectors are 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.819
 okay that's it women too 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.039
 this brings about transfer 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.039
 Neighbors did not have time remained silent 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:25.899
 Video 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:27.389
 Nat's pulling 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.389
 - to throb 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.389
 so cares 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.009
 and should be belly fat 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:39.709
 and then we go 20 too 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.139
 By the way, that's all now, too, says Prof that of us 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:47.429
 in the iTunes Store directly to the podcast Braunschweiger 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:51.709

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.109
 and also Ulrich Beck 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.309
 asked the nw Well, how do you know all this and because 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:00.269
 How can I learn this? 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.979
 there we can in saint-dizier training of video2brain 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.469
 handed over by Bettina Lechner 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:10.209
 April for three points XVI get problems and not yet with the 4 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.409
