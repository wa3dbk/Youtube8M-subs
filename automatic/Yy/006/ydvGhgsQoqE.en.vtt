chef<00:01:01.020> knives<00:01:01.260> were<00:01:01.469> made<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.800> carbon

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
chef knives were made out of carbon

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.700 
chef knives were made out of carbon
steel<00:01:02.730> now<00:01:03.449> carbon<00:01:03.809> steel<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.439> little

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
steel now carbon steel is a little

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.340 
steel now carbon steel is a little
softer<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.790> easier<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.330> us<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.900> sharpen

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
softer and it's easier for us to sharpen

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.380 
softer and it's easier for us to sharpen
we<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.710> sharpen<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.310> carpenter<00:01:08.939> bin'<00:01:09.119> steel

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
we can sharpen a carpenter bin' steel

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.750 
we can sharpen a carpenter bin' steel
knife<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.869> many<00:01:10.439> times<00:01:10.740> as<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.010> would<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.460> but

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
knife as many times as we would like but

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.359 
knife as many times as we would like but
you<00:01:11.880> know<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.210> being<00:01:12.479> soft<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.260> loses<00:01:14.159> its

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
you know what being soft it loses its

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.760 
you know what being soft it loses its
edge<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.939> much<00:01:15.180> more<00:01:15.420> quickly<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.530> tough

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
edge that much more quickly and a tough

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.010 
edge that much more quickly and a tough
thing<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> carbon<00:01:17.790> steel<00:01:18.000> knife<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.720> that

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
thing with a carbon steel knife is that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.580 
thing with a carbon steel knife is that
it<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.560> discolor<00:01:20.630> acids<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:22.020> cause<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.560> to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
it can discolor acids can cause it to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.789 
it can discolor acids can cause it to
discolor<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.420> will<00:01:24.420> rust<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.290> will<00:01:25.619> actually

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
discolor it will rust it will actually

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.310 
discolor it will rust it will actually
pick<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.729> carbon<00:01:27.240> steel<00:01:27.360> knife<00:01:27.689> because<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.170> its

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
pick a carbon steel knife because of its

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.890 
pick a carbon steel knife because of its
soft<00:01:28.619> nature<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.549> some<00:01:29.939> people<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> carbon

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
soft nature so some people like a carbon

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.660 
soft nature so some people like a carbon
steel<00:01:31.020> knife<00:01:31.350> because<00:01:31.740> they<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.100> sharpen<00:01:32.430> it

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
steel knife because they can sharpen it

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.700 
steel knife because they can sharpen it
as<00:01:32.850> often<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.240> they<00:01:33.420> want<00:01:33.600> it'll<00:01:34.200> lose<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
as often as they want it'll lose the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.109 
as often as they want it'll lose the
edge<00:01:34.829> quickly<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.460> then<00:01:35.579> again<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
edge quickly but then again you have the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.330 
edge quickly but then again you have the
power<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> sharpen<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:36.990> generally<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> carbon

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
power to sharpen it generally a carbon

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.149 
power to sharpen it generally a carbon
steel<00:01:38.460> knife<00:01:38.850> will<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.420> less<00:01:39.630> expensive

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
steel knife will be less expensive

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.399 
steel knife will be less expensive
versus<00:01:41.210> this<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> stainless<00:01:42.869> steel<00:01:43.140> knife

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
versus this is a stainless steel knife

professional I do it on my sharpening

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.200 
professional I do it on my sharpening
stone<00:01:53.100> which<00:01:53.340> I'm<00:01:53.460> going<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> show<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.119> a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
stone which I'm going to show you in a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.510 
stone which I'm going to show you in a
little<00:01:54.299> bit<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.990> difficult<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.009> sharpen

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
little bit it is difficult to sharpen

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.980 
little bit it is difficult to sharpen
but<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.820> know<00:01:56.939> what<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> stainless<00:01:57.780> steel

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
but you know what with a stainless steel

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.590 
but you know what with a stainless steel
knife<00:01:58.439> once<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.219> get<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> good<00:01:59.939> edge<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.420> it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
knife once you get a good edge on it

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.539 
knife once you get a good edge on it
because<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.020> stainless<00:02:01.469> steel<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.189> hard

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
because the stainless steel is so hard

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.569 
because the stainless steel is so hard
it<00:02:02.850> will<00:02:03.299> keep<00:02:03.600> its<00:02:04.259> edge<00:02:04.530> much<00:02:04.860> longer<00:02:05.399> it

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
it will keep its edge much longer it

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.240 
it will keep its edge much longer it
will<00:02:06.000> not<00:02:06.240> discolor<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.619> only<00:02:07.860> two<00:02:08.009> knives

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
will not discolor so the only two knives

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.130 
will not discolor so the only two knives
available<00:02:08.550> for<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.209> longest<00:02:09.539> time<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:10.080> a

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
and what this shows me is this knife is

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.729 
and what this shows me is this knife is
of<00:04:17.190> one-piece<00:04:17.940> construction<00:04:18.229> this<00:04:19.229> handle

which<00:04:25.340> has<00:04:25.580> sentimental<00:04:25.940> value<00:04:26.270> because<00:04:26.780> this

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
which has sentimental value because this

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
ago or so so I still use it but there's

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.510

no<00:04:32.720> Tang<00:04:33.020> that<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.410> can<00:04:33.680> see<00:04:33.889> and<00:04:34.130> you<00:04:34.250> know<00:04:34.370> what

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
no Tang that I can see and you know what

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.100 
no Tang that I can see and you know what
if<00:04:34.669> it's<00:04:34.850> put<00:04:35.030> together<00:04:35.120> with<00:04:35.389> plastic<00:04:35.930> like

if it's put together with plastic like
that<00:04:36.290> most<00:04:36.710> probably<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.370> Tang<00:04:37.580> goes<00:04:37.880> to

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
that most probably the Tang goes to

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.360 
that most probably the Tang goes to
about<00:04:38.389> here<00:04:38.780> or<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.080> is<00:04:39.290> this<00:04:39.680> that<00:04:39.889> much<00:04:40.130> of<00:04:40.280> a

does not sharpen the blade but it

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.960 
does not sharpen the blade but it
reaches<00:06:17.240> the<00:06:17.720> blade<00:06:17.960> so<00:06:18.590> if<00:06:18.890> a<00:06:19.010> sharp<00:06:19.400> blade<00:06:19.669> is

reaches the blade so if a sharp blade is

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.300 
reaches the blade so if a sharp blade is
like<00:06:20.150> this<00:06:20.360> put<00:06:21.050> those<00:06:21.200> down<00:06:21.410> the<00:06:21.830> sharp<00:06:22.130> blade

like this put those down the sharp blade

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.120 
like this put those down the sharp blade
is<00:06:22.700> like<00:06:22.880> this<00:06:23.180> a<00:06:23.450> dull<00:06:24.050> blade<00:06:24.410> is<00:06:24.650> like<00:06:24.860> that

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
is like this a dull blade is like that

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.580 
is like this a dull blade is like that
what<00:06:25.460> the<00:06:25.580> sharpening<00:06:26.120> steel<00:06:26.419> does<00:06:26.750> is<00:06:26.990> solve

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
what the sharpening steel does is solve

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.190 
what the sharpening steel does is solve
this<00:06:27.979> for<00:06:28.580> us<00:06:28.729> that's<00:06:28.910> when<00:06:29.090> we<00:06:29.240> get<00:06:29.390> burrs<00:06:29.750> on

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
this for us that's when we get burrs on

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.870 
this for us that's when we get burrs on
either<00:06:30.470> side<00:06:30.830> of<00:06:30.860> the<00:06:31.130> knife<00:06:31.340> and<00:06:31.550> the

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
either side of the knife and the

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.000 
either side of the knife and the
sharpening<00:06:32.419> steel<00:06:32.750> will<00:06:33.050> reach<00:06:33.409> you<00:06:33.800> the

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
sharpening steel will reach you the

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.620 
sharpening steel will reach you the
blade<00:06:34.220> so<00:06:34.820> after<00:06:35.270> I've

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
blade so after I've

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.900 
blade so after I've
dragged<00:06:35.840> my<00:06:36.230> carbon<00:06:36.740> steel<00:06:37.010> blade<00:06:37.340> over<00:06:37.760> my

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
dragged my carbon steel blade over my

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.450 
dragged my carbon steel blade over my
sharpening<00:06:38.390> stone<00:06:38.720> to<00:06:39.230> resharpen<00:06:39.650> it<00:06:40.010> I<00:06:40.130> can

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
sharpening stone to resharpen it I can

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.850 
sharpening stone to resharpen it I can
now<00:06:40.610> take<00:06:40.670> my<00:06:41.120> sharpening<00:06:41.990> steel<00:06:42.380> to<00:06:42.650> reach

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
now take my sharpening steel to reach

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.890 
now take my sharpening steel to reach
through<00:06:43.070> the<00:06:43.220> edge<00:06:43.370> this<00:06:45.010> come<00:06:46.010> on<00:06:46.600> that's<00:06:47.600> not

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
through the edge this come on that's not

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.740 
through the edge this come on that's not
necessary<00:06:48.530> plus<00:06:48.890> we<00:06:49.400> have<00:06:49.580> a<00:06:49.610> varied<00:06:50.210> angle

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
necessary plus we have a varied angle

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.660 
necessary plus we have a varied angle
the<00:06:51.050> correct<00:06:51.440> way<00:06:51.650> to<00:06:51.680> use<00:06:51.980> the<00:06:52.220> sharpening

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:52.670 
the correct way to use the sharpening

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.690 
the correct way to use the sharpening
steel<00:06:53.030> is<00:06:53.300> I<00:06:53.660> put<00:06:53.900> it<00:06:53.990> down<00:06:54.290> on<00:06:54.680> my<00:06:54.890> tabletop<00:06:55.520> at

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 
steel is I put it down on my tabletop at

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.300 
steel is I put it down on my tabletop at
a<00:06:55.730> steady<00:06:56.120> angle<00:06:56.750> and<00:06:56.900> I<00:06:57.200> pull<00:06:57.590> the<00:06:58.100> knife
