one<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.520> things<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.700> will<00:02:14.820> point<00:02:14.970> out<00:02:15.120> here

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
one of the things I will point out here

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.110 
one of the things I will point out here
is<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:16.020> every<00:02:16.350> card<00:02:16.620> there's<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.220> dice<00:02:17.520> and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
is that on every card there's a dice and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.940 
is that on every card there's a dice and
one<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.930> little<00:02:19.050> circles<00:02:19.590> with<00:02:19.860> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
one of the little circles with the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.950 
one of the little circles with the
numbers<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.460> them<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.300> tells<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.810> what

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
numbers on them so that tells you what

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.680 
numbers on them so that tells you what
the<00:02:22.050> role<00:02:22.230> was<00:02:22.530> as<00:02:22.800> well<00:02:23.250> as<00:02:23.430> resources<00:02:24.240> come

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
the role was as well as resources come

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.760 
the role was as well as resources come

up and turn the page here again here's

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.440

the Harbormaster that's that card we
showed<00:02:30.600> earlier<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.340> catan<00:02:32.700> 42<00:02:33.120> this

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
showed earlier and this is catan 42 this

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.060 
showed earlier and this is catan 42 this
is<00:02:33.840> one<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.320> things<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.740> think<00:02:34.950> is

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
is one of the things that I think is

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.280 
is one of the things that I think is
really<00:02:35.100> cool<00:02:35.520> about<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:35.940> game

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
really cool about this game

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.930 
really cool about this game
traditionally<00:02:37.290> catan<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.950> 3<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.490> 4<00:02:38.730> player

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
traditionally catan is a 3 and 4 player

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.510 
traditionally catan is a 3 and 4 player
game<00:02:39.440> which<00:02:40.440> makes<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.800> really<00:02:40.860> hard<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.340> play

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
game which makes it really hard to play

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.030 
game which makes it really hard to play
with<00:02:41.670> your<00:02:41.760> spouse<00:02:42.410> what<00:02:43.410> they've<00:02:43.590> done<00:02:43.770> is

they've taken catan and now they've made

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.780 
they've taken catan and now they've made
it<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.320> two-player<00:02:46.770> game<00:02:47.040> where<00:02:47.610> there's

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
more players on the back side here you

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.320 
more players on the back side here you
can<00:04:50.770> see<00:04:50.949> that<00:04:51.160> they<00:04:51.340> come<00:04:51.520> with<00:04:51.639> more<00:04:51.880> hexes

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
more cities and settlements and roads so

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.700 
more cities and settlements and roads so
it<00:04:57.820> allows<00:04:58.030> for<00:04:58.360> more<00:04:58.990> players<00:04:59.349> and<00:04:59.590> there's

it allows for more players and there's
one<00:04:59.889> of<00:05:00.010> these<00:05:00.300> for<00:05:01.300> every<00:05:01.599> one<00:05:01.750> of<00:05:01.840> these

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
one of these for every one of these

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.260 
one of these for every one of these
expansions<00:05:02.620> as<00:05:02.740> well<00:05:02.950> so<00:05:03.520> potentially<00:05:04.120> you

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
expansions as well so potentially you

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.270 
expansions as well so potentially you
could<00:05:04.300> have<00:05:04.660> six<00:05:05.050> expansions<00:05:05.650> plus<00:05:05.889> your<00:05:06.070> core
