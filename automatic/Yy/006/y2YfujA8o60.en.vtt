00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.740
 . 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.620
 cool reef machine like i already 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.460
 said such a very good springboard 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.230
 on the way to the porsche 912 man family 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.559
 the car wo n't fit at all 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.930
 what kind if you use it as 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.160
 the only car in the family he's from 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.160
 full he is clean 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.989
 it's pure mechanics net 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.280
 Automotive essence is that which is already to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.280
 Sorry now can lose 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.520
 this button is near the box lever 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.060
 gears and more precisely two buttons that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.980
 clean assistants electronic she 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.280
 always provokes and dries 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.790
 push support and already go as 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.090
 it's because he can do a lot 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.070
 and these are his potential abilities 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.350
 you always remember them even when you 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.210
 you just go home to work you are always 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.510
 you will remember them and 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.460
 there will always be under meager desire 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.460
 implement them again and again 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.180
 with the electronics turned off completely 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.580
 decent structural 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.190
 he is really understandable 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.980
 and axes are very good masters 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.069
 understandably 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.680
 by the city 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:25.050
 grab 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:29.400
 but if you need to know how to connect and 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.900
 included electronics but safer on 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.640
 actually have to work less 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.880
 when this system is on 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.830
 because she doesn't give you the opportunity 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.490
 make some mistakes protecting you 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.030
 let's say before setting the pin from 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.270
 reversal inside 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.610
 as far as motion is off 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.980
 the system here is more in the hands well that is 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.930
 if you really are not the first time 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.700
 you already drive a car all the more so 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.610
 as if quite tenacious control 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.250
 you will like this about mine 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.450
 sensations and in my opinion I would disconnect 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.540
 In general, everything is completely 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.090
 but God forbid to pull the wheel too much 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.260
 strong then you find yourself in absolutely 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.260
 the other side is directed 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.360
 sets a small reel rear wheel drive 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.660
 when I drove the car here complex 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.819
 I think probably disgrace the turn for 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.100
 reversal of name is and no really 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.150
 despite the fact that for quite a form of experience 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.310
 communication with rear wheel drive 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.610
 because it's so clear floor 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.630
 it is possible to immediately sit down and go 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.850
 it turned out quite efficiently to pass 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.560
 several laps without frank there without 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.550
 micro a different lazhi but this talk about 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.410
 what is there i am doing good 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.270
 just a car so balanced 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.100
 the lung is understandable and you feel it in 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.920
 the smallest nuances in all the details 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.870
 time to catch somewhere somewhere date 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.209
 show your character and it's great us 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.209
 orbit with such a compromise sports car 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.410
 I have not the first experience with this 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.690
 car in this us 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.720
 member too 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.720
 but 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:24.110
 very clear fit very clearly 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.189
 driver landing on the steering wheel 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:31.789
 boxes on the pedals under my height. rosh 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:34.069
 very me reaction on hand 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.849
 excellent gearbox mechanism 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:37.280
 gears 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:40.280
 I talked to the automatic with 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:44.810
 versions with automatic transmission mechanics 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.509
 first time exceptional lucky 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.419
 the box turned out just toyota 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:53.090
 very short switches very clearly 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.490
 the moves are very comfortable lies hands harshly 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.340
 little suspension as well as the rest 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.139
 would be appropriate for the class if 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.120
 let's say so justified for the final 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.930
 consumer then the person will be able and here on 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.819
 such tracks 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.819
 quietly show results 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.540
 here in terms of the pleasure of 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.280
 driving course rear-wheel drive and clean 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.020
 drive on the rear wheel drive he of course 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.770
 interesting in terms of efficiency 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.980
 on somewhere in the configuration well everything depends 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.810
 from 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.460
 from a specific track here probably 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.790
 a man who can move 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.310
 back still lucky in similar 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.370
 there there with similar indicators 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.229
 capacity even for what to take 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.700
 if for racing this one if for yourself 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.270
 for the soul 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.760
 Of course, we are on this mazda mx-5 stands 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.460
 on this now rises from the board and consists 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.560
 nothing than this car it if not 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.170
 consider suspension stiffness in principle 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:01.540
 landing stiffness is enough 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:05.700
 civilian car is quite comfortable for 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:08.400
 usual some everyday trips 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.590
 in city mode stupidly from home to 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.210
 of course I would be ashamed to plant 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.980
 back your child to me and you just 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.270
 sorry this car is basically in my 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.970
 young lifestyle idle she 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.950
 fits perfectly I would probably even 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.140
 looked at her quite seriously 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.620
 its main drawback in my opinion is 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.950
 price 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.860
 still millions to the end as empty 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.930
 drum 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.669
 Milchik this brute on can be seven hundred 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.180
 nine hundred more psychologically threshold 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.069
 humil 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.110
 and more could be considered when 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:38.740
 she for a million from good trim levels 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.490
 400 million and above is already 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.030
 the rest of the car is absolutely 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.030
 amazing
