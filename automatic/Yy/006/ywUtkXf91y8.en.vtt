00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hey my love today i have one 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.890
 completely different video times on my channel 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.679
 this time it's about healthy snacks and 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.780
 breakfast ideas and make this video 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.480
 I'm cooperating with Rebecca 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.369
 maybe it'll be on youtube 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.930
 knows because she is a pretty big one 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.449
 blogger and I already know her 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.189
 stocked over three years and she 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.750
 is a very sweet sweet 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.590
 people and is necessarily with her 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.789
 drop by 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.369
 she has only been a few weeks now 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.500
 or months a channel and she does that 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.899
 Corrected man is so much trouble 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.000
 the cultivation and she does that extremely 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.399
 good and I really like watching 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.379
 videos and here you can see a 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.879
 excerpt from her video that I have you 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.399
 will also link 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.370
 and she shows you her healthy and 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.110
 summery light snack ideas and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.430
 it all looks so fantastic 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.610
 I am very happy about myself 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.640
 video and yes then I wish you already 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.109
 Have fun with my video 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.600
 I 'm currently noticed 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.309
 especially a hearty breakfast myself 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.989
 long enough to hold the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.600
 Insulin levels are not that fast 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.340
 drives and this also very much for 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.650
 the cravings or generally for 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.360
 the hunger is responsible and therefore 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.700
 I circumvent the whole while I just 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.259
 not always sweet breakfast if I know 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.540
 that it took quite a long time 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.909
 I eat what's right as lunch 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.290
 a particularly healthy bread what I can 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.600
 you can really recommend something 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.689
 tastes great and I do not myself 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.130
 thought would be a protein bread mainz 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.829
 I now have the net if I believe 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.750
 you get that almost everywhere and it has 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.619
 great values ​​and saturated by the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.090
 high fiber content really very good 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.460
 I really like to eat this one 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.380
 Grainy cream cheese then I take too 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.119
 like the one who has a bit more fat 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.950
 because he just tastes much better and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.970
 calorie moderately does not do that either 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.040
 really noticeable 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.070
 I really like to combine them 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.540
 cream tuscany of alnatura can 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.719
 I really only recommend this 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.729
 really great for this I cut 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.659
 I also like to have a paprika in it 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.430
 This is my favorite vegetable 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.350
 and like those little cocktail tomatoes 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.300
 I also really like the taste of me 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.830
 much better than the normal ones 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.310
 they have their own 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.329
 taste 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.040
 I usually use me there's three or 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.739
 four of these little chicken nuggets 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.329
 we are already done and that 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.519
 Chicken is it is pretty 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.870
 lean and you have to look there 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.909
 There are very different ones of course 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.409
 but also finished by the panade are 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.650
 they are pretty lean and taste good 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:33.010
 very delicious and smells like it 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.870
 usually a hard-boiled egg in addition 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.819
 and yes that was it with mine 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.010
 Breakfast is pretty hearty 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.400
 but I find it delicious and it looks 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.590
 really good for those who like sweet 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.670
 Have breakfast and like oatmeal 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.379
 want to give up 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.750
 because they are not always so compatible 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.819
 for the body with many are the can 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.489
 I only soya flakes from a tura 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.139
 Highly recommend as in the super values 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.090
 have even better than that of 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.400
 oatmeal and also super saturate and 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.599
 are healthy 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.489
 I always do one for that 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.349
 I saw the portion of china 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.870
 in between briefly in water to 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.420
 soft and really great 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.519
 for the breakfast then I mix since then 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.970
 a little bit more of this casein protein 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.280
 powder from imax to the cafe has 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.590
 special properties are just that 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.540
 much longer and general 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.030
 I have great values ​​and I am not quite 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.250
 as expensive as most other protein 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.870
 Powder that you know and I am 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.799
 I really like it 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.629
 with pleasure 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.909
 However, I have to say it only tastes good 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.980
 with water but not so good for it 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.290
 I prefer to use my sojadrink 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.120
 vanilla from a tuba summery 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.280
 fruity for the whole also with 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.169
 fresh fruits or as here namely 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.569
 really like also deep-frozen fruits 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.400
 because they just hold long and 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.919
 are flash frozen and thus very 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.329
 still have many vitamins in it and 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.430
 to the conclusion I give my 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.979
 beloved sojadrink vanilla from one 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.780
 tura this I can take on much better 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.790
 as a milk and I taste a lot again 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.739
 much better 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.229
 and yes that's the finished sheikh 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.590
 the super tastes and really full for a long time 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:12.139
 keeps and is also very healthy as sweet 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.239
 and healthy snack alternative I can 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.940
 you very much this raises baby rice waffles 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.130
 They are really sweet and sour 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.419
 fruity and I really like for 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.290
 between 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.880
 which I always im with 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.520
 Refrigerator must be located 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.860
 such fruity little list love 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.169
 I have been for years and I like those 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.370
 super like to be super healthy and one 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:37.169
 great alternative to sweets protein 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.820
 are rules for small hot the 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.160
 attacks in between also great 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.440
 this one is suitable for this example 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.870
 to be very healthy is one thing 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.380
 protein usually from the healthy plus dm 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.090
 and tastes really delicious 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.370
 These two rules by Leinberger 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.840
 Finnish pallecchi but that is 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.430
 of course, each his personal 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.940
 taste and I do not know everyone 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.220
 taste 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.970
 but I think they taste good with am 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.830
 Do the best with the video I hope 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.320
