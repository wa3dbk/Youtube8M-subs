the remastered version of halo 2 really
my<00:01:51.720> only<00:01:51.869> complaint<00:01:52.380> would<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.920> it

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
my only complaint would be that it

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.480 
my only complaint would be that it
requires<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.840> 59.1<00:01:54.840> gigabyte<00:01:55.409> install<00:01:55.890> which

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
requires a 59.1 gigabyte install which

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.520 
requires a 59.1 gigabyte install which
is<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> ton<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.880> storage<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.020> four<00:01:58.320> games

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
is a ton of storage but it is four games

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.100
