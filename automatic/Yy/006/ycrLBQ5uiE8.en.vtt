00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.450
 I am happy to say to all viewers 9 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.400
 good morning to your channels worked our 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.130
 the referee continues the program new day 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.009
 remember today is Sunday, March 31 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.080
 medical news french scientists 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.520
 figured out how to treat caries home 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.770
 conditions without a doctor's help 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.570
 they created a special gel which 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.579
 allows you to repair damaged 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.500
 tooth surface to cure 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.809
 already ill sound enough to enter 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.270
 some new mixture into the resulting 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:35.309
 cavity in a month she literally 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.199
 the truth is overgrown with this technology of the future 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.460
 scientists have been experimenting so far only on 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.890
 rats gordon 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.989
 I liked their teeth after gel treatment 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.579
 become like new if tested on 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.929
 human teeth will be the same 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.699
 successful maybe soon 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.920
 take advantage of the gel from everyone 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.260
 willing to agree good news 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.329
 for those who are afraid of dentists by the way 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.460
 Dentist today is a guest of medical 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.460
 heading which you will see right now 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.780
 for morning 8 medical heading 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.170
 prosthetic teeth have long been 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.330
 one of the most common procedures 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.190
 dentistry different types of dentures 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.050
 perform different tasks 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.050
 from cosmetic to recovery 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.220
 full replacement of the main functions and 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.680
 missing teeth 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.210
 about how to restore the dentition and 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.480
 save this 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.990
 will tell our doctor igor livshits but 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.510
 am to 2 so we come from 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.420
 post-soviet space of course there 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.430
 her teeth did not know how to heal and therefore people 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.500
 our age let's say live enough 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.090
 often suffer from lack of problems 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.650
 of teeth 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.660
 but we still have problems and 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.600
 lack of sufficient funds 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:54.490
 give us recommendations how to 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.570
 choose a procedure that will help us 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.010
 restore dentition 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.800
 Well, the dentition can be restored 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.020
 removable in several ways 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.880
 fixed prosthetics difference 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.820
 what happens is that part of the shoot 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.470
 should people take off or can take it off 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.590
 the second which it is impossible to remove it 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.989
 glued or given so let's say as 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.070
 the rule 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.170
 fixed types of prosthetics they 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.820
 much more expensive they are much more 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.160
 labor intensive more cost 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.860
 But this business as a doctor and technical 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.510
 personnel for this there are removable 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.110
 types of prosthetics which are also 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.090
 make up for the lack of teeth but at the same time 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.470
 they are worth much more expensive to cheaper 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.900
 order is sometimes cheaper 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.700
 so here are the very prostheses that 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.060
 once grandmothers were filming put in 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.160
 a glass of water before this is one of the mistakes 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.550
 what you need and why you must 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.739
 take off 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.260
 that everyone knew where to put it on 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.180
 the whole thing is wrong yes dentures 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.850
 not removed in principle they are removed 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.920
 just to clean them and this 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.200
 is one of the biggest 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.880
 The advantages of prosthetics are what 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.290
 teeth that can be removed to clean 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.440
 put back and about it at all in 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.380
 principle no one should know 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.940
 the problems of these that is why here's all 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.040
 it was wonderful they are also cheaper 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.240
 of course there are a number of certain 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.390
 problems that have to 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.840
 collide it is basically their fixation 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.820
 that is, not removable dentures 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.980
 they are usually much worse 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.670
 fixed and we have to with this 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.200
 fight 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.960
 for that there is 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.520
 implants that we all know for a long time 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.740
 we use it and thatâ€™s the union 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.960
 prosthetics removable on exactly 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.650
 and this is the topic we wanted today 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:50.710
 talk that is if there is no possibility 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.770
 a person as objectively that is 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:57.610
 insufficient bone have no bones in 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.350
 the place where we need we can deliver 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.530
 limited number of implants and 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.500
 fix that removable denture on them 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.180
 which will be more aesthetic and will 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.150
 very good to keep it in the absence 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.680
 enough teeth this is when 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.860
 the absence of even a small amount 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.989
 teeth tend to be in the back section 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.660
 where we can't do some other 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.610
 or bridges 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.860
 the person is still shown or removable 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.010
 or prosthetics on implants here 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.950
 have to choose 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.580
 what is cheaper if you can not 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.070
 human dentures on implants he 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.070
 these are the hooks that we all have seen our 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.930
 what scares us most about this 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.780
 just no removable dentures because 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.000
 that they can not hold on for his teeth 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.030
 human silk yes yes they snap 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.180
 as on the buttons about this it is not visible and 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.949
 sometimes even 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.830
 very close people do not know what is 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:57.820
 removable denture that's removable denture 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:02.090
 let's say yes to older people they retire 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:06.560
 hard enough to do something more 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:09.440
 how would global like you say easy 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.259
 remove and easy to care for earlier dentures 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.840
 the old generation were so complicated and 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.889
 heavy that they usually brought them 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.169
 deformations 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:24.289
 gums like they were walking in the mouth and 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:27.229
 the man from was uncomfortable with that 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.680
 today distinguishes modern removable 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.380
 prosthesis 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.030
 about those massive prostheses that 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.669
 were once a horse first 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.759
 this technology is today's material 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.889
 from which you can make removable dentures 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:43.009
 This I do not know many have heard a whistle 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.720
 the material is called he mirrors not up from 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:47.570
 which can be made prosthesis which 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.270
 will be very very aesthetic and this one 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:53.449
 process can also join 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.330
 implants as removable and conditional 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.590
 removable today there is another view 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.330
 removable prosthetics then conditionally 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.639
 removable that is, it can theoretically 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.919
 filmed but only by a doctor that is 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.720
 the patient himself cannot withdraw 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.419
 when he comes to shoot me on 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.449
 hygienic cleaning is impossible 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:14.150
 remove the doctor he removes and then he can 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:16.599
 put in place well something like this 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.800
 that is, the doctor once a year or every six months 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.759
 whichever is done should 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.800
 call the patient 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:24.199
 take a look see how he cares 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.120
 because one of the main causes of marriage 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:28.820
 prosthetic implant is 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.099
 not enough they go here in 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.280
 Generally it is quite clear and interesting 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:36.199
 thank you doctor and so modern removable 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.909
 prosthetics are noticeably different from 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.419
 that which was some ten years 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.669
 backwards 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:42.919
 firstly it is more affordable in 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:45.650
 second thanks to prosthetic materials 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:48.320
 outwardly almost indistinguishable from the present 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.190
 teeth and don't give a feeling 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.320
 discomfort 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.320
 so decide all the best to you 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.190
 started everything
