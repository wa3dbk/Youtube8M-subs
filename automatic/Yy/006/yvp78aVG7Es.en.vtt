00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.490
 I was told I have I mentioned 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.969
 we're here between maybe it's one of the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.910
 biggest debuts not the biggest one if 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.890
 one of the biggest but we are in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.470
 the boot of a brand that is growing 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.410
 a lot and that more and more we are going to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.750
 listen and we will see your products and 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.240
 products that do not look so bad on me 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.340
 I refer to Huawei a Chinese company that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.340
 keeps growing and that is launching 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.890
 high-end equipment in this case 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.170
 we are before a tablet a combination 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.670
 between phone and tablet 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.950
 This is the send mail you a product one 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.920
 device with a screen 6 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.640
 inches is much bigger than a 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.610
 galaxy note 2 you can see it in 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.239
 this comparison if it looks much more 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.680
 great and the truth is that it is a team 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.899
 very good 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.240
 we had already mentioned a screen of 6 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.770
 8- megapixel camera one 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.040
 RAM 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.500
 2 GB processor 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.750
 at the same time that he is a loser that is already 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.390
 becoming standard in the four cores 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.070
 and the truth is that it is a team that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.890
 the screen can work very well 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.520
 It looks amazing and has a configuration 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.130
 from pretty decent android bars the time 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.900
 that it looks very good every time this issue of 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.300
 that the products are bigger than 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.700
 there are much bigger products 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.800
 will allow the management of 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.050
 information is different and that even 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.880

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.619
