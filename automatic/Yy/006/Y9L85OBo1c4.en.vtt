oops if you're wondering why I changed
before<00:01:52.650> I<00:01:52.890> got<00:01:53.100> my<00:01:53.250> gaming<00:01:53.580> mouse<00:01:53.729> hooked<00:01:54.090> up

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
before I got my gaming mouse hooked up

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.800 
before I got my gaming mouse hooked up
sorry<00:01:54.510> about<00:01:54.630> that

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810

sorry about that
we'll<00:01:55.740> say<00:01:55.950> set<00:01:56.610> time<00:01:56.850> and<00:02:01.250> get<00:02:02.250> time<00:02:07.550> time<00:02:08.550> is

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
we'll say set time and get time time is

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
we'll say set time and get time time is
I'm<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.500> kind<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.800> whipping<00:02:11.070> through<00:02:11.250> here

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
I'm just kind of whipping through here

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.699 
I'm just kind of whipping through here
if<00:02:12.360> you're<00:02:12.480> wondering<00:02:12.720> what<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.840> label<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.380> a

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
if you're wondering what a label is a

if you're wondering what a label is a
label<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:14.700> quite<00:02:15.300> literally<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.959> control

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
label is just quite literally a control

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.400 
label is just quite literally a control
that<00:02:16.590> displays<00:02:16.860> text<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.510> do<00:02:18.660> other<00:02:19.110> neat

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
that displays text you can do other neat

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.540 
that displays text you can do other neat
things<00:02:19.620> with<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.800> label<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:20.130> it's<00:02:20.250> beyond<00:02:20.459> the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
things with a label but it's beyond the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.090 
things with a label but it's beyond the
scope<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.000> tutorial

scope of this tutorial

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.590 
scope of this tutorial
really<00:02:23.100> what<00:02:23.400> we<00:02:23.520> want<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.790> do<00:02:23.880> with<00:02:24.150> this<00:02:24.360> is

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
really what we want to do with this is

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.840 
really what we want to do with this is
just<00:02:24.750> display<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.440> text<00:02:25.620> time<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.400> then<00:02:26.760> we've

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
just display the text time is then we've

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.870 
just display the text time is then we've
got<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.000> text<00:02:27.300> box<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:28.550> there's<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.640> thing

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
got a text box and there's a thing

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.050 
got a text box and there's a thing
called<00:02:30.500> windows<00:02:31.500> design<00:02:31.860> patterns<00:02:32.340> you

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
called windows design patterns you

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.990 
called windows design patterns you
notice<00:02:33.300> how<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.420> looks<00:02:33.830> much<00:02:34.830> much<00:02:35.400> better<00:02:35.700> if

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
notice how it looks much much better if

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.760 
notice how it looks much much better if
it's<00:02:36.180> like<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:37.410> when<00:02:37.530> you're<00:02:37.620> designing

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
it's like that so when you're designing

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.010 
it's like that so when you're designing
an<00:02:38.100> application<00:02:38.220> try<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.910> adhere<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.630> the

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
an application try to adhere to the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.080 
an application try to adhere to the
windows<00:02:40.440> design<00:02:40.770> patterns<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.340> other<00:02:41.880> words

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
windows design patterns in other words

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.790 
windows design patterns in other words
don't<00:02:42.209> put<00:02:42.480> like<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.660> button<00:02:42.989> on<00:02:43.260> top<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.680> your

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
don't put like a button on top of your

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.560 
don't put like a button on top of your
text<00:02:44.100> box<00:02:44.280> or<00:02:44.489> put<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.700> button<00:02:45.000> above<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.390> or

text box or put a button above it or
something<00:02:45.780> like<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:45.980> look<00:02:46.980> at<00:02:47.130> applications

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
something like that look at applications

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.640 
something like that look at applications
you've<00:02:48.000> used<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.480> you've<00:02:48.600> loved<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.230> try<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
you've used and you've loved and try to

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.830 
you've used and you've loved and try to
design<00:02:49.980> them<00:02:50.310> don't<00:02:50.730> don't<00:02:51.330> blatantly<00:02:51.690> rip

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
design them don't don't blatantly rip

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.810

them off copy them just design them in a
similar<00:02:54.120> pattern<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:55.019> notice<00:02:55.230> how<00:02:55.320> there's

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
similar pattern you notice how there's

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.020 
similar pattern you notice how there's
