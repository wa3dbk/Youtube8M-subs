incredibly<00:02:06.899> LP<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.409> was<00:02:08.099> impressed<00:02:08.399> with<00:02:08.610> her

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.219 
incredibly LP I was impressed with her
but<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:08.910> wasn't<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.239> overly<00:02:09.750> shocked<00:02:10.050> with

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
but I wasn't like overly shocked with

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.630 
but I wasn't like overly shocked with
how<00:02:10.259> good<00:02:10.649> she<00:02:10.800> was<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.280> wasn't<00:02:11.550> it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
how good she was like it wasn't it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.770 
how good she was like it wasn't it
wasn't<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.910> golem<00:02:12.239> for<00:02:12.750> me

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
wasn't a golem for me

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.120 
wasn't a golem for me
I thought<00:02:13.990> goals<00:02:14.230> are<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.470> best<00:02:14.740> recent

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
I thought goals are the best recent

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.100 
I thought goals are the best recent
troop<00:02:15.459> that<00:02:15.610> would<00:02:15.700> have<00:02:15.819> been<00:02:16.000> added<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.480> think

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
troop that would have been added I think

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.660 
troop that would have been added I think
golems<00:02:17.350> are<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.590> far<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.220> best<00:02:18.370> dark<00:02:18.520> elixir

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
golems are the far the best dark elixir

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.750 
golems are the far the best dark elixir
troop<00:02:19.030> with<00:02:19.450> minions<00:02:19.840> coming<00:02:20.140> in<00:02:20.200> second

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
troop with minions coming in second

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.860 
troop with minions coming in second
another<00:02:21.760> thing<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.060> add<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.420> update<00:02:22.690> they

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
another thing to add in the update they

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.630 
another thing to add in the update they
really<00:02:23.319> really<00:02:23.440> buffed<00:02:23.890> some<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.459> dark

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
really really buffed some of the dark

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.580 
really really buffed some of the dark
elixir<00:02:24.819> troops<00:02:25.209> they<00:02:25.569> made<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.840> Valkyrie<00:02:26.200> way

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
elixir troops they made the Valkyrie way

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.500 
elixir troops they made the Valkyrie way
way<00:02:26.770> better<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.250> they<00:02:27.400> cheapen<00:02:27.790> her<00:02:27.940> cost<00:02:28.240> to

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
way better and they cheapen her cost to

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.449 
way better and they cheapen her cost to
they<00:02:29.170> made<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:29.440> think<00:02:29.530> they<00:02:29.770> cheapen<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.250> hog

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
they made I think they cheapen the hog

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.729 
they made I think they cheapen the hog
riders<00:02:30.819> costs<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.300> increased<00:02:31.739> increase

their<00:02:32.920> damage<00:02:33.250> or<00:02:33.370> something<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:33.790> they<00:02:33.819> made

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
their damage or something so they made

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.760

both<00:02:34.270> of<00:02:34.300> those<00:02:34.420> troops<00:02:34.720> really<00:02:35.050> good<00:02:35.200> they

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
both of those troops really good they

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.390 
both of those troops really good they
decreased<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.920> amount<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:39.069> elixir

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
decreased the the amount of elixir

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.070 
decreased the the amount of elixir
