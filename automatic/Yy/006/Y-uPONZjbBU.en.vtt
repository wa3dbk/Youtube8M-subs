00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.339
 dear friends there we are out again 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.810
 the hibernates are awake hands 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.109
 not asleep easter faces the 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.879
 door 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.129
 that's why we have something small for you 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:13.160
 We need to think about it first 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.849
 an egg here comes the image is rolled 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.180
 usual is one 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.189
 next a nail because we have 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.180
 Unfortunately, this alpiq does not sting at home 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.560
 That's why we made the holes 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.510
 simply with nails purely because we have a the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.060
 then blow out a pen 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.170
 and paper 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.080
 We'll come to that for what it's good for afterwards 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.270
 is also served 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.530
 easter and motifs will be suitable for easter 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:41.390
 Here bristles with chick blÃ¼mchen it 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.440
 brush and craft glue 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.090
 we still have that for the whole 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.860
 Last work would have left 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.969
 probably not new to get that 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.559
 is everything we need for one 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:53.120
 little Easter special and go to work 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.239
 First, we take the egg and 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.340
 Of course not our rusty nail 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.190
 funny but pointed and do both 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.960
 a hole in it so that we can 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.250
 can blow out a bit carefully 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.930
 Do not be crushed with it 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.550
 both sides a bit 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.030
 he gets it on with a touch of tact 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.380
 every case 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:19.340
 or do we blow it up and strong 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.230
 Splash therefore are already there 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.450
 of course you can make it delicious 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.990
 but then we are more likely to do that now 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.980
 do we need so only the shell abz 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.010
 next have us out of ours 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.940
 big sheet of paper a little piece of paper 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.920
 demolished and write with the pen 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.570
 We now have our personal greetings 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.710
 We have it for us now 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.780
 we just decided to write 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.780
 on it and nice the heart behind it 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.130
 and you see 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.170
 already where the whole thing leads because we 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.210
 Kick the note now and the two 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.020
 holes before he has in the offer 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.509
 they are now going to be as well 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.610
 prove useful because it will be a kind 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.030
 Eggs fortunately we already 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.990
 maybe you can see 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.070
 as soon as the note is in it you have to 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.899
 of course, let it dry first 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.380
 otherwise that would be in the whole 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.760
 Schlager in it so that I already rustles 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.010
 and now let's just take those 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.230
 served and as always when served 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.380
 technology, we only need the top one 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.380
 layer 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.450
 that's a bit like always 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:29.319
 voluntary, but we can get it on 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.690
 every case and hope that the bottom 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.360
 Part no way is monster what we are 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.080
 from the served just want to get out 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.340
 a few flowers 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.019
 Of course there is the big one we need 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.319
 not so much to a few shreds everything 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.930
 clear 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:50.260
 Now take the tinkering from ours 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.810
 out here on the theme back and catch 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.829
 Now just paint the egg 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.939
 Of course we can do that through a hole 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.709
 also stretch somewhere that you 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.239
 your fingers do not paint and the 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.739
 Served then while brushing not in 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:11.980
 new spheres sticking when we do that 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:13.719
 to paint over a whole five times and so on 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.549
 Now we have the big flower of ours 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.170
 main attraction here on the egg 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.189
 already clear that 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.919
 We better still a bit of 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.329
 from the sides and where still white places 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:27.129
 we have two more of us 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:30.819
 Demolished so that the end 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:34.719
 completely covered with this served 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.819
 Of course , that's the whole thing 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:39.159
 a bit accelerated but that should be 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.129
 not too much craftsmanship 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:45.700
 challenge 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:48.040
 as soon as we see it stuck everywhere 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:54.370
 Let's put it to dry first 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:56.620
 everything clear 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.139
 We'll let the whole thing dry and 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.500
 so it was dried it looks like that 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:05.229
 wonderfully wonderfully colorful egg and if 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:11.290
 give it away then fortune cookie 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:12.760
 moderately easy and oh ours
