00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:30.040 

here's<00:00:04.730> my<00:00:04.940> settings<00:00:06.370> 30<00:00:07.370> sensitivity<00:00:29.050> mister

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
here's my settings 30 sensitivity mister

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.019 
here's my settings 30 sensitivity mister
lowering<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.619> sensitivity<00:00:31.520> to<00:00:31.640> see<00:00:31.789> if<00:00:31.880> that

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
lowering the sensitivity to see if that

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.790 
lowering the sensitivity to see if that
changes<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:32.629> bounciness<00:00:33.079> as<00:00:33.469> somebody

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
changes the bounciness as somebody

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:47.139 
changes the bounciness as somebody
suggested<00:00:45.280> well<00:00:46.280> it<00:00:46.399> sure<00:00:46.579> looks<00:00:46.610> like<00:00:47.000> it

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
suggested well it sure looks like it

00:00:47.149 --> 00:01:00.959 
suggested well it sure looks like it
does<00:00:51.070> so<00:00:52.070> once<00:00:52.309> again<00:00:52.540> of<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:53.750> sensitivity

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:09.069 

amazing<00:01:07.149> now<00:01:08.149> maybe<00:01:08.359> that's<00:01:08.539> partly<00:01:08.869> because

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
amazing now maybe that's partly because

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.279 
amazing now maybe that's partly because
it's<00:01:09.409> just<00:01:09.560> picking<00:01:09.889> up<00:01:09.979> more<00:01:10.159> of<00:01:10.219> the<00:01:10.369> ground

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
it's just picking up more of the ground

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:20.949 
it's just picking up more of the ground
and<00:01:12.289> this<00:01:12.439> is<00:01:12.560> iron<00:01:12.799> mineralized<00:01:13.369> ground<00:01:19.959> so

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:20.959 
and this is iron mineralized ground so

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:23.620 
and this is iron mineralized ground so
again<00:01:21.289> slower<00:01:21.679> deep<00:01:22.490> discrimination<00:01:23.329> screen

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
again slower deep discrimination screen

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:43.219 
again slower deep discrimination screen
opens

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.620 

well<00:01:44.670> I'd<00:01:45.670> say<00:01:45.880> it<00:01:45.969> has<00:01:46.030> something<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.420> do<00:01:46.539> with

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
well I'd say it has something to do with

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:55.610 
well I'd say it has something to do with
the<00:01:46.750> discrimination<00:01:47.289> screen<00:01:47.740> also<00:01:47.920> that

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.680 

you
