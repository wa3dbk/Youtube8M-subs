00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.150
 in the present tutorial we are going to look 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:16.990
 how to update the samsung 91 92 that 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:20.710
 has an android 4 2 or 4 22 in a 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.199
 android kitkat 44 officially not 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.870
 Finds available for Latin America 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.820
 this version is only available 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.760
 in russia then what are we going to do 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.649
 is to update it we press volume 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.649
 down power and home 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.460
 then we give you a key up 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.590
 2 logan up 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.520
 connect 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.520
 the wire 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.489
 now we open 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.610
 the folder where we downloaded what 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.009
 is the firmware and we have to stop the 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.009
 odin then we execute the odin 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.390
 here says auto reboot should be 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.729
 configured 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.729
 then we give in ap 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.530
 we look for the firmware 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.560
 the software tells me that you expect a 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.119
 moment 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.119
 we leave our mobile here 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.080
 after the file has been loaded 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:02:00.280
 we have to have auto enabled 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.280
 robot and reset time then we give start 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.270
 and the update system did not waver 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.710
 starts 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.080
 remember that the mobile must be 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.060
 charged to 100% otherwise you can 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.730
 happen some problem or problem 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.650
 with our cell phone 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.650
 in the mobile is charging 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.150
 I remind you that this cell phone has 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:32.480
 manufactures a version 422 is the version 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.480
 'billie jean' 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.130
 now we wait until the software 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.640
 I finished doing all the load of the 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.540
 system 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.760
 this may take a moment 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.760
 the process and it 's about to end 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.770
 It is not long before I finish them 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.930
 I remember the flash or the firmware that 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.540
 I just downloaded from the site 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.330
 samsung official which I've 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.250
 downloaded the official flash is not 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.800
 still available for some countries 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.720
 for example as for some countries of 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.019
 latin america for example for colombia 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.480
 where they settled but we can 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.510
 do this update and perfectly 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.489
 our mobile can work clarified that 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.700
 there are times when the mobile is rooted 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.160
 it is not allowed to update manually and 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.900
 through the iess can not be updated 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.819
 to the latest version since it is not 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.819
 still available for our country 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:43.569
 this system has been reset says 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.569
 reset our mobile has just paid 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.210
 it's going on 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.020
 turn on our mobile with the symbol of 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.020
 samsung 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.690
 now we see a message that says

 it's over or it just happened 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.860
 the update correctly 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.180
 let's hope that initial I made 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.210
 and that is finished auto configure 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.420
