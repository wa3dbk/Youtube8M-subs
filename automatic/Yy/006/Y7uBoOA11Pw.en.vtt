00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.270 

now<00:00:07.700> again<00:00:08.330> different<00:00:09.230> motherboards<00:00:09.800> take

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
now again different motherboards take

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.750 
now again different motherboards take
different<00:00:10.990> pin<00:00:11.990> counsel<00:00:12.530> brain<00:00:12.740> for<00:00:13.670> example

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:13.760 
different pin counsel brain for example

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.980 
different pin counsel brain for example
if<00:00:14.480> you<00:00:14.840> picked<00:00:15.139> out<00:00:15.259> ddr2<00:00:15.980> RAM<00:00:16.759> you<00:00:17.599> have<00:00:17.630> to

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
if you picked out ddr2 RAM you have to

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.140 
if you picked out ddr2 RAM you have to
note<00:00:18.380> that<00:00:18.410> ddr2<00:00:19.130> it<00:00:19.430> has<00:00:19.580> three<00:00:20.000> different

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
note that ddr2 it has three different

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.390 
note that ddr2 it has three different
pin<00:00:20.540> counts<00:00:20.930> so<00:00:21.140> even<00:00:21.830> though<00:00:21.980> you<00:00:22.040> might<00:00:22.250> have

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
pin counts so even though you might have

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.980 
pin counts so even though you might have
got<00:00:22.520> the<00:00:22.550> right<00:00:22.790> type<00:00:23.060> you<00:00:23.330> still<00:00:23.689> need<00:00:23.900> to

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
got the right type you still need to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.330 
got the right type you still need to
make<00:00:24.020> sure<00:00:24.289> that<00:00:24.500> it<00:00:24.650> got<00:00:24.770> the<00:00:24.830> right<00:00:24.980> pin

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
make sure that it got the right pin

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.929 
make sure that it got the right pin
count

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
count

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.200 
count
so<00:00:26.449> again<00:00:26.689> style<00:00:27.320> of<00:00:27.529> RAM<00:00:27.800> such<00:00:28.310> as<00:00:28.460> DDR<00:00:28.850> ddr2

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
so again style of RAM such as DDR ddr2

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.710 
so again style of RAM such as DDR ddr2
ddr3<00:00:29.980> pin<00:00:30.980> count<00:00:31.310> such<00:00:31.670> as<00:00:31.820> how<00:00:32.000> many<00:00:32.059> pins<00:00:32.510> are

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
ddr3 pin count such as how many pins are

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.189 
ddr3 pin count such as how many pins are
on<00:00:32.840> it

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
on it

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.600 
on it

you guys about is if speed of ram now
once<00:00:57.710> you're<00:00:57.860> looking<00:00:58.129> at<00:00:58.220> ram<00:00:58.460> you're<00:00:58.670> gonna

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
once you're looking at ram you're gonna

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.109 
once you're looking at ram you're gonna
come<00:00:59.059> across<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.479> number<00:01:00.190> that<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:01.670> might<00:01:01.940> not

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119 
come across a number that you might not

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:03.789 
come across a number that you might not
know<00:01:02.330> what<00:01:02.360> it<00:01:02.540> is<00:01:02.720> and<00:01:02.930> it's<00:01:03.049> kind<00:01:03.290> of<00:01:03.409> a

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
know what it is and it's kind of a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.620 
know what it is and it's kind of a
number<00:01:04.339> that's<00:01:04.489> kind<00:01:04.760> of<00:01:04.790> just<00:01:04.939> flow<00:01:05.210> in<00:01:05.390> there

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
number that's kind of just flow in there

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.450 
number that's kind of just flow in there
and<00:01:05.900> not<00:01:06.350> really<00:01:06.590> telling<00:01:06.860> anything<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.250> whole

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
and not really telling anything a whole

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.080 
and not really telling anything a whole
lot<00:01:07.640> for<00:01:08.479> example<00:01:09.369> when<00:01:10.369> you<00:01:10.460> buy<00:01:10.490> ram<00:01:10.880> just

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
lot for example when you buy ram just

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.930 
lot for example when you buy ram just
going<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.300> say<00:01:11.420> something<00:01:11.780> like<00:01:11.900> ddr2<00:01:12.550> 800<00:01:13.550> DVR

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
going to say something like ddr2 800 DVR

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.910 
going to say something like ddr2 800 DVR
to<00:01:14.150> a<00:01:14.180> thousand<00:01:14.840> you're<00:01:15.260> like<00:01:15.470> what<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.770> heck

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
to a thousand you're like what the heck

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.200 
to a thousand you're like what the heck
is<00:01:16.070> this<00:01:16.220> I<00:01:16.460> don't<00:01:16.520> know<00:01:16.730> what<00:01:16.880> this<00:01:17.030> number

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
is this I don't know what this number

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.170 
is this I don't know what this number
means<00:01:17.410> what<00:01:18.410> this<00:01:18.590> number<00:01:18.800> is<00:01:18.920> is<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:19.790> speed

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
means what this number is is the speed

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.660 
means what this number is is the speed
of<00:01:20.450> your<00:01:20.630> RAM<00:01:20.900> and<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.770> higher<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.070> number

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
of your RAM and the higher the number

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.280 
of your RAM and the higher the number
the<00:01:22.910> faster<00:01:23.120> and<00:01:25.300> before<00:01:26.300> you<00:01:26.450> go<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:26.690> find

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
the faster and before you go and find

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.880 
the faster and before you go and find
the<00:01:27.640> just<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:28.730> random<00:01:29.180> thing<00:01:29.360> I<00:01:29.660> need<00:01:30.620> to<00:01:30.710> tell

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
the just a random thing I need to tell

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.210 
the just a random thing I need to tell
you<00:01:30.980> guys<00:01:31.040> one<00:01:31.790> very<00:01:32.390> important<00:01:32.990> thing<00:01:33.220> when

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
you guys one very important thing when

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.770 
you guys one very important thing when
you're<00:01:34.370> looking<00:01:34.400> at<00:01:34.940> your<00:01:34.970> motherboard<00:01:35.570> in

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
you're looking at your motherboard in

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.800 
you're looking at your motherboard in
the<00:01:36.020> specs<00:01:36.409> of<00:01:36.680> RAM<00:01:37.130> it's<00:01:38.000> gonna<00:01:38.240> have<00:01:38.540> a

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
the specs of RAM it's gonna have a

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.560 
the specs of RAM it's gonna have a
memory<00:01:39.230> standard<00:01:40.010> and<00:01:40.220> what<00:01:40.850> this<00:01:41.030> is<00:01:41.360> the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
memory standard and what this is the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.560 
memory standard and what this is the
lowest<00:01:42.200> amount<00:01:42.620> speed<00:01:43.430> that<00:01:44.120> it<00:01:44.240> can<00:01:44.360> come

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
lowest amount speed that it can come

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.010 
lowest amount speed that it can come
with<00:01:44.770> for<00:01:45.770> example<00:01:45.890> if<00:01:46.490> your<00:01:47.180> memory<00:01:47.510> standard

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
with for example if your memory standard

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.540 
with for example if your memory standard
is<00:01:48.260> DVR<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.960> 800<00:01:50.960> then<00:01:51.710> that's<00:01:52.010> the<00:01:52.310> lowest

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
is DVR to 800 then that's the lowest

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.840 
is DVR to 800 then that's the lowest
speed<00:01:53.240> they<00:01:53.600> hundred<00:01:54.170> that<00:01:54.320> you<00:01:54.440> can<00:01:54.590> get<00:01:54.850> now

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
speed they hundred that you can get now

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.850 
speed they hundred that you can get now
another<00:01:56.450> thing<00:01:56.570> that<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.140> should<00:01:57.170> know<00:01:57.590> is

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
another thing that you should know is

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.649 
another thing that you should know is
memory<00:01:58.820> or<00:01:59.120> RAM<00:02:00.050> is<00:02:00.350> backwards<00:02:00.920> compatible

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
memory or RAM is backwards compatible

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.240 
memory or RAM is backwards compatible
therefore<00:02:02.659> you<00:02:02.960> can<00:02:03.140> always<00:02:03.560> get<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:03.830> speed

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
therefore you can always get a speed

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.960 
therefore you can always get a speed
higher<00:02:05.020> than<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.409> standard<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.520> if<00:02:07.820> your

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
higher than the standard so if your

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.479 
higher than the standard so if your
standard<00:02:08.479> on<00:02:08.629> your<00:02:08.780> brother<00:02:08.959> bars

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
standard on your brother bars

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.820 
standard on your brother bars
motherboard<00:02:10.489> is<00:02:10.759> DVR<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.480> 800<00:02:12.049> you<00:02:12.470> can<00:02:12.620> always

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
motherboard is DVR to 800 you can always

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.850 
motherboard is DVR to 800 you can always
go<00:02:13.099> DDR<00:02:13.610> 2000<00:02:14.420> DVR<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.620> 1200

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
go DDR 2000 DVR to 1200

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.400 
go DDR 2000 DVR to 1200
but<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.430> never<00:02:17.700> go<00:02:18.000> any<00:02:18.180> lower<00:02:18.450> like<00:02:18.810> DVR

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
but you can never go any lower like DVR

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.810 
but you can never go any lower like DVR
to<00:02:20.450> 600<00:02:21.450> or<00:02:21.510> 400<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.160> can<00:02:23.340> always<00:02:23.520> go

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
to 600 or 400 so you can always go

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.910 
to 600 or 400 so you can always go
higher<00:02:24.120> speed<00:02:24.600> than<00:02:24.870> your<00:02:24.990> standard<00:02:25.290> but

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
higher speed than your standard but

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.040 
higher speed than your standard but
never<00:02:26.190> lower<00:02:26.490> it's<00:02:27.060> very<00:02:27.450> important<00:02:27.960> because

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
never lower it's very important because

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.900 
never lower it's very important because
if<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.320> put<00:02:28.500> lower<00:02:28.710> reimann<00:02:29.070> your<00:02:29.520> beaters

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
if you put lower reimann your beaters

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.290 
if you put lower reimann your beaters
not<00:02:30.120> gonna<00:02:30.300> work<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.600> out<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:32.520> now<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.030> you

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
not gonna work it out so now that you

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.080 
not gonna work it out so now that you
say<00:02:33.480> all<00:02:33.750> right<00:02:33.930> more<00:02:34.800> ram<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.400> put<00:02:35.880> in<00:02:35.970> my

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
say all right more ram I put in my

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.940 
say all right more ram I put in my
computer<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.750> more<00:02:36.930> applications<00:02:37.560> I'm<00:02:37.740> gonna

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
computer the more applications I'm gonna

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.620 
computer the more applications I'm gonna
be<00:02:38.070> able<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.340> run<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:39.030> I'm<00:02:39.120> going<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.330> go<00:02:39.480> out

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
be able to run so I'm going to go out

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.320 
be able to run so I'm going to go out
and<00:02:39.750> buy<00:02:40.310> $12,000<00:02:41.310> worth<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.610> RAM<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.090> put<00:02:42.210> it

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
and buy $12,000 worth of RAM and put it

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.900 
and buy $12,000 worth of RAM and put it
in<00:02:42.420> my<00:02:42.540> computer<00:02:42.720> well<00:02:43.680> take<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.340> easy<00:02:44.430> Bessie

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
in my computer well take it easy Bessie

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.070 
in my computer well take it easy Bessie
because<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.330> don't<00:02:45.510> want<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.750> do<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.020> just

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
because you don't want to do that just

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.310 
because you don't want to do that just
yet<00:02:46.580> there<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> maximum<00:02:48.420> amount<00:02:48.600> of<00:02:49.050> RAM

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
yet there is a maximum amount of RAM

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.050 
yet there is a maximum amount of RAM
that<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.590> can<00:02:49.740> put<00:02:49.950> on<00:02:50.100> every<00:02:50.520> motherboard

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
that you can put on every motherboard

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.540 
that you can put on every motherboard
and<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:52.410> way<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.650> find<00:02:53.040> out<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.400> maximum

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
and the way you find out the maximum

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.640 
and the way you find out the maximum
amount<00:02:54.030> was<00:02:54.209> Ram<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.660> course<00:02:55.170> just<00:02:55.500> like

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
amount was Ram of course just like

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.470 
amount was Ram of course just like
everything<00:02:56.070> else<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.700> need<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.090> look<00:02:57.209> at<00:02:57.360> the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
everything else you need to look at the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.500 
everything else you need to look at the
specs<00:02:58.070> now<00:02:59.070> one<00:02:59.459> thing<00:02:59.640> you<00:03:00.090> have<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.360> realize

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
specs now one thing you have to realize

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.370 
specs now one thing you have to realize
that<00:03:00.810> even<00:03:01.350> if<00:03:01.500> your<00:03:01.650> motherboard<00:03:01.950> can<00:03:02.790> take

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
that even if your motherboard can take

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.080 
that even if your motherboard can take
massive<00:03:04.380> amount<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.160> RAM<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.790> don't

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
massive amount of RAM you don't

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.090 
massive amount of RAM you don't
necessarily<00:03:06.239> want<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.989> put<00:03:07.260> all<00:03:07.470> this<00:03:07.709> Ram<00:03:07.950> on

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
necessarily want to put all this Ram on

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.680 
necessarily want to put all this Ram on
your<00:03:08.220> motherboard<00:03:08.459> because<00:03:09.180> maybe<00:03:09.390> your

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
your motherboard because maybe your

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.500 
your motherboard because maybe your
operating<00:03:10.320> system<00:03:10.680> can't<00:03:10.890> recognize<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.580> to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
operating system can't recognize that to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.250 
operating system can't recognize that to
be<00:03:12.540> safe<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.320> would<00:03:13.860> put<00:03:14.100> in<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:15.270> maximum<00:03:15.810> for

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
be safe I would put in the maximum for

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.560 
be safe I would put in the maximum for
any<00:03:16.470> computer<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:16.980> ever<00:03:17.340> built<00:03:17.670> was<00:03:17.850> 4<00:03:18.150> gigs<00:03:18.420> of

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
any computer I ever built was 4 gigs of

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.289 
any computer I ever built was 4 gigs of
ram<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.709> plenty<00:03:20.070> enough<00:03:20.220> if<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.120> put

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
ram and this is plenty enough if you put

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.060 
ram and this is plenty enough if you put
in<00:03:21.390> any<00:03:21.570> more<00:03:21.780> than<00:03:22.019> 4<00:03:22.260> gigs<00:03:22.470> ram<00:03:22.590> then<00:03:22.920> you're

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
in any more than 4 gigs ram then you're

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.090 
in any more than 4 gigs ram then you're
just<00:03:23.220> getting<00:03:23.549> greedy<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:25.709> know<00:03:25.860> you

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
just getting greedy and you know you

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.039 
just getting greedy and you know you
just<00:03:26.250> don't<00:03:26.400> need<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.670> do<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.330> just<00:03:27.600> back

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
just don't need to do it so just back

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.600 
just don't need to do it so just back
off<00:03:29.600> now<00:03:30.600> for<00:03:31.350> this<00:03:31.530> build<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:32.070> want<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.340> talk<00:03:32.489> to

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
off now for this build I want to talk to

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.640 
off now for this build I want to talk to
you<00:03:32.700> guys<00:03:32.850> about<00:03:33.120> what<00:03:33.330> kind<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:33.930> RAM<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.290> picked

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
you guys about what kind of RAM I picked

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.430 
you guys about what kind of RAM I picked
out<00:03:34.799> we<00:03:35.580> went<00:03:35.790> with<00:03:35.880> Kingston<00:03:36.390> which<00:03:36.959> is<00:03:37.140> just

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
out we went with Kingston which is just

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.580 
out we went with Kingston which is just
the<00:03:37.560> brand<00:03:37.830> name<00:03:38.070> we<00:03:38.790> went<00:03:39.060> with<00:03:39.209> 1<00:03:40.140> gigabyte

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
the brand name we went with 1 gigabyte

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.920 
the brand name we went with 1 gigabyte
total<00:03:41.190> what<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.790> actually<00:03:41.970> see<00:03:42.390> is<00:03:42.420> made<00:03:42.750> up

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
total what you actually see is made up

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.440 
total what you actually see is made up
of<00:03:43.080> two<00:03:43.549> 512<00:03:44.549> megabyte<00:03:45.510> sticks<00:03:45.840> we<00:03:46.769> went<00:03:47.010> with

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
of two 512 megabyte sticks we went with

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.539 
of two 512 megabyte sticks we went with
240<00:03:48.450> pin<00:03:48.660> which<00:03:49.049> is<00:03:49.260> again<00:03:49.769> just<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.370> make<00:03:50.519> sure

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
240 pin which is again just to make sure

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.420 
240 pin which is again just to make sure
it<00:03:50.760> fits<00:03:51.000> into<00:03:51.150> motherboard<00:03:51.720> type<00:03:52.709> moon<00:03:52.980> is

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
it fits into motherboard type moon is

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.750 
it fits into motherboard type moon is
ddr2<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.690> we<00:03:55.590> wanna<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:56.010> 800<00:03:56.760> speed<00:03:57.920> so<00:03:58.920> this

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
ddr2 and we wanna the 800 speed so this
