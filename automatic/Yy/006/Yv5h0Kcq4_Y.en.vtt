time<00:02:14.829> so<00:02:15.459> we<00:02:15.640> can<00:02:15.760> do<00:02:15.879> is<00:02:16.000> actually<00:02:16.180> possible

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
time so we can do is actually possible

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.530 
time so we can do is actually possible
and<00:02:17.200> we're<00:02:17.290> right<00:02:17.440> at<00:02:17.590> 35<00:02:18.129> through<00:02:18.489> even<00:02:21.540> and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
know what it was to be in them so this

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.750 
know what it was to be in them so this
time<00:02:27.970> we're<00:02:28.090> going<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.239> go<00:02:28.390> across<00:02:28.599> her<00:02:28.900> hip

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.680 

and<00:04:35.949> that's<00:04:36.160> really<00:04:36.370> not<00:04:36.639> that<00:04:36.880> tight<00:04:37.210> on<00:04:37.449> her

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
and that's really not that tight on her

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.779 
and that's really not that tight on her
it's<00:04:37.960> just<00:04:38.320> holding<00:04:39.070> it<00:04:39.280> down<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.639> now<00:04:39.729> she

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
it's just holding it down and now she

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.600 
it's just holding it down and now she
can<00:04:40.090> get<00:04:40.240> trip<00:04:40.949> one<00:04:41.949> of<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:42.100> cool<00:04:42.310> things<00:04:42.550> we

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
can get trip one of the cool things we

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.900 
can get trip one of the cool things we
want<00:04:42.820> to<00:04:42.940> tell<00:04:43.270> what<00:04:43.479> time<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:43.750> is<00:04:44.910> eleven

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
want to tell what time it is eleven

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.480 
want to tell what time it is eleven
twelve

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
twelve

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.490 
twelve
and<00:04:48.490> so<00:04:49.180> since<00:04:49.419> these<00:04:49.600> things<00:04:49.810> only<00:04:50.050> last<00:04:50.350> for

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
and so since these things only last for

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.290 
and so since these things only last for
about<00:04:50.590> ten<00:04:50.889> minutes<00:04:51.250> we're<00:04:51.789> going<00:04:51.940> to<00:04:52.030> have<00:04:52.150> to

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
about ten minutes we're going to have to

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.379 
about ten minutes we're going to have to
do<00:04:52.840> a<00:04:52.870> second<00:04:53.350> session<00:04:54.220> in<00:04:54.580> order<00:04:54.669> to<00:04:54.970> do<00:04:55.240> the

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
do a second session in order to do the

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:56.129 
do a second session in order to do the
remeasurement

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
remeasurement

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.020 
remeasurement
because<00:04:56.470> this<00:04:56.620> needs<00:04:56.860> to<00:04:56.919> be<00:04:56.979> on<00:04:57.160> at<00:04:57.280> least<00:04:57.490> 45

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
because this needs to be on at least 45

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.330 
because this needs to be on at least 45
minutes<00:04:58.199> to<00:04:59.199> explain<00:04:59.620> what<00:04:59.860> it's<00:05:00.010> doing

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
minutes to explain what it's doing

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.620 
minutes to explain what it's doing
really<00:05:01.000> decibel<00:05:01.620> yes
