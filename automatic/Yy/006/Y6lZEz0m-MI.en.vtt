00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.600 
boy in my collection I have yet to read
those<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.780> I'm<00:02:25.900> sure<00:02:26.080> they<00:02:26.290> will<00:02:26.440> be<00:02:26.590> fun<00:02:26.770> true

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
those but I'm sure they will be fun true

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.250 
those but I'm sure they will be fun true
those<00:02:28.030> movies<00:02:28.360> were<00:02:28.570> not<00:02:28.690> quite<00:02:28.930> as<00:02:29.080> good<00:02:29.200> as

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
those movies were not quite as good as

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.440 
those movies were not quite as good as
the<00:02:29.470> spider-man<00:02:29.860> movies<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.550> suspect

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
the spider-man movies I suspect

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.450 
the spider-man movies I suspect
therefore<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.650> books<00:02:32.830> will<00:02:33.010> also<00:02:33.310> not

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
therefore that the books will also not

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.600 
therefore that the books will also not
be<00:02:33.490> as<00:02:33.670> good<00:02:33.990> still<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.320> am<00:02:35.680> sure<00:02:36.130> they<00:02:36.310> will<00:02:36.459> be

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
be as good still I am sure they will be

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.930 
be as good still I am sure they will be
