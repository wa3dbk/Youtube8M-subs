00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.179
 hello and welcome to play 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.599
 ouhlala to dragon ball the story of 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.599
 dragon 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.400
 Warning 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.080
 welcome to the meanders of shit 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.540
 it's a little youth that I was very 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.849
 very happy that I am ready at the time 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.000
 I feel like he's a judo buddy who 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.530
 had lent me on nes I had finished with 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.170
 with the guen jsk era I liked 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.309
 tchité and because you're going all over 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.320
 then understand that if we try to 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.699
 play this game correctly it does not work 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.809
 not then advertise for a background he was doing 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.230
 that game has never been released 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.360
 United States 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.620
 in the state it was called power strap 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.480
 because dragonball was not yet 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.860
 released in the United States 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.149
 it's this weekend after and suddenly there is 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.680
 few countries that have a version 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.840
 fully translated into their language 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.670
 and France is a little bit 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.600
 as a nice to diack also on nes 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.450
 which were translated into French at 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.990
 the time as what we got lucky 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:12.000
 but not with this one right now the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.800
 Ihermitte level I have three balls of 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.850
 dragon let's see if this game if my 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.770
 bullets resist 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.729
 at this fucking good shit games 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.900
 starters but how to find better 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.400
 he finishes bulma sentences it's not 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.530
 badly with that good radar dragons let's go 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.409
 said 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.840
 ah fucking shit and that's the one and 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.799
 unique music of the game so if you have 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.320
 seen and maybe from the attic player 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.580
 maybe you remember that then 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.200
 it's a game I 've never tested 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.310
 in my own game show from maïdo to 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.590
 a very distant time and I do not know 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.659
 not if you can see you but in 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.210
 did I lose my life marked power is 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.970
 in fact I lose deviated closure that the 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.369
 chrono advance because why not they 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.200
 are diverse and so I really do 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.670
 expressing not to lose too much life and 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.679
 yet I take the full steak 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.820
 and recover it and a rice dumpling 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.190
 that makes me move faster it does not serve 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.539
 nothing right now fight fight 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.130
 against the leader of the brigands who we 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.630
 did a good job that we had good 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.550
 misery because there is no 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.989
 technique in this crappy game 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.910
 here and I'm happy I 'm going 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.319
 Mongolian head and fucking I have more 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.950
 that half of my life because this game 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:31.230
 it's dung with echoes or not 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.230
 was captured 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:42.010
 what a suspense and here and so suddenly 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:44.019
 I could that 67 ha ben fucking pv you 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.579

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.079
 real good game on the beginning of dragon ball 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.819
 frankly I see the one on gameboy 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.879
 advance which is really a wonder 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.650
 because this one at the fucking how 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.659
 it's shit and diaries to judo it 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:14.879

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:23.709

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:27.280
