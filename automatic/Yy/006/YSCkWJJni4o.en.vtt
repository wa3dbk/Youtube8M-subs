00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
that we sometimes he's on these matrix

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.070 
that we sometimes he's on these matrix
dots<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.699> lot<00:00:12.119> of<00:00:12.240> people<00:00:12.480> inquire<00:00:12.660> about<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
dots a lot of people inquire about the

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.410 
dots a lot of people inquire about the
matrix<00:00:13.440> dots<00:00:13.680> and<00:00:13.949> how<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.879> deal<00:00:15.059> with<00:00:15.090> them

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
matrix dots and how to deal with them

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.180 
matrix dots and how to deal with them
well<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:15.779> is<00:00:15.930> one<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.170> many<00:00:16.500> techniques<00:00:16.830> I

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
well this is one of many techniques I

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.310 
well this is one of many techniques I
think<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.609> work<00:00:17.820> one<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.810> my<00:00:18.900> personal

everybody knows that a Mustang has to
make<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.759> starts<00:00:24.060> at<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.210> top<00:00:24.419> and<00:00:24.990> just<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
make it starts at the top and just a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.929 
make it starts at the top and just a
save<00:00:25.439> time<00:00:25.679> I've<00:00:25.949> already<00:00:26.130> cleaned<00:00:26.730> and

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
save time I've already cleaned and

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.759 
save time I've already cleaned and
prepped<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.329> inside<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.169> glass<00:00:28.320> and

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
prepped the inside of this glass and

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.300 
prepped the inside of this glass and
I've<00:00:29.159> already<00:00:29.369> shrunk<00:00:29.999> some<00:00:30.240> tent<00:00:31.040> over<00:00:32.040> this

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
I've already shrunk some tent over this

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.370 
I've already shrunk some tent over this
glass<00:00:32.579> now<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.030> went<00:00:33.480> ahead<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:34.080> you<00:00:34.200> see

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
glass now I went ahead is if you see

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.500 
glass now I went ahead is if you see
this<00:00:34.560> up<00:00:34.740> here<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.280> went<00:00:35.880> ahead<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.060> shrunk<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
this up here I went ahead and shrunk the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.660 
this up here I went ahead and shrunk the
entire<00:00:36.810> window<00:00:37.230> dots<00:00:37.470> at<00:00:37.680> all<00:00:37.830> and<00:00:38.490> then<00:00:38.610> I

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
entire window dots at all and then I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.460 
entire window dots at all and then I
went<00:00:38.880> back<00:00:38.970> and<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.630> cut<00:00:40.080> at<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.320> bottom

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
went back and I just cut at the bottom

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.500 
went back and I just cut at the bottom
row<00:00:40.740> of<00:00:40.860> dots<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.250> straight<00:00:41.520> line<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.060> I've

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
row of dots a straight line and I've

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.900 
row of dots a straight line and I've
separated<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.200> top<00:00:43.410> part<00:00:43.770> from<00:00:44.490> the<00:00:44.610> bottom

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
separated the top part from the bottom

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.260 
separated the top part from the bottom
part

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
part

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.180 
part
one<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:45.990> reasons<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.350> did<00:00:46.560> that<00:00:46.740> is<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.040> is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
one of the reasons I did that is this is

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.000 
one of the reasons I did that is this is
the<00:00:47.400> cheapest<00:00:48.180> quickest<00:00:48.660> easiest<00:00:48.870> way<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.590> me

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
the cheapest quickest easiest way for me

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.680 
the cheapest quickest easiest way for me
to<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.310> pattern<00:00:50.580> to<00:00:50.970> cut<00:00:51.150> this<00:00:51.270> out<00:00:51.510> with

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
to have a pattern to cut this out with

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.600 
to have a pattern to cut this out with
I'm<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.530> use<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.190> put<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.400> top

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
I'm just going to use this to put on top

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.060 
I'm just going to use this to put on top
of<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.910> black<00:00:54.230> material<00:00:55.230> which<00:00:55.680> by<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.920> way

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
of the black material which by the way

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.120 
of the black material which by the way
the<00:00:56.250> technique<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.780> put<00:00:57.990> a<00:00:58.020> black<00:00:58.440> jet

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
the technique is to put a black jet

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.700 
the technique is to put a black jet
black<00:00:59.370> opaque<00:00:59.850> vinyl<00:01:00.330> on<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.510> inside<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.590> I'm

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
black opaque vinyl on the inside and I'm

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.860 
black opaque vinyl on the inside and I'm
going<00:01:01.740> to<00:01:01.920> cut<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.190> out<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.660> duplicate<00:01:03.660> this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
going to cut it out to duplicate this

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.739 
going to cut it out to duplicate this
piece<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.350> tent<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.210> I'm<00:01:06.359> going<00:01:06.509> to

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:06.749 
piece of tent here and then I'm going to

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:09.160 
piece of tent here and then I'm going to
install<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.380> inside<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.979> want<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.249> install

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
install on the inside I want to install

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.649 
install on the inside I want to install
after<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.859> install<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.609> tent<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.179> gone<00:01:12.299> it's

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
after I install the tent it's gone it's

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.300 
after I install the tent it's gone it's
going<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:12.899> installed<00:01:13.049> last<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:14.100> then<00:01:14.219> I

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
going to be installed last but then I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.330 
going to be installed last but then I
want<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.520> take<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.759> to<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.909> glass<00:01:15.119> behind<00:01:15.450> me

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
want to take you to the glass behind me

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.389 
want to take you to the glass behind me
and<00:01:17.340> show<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.700> how<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.149> this<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:20.340> know

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
and show you how we do this you know

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.880 
and show you how we do this you know
first<00:01:20.609> we<00:01:20.819> determine<00:01:21.299> which<00:01:21.990> side<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.289> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
first we determine which side of the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.459 
first we determine which side of the
release<00:01:23.249> liner<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:23.909> decide<00:01:24.259> facing<00:01:25.259> me

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
release liner we just decide facing me

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.859 
release liner we just decide facing me
and<00:01:25.679> one<00:01:25.859> way<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.039> check<00:01:26.429> is<00:01:26.609> I<00:01:26.759> divide<00:01:27.569> it<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
and one way I check is I divide it and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.569 
and one way I check is I divide it and
see<00:01:29.749> just<00:01:30.749> to<00:01:30.840> make<00:01:31.020> sure<00:01:31.159> because<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.369> didn't

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
see just to make sure because I didn't

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.980 
see just to make sure because I didn't
want<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.759> release<00:01:32.999> liner<00:01:33.210> facing<00:01:33.659> B<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.899> this

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
want the release liner facing B in this

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.840 
want the release liner facing B in this
example<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.969> I<00:01:36.020> want<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> go<00:01:37.200> ahead<00:01:37.789> and<00:01:38.789> I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
example and I want to go ahead and I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.600 
example and I want to go ahead and I
want<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> put<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.359> tent<00:01:40.310> hiring<00:01:41.310> above<00:01:41.520> me

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
want to put the tent hiring above me

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.480 
want to put the tent hiring above me
so<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.880> see<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:46.490> then<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.610> take<00:01:47.850> my<00:01:47.880> bottle

go<00:05:05.280> back<00:05:05.550> I'd<00:05:06.510> rather<00:05:07.670> cut<00:05:08.670> it<00:05:08.820> where<00:05:09.000> I<00:05:09.030> can

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
go back I'd rather cut it where I can

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.730 
go back I'd rather cut it where I can
come<00:05:09.810> back<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.110> trim<00:05:10.260> off<00:05:10.410> a<00:05:10.440> little<00:05:10.650> more

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740

than<00:05:10.920> trim<00:05:11.340> too<00:05:11.520> much<00:05:12.380> so<00:05:13.380> I<00:05:13.410> can<00:05:13.710> always<00:05:13.860> get

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
than trim too much so I can always get

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.900 
than trim too much so I can always get
it<00:05:14.280> perfect<00:05:15.890> just<00:05:16.890> a<00:05:16.980> little<00:05:17.250> mistake<00:05:17.340> and

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
it perfect just a little mistake and

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:25.310 
it perfect just a little mistake and
kind<00:05:18.810> of<00:05:18.870> set<00:05:18.990> you<00:05:19.140> back<00:05:19.290> sometimes<00:05:24.110> I've<00:05:25.110> got

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
kind of set you back sometimes I've got

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.630 
kind of set you back sometimes I've got
to<00:05:25.380> do<00:05:25.470> a<00:05:25.500> little<00:05:25.740> trimming<00:05:25.980> on<00:05:26.190> that<00:05:26.400> but

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640

otherwise<00:05:26.880> it's<00:05:27.330> almost<00:05:27.690> perfect<00:05:28.110> like<00:05:28.200> a

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
otherwise it's almost perfect like a

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:43.520 
otherwise it's almost perfect like a
warning<00:05:29.150> in<00:05:30.150> places

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.210

all right I'm happy with that all right
now<00:05:47.520> we'll<00:05:47.760> pause<00:05:48.000> for<00:05:48.030> a<00:05:48.300> minute<00:05:48.390> we'll<00:05:48.860> pass

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
now we'll pause for a minute we'll pass

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.410 
now we'll pause for a minute we'll pass
the<00:05:50.010> video<00:05:50.280> to<00:05:50.550> where<00:05:50.670> I'm<00:05:50.790> putting<00:05:51.000> it<00:05:51.150> on<00:05:51.270> the

the video to where I'm putting it on the

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.630 
the video to where I'm putting it on the
matrix<00:05:51.780> dots<00:05:51.990> and<00:05:52.320> close-up<00:05:53.310> of<00:05:53.400> what<00:05:53.550> it

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
matrix dots and close-up of what it

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.550 
matrix dots and close-up of what it
looks<00:05:53.790> like<00:05:53.990> and<00:05:54.990> when<00:05:55.620> we<00:05:55.680> come<00:05:55.830> back<00:05:56.010> thanks
