00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.999 
but let's see let's just carry out antic
you<00:01:30.270> might<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:30.840> me<00:01:30.960> first<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.470> stuff<00:01:31.680> but

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.830 
you might a get me first and stuff but
we'll<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.640> wait<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.360> we're<00:01:33.479> gonna<00:01:33.570> hang

on<00:01:34.020> until<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.619> begin<00:01:35.540> yeah

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
on until we begin yeah

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.020 
on until we begin yeah

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
right so I think gloves shots in the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.399 
right so I think gloves shots in the
host<00:01:40.770> pod<00:01:41.100> he's<00:01:41.310> hidden<00:01:41.549> lines<00:01:41.939> but<00:01:42.869> I'm<00:01:42.990> lions

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
host pod he's hidden lines but I'm lions

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.260 
host pod he's hidden lines but I'm lions
head<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.860> should<00:01:44.040> spawn<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.579> stampy's<00:01:45.060> head

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
head we should spawn and stampy's head

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.480 
head we should spawn and stampy's head
it<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:45.570> goes<00:01:45.810> correctly<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:47.100> then<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.310> can

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
it all goes correctly and then we can

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.770 
it all goes correctly and then we can
get<00:01:48.439> to<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.860> go<00:01:50.040> okay<00:01:50.850> teleporting
