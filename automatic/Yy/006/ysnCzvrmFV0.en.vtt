sky<00:02:41.650> drift<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.540> have<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> lot<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.500> terrain

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
sky drift so you have a lot of terrain

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.100 
sky drift so you have a lot of terrain
to<00:02:45.190> cover<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:46.000> really<00:02:46.299> is<00:02:46.660> some<00:02:46.900> nice

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
to cover and it really is some nice

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.259

frozen mountains and lava covered
landscapes<00:02:52.180> just<00:02:52.599> to<00:02:52.720> mention<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:53.140> few<00:02:53.340> sky

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
landscapes just to mention a few sky

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.809 
landscapes just to mention a few sky
drift<00:02:54.670> has<00:02:54.879> a<00:02:55.209> lot<00:02:55.900> of<00:02:56.170> variety<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:57.459> combine

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
drift has a lot of variety you combine

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.839 
drift has a lot of variety you combine
that<00:02:58.060> with<00:02:58.120> all<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.510> vibrant<00:02:59.230> colors

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
that with all the vibrant colors

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.729 
that with all the vibrant colors
imaginative<00:03:00.849> layouts<00:03:01.390> there<00:03:01.870> really<00:03:02.349> isn't<00:03:02.709> a

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
imaginative layouts there really isn't a

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.220 
imaginative layouts there really isn't a
bad<00:03:02.980> track<00:03:03.370> in<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.670> bunch<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.810> has<00:03:04.930> solid

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
bad track in the bunch it has solid

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.949 
bad track in the bunch it has solid
controls<00:03:05.829> and<00:03:06.099> constant<00:03:06.910> plane<00:03:07.209> explosions

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
controls and constant plane explosions

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.170 
controls and constant plane explosions
so<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.500> really<00:03:08.950> can't<00:03:09.220> say<00:03:09.400> much<00:03:09.579> bad<00:03:09.910> about

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.619 
so you really can't say much bad about
