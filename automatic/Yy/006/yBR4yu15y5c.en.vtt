00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
whole new marketplace which i think is a

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.380 
whole new marketplace which i think is a
very<00:02:24.569> exciting<00:02:25.200> marketplace<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.459> was<00:02:26.670> for

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
very exciting marketplace and it was for

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.570 
very exciting marketplace and it was for
that<00:02:27.540> reason<00:02:27.599> that<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.380> felt<00:02:28.709> we<00:02:28.920> could<00:02:29.280> go

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
that reason that I felt we could go

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.460 
that reason that I felt we could go
forward<00:02:29.970> with

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
forward with

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.270 
forward with
1.5<00:02:31.220> billion<00:02:31.970> dollar<00:02:32.360> investment<00:02:33.050> here<00:02:33.980> and

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
1.5 billion dollar investment here and

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.540 
1.5 billion dollar investment here and

that we're seeing in Dubai in June of as

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
isolated to define specific were part of

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.050 
isolated to define specific were part of
the<00:02:50.600> global<00:02:50.900> downturn<00:02:51.020> no<00:02:51.560> no<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.770> I<00:02:52.160> think<00:02:52.550> it's

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
the global downturn no no I I think it's

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.940 
the global downturn no no I I think it's
certainly<00:02:53.330> part<00:02:53.870> of<00:02:53.990> the<00:02:54.140> global<00:02:54.590> downturn

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
certainly part of the global downturn

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.720 
certainly part of the global downturn
and<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.940> think<00:02:56.240> Dubai<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:57.200> one<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.340> lost

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
and I think Dubai is one of the lost

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.170 
and I think Dubai is one of the lost
places<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.750> begin<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.470> feel<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:00.800> I<00:03:01.550> mean<00:03:01.970> we

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
places to begin to feel it I mean we

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.070 
places to begin to feel it I mean we
felt<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.810> soared<00:03:03.230> happening<00:03:04.720> right<00:03:05.720> at<00:03:06.020> the
