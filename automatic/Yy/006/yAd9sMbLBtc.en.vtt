00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
you've said before nob this way as you

you've said before nob this way as you
can<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.210> not<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> landscape<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.229> fiddly

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
can see it is not a landscape a fiddly

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.590 
can see it is not a landscape a fiddly
but<00:01:20.159> awkward<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.610> start<00:01:20.850> off<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> space

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
but awkward to start off with the space

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.969 
but awkward to start off with the space
if<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.810> used<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.439> your<00:01:22.470> phone<00:01:22.770> this

if you used to have in your phone this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.920 
if you used to have in your phone this
way<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.790> as<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.420> with<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> next

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
way but as you can see with the next

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.929 
way but as you can see with the next
clip<00:01:25.140> you'll<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.680> why<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.159> fills<00:01:26.520> screen<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
clip you'll see why it fills screen a

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.370 
clip you'll see why it fills screen a
lot<00:01:27.240> lot<00:01:27.450> more<00:01:27.479> properly<00:01:27.960> that's<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> way

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
lot lot more properly that's the way

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.440 
lot lot more properly that's the way
spoons<00:01:28.740> should<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.070> taken<00:01:29.460> especially<00:01:29.820> taking

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
spoons should be taken especially taking

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.210 
spoons should be taken especially taking
video<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.750> even<00:01:31.079> taking<00:01:31.619> pictures<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.040> well

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
video and even taking pictures as well

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.980 
video and even taking pictures as well
or<00:01:32.430> people<00:01:32.729> make<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> mistake<00:01:33.060> taking

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
or people make the mistake taking

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.649 
or people make the mistake taking
pictures<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.829> way<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.790> well<00:01:35.939> which<00:01:36.630> should

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
pictures that way as well which should

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.390 
pictures that way as well which should
be<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.259> way<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.710> let<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.950> see<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> video

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
be that way so let you see the video

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.830 
be that way so let you see the video
what<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.610> looks<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:38.820> from<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.060> phone<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.780> you

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
what it looks like from the phone so you

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.319 
what it looks like from the phone so you
get<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> rough<00:01:40.320> idea<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> video

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
get a rough idea so this is a video

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.450 
get a rough idea so this is a video
recorder<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.479> landscape<00:01:46.020> mode<00:01:46.229> which<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.280> you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
recorder a landscape mode which as you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.810 
recorder a landscape mode which as you
can<00:01:47.490> see<00:01:47.750> fills<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.259> complete<00:01:49.890> screen<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
can see fills the complete screen and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.219 
can see fills the complete screen and
you<00:01:50.880> don't<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.390> black<00:01:51.630> lines<00:01:51.960> don't

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you don't have the black lines don't

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.980 
you don't have the black lines don't
each<00:01:52.470> side<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.610> way<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.450> you're<00:01:54.689> taking

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
each side this is way if you're taking

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.560 
each side this is way if you're taking
any<00:01:55.170> pictures<00:01:55.439> or<00:01:55.860> taking<00:01:56.369> any<00:01:56.579> video<00:01:56.909> you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
any pictures or taking any video you

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.780 
any pictures or taking any video you
keep<00:01:57.810> your<00:01:57.960> phone<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.890> side<00:01:59.130> with<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
keep your phone on the side with the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.030 
keep your phone on the side with the
camera<00:02:00.240> near<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.810> off<00:02:00.899> always<00:02:01.200> up<00:02:01.560> at<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.829> top

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
camera near and off always up at the top

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.030 
camera near and off always up at the top
so<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.909> can<00:02:03.149> get<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.509> even<00:02:04.110> far<00:02:04.439> better<00:02:04.710> shot

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
so you can get that even far better shot

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.679 
so you can get that even far better shot
and<00:02:05.310> your<00:02:05.430> videos<00:02:05.790> look<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.090> your<00:02:06.240> pictures

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
and your videos look on your pictures

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.660 
and your videos look on your pictures
will<00:02:07.140> come<00:02:07.170> by<00:02:07.409> 10<00:02:07.740> times<00:02:07.979> better<00:02:08.250> than<00:02:08.520> what

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
will come by 10 times better than what

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.150 
will come by 10 times better than what
they<00:02:08.819> were<00:02:08.940> before

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
they were before

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.440 
they were before
so<00:02:11.160> if<00:02:11.280> they<00:02:11.370> like<00:02:11.489> white<00:02:11.700> value<00:02:12.000> will<00:02:12.300> give

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
so if they like white value will give

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.730 
so if they like white value will give
