00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:09.170
 yes hello me again this time i want to 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.370
 introduce my second family 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.349
 This one looks at first sight 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:20.760
 not so instructor top Sodinger it 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:24.980
 But you already feel in these 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.320
 two boxes since spun the zombies 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.599
 then die would be you can 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:42.329
 Collecting things by being here 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:43.800
 goes in practice this is virtually 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.440
 then you go down and things come 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.210
 just wanted to swim here now 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.020
 Certainly know how I did it 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.670
 So I have more water taken to 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.670
 has still a bucket I have that then 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.670
 redirected 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:15.260
 Maybe I can leave it here 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:15.260
 Here the water flows there 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:22.890
 and if it is then in there it's warm 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.409
 Keep the zombies in these two rooms 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.729
 the falling into the watercourse and 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.210
 then die because he is too deep 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.829
 and the so-called big but this because they 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.299
 then do not go or climb this one 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.900
 come forth that I can you now times 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.030
 a display I have just again 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.649
 built because I do not want to now 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.330
 wanted to break it because it was neither one 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:02:07.830
 big trap with only taken 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:02:10.260
 on top of that, there was more 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.990
 inside or I can not straight 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.960
 not just as well not believe 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.950
 So they fall in here and down there 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.360
 are these glass plates 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.580
 if a there are here then so 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.310
 glass plates so that you also look beautiful 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.709
 may explode as from 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.700
 Here is the little one that is possible 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.400
 water up 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.540
 because that goes down then die 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.700
 but stop the rims arrows and stuff 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.680
 go on underneath and if 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.050
 then here you just have to wash it all down 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.490
 still collect 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.580
 yes this is a monster of I 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.270
 this will now emptying this 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.190
 something else 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.590
 the built so far that you get in 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.790
 but simply a stream of water 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.920
 However, the zombies did not die 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.959
 if the water flow you listen to the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.709
 means if then sees fall under it 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.709
 there are still zombies 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.829
 That's why I'll be the water right away 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.569
 even turn off then comes the 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:27.530
 things just think the addressed it 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.530
 is also very nice quiet 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:34.049
 this is my blog in here with yes 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.640
 Also nice to die if you look for it 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.739
 fall 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.519
 now there is no exception to mine 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.530
 third, this is just a trap 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:49.129
 die and things just go 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.129
 side away here I'll show you now 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.799
 there is an entrance that I have to 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.439
 a short time there is the cactus and the 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.780
 things from the dog owners we want 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:02.730
 you also have to pick up quite a 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.639
 Secret I can you there was there 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:10.760
 show a map 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:10.760
 He also feels minecraft munich 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.690
 underground 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.100
 it goes up 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.889
 who then appears this turnfest 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.550
 put down 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:45.039
 so we put in minecraft male in it 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:47.460
 I mean, this is a flat 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.460
 in the top 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:53.969
 I can also show you that 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.860
 You always have to keep this spiral staircase 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:59.289
 spiral staircase to the top 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:05.669
 with someday you will be the holder 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:11.830
 are already in the range of the upper part than 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:16.719
 and have done everything possible so that can 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:21.699
 you can not look out for rice 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:24.250
 information up there that's it 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.650
 actually the next videos come from 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.029
 my other minecraft stuff then 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.360
 I would say 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:30.360
 bye for now
