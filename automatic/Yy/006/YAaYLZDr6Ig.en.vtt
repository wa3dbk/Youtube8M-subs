00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
I think maybe the nitrogen itself the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.940 
I think maybe the nitrogen itself the
nitrogen<00:01:51.630> these<00:01:51.899> beers<00:01:52.170> they<00:01:52.380> kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.649> cut

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.630 
and I'd say honestly if people want to
drink<00:03:42.570> this<00:03:42.750> beer<00:03:43.080> pour<00:03:43.770> it<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:43.980> drink<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.400> a

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
drink this beer pour it and drink it a

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.130 
drink this beer pour it and drink it a
little<00:03:45.330> bit<00:03:45.420> faster<00:03:45.780> than<00:03:45.900> you<00:03:45.990> would<00:03:46.110> a

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
little bit faster than you would a

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.110 
little bit faster than you would a
normal<00:03:46.230> beer<00:03:46.620> because<00:03:47.010> when<00:03:47.460> it<00:03:47.580> loses<00:03:47.970> its

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
normal beer because when it loses its

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.330 
normal beer because when it loses its
carbonation<00:03:48.750> it's<00:03:48.900> more<00:03:49.170> of<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.440> kind<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.250> a

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
carbonation it's more of a kind of a

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.580 
carbonation it's more of a kind of a
watery<00:03:50.700> Dee<00:03:51.600> carbonated<00:03:52.140> beer<00:03:52.230> honestly

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
watery Dee carbonated beer honestly

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.050 
watery Dee carbonated beer honestly
because<00:03:52.800> it<00:03:52.920> doesn't<00:03:53.220> hold<00:03:53.310> its<00:03:53.520> carbonation

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
because it doesn't hold its carbonation

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.940 
because it doesn't hold its carbonation
at<00:03:54.210> all<00:03:54.540> there<00:03:54.840> is<00:03:54.990> no<00:03:55.200> carbonation<00:03:55.590> in<00:03:55.830> this

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950

at all there is no carbonation in this
beer<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.640> a<00:03:56.790> flat<00:03:57.210> beer<00:03:57.420> at<00:03:57.540> this<00:03:57.690> point

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
beer it is a flat beer at this point

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.870
