of<00:00:57.379> 195<00:01:02.050> so<00:01:03.050> it<00:01:03.170> looks<00:01:03.199> like<00:01:03.409> I've<00:01:03.650> got

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
of 195 so it looks like I've got

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.230

probably<00:01:04.129> 200<00:01:04.610> or<00:01:04.699> 205<00:01:05.000> in<00:01:05.420> me<00:01:07.149> should<00:01:08.149> have

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
probably 200 or 205 in me should have

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.340

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.540 
lifted 209 first batch 110 pretty
comfortable<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:15.890> think<00:01:16.070> I<00:01:16.100> did<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:16.310> for<00:01:16.369> about

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550

right

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.609 
right
and<00:01:27.520> probably<00:01:28.299> a<00:01:28.479> little<00:01:28.689> bit<00:01:28.869> left<00:01:29.110> in<00:01:29.320> tank

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
and probably a little bit left in tank

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.139 
and probably a little bit left in tank
that<00:01:29.799> maybe<00:01:30.009> two<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.280> half<00:01:30.399> of<00:01:30.549> five<00:01:30.759> kilos

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
that maybe two and a half of five kilos

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:38.010 
that maybe two and a half of five kilos
depending<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:35.200> my<00:01:35.350> own<00:01:35.409> socks<00:01:35.740> bra<00:01:36.869> see<00:01:37.869> if<00:01:37.930> I

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
depending you my own socks bra see if I

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.929 
depending you my own socks bra see if I
can<00:01:38.110> get<00:01:38.170> something<00:01:38.439> a<00:01:38.729> slightly<00:01:39.729> different

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
can get something a slightly different

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.039 
can get something a slightly different
for<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.240> next<00:01:40.450> comp<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.479> deads<00:01:43.750> felt<00:01:43.990> a

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
for the next comp so the deads felt a

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.350 
for the next comp so the deads felt a
lot<00:01:44.170> stronger<00:01:44.409> than<00:01:44.530> I<00:01:44.679> expected<00:01:44.799> so<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:45.729> felt

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
lot stronger than I expected so it felt

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.990 
lot stronger than I expected so it felt
pretty<00:01:46.479> good<00:01:47.070> I'm<00:01:48.070> ten<00:01:48.280> kilos<00:01:48.610> for<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.789> next

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
pretty good I'm ten kilos for the next

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
pretty good I'm ten kilos for the next
attempt

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:15.640 

easy<00:02:10.930> lifting<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.140> serious<00:02:12.740> business
