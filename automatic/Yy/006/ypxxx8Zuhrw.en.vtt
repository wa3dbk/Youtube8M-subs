screen there a customs form message and
i<00:00:45.510> bet<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.530> wondering<00:00:46.980> how<00:00:47.310> this<00:00:47.880> is<00:00:48.030> possible

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
i bet you wondering how this is possible

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.900 
i bet you wondering how this is possible
well<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.380> a<00:00:49.830> second<00:00:50.250> you're<00:00:50.460> about<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.760> find

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
well in a second you're about to find

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.190 
well in a second you're about to find
out<00:00:51.200> all<00:00:52.200> it<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.970> renamed<00:00:54.720> wither

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
out all it really is is a renamed wither

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.010 
out all it really is is a renamed wither
and<00:00:55.820> now<00:00:56.820> they<00:00:57.120> probably<00:00:57.360> all<00:00:57.570> makes<00:00:57.780> sense

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and now they probably all makes sense

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.610 
and now they probably all makes sense
but<00:00:59.570> right<00:01:00.570> underneath<00:01:00.840> where<00:01:01.140> are<00:01:01.290> spawned

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
but right underneath where are spawned

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.530 
but right underneath where are spawned
in<00:01:01.830> in<00:01:01.950> the<00:01:02.040> world<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.270> wither

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
in in the world I have a wither

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.600 
in in the world I have a wither
underneath<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:04.890> dig<00:01:05.250> down<00:01:05.400> these

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
underneath so if I just dig down these

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.390 
underneath so if I just dig down these
blocks<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.110> find<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.620> bedrock<00:01:08.070> cage

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
blocks and you can find a bedrock cage

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.700 
blocks and you can find a bedrock cage
holding<00:01:08.910> a<00:01:09.150> river<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.690> you<00:01:10.050> can<00:01:10.140> see<00:01:10.380> there<00:01:10.620> is

holding a river as you can see there is

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.260
