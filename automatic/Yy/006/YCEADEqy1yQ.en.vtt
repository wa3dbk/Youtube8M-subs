 two branches of milky pearls mean 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.120

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.800
 so it's earrings and ring 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:52.260
 it means networks look like this 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.710
 amazing braids I made took 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.680
 I 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.469
 small pearl means it can even be 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.090
 say comparing here with this he 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.180
 small and took Czech beads like that 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.460
 tiny beads and so I did 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.189
 them like this along the edge of the pearls in order 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.490
 so that the fishing line was not visible 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.560
 means here such here cute earrings and 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.670
 he is such a ring that is it too 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.040
 wicker bag which serezhechka hto well clogged 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.240
 Czech glass beads mean 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.420
 beautiful ring with crystals these 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.299
 crystals very surprisingly become visible 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.479
 between these holes, that is, it turned out 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.670
 You can say jewelry work means and 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.950
 This is how it looks 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:47.470
 so here is a ring and earrings still 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.670
 I plan to make a bracelet but since 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.440
 manual work is very laborious means 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.360
 have to spend a lot of time on it 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.970
 I decided to do it for now 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.509
 pores to us means one i made pearl 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.149
 set of pure pearls 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.489
 I made the second set with stones 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.769
 Aventurine means why I take 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:17.860
 angelina because he is very shiny 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:22.239
 now the summer is beginning and that means going to 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.310
 street or mean somewhere on walks then 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.220
 there is a stone aventurine and very beautiful 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.489
 glitters so i really read mean 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.190
 here is the same little wicker 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.190
 that means too small 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.100
 czech beads czech glass 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.640
 who knows she is very popular and 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.459
 very long time it uses in work and 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.569
 it means these beads are amazingly smooth. 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.660
 and beautiful and 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.540
 and shine too, this dear beads and they 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.620
 from cheap without the same means 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.380
 ring and earrings mean like that 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.670
 way it will look on the fingers 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:08.350
 and on the ears will be earrings, too, plan to 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:12.400
 this naborchik have to make a bracelet that is, 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.620
 Now in this way, and then as I 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.859
 doing wedding sets 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.680
 I decided to make a tiara and bought it 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.549
 I am a metal frame as I have already 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.420
 told 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.350
 I resort to buying the basics because 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.050
 eg 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.220
 with metal i can't handle i don't own 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.890
 technique 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.710
 alloy metals and I buy already 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.640
 finished product but again I insert in 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.580
 them stones means this here for childbirth 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.270
 means very comfortable means made 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.240
 metal balls so as not to pricked 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.450
 head and so were here like this 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.900
 huge crystals means here they are 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.510
 large crystals and around the wicker 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.930
 the little ones were made like a circle 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.780
 but there was a void and I scored here again 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.530
 the pearls came out very surprising 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:13.990
 beautiful work like this 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:18.940
 crown diadem 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:21.760
 so here it is 1 and the second I have here 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.800
 in this way it is already exactly how 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.290
 the crown on you so put on your head 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.900
 Of course in this there are no such balls I'm on 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.240
 I did not pay attention 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.760
 up convenient not to score 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.890
 stone mean here went like this 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:42.400
 it means 1 2 strips of crystals here and it was 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.060
 between a lot of space and I mean her 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.250
 chose 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.120
 but then coming home of course 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.880
 disappointed but it's all fixable 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.580
 think of something here and that means 2 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.880
 Here's a tiara mean she 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.820
 I chose the crown small because well 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.210
 I prefer the classics, that is, if 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.510
 Of course who wants and can be ordered and 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.270
 high and big it is for me not 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:14.560
 the problem I will do everything means such 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.640
 Here are 2 tiara ki I mean today 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.820

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:26.260

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.660

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.540
 in the twelfth year how time flies 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.030
 absolutely do not pay attention here such 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.390
 This means that they have released a new stone 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.330
 it means as if untreated on 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.220
 the edges but in the middle it is very beautiful 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.460
 I polished you now a little bit 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.980
 Like this, I'll play with my hand, it's faceted 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.470

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.130
 faceting I made a narrow 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.800
 here is a tiny wire 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.690
 metal but I scored her here 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.490
 beautiful such here are curved 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:06.910
 mean patterns on the sides but on the finger like 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.010
 as if it is and there is no this wire here 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.580

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.790
 throw but how many stones did i have 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.500
 made some rings really weren't 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.930
 a little bit different because the shape of the stone 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.790
 there was another but the most ideal 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.400
