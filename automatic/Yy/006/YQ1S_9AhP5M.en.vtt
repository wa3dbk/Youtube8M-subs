the nikon d610 once again heavily
rumored<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:14.700> what's<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.150> all<00:00:15.210> about<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.809> it

worth<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> d600<00:00:17.400> dead

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.880 

well<00:00:25.990> according<00:00:26.320> to<00:00:26.350> my<00:00:26.440> sheet<00:00:26.710> right<00:00:26.830> here

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
well according to my sheet right here

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.600 
well according to my sheet right here
the<00:00:27.220> d600<00:00:27.940> is<00:00:28.060> dead<00:00:28.840> even<00:00:29.650> spelled<00:00:30.040> capital

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
the d600 is dead even spelled capital

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.460 
the d600 is dead even spelled capital
you<00:00:30.730> probably<00:00:31.029> can't<00:00:31.240> see<00:00:31.300> that<00:00:31.510> yeah

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
you probably can't see that yeah

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.040 
you probably can't see that yeah
basically<00:00:32.800> the<00:00:33.160> 610<00:00:33.610> is<00:00:33.790> just<00:00:34.090> and<00:00:34.300> it's<00:00:34.870> not

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
basically the 610 is just and it's not

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.600 
basically the 610 is just and it's not
even<00:00:35.230> an<00:00:35.320> upgrade<00:00:35.680> to<00:00:35.710> its<00:00:35.920> just<00:00:36.129> fixing<00:00:36.580> some

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
even an upgrade to its just fixing some

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.270 
even an upgrade to its just fixing some
things<00:00:37.000> in<00:00:37.150> the<00:00:37.239> 600<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:38.470> 600<00:00:38.920> came<00:00:39.040> out<00:00:39.160> about

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
things in the 600 the 600 came out about

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.030 
things in the 600 the 600 came out about
I'd<00:00:39.790> say<00:00:39.820> year<00:00:40.420> ago<00:00:40.690> which<00:00:41.290> is<00:00:41.320> a<00:00:41.470> really<00:00:41.710> fast

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
I'd say year ago which is a really fast

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.000 
I'd say year ago which is a really fast
turnaround<00:00:42.550> for<00:00:42.790> this<00:00:43.180> camera<00:00:43.480> but<00:00:44.350> it's

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
turnaround for this camera but it's

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.740 
turnaround for this camera but it's
addressing<00:00:45.430> one<00:00:45.820> huge<00:00:46.090> issue<00:00:46.269> and<00:00:46.510> that<00:00:46.540> was

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
addressing one huge issue and that was

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.330 
addressing one huge issue and that was
the<00:00:46.840> oil<00:00:47.110> dust<00:00:47.530> spots<00:00:47.739> and<00:00:47.980> everything<00:00:48.220> that

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
the oil dust spots and everything that

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.150 
the oil dust spots and everything that
that<00:00:48.519> sensor<00:00:49.000> had<00:00:49.210> in<00:00:49.449> the<00:00:49.570> 600<00:00:50.080> so<00:00:50.470> pretty

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
that sensor had in the 600 so pretty

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.040 
that sensor had in the 600 so pretty
much<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.519> main<00:00:51.640> point<00:00:51.940> of<00:00:52.059> this<00:00:52.239> 610<00:00:52.840> the

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
much the main point of this 610 the

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.829 
much the main point of this 610 the
nikon<00:00:53.379> d610<00:00:53.830> is<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.550> just<00:00:54.760> address<00:00:55.390> this<00:00:55.629> issue

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
nikon d610 is to just address this issue

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:57.869 
nikon d610 is to just address this issue
fix<00:00:56.559> it<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:56.890> move<00:00:56.980> on<00:00:57.129> from<00:00:57.280> there<00:00:57.460> they<00:00:57.700> get<00:00:57.850> a

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
fix it and move on from there they get a

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.780 
fix it and move on from there they get a
couple<00:00:58.210> slight<00:00:58.450> things<00:00:58.719> and<00:00:59.079> as<00:00:59.890> I<00:01:00.070> said<00:01:00.280> all

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
couple slight things and as I said all

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.310 
couple slight things and as I said all
the<00:01:00.910> specs<00:01:01.210> are<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.510> same<00:01:01.719> and<00:01:01.960> if<00:01:02.079> you've

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
the specs are the same and if you've

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.690 
the specs are the same and if you've
seen<00:01:02.500> them<00:01:02.680> out<00:01:02.829> I<00:01:02.860> guess<00:01:03.190> I'll<00:01:03.309> put<00:01:03.460> him<00:01:03.550> up<00:01:03.610> on

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
seen them out I guess I'll put him up on

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.400 
seen them out I guess I'll put him up on
screen<00:01:03.910> there<00:01:04.420> are<00:01:04.509> really<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:04.930> same<00:01:04.960> there's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
screen there are really the same there's

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.810 
screen there are really the same there's
a<00:01:05.470> couple<00:01:05.740> quick<00:01:05.860> things<00:01:05.920> I<00:01:06.220> said<00:01:06.399> I'm<00:01:06.580> the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
a couple quick things I said I'm the

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.840 
a couple quick things I said I'm the
frames<00:01:07.420> per<00:01:07.630> second<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.140> d600<00:01:08.950> day<00:01:09.070> at<00:01:09.130> 5.5

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
frames per second the d600 day at 5.5

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.300 
frames per second the d600 day at 5.5
frames<00:01:10.119> per<00:01:10.300> second<00:01:10.720> and<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.350> 610<00:01:11.770> does<00:01:11.979> six

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
frames per second and the 610 does six

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.550 
frames per second and the 610 does six
so<00:01:12.610> you're<00:01:13.509> not<00:01:13.720> really<00:01:13.960> getting<00:01:14.170> a<00:01:14.350> huge

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
so you're not really getting a huge

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.139 
so you're not really getting a huge
improvement<00:01:14.830> there<00:01:15.160> you're<00:01:15.729> getting<00:01:15.820> better

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
improvement there you're getting better

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.240 
improvement there you're getting better
wetter<00:01:16.420> weather<00:01:16.899> sealing<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.619> it's<00:01:17.770> from<00:01:18.100> the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
wetter weather sealing and it's from the

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.730 
wetter weather sealing and it's from the
d800<00:01:19.030> I<00:01:19.119> think<00:01:19.360> they're<00:01:19.509> using<00:01:19.840> so<00:01:20.410> I<00:01:20.440> guess

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
d800 I think they're using so I guess

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.080 
d800 I think they're using so I guess
that's<00:01:20.979> an<00:01:21.160> improvement<00:01:21.399> but<00:01:21.700> one<00:01:21.789> of<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:21.940> new

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
that's an improvement but one of the new

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.900 
that's an improvement but one of the new
things<00:01:22.119> is<00:01:22.539> this<00:01:22.720> new<00:01:22.990> quieter<00:01:23.670> nesting<00:01:24.670> mode

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
things is this new quieter nesting mode

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.779 
things is this new quieter nesting mode
which<00:01:25.509> basically<00:01:25.899> it's<00:01:26.680> just<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.220> new<00:01:27.369> mode

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
which basically it's just a new mode

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.160 
which basically it's just a new mode
it's<00:01:28.030> just<00:01:28.180> a<00:01:28.270> new<00:01:28.390> silent<00:01:28.840> mode<00:01:28.959> they're

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
it's just a new silent mode they're

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.109 
it's just a new silent mode they're
trying<00:01:29.440> out<00:01:29.679> and<00:01:29.860> it<00:01:30.310> can<00:01:30.459> do<00:01:30.580> it<00:01:30.729> at<00:01:30.849> three

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
trying out and it can do it at three

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.969 
trying out and it can do it at three
frames<00:01:31.330> per<00:01:31.479> second<00:01:31.840> instead<00:01:32.020> of<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.259> six<00:01:32.500> so

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
frames per second instead of the six so

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.020 
frames per second instead of the six so
instead<00:01:33.220> of<00:01:33.280> hearing<00:01:33.520> she<00:01:34.270> might<00:01:34.420> hear

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
instead of hearing she might hear

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.800 
instead of hearing she might hear
probably<00:01:37.030> going<00:01:37.179> to<00:01:37.240> be<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.390> same<00:01:37.539> thing<00:01:37.750> I

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
probably going to be the same thing I

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.730 
probably going to be the same thing I
know<00:01:37.929> one<00:01:38.050> of<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.170> most<00:01:38.349> disappointing

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
know one of the most disappointing

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.380 
know one of the most disappointing
factors<00:01:39.160> for<00:01:39.310> people<00:01:39.580> that<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:39.880> does<00:01:40.060> not<00:01:40.179> have

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
factors for people that it does not have

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.990 
factors for people that it does not have
built-in<00:01:40.780> GPS<00:01:41.259> or<00:01:41.440> built-in<00:01:41.770> Wi-Fi<00:01:41.979> they<00:01:42.759> can

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
built-in GPS or built-in Wi-Fi they can

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.609 
built-in GPS or built-in Wi-Fi they can
