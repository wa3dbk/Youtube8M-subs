00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.679
 alpha is zero

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.660
 that if but I do not have a business that you 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.560

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.880
 to make portions of your name let us 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.200
 comments 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:19.500
 Why is it a sin to want to surrender stone? 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:25.110
 redstone doing things is automatically 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:30.540
 minecraft to almost anything without a rule 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.570
 stone will take on a new dimension that will 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.170
 to be called the dimension of the dream 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.530
 on energy Hadrian's going to be a 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.180
 I'm going to bring a video when I have 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.649
 to 0 for example brings the video as if 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.350
 was doing 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.840
 is this dimension to this portal 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.009
 hurry dimension in this dimension that put 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.240
 dragons 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.540
 the cows dinosaurs will fly defendant 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:02.369
 red will know how to give it to you 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.130
 ride the dragons will goes all yours 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.039
 different body will change your inventory 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.140
 the armor 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:15.750
 but if a dimension 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:19.110
 will also have it in diogo fink that will 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.260
 have endeavour eyes to put it 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.690
 ethics will have the address of the water one 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.720
 A doubt on twitter 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.110
 I do not even know yet some say yes 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:36.000
 some said that it will not take Daniel 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.040
 they did not want on twitter if they will have more 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.600
 The only thing I heard is that some 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.030
 people speaking there are people I met 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.510
 tommaso daniel said he was going to have to 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:55.140
 give a proof stayed in the same 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:58.920
 will also have new furniture with is the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:05.580
 dreams will have guardians will have a 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:14.570
 horse will have strength underneath 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:17.790
 with guardians and will also have 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:21.269
 to invent I think it will change and 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.340
 another doubt the inventory will change 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:27.450
 I think it 's because some people 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.890
 say yes or no other doubt there 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.750
 it's already a doubt 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:37.079
 Something else that will have it again goes 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.400
 to have anke box 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.730
 mourning 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.019
 that music box did not press and 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.170
 going to have music in the game is going to be a thing 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:54.500
 good will have commanded the commands of 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:04:07.109
 minecraft guarantee death of someone 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:11.299
 was a good thing and also before me 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.299
 I think it will take 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:23.000
 look it's d-edge stone block that we take 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:29.810
 jhonny one thing very ball show that 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:33.889
 will also have is that it will have the date of 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:38.000
 launch date and release date 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:41.510
 This is a good question, folks. 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.110
 the release date will be more or 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.410
 least launched towards the end of October or 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.410
 November 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:05:09.590
 developers taking daniel are 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:05:15.220
 placing at the end of October or 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.220
 November but will not have any news 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:34.150
 Everyone doubts that I 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:34.150
 I get to get 0 13 zero point without 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:43.010
 Look, it's a good question. 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:46.070
 today this thing they use with the 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:50.450
 developers of the weaker 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:54.460
 they ask a child and I and they do 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:06:00.530
 some versions of tests for example in 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:04.540
 2011 has a channel on youtube going to the 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:08.020
 people look at you by audi 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.720
 everything and that's it 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:15.610
 It's one more thing everyone wanted. 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.920
 know about zero point 12.0 in the language 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.250
 that has been so far is exactly 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.830
 I think it does not have a good and 3 is 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:29.050
 practically to launch this week the 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:32.830
 original version is this 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:35.590
 the doubts what is to launch what will you 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.570
 he took out he will have more boxing partners 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.080
 At most, things will be much more. 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:44.220
 new videos etc 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.780
