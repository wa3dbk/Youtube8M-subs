00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
Four from back in 2005 I think but just

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.270 
Four from back in 2005 I think but just
because<00:01:47.630> they<00:01:47.840> had<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.080> very<00:01:48.500> good<00:01:48.770> mid-major

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280

team<00:01:49.610> Kansas<00:01:50.150> State<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:50.750> think<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.050> way<00:01:51.170> they

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
team Kansas State I think the way they

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.889 
team Kansas State I think the way they
play<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.830> toughness<00:01:52.250> if<00:01:52.399> I<00:01:52.520> think<00:01:52.790> that<00:01:52.970> Jay

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
play the toughness if I think that Jay

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.630 
play the toughness if I think that Jay
could<00:01:54.080> pull<00:01:54.290> him<00:01:54.410> if<00:01:54.649> he<00:01:54.770> plays<00:01:55.009> well<00:01:55.280> yeah

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640
