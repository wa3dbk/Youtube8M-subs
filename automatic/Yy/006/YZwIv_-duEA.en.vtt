00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
deal what the lock washer does is it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.820 
deal what the lock washer does is it
bites<00:01:55.970> into<00:01:56.270> whatever<00:01:56.720> you<00:01:56.960> type<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.350> down<00:01:57.560> to

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
bites into whatever you type it down to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.310 
bites into whatever you type it down to
so<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.310> isolates<00:01:58.820> movement<00:01:59.420> so<00:01:59.689> you<00:02:00.020> put<00:02:00.200> the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
so it isolates movement so you put the

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.770 
so it isolates movement so you put the
lock<00:02:00.530> washer<00:02:00.770> as<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:01.970> last<00:02:02.180> thing<00:02:02.510> on<00:02:02.689> the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
lock washer as the last thing on the
