00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the days of me trying to conform to

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.660 
the days of me trying to conform to
society's<00:01:34.049> or<00:01:34.560> dare<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> say<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.430> natural

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
society's or dare I say that natural

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.940 
society's or dare I say that natural
hair<00:01:36.119> community<00:01:36.320> standard<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.770> what

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
hair community standard of what

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.069 
hair community standard of what
beautiful<00:01:38.220> hair<00:01:38.579> as<00:01:38.790> I've<00:01:39.390> said<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
beautiful hair as I've said this a

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.960 
beautiful hair as I've said this a
million<00:01:40.350> times<00:01:40.470> before<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.790> that

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
million times before but I think that

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.090 
million times before but I think that
it's<00:01:42.119> definitely<00:01:42.479> worth<00:01:42.840> repeating<00:01:43.350> part<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
it's definitely worth repeating part of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.499 
it's definitely worth repeating part of
being<00:01:44.310> natural<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.790> permitting<00:01:45.210> our<00:01:45.270> hair<00:01:45.420> to

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
being natural is permitting our hair to

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.630 
being natural is permitting our hair to
do<00:01:45.659> what<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.869> does<00:01:46.020> naturally<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.460> all

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
do what it does naturally and so all

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.460 
do what it does naturally and so all
this<00:01:47.759> extra<00:01:48.180> time<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.840> effort<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.439> put

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
this extra time and effort that we put

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.649 
this extra time and effort that we put
into<00:01:49.920> making<00:01:50.189> our<00:01:50.640> hair<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:51.149> something<00:01:51.540> that

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
into making our hair be something that

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.100 
into making our hair be something that
it's<00:01:51.810> not

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
it's not

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.499 
it's not
is<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.890> complete<00:01:53.430> waste<00:01:53.640> then<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.180> took<00:01:54.360> me

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
is a complete waste then it took me

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.240 
is a complete waste then it took me
almost<00:01:54.720> two<00:01:55.049> years<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.409> figure<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:55.799> but

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
almost two years to figure that out but

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.830 
almost two years to figure that out but
