total bitch to get out I'm not gonna be

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.539 
total bitch to get out I'm not gonna be
able<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.590> get<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.799> out<00:02:18.889> without<00:02:19.040> getting<00:02:19.280> more

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
able to get it out without getting more

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.120 
able to get it out without getting more
tools<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:19.910> there<00:02:20.060> but<00:02:20.209> that's<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.780> idea<00:02:24.130> it

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
tools in there but that's the idea it

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.360 
tools in there but that's the idea it
prematurely<00:02:25.730> ejected<00:02:26.630> itself<00:02:29.889> she's<00:02:30.889> out<00:02:31.099> and

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
prematurely ejected itself she's out and

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.030 
prematurely ejected itself she's out and
that<00:02:32.209> changes<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.720> pivot<00:02:33.109> point<00:02:33.380> which<00:02:33.739> makes

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
that changes the pivot point which makes
