one of the lenses if I broke it today I

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.520 
one of the lenses if I broke it today I
would<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.689> go<00:01:42.810> ahead<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.020> buy

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
would have to just go ahead and buy

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.859 
would have to just go ahead and buy
another<00:01:43.680> one<00:01:44.040> within<00:01:44.280> 24<00:01:44.759> hours<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.210> need<00:01:45.720> this

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
another one within 24 hours I need this

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.539 
another one within 24 hours I need this
length<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.649> by<00:01:46.770> far<00:01:46.799> my<00:01:47.070> favorite<00:01:47.340> lines

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
length this is by far my favorite lines

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.670 
length this is by far my favorite lines
and<00:01:47.850> I've<00:01:47.970> owned<00:01:48.210> I've<00:01:49.020> owned<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.439> 50

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
and I've owned I've owned the 50

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.770 
and I've owned I've owned the 50
millimeter<00:01:50.070> 1.2<00:01:51.320> I<00:01:52.320> returned<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.250> because<00:01:53.780> I

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
millimeter 1.2 I returned it because I

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.560 
millimeter 1.2 I returned it because I
felt<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.590> know<00:01:55.740> between<00:01:55.979> these<00:01:56.399> two<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
felt that you know between these two the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.200 
felt that you know between these two the
250<00:01:57.990> millimeter<00:01:58.350> 1.2<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.100> one<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.640> prefer

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
250 millimeter 1.2 and this one I prefer

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.420 
250 millimeter 1.2 and this one I prefer
this<00:02:00.570> one<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.200> now<00:02:01.380> if<00:02:01.770> you're<00:02:01.950> wondering<00:02:01.979> why

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
this one so now if you're wondering why

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.240 
this one so now if you're wondering why
the<00:02:02.490> shot<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.299> wider<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.350> because<00:02:04.770> now<00:02:05.009> we're

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the shot is wider it's because now we're

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.789 
the shot is wider it's because now we're
using<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.700> 35-millimeter<00:02:06.320> same<00:02:07.320> position<00:02:07.710> as

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
using a 35-millimeter same position as

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.390 
using a 35-millimeter same position as
the<00:02:07.860> 24<00:02:08.310> millimeter<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.819> want<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.030> compare

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
the 24 millimeter if you want to compare

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.280 
the 24 millimeter if you want to compare
no<00:02:11.400> actually<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.239> didn't<00:02:12.510> shoot<00:02:12.720> wide<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
no actually we didn't shoot wide on the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.990 
no actually we didn't shoot wide on the
24<00:02:13.680> millimeter<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.400> won't<00:02:14.550> be<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.700> good

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
24 millimeter so that won't be a good

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.830 
24 millimeter so that won't be a good
comparison<00:02:15.620> anyway<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:18.420> now<00:02:18.540> we're<00:02:18.690> talking

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
comparison anyway so now we're talking

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.600 
comparison anyway so now we're talking
about<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.020> 24<00:02:19.379> to<00:02:19.470> 70<00:02:19.770> millimeter<00:02:20.129> lens<00:02:20.340> and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
about the 24 to 70 millimeter lens and

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.089 
about the 24 to 70 millimeter lens and
this<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.510> by<00:02:21.660> far<00:02:21.870> my<00:02:21.930> go-to<00:02:22.290> lens<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:22.830> event

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
this is by far my go-to lens for event

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.550 
this is by far my go-to lens for event
photography<00:02:23.640> when<00:02:24.360> coupled<00:02:24.720> with<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.900> mar<00:02:25.080> 31

cannon<00:02:30.569> go<00:02:31.170> for<00:02:31.379> this<00:02:31.440> length<00:02:31.680> right<00:02:31.800> here

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
cannon go for this length right here

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.820 
cannon go for this length right here
because<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.360> cover<00:02:33.569> all<00:02:33.660> ranges<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.590> got<00:02:34.739> the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
because you cover all ranges you got the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.339 
because you cover all ranges you got the
wide<00:02:35.010> shot<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.269> get<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.750> whole<00:02:36.900> room<00:02:37.140> if

millimeters for video is an awesome lens
because<00:02:48.239> like<00:02:48.599> i<00:02:48.690> said<00:02:48.720> before<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.230> gets<00:02:49.379> wide

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
because like i said before it gets wide

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.740 
because like i said before it gets wide
i'm<00:02:50.129> at<00:02:50.310> 24<00:02:50.730> millimeters<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.300> can<00:02:51.420> actually

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
other when doing interviews and that's

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.370 
other when doing interviews and that's
that<00:05:33.850> closed-end<00:05:34.510> shot<00:05:34.810> when<00:05:34.960> you<00:05:34.990> get<00:05:35.140> real

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.590 
that closed-end shot when you get real
tight<00:05:35.830> on<00:05:36.040> the<00:05:36.100> subjects<00:05:36.460> face<00:05:36.640> you<00:05:37.240> blurt<00:05:37.479> a

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
tight on the subjects face you blurt a

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.110 
tight on the subjects face you blurt a
backdrop<00:05:38.080> and<00:05:38.400> you<00:05:39.400> did<00:05:39.610> all<00:05:39.760> you<00:05:39.880> see<00:05:40.000> is<00:05:40.090> the

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
backdrop and you did all you see is the

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.790 
backdrop and you did all you see is the
subjects<00:05:40.510> face<00:05:40.660> it's<00:05:41.020> real<00:05:41.320> cool<00:05:41.500> for<00:05:41.710> that

subjects face it's real cool for that
too<00:05:42.040> but<00:05:42.370> i<00:05:42.580> think<00:05:42.850> by<00:05:42.970> far<00:05:43.000> this<00:05:43.360> is<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:43.860> best
