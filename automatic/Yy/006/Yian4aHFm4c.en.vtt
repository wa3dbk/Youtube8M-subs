00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 all right 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.700
 for the high consumption of beverages 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.710
 energizers ensuring that there is a lot 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.720
 propaganda that exists about their 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.640
 apparent virtues and almost null 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.279
 information that is provided about their 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.110
 dangers and contraindications 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.360
 energy drinks are drinks without 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.310
 alcohol and stimulants they offer 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.310
 supposed regenerative virtues of the 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.349
 fatigue and exhaustion these drinks in 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.880
 they do not manage to eliminate the 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.280
 physical exhaustion or exhaustion 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.840
 muscle something that can only be achieved 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.750
 with rest and hours of sleep 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.609
 necessary its main component is the 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.530
 caffeine so they can create 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.570
 dependence on the consumer 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.579
 they are often used as substitutes 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.960
 of water without having properties 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.780
 moisturizers causing disorders 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.390
 physical and sometimes irrecoverable damage 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.219
 by chronic dehydration another great 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.230
 danger is associated to its mixture with 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.749
 alcoholic drinks 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.289
 energizers are stimulants and 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:05.360
 depressive alcoholics their mixture inhibits 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.700
 the effect of alcohol increasing its 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.590
 I consume the effects of these drinks 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.810
 depend on the susceptibility of 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.260
 consumer but it has been proven that after 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.880
 several 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.520
 hours of consumption cause pain of 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.180
 head hypertension tachycardia 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.830
 arterial vomiting and hyperactivity between 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.420
 other evils 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.640
 but here is doctor antonio 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.860
 us to clarify how 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.530
 dangerous is to consume these calls 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.480
 energy drinks is serious as well 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.540
 have said in the presentation is 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.860
 really worrying because 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.150
 mainly these companies now 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.460
 they are unfortunately objectified not 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.740
 are trying from your target is 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.840
 just the young people are going to have 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.190
 a lot of these propaganda of companies 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.640
 who make energy drinks in 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.430
 sporting events in marathons and so on 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.470
 are trying to symbolize energy with 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.030
 the consumption of these are the substances 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.920
 chemical the chemical components of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.780
 this loss is simply caffeine 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.430
 it's simply caffeine that's why it's 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.640
 very important that our viewers 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.619
 understand what is the proportions 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.720
 that we are driving here I do not want 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.050
 devilish any of these drinks 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.430
 energizers because they really are not 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.590
 excessively dangerous and are 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.720
 allowed its consumption however by 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.850
 example a coffee pour that is more or 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.280
 less what of what they take several 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.440
 people contains about 70 milligrams of 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.330
 caffeine this coffee house that we 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.400
 we usually take in the mornings 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.050
 many of the people contains about 30 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.750
 milligrams of caffeine American coffee 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.240
 as we say here in florida is 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.880
 approximately 60 milligrams good 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.360
 a little bit of this is like taking two 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.820
 washings and half whole 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.220
 and a can of little tail is almost 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.530
 comparable to an equal cup of coffee 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.290
 that a can of Persian the one can of 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.330
 these glue substances now there in 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.980
 this there are proportions when we take 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.870
 suddenly a number of these 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.510
 substances that say that hard energy 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.940
 seven hours really what we want a 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.430
 state of anxiety very often it 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.680
 sees that patients the consumers of 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.470
 these substances have declared that 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.380
 have jitters nervousness can you 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.400
 give headache palpitations 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.350
 tachycardia which is the acceleration of 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.060
 rhythm of the heart and can even 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.550
 lead to arrhythmia this is very 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.800
 well published in medicine that can 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.500
 occur cardiac arrhythmias due to the use 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.230
 excessive caffeine mixed with alcohol 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.180
 these energy drinks or with other 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.100
 stimulating substances which ones 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.470
 it would be the consequences is a bomb 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.510
 oscar de amanece there is one of these 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.070
 substances that is called b-52 the name 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.510
 of a bomber bomber and I think 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.600
 which is a very appropriate thing because 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.100
 really this can create the effects 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.700
 adverse then of two substances 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.160
 chemical that of accord and coffee 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.930
 the redbook has about 80 milligrams of 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.569
 caffeine which is like taking a wash 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.069
 at a stroke this really is hard can 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.550
 stomach pain and it has an effect 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.860
 in the stomach muscle that controls 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.930
 the rise of the acids so that 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.390
 the acids rise in the stomach in the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.890
 stomach that is called sphincter 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.150
 gastroesophageal and this is what the 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.890
 redbull 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.260
 all the substances that 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.180
 they contain caffeine is to relax this 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.889
 muscle and therefore the acids rise 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.650
 that gives a tremendous annoyance here that 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.570
 many people who drink coffee know that 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.300
 it's an effect of gastric reflux 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.220
 Gastroesophageal reflux damages the 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.229
 vocal cords can damage the strings 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.930
 vowels can carry the esophagus to 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.240
 changes that are called metaplasia can 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.840
 that the pre -cancer state of 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.639
 esophagus 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.370
 there are people who take this for later 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.410
 due to the famous hanover as 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.060
 can counteract the hangover 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.040
 the best thing is to prevent it is not to have 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.770
 hangover not drinking alcohol the truth 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.690
 but in this case I have to join the 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.820
 Dominicans and I have to join the 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.620
 Cubans who sometimes used the torpor of 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.530
 next day or the ajiaco or the sancocho 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.780
 that really is a drink that has a 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.850
 liquid of course is a drink that 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.240
 It is taken with a spoon but it is taken in a 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.400
 cup but contains protein and contains 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.199
 also a large amount of electrolytes 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.490
 about sodium and potassium that what 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.260
 it means then that the hangover is 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.470
 a dehydration 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.419
 the hangover produces the effect of the flame 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.970
 it's an alcohol effect 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.190
 it is immediate abstinence from alcohol 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.080
 and a side effect of the 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.270
 deprivation of brain and organism 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.280
 alcohol linked with adverse effects that 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.810
 is for example stomach pain by 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.729
 the acute gastritis that the 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.889
 alcohol to do to recover the 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.720
 lost energy this is a very 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.100
 important and is perhaps the goal 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.750
 because so many people are using 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.240
 these car 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.860
 and there are two things here key people 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.750
 they think there's a thing called 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.640
 chronic fatigue which is what they have 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.230
 because they feel tired several days 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.460
 there are people who feel tired 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.410
 when they wake up in the morning 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.900
 exact and this may be in relation 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.300
 with an exhaustion it is in 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.100
 association with sleep problems by 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.960
 example there are people who do not sleep well 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.460
 they stop breathing intermittently 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.410
 when less 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.250
 leslie turner called area of ​​the 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.810
 dream and this can produce not only 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.480
 tiredness but pressure headache 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.040
 high palpitation depression produces 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.020
 also that there is a depression 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.669
 These are causes of exhaustion of 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.570
 secondary fatigue that are the most 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.950
 frequent anemia depression cancer 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.630
 thyroid problems when a 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.120
 person feels that way he should see his 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:31.660
 doctor should not be chronically using 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.940
 energy drinks it is normal to feel 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.950
 tired when waking up it is normal to oscar 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.800
 to some extent the process of 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:41.050
 wake up again a switch of honor not 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.820
 it's a good light switch is a 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.040
 process that takes several minutes there 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.760
 people who take up to half an hour 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.220
 one hour 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.840
 they are wide awake and sometimes 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.550
 Answer clear while more you 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.930
 rest earlier in the night and 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.640
 the more you lie down away from the 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.520
 midnight is to go at 10 o'clock at night 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.280
 the 9 freshest ones get up by 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.320
 the morning because in great the system 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.320
 of the production organism of 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.270
 steroid hormones what they call the 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.390
 old clock accurate biological clock is not 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.010
 it's the same minus 8 hours from 12 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.510
 from night until 9 in the morning that 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.550
 from 2000 to from 10 to 6 that 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.240
 we do when we are tired to the 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.880
 half day 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.430
 I think that the best Oscar is the ideal 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.840
 is what is called an app payment that 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.700
 Americans say it's a nap 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.290
 cut clear this sometimes is impossible 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.690
 but there are places in the world where you are 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.640
 making effective to the Spaniards in 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.350
 Latin America have more reason than in 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.330
 they think it's a destiny is a thing 

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.220
 natural camilo josé cela called him to the 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.990
 Iberian yoga party I think so 

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.600
 I think that's fantastic but what 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.460
 ideal is to take a break from about 

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.350
