 more than you want the mambo 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.100

 magnets or blue or green depends on the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.340

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.210
 when exactly one week ago 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.910
 the navel served a week in a vote 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.110

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.730
 she sees it raining and she was fascinated watching 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.850
 in the window but I can not 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.100
 explain the fixation that I had him 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.290
 He was turning and bolt 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:58.890
 the letter again sound also the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.750
 organist to film more or less look at the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.480
 first month very difficult to organize 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.690

 this milk is family in xalapa super 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.330
 I recommend breast milk 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:38.250
 in cheap as more state opens up for 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.800
 the practice is to lose weight 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.870
 immediately the recovery many 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.640
 Thanks again and both alike 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.640
 the time more water exactly the same 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:56.220
 but one month if the army and there is not 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.140
 little belly of thanks but you have to 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.610
 recover the muscle remember that it is 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.470
 all your stretched 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.960
 it's a process but you've been 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.790
 Exactly the same, this is to prove 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.460
 that if you take care of the food in the 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.010
 pregnancy if they do not gain more than what 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:16.680
 you have to get fat for your baby you're going to 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:19.470
 get to your clothes of the smallest 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.380
 you're also right, look at me 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.170
 I raised 25 pounds in pregnancy 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.500
 water is food from drinking it is already 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.290
 normal when I came out of labor they weighed 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.020
 nine pounds more than what I already 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.790
 like 'I started in nobody fattened nine 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.710
 pounds right now I do not know how much weight the 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.380
 it's true that he does not give me the homework 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.620
 matter if you can feed a 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.210
 lots and half but you have to eat 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.090
 because they are feeding their baby 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.640
 then it's getting hot and she's 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.350
 exactly to eat enough protein 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.250
 When you say you eat, you eat 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:05:02.970
 pretty but he was older and he's like 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:05.010
 not desserts and right now they enjoyed it yesterday 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.350
 had the one to tell him with breast milk 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.480
 also she has free demand in 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.460
 feeding because it's breast milk if 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.460
 We talk right now talking alavÃ©s 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.400
 good thing about breast milk 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.710
 now I can speak it properly the one of 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:30.030
 thank God and nature is 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:35.120
 super healthy and the doctor says that if the 25 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:39.600
 percent of women breastfeeds 75 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:42.120
 that's what we're talking about the benefits 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:47.240
 for one breast that are very many the 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.240
 green lament incredible health 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.890
 and then come and check and dads that 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.170
 they are three Goth dads tells me look at the 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.390
 first two we had chest to the other no 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.550
 I made the difference of the quality of 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.680
 health of children 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.320
 I can not compare I have a Saturday of 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.440
 a year that there was a lot of side she 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.260
 He decided to leave the chest and was when and 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.710
 he decided to leave it said no I do not want 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:19.440
 summary and I tell you his Greek person 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.690
 raisins that moves there are women who are going 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.900
 better than others maybe I have gone 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.229
 well because that's how he learned it 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.090
 but they start at sea and it's much more 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:33.900
 gratifying that the fact of taking my 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:37.500
 milk the bond that forms between me 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:40.080
 is in charge with the injury that I had 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:46.740
 than to give the formula beginning because in 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:48.570
 the hospital were formulas and in it is 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.490
 that looks like the monologue of 'baby 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.960
 boom 'the breasts are meant to 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.960
 first place to the child 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.139
 because that for him he visited but there 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:10.889
 to give him credit he helps you when 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:12.180
 will give birth to someone but not 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.550
 I want to give because I do not want to be 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.280
 ruin like this is not choose not 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:21.900
 exercises that you can do to 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.580
 keep it firm and blinked I do not know I do not know 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.199

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.780
 Magnet active exercises are 

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:29.310
 also if you use creams or know a 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.560
 set of pile of things that do not 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:39.500
 I should leave the bust so there's no 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:39.500
 no longer no longer thank you
