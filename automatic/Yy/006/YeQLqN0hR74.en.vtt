37<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.860> high<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> pistol<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.570> oh<00:01:07.020> yeah

37 can I high for a pistol and oh yeah
now<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.070> why<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:09.030> uses<00:01:09.450> dot<00:01:09.689> 45<00:01:10.290> /<00:01:11.070> 70<00:01:11.970> g

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
now I see why it uses dot 45 / 70 g

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.149 
now I see why it uses dot 45 / 70 g
round<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.020> that's<00:01:13.799> probably<00:01:14.310> why<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.570> I'm<00:01:16.320> not

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
round so that's probably why and I'm not

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.190 
round so that's probably why and I'm not
completely<00:01:17.610> sure<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.600> mod<00:01:18.900> this
