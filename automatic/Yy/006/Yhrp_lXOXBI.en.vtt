00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
I think I just really enjoy making

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.830 
I think I just really enjoy making
things<00:00:29.460> I've<00:00:29.670> always<00:00:30.060> I've<00:00:30.330> always<00:00:30.630> made

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
things I've always I've always made

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
pots or whatever it happens to be

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.670 
pots or whatever it happens to be
we're<00:00:39.600> predominantly<00:00:40.140> known<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.500> bags

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
we're predominantly known for the bags

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.700 
we're predominantly known for the bags
that<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:40.980> do<00:00:41.130> we<00:00:41.910> do<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.060> lot<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.390> everyday<00:00:43.350> bags

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
that we do we do a lot of everyday bags

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.740 
that we do we do a lot of everyday bags
so<00:00:44.160> one<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> big<00:00:45.000> things<00:00:45.210> we're<00:00:45.360> known<00:00:45.510> for

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
so one of the big things we're known for

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.290 
so one of the big things we're known for
is<00:00:45.960> developing<00:00:46.860> hand<00:00:47.489> wax<00:00:47.610> treatment<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
is developing hand wax treatment like a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.440 
is developing hand wax treatment like a
hand<00:00:48.450> wax<00:00:48.570> canvas<00:00:48.900> so<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> fiber<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.730> it's

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
hand wax canvas so the fiber it's it's

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.930 
hand wax canvas so the fiber it's it's
both<00:00:51.780> water<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.200> soil<00:00:52.530> resistant<00:00:55.940> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
both water and soil resistant and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.060 
both water and soil resistant and
everything<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.420> might<00:00:57.630> you<00:00:57.840> make<00:00:58.200> I<00:00:58.470> I

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
everything that might you make I I

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.049 
everything that might you make I I
developed<00:00:59.579> from<00:00:59.790> the<00:01:00.720> beginning<00:01:01.430> so<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.969> not

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
developed from the beginning so it's not

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.670 
developed from the beginning so it's not
only<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.540> pattern<00:01:03.870> drafting<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
only just the pattern drafting and the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.810 
only just the pattern drafting and the
design<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.460> really<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.790> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
design of it but it really is a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.120 
design of it but it really is a
development<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> process<00:01:07.079> and<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.619> think

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
development of the process and I think

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.320 
development of the process and I think
that's<00:01:08.250> something<00:01:08.399> that<00:01:08.549> really<00:01:08.850> needs<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.240> be

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that's something that really needs to be

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
that's something that really needs to be
done<00:01:09.630> entirely<00:01:10.290> in-house<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.920> order<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> have

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
done entirely in-house in order to have

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.970 
done entirely in-house in order to have
a<00:01:11.340> well-designed<00:01:11.850> product

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.300 

I<00:01:17.040> think<00:01:17.760> I<00:01:17.880> always<00:01:18.300> knew<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.720> was<00:01:19.310> gonna

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
I think I always knew that I was gonna

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.680 
I think I always knew that I was gonna
make<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> go<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.210> don't<00:01:21.420> think<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.660> ever

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
make a go of it I don't think I ever

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.090 
make a go of it I don't think I ever
started<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.470> wasn't<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.800> was<00:01:22.890> one<00:01:23.010> of

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
started out it wasn't it was one of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.380 
started out it wasn't it was one of
those<00:01:23.160> things<00:01:23.430> where<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.640> started<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.240> made

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
those things where I started out I made

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.000 
those things where I started out I made
a<00:01:24.420> bag<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.810> was<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> hobby<00:01:25.170> my<00:01:25.410> friend<00:01:25.650> liked<00:01:25.830> it

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
a bag it was a hobby my friend liked it

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.110 
a bag it was a hobby my friend liked it
wasn't<00:01:26.340> anything<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.030> was

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
wasn't anything like that it was

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.300 
wasn't anything like that it was
literally<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> when<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.380> first<00:01:28.470> started<00:01:28.980> I<00:01:29.130> knew

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
literally I when I first started I knew

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.730 
literally I when I first started I knew
that<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.520> had<00:01:29.820> started<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.140> intent<00:01:31.530> of

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that I had started it with the intent of

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.440 
that I had started it with the intent of
being<00:01:32.040> able<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.370> really<00:01:32.670> develop<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.090> studio

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
being able to really develop a studio

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.730 
being able to really develop a studio
where<00:01:33.660> I<00:01:33.690> could<00:01:34.020> develop<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.410> work<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.710> I

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
where I could develop the work that I

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.010 
where I could develop the work that I
wanted<00:01:34.980> to<00:01:35.070> develop<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:36.930> so

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
wanted to develop and it just so

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.360 
wanted to develop and it just so
happened<00:01:37.410> that<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.530> medium<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.010> I<00:01:38.070> picked

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
happened that the medium that I picked

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.000 
happened that the medium that I picked
in<00:01:38.730> this<00:01:38.970> instance<00:01:39.450> was<00:01:39.900> textiles

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
in this instance was textiles

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.920 
in this instance was textiles
I<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.730> want<00:01:41.910> to<00:01:41.970> craft<00:01:42.180> all<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> things<00:01:42.780> in

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
I just want to craft all the things in

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.110 
I just want to craft all the things in
my<00:01:42.960> life<00:01:43.440> is<00:01:43.530> essentially<00:01:44.070> what<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.550> yeah<00:01:44.880> I

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.900 
my life is essentially what it is yeah I
like<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.450> idea<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.780> being<00:01:45.990> able<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.910> develop

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
like the idea of being able to develop

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.080 
like the idea of being able to develop
things<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.410> know<00:01:49.760> just<00:01:50.760> create<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
things that you know just create a

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.800 
things that you know just create a
beautiful<00:01:51.210> life<00:01:51.600> freely<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> when<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.510> working

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
beautiful life freely so when we working

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.760 
beautiful life freely so when we working
on<00:01:57.870> a<00:01:57.900> leather<00:01:58.080> bag<00:01:58.320> what<00:01:58.530> would<00:01:58.650> you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
on a leather bag what would you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.580 
on a leather bag what would you
initially<00:01:59.580> is<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.360> leather<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.750> all<00:02:00.960> hand<00:02:01.350> cut

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
initially is the leather is all hand cut

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.770 
initially is the leather is all hand cut
we<00:02:02.310> can't<00:02:02.730> use<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> machine<00:02:03.300> to<00:02:03.420> cut<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.690> like

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
we can't use the machine to cut it like

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.160 
we can't use the machine to cut it like
we<00:02:04.080> typically<00:02:04.680> work<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.070> textile<00:02:05.640> based<00:02:05.850> bags

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
we typically work in textile based bags

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.040 
we typically work in textile based bags
what<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.260> have<00:02:07.410> to<00:02:07.530> do<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:08.570> mark<00:02:09.570> each<00:02:09.750> pattern

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
what we have to do is mark each pattern

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.140 
what we have to do is mark each pattern
on<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.590> skin<00:02:10.860> based<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.430> where<00:02:11.760> there<00:02:12.030> are

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
on the skin based on where there are

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.300 
on the skin based on where there are
flaws<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.750> skin<00:02:12.960> and<00:02:13.140> what<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.410> best<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
flaws in the skin and what the best the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.250 
flaws in the skin and what the best the
the<00:02:14.550> best<00:02:14.730> part<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.210> skin<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.750> use<00:02:15.960> and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
the best part of the skin is to use and

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.990 
the best part of the skin is to use and
then<00:02:16.620> each<00:02:16.800> piece<00:02:17.100> is<00:02:17.310> traced<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.880> then

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
then each piece is traced and then

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.540 
then each piece is traced and then
hand-cut<00:02:18.800> after<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:19.980> we<00:02:20.100> will<00:02:20.250> end<00:02:20.430> up

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
hand-cut after that we will end up

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.490 
hand-cut after that we will end up
working<00:02:20.910> on<00:02:21.090> typically<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.020> cutting<00:02:22.440> of

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
working on typically is the cutting of

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.830 
working on typically is the cutting of
the<00:02:22.560> linings<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.280> that's<00:02:23.880> all<00:02:24.090> fabricated<00:02:24.720> on

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
the linings and that's all fabricated on

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.560 
the linings and that's all fabricated on
a<00:02:25.140> machine<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:26.310> well<00:02:26.520> we'll<00:02:26.970> sew<00:02:27.240> up<00:02:27.330> all<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
a machine so well we'll sew up all the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.970 
a machine so well we'll sew up all the
linings<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.080> put<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.290> all<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.470> pockets<00:02:28.680> and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
linings and put in all the pockets and

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.720 
linings and put in all the pockets and
that<00:02:29.040> kind<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.400> thing<00:02:29.610> as<00:02:29.760> well<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.240> then<00:02:30.930> a

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
that kind of thing as well and then a

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.920 
that kind of thing as well and then a
lot<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.910> handles<00:02:33.330> on<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.510> leather<00:02:33.660> bags

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
lot of the handles on the leather bags

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.550 
lot of the handles on the leather bags
are<00:02:34.140> all<00:02:34.790> hand<00:02:35.790> sewn<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:36.870> each<00:02:37.050> piece<00:02:37.380> is

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
are all hand sewn in so each piece is

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.680 
are all hand sewn in so each piece is
individually<00:02:38.220> sewn<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.030> by<00:02:39.120> hand<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:39.420> for

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
individually sewn in by hand just for

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.330 
individually sewn in by hand just for
durability<00:02:39.989> just<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.709> make<00:02:40.890> sure<00:02:40.920> that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
durability just to make sure that

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.220 
durability just to make sure that
obviously<00:02:42.180> your<00:02:42.300> bag<00:02:42.450> doesn't<00:02:42.660> come<00:02:42.870> apart

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
obviously your bag doesn't come apart

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.690 
obviously your bag doesn't come apart
when<00:02:43.440> you're<00:02:43.620> holding<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.100> lot<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.220> weight<00:02:44.400> and

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
when you're holding a lot of weight and

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.570 
when you're holding a lot of weight and
then<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.420> bag<00:02:45.570> gets<00:02:45.780> sewn<00:02:45.989> together<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:49.580> think

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
then the bag gets sewn together I think

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.220 
then the bag gets sewn together I think
a<00:02:50.760> lot<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.209> times<00:02:51.480> would<00:02:51.660> speak<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.050> people

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
a lot of the times would speak to people

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.690 
a lot of the times would speak to people
about<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.500> bags<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.860> we<00:02:52.980> do<00:02:53.130> here<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.550> is
