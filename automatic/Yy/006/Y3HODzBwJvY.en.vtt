is<00:01:54.420> no<00:01:54.750> different<00:01:55.050> I<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.560> make<00:01:56.040> sure<00:01:56.280> my<00:01:56.490> hair

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
is no different I just make sure my hair

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.020 
is no different I just make sure my hair
is<00:01:56.910> super<00:01:57.240> smooth<00:01:57.870> before<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:59.190> in<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.700> curl

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
is super smooth before I go in and curl

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.180 
is super smooth before I go in and curl
it<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.540> way<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.170> easier<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.770> work<00:02:02.010> with

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
it that way it is easier to work with

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.390 
it that way it is easier to work with
once<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.120> curls<00:02:03.480> are<00:02:03.750> made<00:02:04.050> I<00:02:04.380> also<00:02:04.920> make<00:02:05.370> sure

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
once the curls are made I also make sure

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.780 
once the curls are made I also make sure
never<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.090> include<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:07.140> bottom<00:02:07.710> bit<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.430> my

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
hair the less heat to the ends of the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:24.650 
hair the less heat to the ends of the
better<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.980> way<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.550> get<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> ends<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.630> my

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
better the way I do get the ends of my

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.410 
better the way I do get the ends of my
hair<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.290> just<00:02:25.350> by<00:02:25.860> rolling<00:02:26.340> them<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:27.060> long

curl your hair about an inch away from
the<00:02:48.180> root<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:49.170> makes<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.890> waves<00:02:50.160> not<00:02:50.790> take

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
the root this makes the waves not take

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.530 
the root this makes the waves not take
away<00:02:51.300> from<00:02:51.450> your<00:02:52.080> length<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:53.300> once<00:02:54.300> again

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.770 

now<00:03:04.800> my<00:03:05.250> trick<00:03:05.580> for<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.000> front<00:03:06.270> section<00:03:06.750> of

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
wand just twist it the way you want it

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.530 
wand just twist it the way you want it
to<00:03:11.940> go<00:03:12.240> and<00:03:12.570> then<00:03:12.900> put<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.260> behind<00:03:13.500> your<00:03:14.130> ear
