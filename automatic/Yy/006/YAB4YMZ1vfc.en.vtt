00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:15.700
 hello, I'll make the exchange for the top beagle 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:19.360
 from the interior of the pajero and export we will have 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.789
 fear of falling and small rescue to 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.640
 it was meat 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:31.650
 the metal part that covers here 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:39.940
 of the axis in the homokinetics, considering that 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:42.699
 the doors are very difficult out what 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.390
 already caused the break of the key in this 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:50.580
 occasion I will provide lubrication 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:56.129
 them to make it easier to believe 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:01:00.869
 I'll do lubrication today. 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.869
 with socket, right? 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.969
 except cheating 2011 is security is all 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.039
 a very heavy car 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:16.420
 Any hesitate you with your promise. 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:17.890
 life you lose the fear so trust 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.990
 in case the monkey jamari 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.759
 I'm wearing a pair of earth pants. 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.969
 inappropriate then a little monkey in the light 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.579
 so I 've heard myself surrounded by cares here 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:33.700
 with that little easel is it going 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.590
 assist in working with the car 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:41.140
 duly exploited 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:44.439
 I'm going to use 10 socket handle extracting 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.579
 here the probe is only really the shadow 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:52.090
 to avoid rupture because it is in the 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:54.369
 the set will be moved to 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.249
 forums this disk 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.130
 we'll bring that to contain the riot 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:03.069
 net that this intention to be able to move 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.600
 here in the tray system, and do the 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:09.220
 replacement of the pilots when taking 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.030
 the catheter 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.000
 I'm going to make the attack on the track now 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.490
 see that screw and it's getting set 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.700
 to take away 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.280
 here we do not have a pneumatic and 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.010
 opposition maybe not 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.840
 in the form they are taking or would be 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.070
 possible is making use of them. 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.600
 with safety 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:36.990
 I'll do it here, it's not from your kit. 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:40.500
 a small maize of the ufam catchings light 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.230
 to see if I can make a 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.420
 two screws that 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.590
 frei's grandfather's claw 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.340
 I prefer all of them and you have to force yourself 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:57.360
 very that cardigan the flexible 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.090
 because it can end with feathers ifo fell 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.540
 show more agile and tomato so I get 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.540
 a wire that has the law that gave it 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.370
 tie because it was there and rolling 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.730
 continuity of service with him 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.150
 because I think sustaining is leaving 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.630
 the clamp being supported Lior is all 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.660
 that weight a linense can not in the flexible 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.310
 in the case of brake fluid is one thing 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.040
 Interesting huh 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.950
 it is preferable that we avoid 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:35.240
 america stay indeed nec of ntiga is 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.240
 save near type 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:50.370
 see now we're going to release the 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:55.260
 this frontier has 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.920
 a trading here a small one with pile 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.860
 huh 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.560
 what a strange answer two ways with 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.980
 two screwdrivers and much goodwill 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.080
 good faith does not comply appropriate for making 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.090
 this kind of situation but nothing that does not 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:15.079
 should be done and carefully and in the 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.079
 Your home, right? 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:28.110
 to partypoker or higher than my top 100 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:31.380
 dirty and three doors 33 screw 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:36.810
 and we're going to do this 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:41.280
 pac on top first by taking the 3 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:44.220
 Speak the pictures, we have a 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:50.450
 another door you also loose 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.450
 then yes, then force with the crowbar 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.190
 ah ah 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:17.470
 Oh good
