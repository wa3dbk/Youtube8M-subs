00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.380
 so we will see today how 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.790
 replace a pro macbook battery 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.889
 early 2011 15 inches in less than ten 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.450
 minutes so the first step is 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.440
 to remove all and metal bracelet 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.980
 to avoid a short circuit bogus so 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.910
 once we have removed all of his jewels 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.699
 aluminum metal we go so we will take 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.380
 the macbook we go their tour with a 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.910
 rag or something like that of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.649
 under to not damage the ballet the face 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.149
 from the screen we will take a screwdriver 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.340
 philippe it is very easily 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:44.340
 in the shops and we will start to 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.559
 unscrew all the screws from the face in 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.930
 below the macbook 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.390
 so there are three long vices and the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.860
 rest are small screws must do 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.699
 be careful about talking about losing but good 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.980
 it's easy to face and it's okay and so 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.780
 once it was done to put pressure 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.830
 on the part on the part how to say 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.600
 on the darker part of this phase and 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.189
 we're going to hear a little clip and we're going 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.840
 be able to gently remove this plate 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.200
 metallic 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:23.759
 so I zoomed in on the battery so 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.990
 that's the battery so it's actually 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.780
 goes through in two steps one must first 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.549
 disconnect the battery 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:35.509
 So it goes with no nails 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:39.689
 screwdriver weight for that you have to do 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:43.229
 be careful to go easy because 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.340
 it's very very fragile and a 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.990
 Once that's done, we have 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.090
 disconnected power from the card 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.869
 mother we risk more a 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.399
 a short circuit to the con like that so 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.500
 once it has disconnected the battery 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.780
 we're going to take a screwdriver 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.060
 once it's this time it's 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.219
 a tri wing and we will unscrew the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.140
 two screws on the left side of the 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.150
 battery including a third which is 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.860
 hidden so she's here it takes 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.140
 remove the little sticker and she gets 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.800
 just below it so you have to 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.800
 also lives that's it 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.500
 and once it's done right 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.810
 be careful to drop it once 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.330
 that it's done we take the broth 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.320
 good plastic if not if she's farted so 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.810
 she's lying works the more we can 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.780
 take the connector and remove the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.530
 battery when these so for 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.760
 put the new battery back 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:50.360
 so it's not a little more complicated 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.360
 it is necessary 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.680
 So here we are now we are going 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.610
 put the battery back in this way 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.830
 so we already slide the part of the 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.770
 part without screws and then in May the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:21.730
 part of the lices so we do 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.730
 be careful here we try that 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.440
 it is easy to embed 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.730
 Then we connect the battery 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.010
 connector on the branch 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.960
 there are two types of batteries for the 15 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.240
 inches have to be careful when we 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.390
 buy the battery if it does not make that 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.840
 make tomorrow it's wrong do not have to 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.670
 go 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.020
 bouin if they do not go this is the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.520
 bad the bad version there are two 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.470
 types of batteries so for the 15 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.370
 inches mine had for example a 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.110
 tp at 13.82 there is a second one 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.660
 you have to be careful because the 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.160
 connectors are different so if you 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.860
 see that it does not fit that's not it 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.690
 it's not that it's not your pack 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.760
 books and the drums so you have to act 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.800
 to go back to the store they go the 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:18.220
 change then we revive this lÃ©vis 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:22.110
 no simpler and once that's it 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:29.100
 do we put the hull back 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:29.100
 here we come again this aplec vitalic 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.340
 and so at the moment of ignition we go 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.050
 turn on the computer for the first time 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.250
 will light up you will hear the 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:47.129
 noise and cd player turned and he goes 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.139
 to cut is normal it is necessary to reignite a 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.300
 second time and this time it's the 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.819
 good is because there had to be 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.400
 had a stage a phase 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.750
 initialization of the battery not 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.430
 it's not that it did not work 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.900
 is that it's normal so you have to 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.349
 light a second time and this time 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.319
 this is the good it's over here thank you 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:10.759
 to have watched this video and I hope 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.759
 will tell you very soon
