00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
back up again there we go and really it

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.830 
back up again there we go and really it
is<00:02:00.330> not<00:02:00.810> visible<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.440> all<00:02:01.590> maybe<00:02:02.300> 30<00:02:03.300> yards<00:02:03.720> at

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
is not visible it all maybe 30 yards at

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.750 
is not visible it all maybe 30 yards at
the<00:02:03.930> most<00:02:04.140> at<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.560> point<00:02:04.830> right<00:02:05.010> there<00:02:05.070> if

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
the most at that point right there if

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.850 
the most at that point right there if
I'd<00:02:05.910> stopped<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.990> course<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.320> train<00:02:07.560> would<00:02:07.740> be

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
I'd stopped of course the train would be

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.500 
I'd stopped of course the train would be
blowing<00:02:08.100> at<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.429> point<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.179> would<00:02:09.420> have

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
blowing at that point and I would have

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.680 
blowing at that point and I would have
heard<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.500> but<00:02:11.340> again<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.390> not<00:02:12.660> a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
heard it and but again it's just not a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.660 
heard it and but again it's just not a
very<00:02:12.780> visible<00:02:13.110> crossing<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.890> know<00:02:14.040> as<00:02:14.489> you

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
very visible crossing you know as you

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.890 
very visible crossing you know as you
can<00:02:14.790> see<00:02:14.940> they're<00:02:15.090> still<00:02:15.300> relating<00:02:15.780> some

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
can see they're still relating some

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.370 
can see they're still relating some
memorials<00:02:16.380> down<00:02:16.620> here

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.340 

unfortunately<00:02:20.380> car<00:02:20.560> but<00:02:20.770> we're<00:02:20.950> still<00:02:21.130> there
