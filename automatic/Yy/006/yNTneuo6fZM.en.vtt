00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.300
 the matches are won by cassel golding chile and he did what he could with the pressure 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.690
 this was so congratulated him congratulated chile 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.789
 Gore to its players and leaders 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.009
 already something else is we have to think about us now it's real 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.810
 In rooms 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.249
 irun 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.460
 because I'm not willing to accept the labels that kind of life of the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.869
 labels 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.999
 but as a director I did 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.429
 that the media of the journalist and the technicians even that put up signs 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:33.920
 I'm tired of it 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.680
 so now go on now and I'm going to start answering when 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.030
 come the signs 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.370
 because I think it's unfair and deserved kept good night 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.960
 gonzález of sports shooting 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.150
 the 2 points here 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.620
 good night first just minutes please 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.720
 here it refers to the labels and whose we invite I'm second 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.800
 ansaldi 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.810
 and the breadth and sharpness 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.570
 boudou was presented the opportunity martín says baldwin and have a little 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.570
 more strength in the mark in the midfield 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.800
 filipe all that power are forgotten and linked 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.840
 but we have a purpose regardless of 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.750
 to win the match 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.150
 the purpose or is that I have to see these guys 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
 They gave opportunity to value and a portion of carrillo port 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.700
 in which I think it could have hurt us we made a change to win the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.820
 match and not to tie it 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.160
 so that was the volta to the possible possible província but he told me 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.400
 that I admit 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.480
 but the idea was to try to win the game with 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.280
 with a front center and two ends that although they were picked up a bit were 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.550
 capable of 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.550
 of creating danger that was the idea 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.610
 you know what it is to win to talk about more 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.610
 When the time comes I will answer to Quintana who 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.509
 rosary beads 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.800
 but very very clear 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.010
 on a credit of the labels 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.450
 there are coaches who are offensive coaches who are not 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.370
 aware that they are mice have me rotten with them 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.330
 but rotten lying 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
 I'm not going to admit it anymore I'm going to unmask it 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.269
 it is clear 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.099
 ee 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.199
 director of the etienne race 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.739
 but you talk about business in South America the period especially in 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:23.819
 everywhere 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.459
 They exist in all countries 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.849
 it is very easy to put signs 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.719
 too easy 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.209
 you have to be pragmatic to do it better than one can do for the federation 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.930
 who hires him for the team that hires him to deal with the material 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.289
 who want to take it forward give battle to fight 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.289
 and not to be beaten to the divine button 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.019
 it's very easy when you have the players in the hierarchy that you have 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.129
 devious and offensive 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.219
 Tate tired of that 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:58.499
 battle let's start to see football in another dimension analyze it from another 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:00.949
 way 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:02.549
 for now it opens too much 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.380
 I have deducted for now wants to give 13 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.330
 percent and cultural iron to the chilibroste theme of a well-known our 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.510
 own with the u in a great championship is not heard say that the antoniano was 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.809
 champion with the u November but what is said 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:20.949
 snows have put the blunt snows to bring what is mine is mine to achieve a 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.139
 incredible championship 6 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.139
 against everything there is a championship there 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:30.819
 to this he said not knowing well what when against all I'm saying contract 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.359
 here the oaks the motels and round table this of competitors and that chile 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.190
 it was the team that had the best football associated as a liar 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.190
 there is a very strong current that the dinka run and in the neighbor says that it can 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.510
 be is the great opportunity for the first in the america cup meets as 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.510
 Connoisseur of the medium it seems to me that chile took to be champion 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:54.309
 if I know I do not know anything 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.110
 the crude injuries 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.110
 has its surprise Argentina has just put together a way 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:05.379
 got out of the way with the victory like yesterday and now it's going to be 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:10.289
 It's going to be very serious I do not know what I can about Brazil and Paraguay if they win tomorrow 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.019
 they will also be a candidate in troja uruguay if they win is also a candidate 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.669
 tito is already we have back to the five of always 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.840
 And also in this I'm going to be a little touch 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.639
 I feel yes 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.639
 the time also started 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.629
 The time has also started for things to be more even at the level of 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.080
 arbitrations 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.840
 it's called parejitas 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.349
 the time has come 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.349
 we are going to start fighting also in that area we do not shut up malabo 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.919
 he said that I believe carmona oy did not deserve the expulsion 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.789
 we did it 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.740
 and that changes the outcome of the game 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.740
 occurred 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.189
 a smoker 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:00.990
 Another issue is the labels 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.170
 0 not only for your opinion but behind them was a prominent s 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.379
 I just said 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.719
 the first yellow to corzo epa king senifa opone 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.990
 ni fao was 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.990
 what are we talking about 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.050
 so far if things are going despite fighting 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:28.259
 apple wants to see 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.189
 I think 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:34.989
 the stages that comes as much coach have said and got it with 

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:35.979
 it does not 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.979
 I think now the cup begins not always happens in the worlds too 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.610
 it's going very well they start 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.580
 when we passed eighth 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.090
 and the cup ends america I think I start at the lowest in quarters there 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.139
 they are going to give hand to hand are match said 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:55.139
 of death the loser stays out and and there they go to see them 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.330
 the big teams what is best prepared 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.030
 Thank you
