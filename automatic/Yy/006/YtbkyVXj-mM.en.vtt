00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.770
 Hey, what's up guys? All right? 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.359
 with you I'm audi and in the list of 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.670
 I'm going to talk about the top five points today. 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.230
 difficult to resident evil who knows what 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.840
 nowadays the plans of the executive in the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.689
 half of them almost does not appear when 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.070
 appear are those things easy to 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.650
 attack the three year old with 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.719
 cerebral palsy can solve more 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.180
 had a time that really awaited him 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.489
 they were responsible for much of the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.129
 difficulty of the games and many people 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.020
 even did not lose the beginnings 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.910
 of hair trying to solve them 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.559
 understand logic and everything 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.360
 Well let's start and open the list in 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.149
 Fifth, I'm going to talk about the animal. 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.149
 Resident evil zero is a plan that 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.309
 have several animals there in a room with a 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.039
 torch and you have to light the fire 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.260
 this torch with billy lighter but 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.369
 problem is knowing the right order of 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.320
 animals 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.299
 the answer is not to us 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.100
 easy but there are people who do not pay much 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.020
 attention to these things and ends up having 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.360
 problems in solving prisoners 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.420
 in the end, the solution decides whether 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.240
 all or is to light the fire of the torches 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.640
 of animals in the weakest or most 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.740
 strong as if it were a food chain 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.270
 it's a little more complicated really 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.770
 resident evil zero and serves as 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.770
 for others to come 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.990
 in our list 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.119
 fourthly the long-term puzzle of 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.320
 4 incentive to that same you are 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.610
 thinking that we have to 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.810
 solve with the action day 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.970
 it's based on a puzzle 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.200
 classic that you found in 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.680
 practically all the stores of 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.630
 there until the mid-1990s and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.159
 in it you have only one free space and 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.590
 have to finish all the other eight 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.240
 until the right combination 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.890
 his difficulty lies in the fact that 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.170
 you 'll probably be broke 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.119
 head almost everybody all certinho 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.829
 only that there will be a wretched piece that 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.899
 will speak another sings you'll have to 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.899
 to remake everything end up showing that 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.149
 had done and this was repeated several 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.290
 times until you can find the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.000
 solution 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.470
 in the third position I'm going to talk about the cloth 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.019
 of resident pictures a color of the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.550
 You'll see the cloth here by far 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.260
 hard game 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.870
 in this cloth or if you can not find the 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.090
 father's message from the head of the family before 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.190
 to start the weight you simply do not 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.140
 has to solve it because all the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.810
 clues for you to solve are in this 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.790
 fayo this panel indicates the time frames 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.069
 because of her talking about objects that 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.480
 people on the board are holding 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.400
 the time he 's talking there in the 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.650
 faial is order you have to press the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.780
 in the pictures is one of those plans that 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.220
 They will make you lose time will do if the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.440
 pussy and butt 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.329
 because if you do not have that balcony 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.620
 the fable has everything to do with the pictures 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:56.360
 forget is to waste a lot and a lot of time 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.849
 silver medal on our list goes 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.980
 Resident or 12-tooth 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.690
 remake is one more case of those plans 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.099
 that you have to catch failed before 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.530
 to get on it otherwise you are simply 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.910
 fucked with another smaller result in the 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.310
 combination of three chemical elements 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.170
 that exist in the nightclub house and 100mm in 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.239
 every platform uncle is something much more 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.889
 The problem is that there are three 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.410
 elements that can be combined between 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.120
 generating 9 different combinations that 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.040
 can be combined to generate 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.870
 another paralyzed of combinations that 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.670
 can be combined 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.410
 Anyway if you understand you do not have a 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.600
 absurd amount of combinations can 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.160
 be made and if you make a mistake 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.380
 depending on the point you have 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.540
 will have to start all over again from scratch 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.489
 before the first place has a bonus 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.230
 here I could not talk about bands that 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.780
 make your head explode without citing the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.250
 piano g1 site you own game 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.380
 only one probably knows that I am 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.510
 speaking you probably missed a lot 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.030
 Time in him the clue to him is a son. 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.090
 called the worst neglected grandparents 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.889
 even a tale of voiceless birds that 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.620
 contains the names of several species of 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.299
 beauty birds we have a past 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.639
 voice on behalf of several species of 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.959
 pacu go out on the piano you arrive at the piano 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.329
 Do you have a Latvian key? 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.220
 bloody and there is no sound 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.780
 you want to customize these exactly 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.120
 keys that do not sound 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.680
 only the problem is the order the real is that 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.019
 Do you have to have a thesis? 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.000
 musical knowledge because the lyrics of 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.669
 name of each of the steps they have of themselves 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.130
 which represents a musical note and 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.480
 not 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.880
 eighty per cent of people in a 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.010
 no music at the time and 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.470
 end up watering because it's a weight 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.240
 very difficult and ran detonated in 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.460
 magazines where he left in several 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.750
 magazines at the time because at the time 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.670
 people did not have as easy access to 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:43.110
 internet next run that bread 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.730
 damn first of all of course not 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.350
 had how to be different comes the most 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.990
 motherfucker of all the fans of 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.730
 resident evil otter cent his logic 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.460
 It's easy to understand why people 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.650
 there are three lines with blocks and 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.660
 result of the last line line 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.440
 must be equal to the sample 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.120
 of water 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.130
 only that these lines we have hundreds 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.980
 of different combinations 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.900
 It's hard for you to make a snap and this. 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.540
 makes it virtually impossible to 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.520
 resolved there quickly and that will 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.090
 make most of the lines your 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.130
 view land and everything else and one more 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.500
 likely that you were tempted 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.290
 hit the combination randomly until 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.050
 You can solve the damn panzo. 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.870
 the lightest embodiment of maine 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.850
 funk in resident evil and is certainly a 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.230
 most difficult plan of the whole franchise 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.060
 Good people, I hope you have 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.160
 liked my list if the cloth you 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.380
 You guys find it harder not to show up. 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.120
 Here, please do not curse me. 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.950
 list of yours here in the comment 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.270
 down here we'll take a look 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.640
 We always answered that you 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.350
 comment on suggestions for new 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.900
 there we are making a top 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.340
 every 15 days and this is what the video 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.140
 share your friends with 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.810
 suddenly they will sign up for our channel 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.910
 because next week has a new s 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.080
 reviewed and in 15 days we have a new 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.670
 list here on the channel 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.670
 thanks people
