 liters is made of material 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.320
 very resistant plastic and is free of 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.330

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.760
 plastics when it comes to storing 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.380

 a measure of more length or afternoon ones 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.700
 36 centimeters 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.489
 here in this part of here would be a 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.520
 height of about 28 centimeters and a background 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:52.490

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.160
 the reservoir to fill the water of the river 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.140
