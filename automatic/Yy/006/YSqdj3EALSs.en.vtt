design with this right on the front side

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.570 
design with this right on the front side
so<00:02:58.170> that's<00:02:58.350> nice<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:58.980> can<00:02:59.130> certainly<00:02:59.490> use

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
so that's nice and you can certainly use

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.850 
so that's nice and you can certainly use
it<00:02:59.880> with<00:03:00.000> screen<00:03:00.300> shields<00:03:00.690> as<00:03:00.840> well<00:03:01.200> your

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
it with screen shields as well your

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.160 
it with screen shields as well your
stand<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.460> works<00:03:02.610> just<00:03:02.850> like<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.270> or<00:03:03.870> it

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
stand it works just like that or it

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.530 
stand it works just like that or it
works<00:03:04.350> just<00:03:04.680> like<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.550> I<00:03:05.940> suppose<00:03:06.420> you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
works just like that and I suppose you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.570 
works just like that and I suppose you
can<00:03:06.660> put<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.930> in<00:03:07.050> over<00:03:07.500> here<00:03:07.530> as<00:03:08.010> well<00:03:08.280> if<00:03:08.430> you

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
can put it in over here as well if you

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.360 
can put it in over here as well if you
want<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:10.260> case<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:10.950> comes<00:03:11.160> in

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
want it to so the case that it comes in

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.490 
want it to so the case that it comes in
serves<00:03:11.640> as<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.940> stand<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.660> looks<00:03:12.870> not<00:03:13.320> too

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
serves as a stand and it looks not too

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.610 
serves as a stand and it looks not too
bad<00:03:13.680> either<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:15.360> remove<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.900> it's<00:03:16.140> really

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
bad either so to remove this it's really

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.070 
bad either so to remove this it's really
really<00:03:16.890> simple<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:18.150> put<00:03:18.360> two<00:03:18.510> fingers<00:03:18.540> on<00:03:18.959> the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
really simple you put two fingers on the
