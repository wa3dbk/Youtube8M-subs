00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 but very much you that your immediate opponent in the first half one 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.410
 case scores twice 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.510
 yes it is a credit may 7 is not with the rest i stand took the time to play a game 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.420
 position the peak at the first overflowing tilt approach at the first pole 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.709
 a judge can set up the padt team 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.709
 well we sure propose the quick scan statement 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.819
 It was hard to play him off who both stood 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.649
 nijhof is not difficult but boys now count but dangers max 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.809
 We got the first goal of being led early by the floor was early 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.130
 start the race and the second chrono 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.480
 in total the ball from the left got market in action and then had to do on that 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.980
 I am known between two Monday after time would leak but not anymore 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.600
 once the sitecom 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.840
 legendary 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.390
 the committee in the back 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.020
 can you understand that your patience was at rest 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.020
 he did a break there so you can do them 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.700
 what did he say to you he had to put down so it is too early 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.850
 to address it, it is only a few sizes of choice 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.770
 to accept 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.860
 why do you think you've been 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.500
 yes the boersma abbas station at the back of the station wasn't good at that 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.930
 because there is malema 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.120
 also get benefits if when it comes to thirteen games counts for prorail 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.020
 does not live up to opportunities that have been completed 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.060
 If they were our offices that would yield a nice tailor in a second 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.380
 home shot lozano supporters 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.200
 I think it's the prices that you don't know if the snow conditions 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.509
 el paso ere advance education and those come yesterday the cell 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.600
 previously we stated that the circumstances will be so but yes 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.090
 so much intended but yes you can here you can not put otherwise 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.500
 cruff football 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.980
 how do you look back on this match then you have played a hero 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.720
 just give this match a penalty and then a fifth class kitchen 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.430
 f 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.800
 You also had a complete off day against MSV last year 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.200
 is that to compare with this in the first half that requirement does not compare the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.920
 cello 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.260
 because it's only going to be beautiful 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.600
 that he is exchanged than watching people, but yes for me that is not the case 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.300
 many similarities between the acquaintances 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.210
 ron jans the 3 0 loss 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.999
 against van v reminiscent of turche 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.999
 that hurts you a lot 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:14.789
 the 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.519
 the way in according to he explains won 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.439
 have certainly achieved a goal plus the fact that the time is right 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.679
 top scorer loses work with one for the card in the 90th minute 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.789
 so we not only have the competition floor here, but also important ones 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:28.529
 player 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:32.359
 from a red card to to a mountain in the stupid offense category and thus 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.089
 also stupid red card 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:37.089
 hilton 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:41.719
 I have the only thing you can say about it, he no longer kicked but made it 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.809
 more theft should still be able to give much but you saw it coming in advance and 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.109
 left it back last night 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.889
 the service of the nmbs 3 million euros in the middle line is a place where 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.619
 just frustration in the 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:57.139
 yes I often think of those moments it had an honor and therefore the om 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.429
 parkje had left I was already afraid of a music happened 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:03.999
 so I hope he learns from this that nothing ever happened but rightly so 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.929
 bored with the funds also very annoying for him 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:10.749
 you had a mission you knew that attack from ajax had won 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:14.589
 more often than you can with a corner over that move last year also achieved full 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:17.819
 to go to those competitions and that seemed to sell in the first ten 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:18.249
 minutes 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:22.459
 there then led to that is right the first ten minutes played well forward 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.759
 the was an immediate shot from petter andersson to fear from ajax in the 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:29.989
 that looked good only to a child who would not let a milan marketer 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.939
 washing game just played away and 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:33.919
 and now especially in that phase 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.469
 they just have very poor defense but I have to say that too 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:41.199
 also in the first half three very big chances and we certainly had two 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:42.649
 van ingen engine and 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:45.789
 do not shave the striker in the back but not in the front either 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.399
 you looked defensive though it didn't look good 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:52.559
 especially with the 2 0 of the must that you can just walk away was I would 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.710
 that has been the reason why you changed it 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.750
 well it wasn't just that situation i think he could already put in the 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.539
 previous in the previous year 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:03.479
 It is very much that the trouble with covering the van is worth 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:07.830
 To address 200 of code we did have the change last week 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.799
 the BOJ cares about problems 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.530
 We also had it once the sleeper stood by a free kick that the swede 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:17.340
 guys are crosses then the opponent always leads the way 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.479
 our defenders and were always able to head in and there was also one in the rebound 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:21.199
 sharp 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.469
 yes that was just the difference in it was just played really fast 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:28.139
 in short, about how you explain this dramatically elapsed afternoon for FC 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.659
 groningen 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:33.029
 what can be like 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:35.229
 until there is an odd guess 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.349
 we played well but after the break the goals 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.419
 everything runs questions 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.419
 in lisse competitions in Westerveld 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:47.059
 with what kind of feeling you don't want this contest in vampire who knew that 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:48.900
 starter won off of her ajax 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.229
 so in other words if you had won here 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.289
 leader 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.430
 yes we knew in advance that it was a fantastic opportunity 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:58.620
 bornand or new and 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.620
 we have a rest before the rest I just work 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.560
 after the first goal everything runs back and that was the problem we are going to 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.460
 one sipped enough the dressing after best by fur and we have just enough 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.650
 Hassle as a regular especially our opponent and that was the problem 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.009
 because for that reason I have to play very well here but you have to 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.409
 still see his in the netherlands but the rest top officials we have it 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:26.499
 well done 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:30.119
 it was also the problem of effectiveness of cia willem 2 

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:31.439
 also not so many opportunities 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.669
 groningen might get even more chances than willem 2 in the first half 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.669
 that too, but why not 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.560
 I have to go to Denmark in severe weather and think the practice is going to be 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.529
 it was also with good play 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:49.619
 then of course you know that it is a very difficult second half of them 

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:51.309
 are also affected by the circumstances 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:54.559
 yes what that is a mistake said in reducing the peace there was still confidence 

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:55.669
 in a happy ending 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.270
 Well there was a problem that one can then be that with a role first 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.629
 with the four robbers moment 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:05.389
 we want some problems but when you sit 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.199
 they were won after two years, it was just a boom house nice and nothing 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.809
 to do 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:13.809
 we got lost in the first big test 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:18.419
 and not only with Marc 0 also lost Marcus in the injury time how 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.689
 look back on that 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:21.300
 reach 9 2 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.839
 it is very unfortunate 

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:28.129
 mathijssen i are very important to us i know that screams geert there then 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:31.109
 that she was out of it was hard to play football and prompt to do something 

00:06:31.109 --> 00:06:33.050
 but it was 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.400
 this with not smart from kenneth it is a pity for the team but 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.700
 I know he did well 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.700
 furthermore it was very difficult for a bus 

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:43.449
 it's just unfortunate
