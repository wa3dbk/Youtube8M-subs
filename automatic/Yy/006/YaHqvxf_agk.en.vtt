00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.710
 In this video I'll teach you how to format your Windows Phone. 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.400
 This is a great output when the system is slow or displaying errors later 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.910
 of some update. 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.470
 But look! 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.460
 First of all, it's very important to backup everything you have on your computer. 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.529
 smartphone and did not lose any important document, saw! 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.720
 To do this go to Settings, Backup and click on the list of applications to activate 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.720
 the backup. 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.340
 So your smartphone is set to automatically save your data to OneDrive, 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.260
 which is a Microsoft server, which stores your photos, videos and documents on a server, 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.580
 online, without taking up memory space on your device. 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.520
 And you can still access them whenever you want, even from other devices such as notebook, 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.520
 for example. 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.190
 Now let's turn on backup to save your messages. 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.500
 Just go back to the previous screen, touch SMS and choose the types of messages that you 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.520
 want to save. 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.479
 Change the menu key from Off to On. 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.610
 Another option you have is to upload your photos and videos to your OneDrive account. 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.020
 To do this, go back to the backup screen and click on photos. 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.710
 There you can also choose the quality of photos and videos. 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.759
 And you can rest assured that sending files is done automatically, see? 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:24.759
 Ready! 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.770
 Everything important you had on your device is protected. 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.280
 The next step is to return to the original configuration of your smartphone. 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.109
 Before you begin, remove your memory card if it is on your phone so you do not lose 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:38.749
 the data that is in it. 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:45.880
 There, go to Settings, the About option, scroll down and click Restore configuration 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.939
 of manufactures. 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.329
 A warning will appear asking if you are sure of the procedure. 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.450
 Yes. 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.450
 After that, a new warning will be given to confirm the configuration. 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.149
 Click Yes again! 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.539
 Then the phone will restart and there will already be the original settings. 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.420
 But what if the device locks and does not work to access the settings? 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.650
 Calm down, that's easy to solve it! 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.771
 In this case, press Power and then the volume down button until you see a 

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:19.310
 exclamation. 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.810
 Once it appears, click the external buttons in the following order: volume up, 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.500
 decrease volume, power, and decrease volume. 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.990
 In this, a screen with rotating gears will appear. 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.670
 Then, just wait for the phone to restart and the problem will be solved. 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.000
 Ready! 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.870
 Now your smartphone is brand new again, and the best, without crashing anything. 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.000
 To recover your data, simply start the system with your email registered with Microsoft, 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.440
 when asked in the initial setup. 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.440
 Ah! 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.820
 And do not forget to stay connected to a wi-fi network to do this, okay? 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.180
 What's up? 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.430
 Hope this helps!
