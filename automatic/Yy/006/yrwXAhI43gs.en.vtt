 hold we see 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:22.770

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:18.480
 8 screws located under the covers 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.480
 I say this to the fact that you never know who is 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.600
 mistakenly lose all of them the same 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:35.260
 lengths so 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:40.709
 mess up remove the wires so 14 will 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:43.500
 I take off the keyboard 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:47.580
 usually starting from the middle 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:55.620
 pushing the latch 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:55.620
 keyboards jump out like this 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:22.670
 all so slightly to hook a finger under 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.140
 the keyboard also has three screws 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.580
 Luckily the same is the same so 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.160
 no one will have any problems 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.290
 to arise 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.290

 starting with will take you so court open 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.540
 then I usually did it 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:02.200
 because residents finger like that 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.200

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.460

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:34.219

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:53.809
 I understand only one we connect it 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:58.069
 remove the board here are visible signs of flooding 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:06:02.359
 times but this is typical 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:09.949
 you have everywhere in the touchpad area here 

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:12.709
 that's what they have to fill in 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:18.619
 This vypayat clean and again boring 

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:21.459
 Solder to not repeat now

 some cooling system 

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:29.679
 no special pressure on the board 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:29.679
 produce 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:42.099
 can accommodate connect with each 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.099
 a friend 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:07:02.010
 excess screws should not remain when 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:04.640
 dispute the laptop is not very dirty anyway 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.640

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:26.270
 everything also has a parsing on the cube he has 

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:29.800
 imitate if you are going to brush 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:32.509
 i.e. replacement of thermal paste and purge 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.809
 radiators should not end in 

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:42.559
 anyways always change if 

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:44.960
 allows the cooler itself to lubricate the sleeve yes 

00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:47.270

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.710
 review how to disassemble such not understandable 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:57.699
 cooler and they are also removable understand 

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:57.699
