00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
think most people eat I think even if I

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.030 
think most people eat I think even if I
obviously<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.630> do<00:04:06.750> not<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:07.079> this<00:04:07.260> I'm<00:04:07.620> no<00:04:07.769> I'm

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
obviously I do not like this I'm no I'm

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.500

no<00:04:08.099> huge<00:04:08.370> Delta<00:04:08.639> fan<00:04:08.790> either<00:04:08.970> but<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.239> think<00:04:09.450> it

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
no huge Delta fan either but I think it

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.349 
no huge Delta fan either but I think it
would<00:04:09.599> be<00:04:09.660> very<00:04:09.780> hard<00:04:10.019> for<00:04:10.139> me<00:04:10.319> to<00:04:10.970> to<00:04:11.970> do<00:04:12.150> that

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
would be very hard for me to to do that

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.539 
would be very hard for me to to do that
if<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.870> delta<00:04:13.169> flight<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.530> cheaper<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:13.980> or<00:04:14.340> more

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549
