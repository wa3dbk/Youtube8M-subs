00:01:26.839 --> 00:01:26.849 
really burn out in this area we can

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:29.300 
really burn out in this area we can
check<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.479> flash<00:01:27.750> meter<00:01:28.020> by<00:01:28.800> placing

the flash meter in the area and pointing
it<00:01:31.770> towards<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.310> snows<00:01:32.550> we<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.240> take<00:01:33.420> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
it towards the snows we can take a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.580 
it towards the snows we can take a
reading<00:01:33.929> and<00:01:35.060> this<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.209> giving<00:01:36.539> me<00:01:36.569> between<00:01:37.229> 8

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
reading and this is giving me between 8

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.850 
reading and this is giving me between 8
and<00:01:37.979> 11<00:01:38.099> 1/2<00:01:38.819> a<00:01:39.000> stock<00:01:39.240> more<00:01:39.450> which<00:01:40.110> works<00:01:40.500> very

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
and 11 1/2 a stock more which works very

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.980 
and 11 1/2 a stock more which works very
well<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.190> most<00:01:41.490> people<00:01:41.640> let's<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> look
