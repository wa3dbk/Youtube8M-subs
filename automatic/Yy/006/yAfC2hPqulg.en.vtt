00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.240
 On the one hand, it depends on every second 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.240
 who has less gas on board 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:14.779
 whoever can later and shorter thanks to him, he has an advantage in the wine city 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.470
 Being extremely dynamic and at the same time more efficient, this is exactly what you need 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.470
 is also the goal of Efficient Dynamics 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.619
 Every week in our series, we introduce a BMW Efficient Dynamics 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.169
 Measures before and explain what benefits they draw 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.080
 our topic today 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.400
 the air flap control 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.160
 through the broadcast, it leads world famous 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
 the opportunity 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.570
 Irene MÃ¼ller Mitte at BMW has always been capitalized no wonder 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.320
 Dynamic yet one of the most important brands 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.250
 Good news the car is one of these records sold at the same time 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.070
 less fuel 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.489
 Guerrero Lena with the first of the body but off 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.060
 Many aerodynamics even where you do not at first glance 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.520
 for example, thinks of the cooler 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.940
 usually the air flaps are always open and completely independent 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.430
 Cooling requirements of the engine to work up the air resistance and 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.450
 worsens the aerodynamics 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.250
 exactly here 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.930
 Now the engineers want the result 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.180
 an innovative one 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.540
 Air traffic tax this season 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.990
 still gape depth of the BMW said 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.400
 but what is that? 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.140
 there is no cooling necessary so at normal driving and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.430
 as it gets cooler for outside temperatures third of a storm 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.220
 prevented 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.350
 this confuses two things on the one hand, so the air resistance is less 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.360
 On the other hand, fuel consumption could mean button only 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.060
 then filled if it is really necessary 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.060
 because actually already has the correct operating temperature 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.820
 and fuels red-white 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.250
 and the connected 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.780
 that's just a show 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.850
 because in the meantime Dynamics measures 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.850
 with bmw-engineers a top position 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.040
 Thanks to the cunning Dynamics Package, 20 bmw models already feature one 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.459
 Co2 value of not more than 140 grams per kilometer 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.159
 less consumption, less emissions and more power at the same time 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.849
 with this single so Freese BMW in the competition Unna 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:29.319
 no wonder that since 2007 already over one million customers for one 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.049
 automobile 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.549
 1 decided 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.149
 that is exactly what we have to confirm
