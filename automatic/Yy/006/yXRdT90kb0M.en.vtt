00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.660
 On the health check today I bought Kibi Central 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.660
 I would like to provide 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.639
 I'm casting 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.639
 Other 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.779
 I will fix the trouble 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.390
 This way 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 It is the content that is suitable 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.869
 I'm breathing for a while 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.470
 Here is the body 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.490
 Metallized 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.490
 Septic tank prevents wind to this side 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.960
 I started the fire 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.450
 In particular 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.450
 Name it 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.110
 I am going through an isolated bride 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.720
 To high 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.390
 Yes 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.870
 Person about use environment 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.940
 I use about 10 games for the students of Sound Studio Tokyo LOL 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.890
 And for former coaches we use apdme2 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.500
 5000 yen before 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.270
 To dubbing 10 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.370
 I think it's a frog, but I mentioned fast performance 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.480
 I think every time 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.580
 Yeah 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.890
 And the river rushes to the driving force 901 this time 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.360
 My wife 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.640
 And that leather item was 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.850
 It is a motorized bike 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.690
 Mr. Naoe is in third place 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.100
 I think it was a smile that I threw me a lot 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.750
 Really cheap 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.890
 Past 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.180
 I am using it for ban 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.180
 Let's make a microphone and we are in touch 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.890
 Suffering on this theme 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.890
 I wanted to avoid text 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.890
 Yesterday I introduced you to it before yesterday 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.489
 Mr. East is the third place Kimi Raikkonen miracle mimic 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.089
 It is 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:17.430
 Well this time is this- 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.029
 Constantly possible 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:23.349
 I want to connect with a microphone 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.210
 The 10th 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.409
 By the way, shin 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.629
 Also from normal to 1 on the set of 8 microphones 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.549
 It may not be the target near the net, though 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:33.459
 I will 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.429
 reference 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.769
 2 If you have 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:39.809
 English 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.809
 Switch 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:04.539
 End 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:07.539
 Just a little bit 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.319
 There is 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.719
 Advertising copy found 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.719
 End 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.499
 1. 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:27.819
 For example, what introduced the destination 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.559
 Something happens in winter 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.699
 Joint 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:32.879
 About 1 hour 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.519
 And 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.519
 I don't know what to do 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:42.339
 Conquer from the last right from this side 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.009
 This is 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:51.069
 For example, you can hear the City Planning Division from here 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.879
 I also said it was fun 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:02.579
 Okikoren 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.579
 I lose a lot 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.199
 I do not like it 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.809
 Further exceeded 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:13.839
 Thin form 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:16.839
 It is said that I posted this 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.519
 Techmo 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.880
 Often participate 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.749
 Major League 

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:26.699
 I joined you to everyone 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.699
 It is not easy to find 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.539
 Because we participate in the same way 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.430
 If I would be useful 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.330
 Thank you for your hair
