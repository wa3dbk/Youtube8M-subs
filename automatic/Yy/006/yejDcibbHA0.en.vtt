as the Blues Bluebird and naturally
you'd<00:00:36.120> find<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.719> tube<00:00:37.079> mics<00:00:37.320> are<00:00:37.530> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you'd find that the tube mics are a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.580 
you'd find that the tube mics are a
little<00:00:38.070> warmer<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.700> texture<00:00:39.149> than<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.660> vet

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
little warmer in texture than the vet

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.670 
little warmer in texture than the vet
but<00:00:41.190> all<00:00:41.640> very<00:00:41.910> interesting<00:00:42.239> tonality<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.410> it

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
but all very interesting tonality and it

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.869 
but all very interesting tonality and it
can<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:43.800> used<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.070> obviously<00:00:44.610> different

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
can be used for obviously different

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.600 
can be used for obviously different
purposes<00:00:45.649> what<00:00:46.649> I'm<00:00:46.739> quickly<00:00:47.010> finding<00:00:47.280> out<00:00:47.430> is

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
purposes what I'm quickly finding out is

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.029 
purposes what I'm quickly finding out is
the<00:00:47.730> difference<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.320> md<00:00:49.320> 1a<00:00:49.530> with<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the difference of the md 1a with the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.549 
the difference of the md 1a with the
sticker<00:00:50.309> 10<00:00:50.610> micron<00:00:51.059> diameter<00:00:51.629> or<00:00:52.199> thickness

compared to the md 2 a's 3 micron
thickness<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.820> I<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:57.090> see<00:00:57.239> why<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:58.039> 1a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
thickness and I can see why that the 1a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.700 
thickness and I can see why that the 1a
seems<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.730> tend<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.120> go<00:01:00.780> toward<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.140> guitar

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
seems to tend to go toward the guitar

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
different tonality I wouldn't say better

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.899 
different tonality I wouldn't say better
or<00:01:18.720> worse<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.530> different<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.400> the
