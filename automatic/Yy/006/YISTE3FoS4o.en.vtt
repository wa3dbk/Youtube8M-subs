00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.170
 brain the name to get to braindrive 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.390
 in fact to a smart vehicle 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.509
 now let's see the vehicle in detail 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.220
 let's start from the front we can see 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.680
 in particular in the frontal part 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.230
 inside the bumper we have 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.350
 placed a series of lhasa scandals 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.809
 are laser- based devices that 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.449
 allow to find the distance of the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.840
 objects that are in front of the 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.140
 vehicle 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.690
 we have two single-sided side panels e 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.719
 a four-story front 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.719
 then we placed another one here 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.559
 sensor always the laser base it puts 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.300
 16 beams that is in correspondence with 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.609
 this is precisely because it is one 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.449
 different technology and more in quotes 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:07.320
 low cost and allows you to evaluate it 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.329
 same type of sensor but from a perspective 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.060
 at least different in this position 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:17.790
 a radar is mounted inside the party 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.140
 that just salami also to find 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.390
 the obstacles in front of the vehicle 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.520
 all these sensors are used 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.710
 in synergy and also associated with 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.689
 camera for the front 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.790
 they are mounted inside the windshield 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.520
 we see them here we see four 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.990
 precisely they are therefore interchangeable 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.600
 these are four that are there now 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.689
 but these positions we also use for 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.210
 test different types of sensors for the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.360
 side part we have installed one 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.219
 camera inside the let's say 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.740
 side just behind the headlight assembly 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.000
 we use this camera for 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.070
 an application for example of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.990
 automatic parking and the side 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:02.880
 monitoring near intersections a 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.929
 blind in which the vehicle stick out a lot 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.950
 inside the intersection itself 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.770
 two other cameras are positioned 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.850
 inside the mirrors in 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.190
 we see them especially 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.960
 we see them here integrated 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.800
 inside the mirror these 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.650
 allow 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.320
 the mirror features 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.620
 clever we pass a part 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.520
 back where we have precisely the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.850
 GPS antennas positioned on the trunk and two 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:37.830
 cameras here with a very wide perspective 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.570
 which allows a rear view e 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.460
 so it helps parking and 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.870
 unification of the obstacles in this 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.490
 phase 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.010
 I would like the name of the vehicle a 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.540
 other Tuscany was positioned here at 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.750
 center of the bumper and then 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.900
 inside the trunk we have what 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:02.520
 is the brain of the machine 3 pc 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.080
 these are between PCs that are precisely that 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.500
 they serve for the elaboration of all the 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.900
 sensor data we had a PC 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.540
 industrial that promises that we say 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.950
 dedicated to vehicle control 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.680
 this is a charger of 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.360
 naval derivation and allows 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.670
 charge the extra battery that 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.610
 behind the black bulkhead we see in 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.910
 trunk bottom the trunk arranged on two 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.070
 layer the top one with all the 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.470
 devices while the lower one is 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:40.290
 dedicated to more interconnections 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:45.350
 chaotic let's say looking at the part 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.350
 internal instead we can find in front 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.860
 a series of different monitors a 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.070
 depending on the type of function that a 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.070
 request 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.050
 we have a big monitor in this one 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.420
 position that allows precisely in phase 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.880
 of code development or in any case of tests 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.290
 algorithms of having a certain type 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.909
 of comfort 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.950
 in being able to develop and see i 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:17.359
 results this coin for 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.769
 completely removable in the process of 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.669
 demonstration 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.949
 we have an integrated touchscreen display 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.009
 in the dashboard so that then one 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:32.699
 communication with the user three 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:36.259
 dynamically reconfigurable buttons in 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:39.750
 so that the vehicle itself to the driver 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.970
 what to activate what not and then we have 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.470
 we also have a warning instead of 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:51.330
 rear view mirror and inside 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.949
 of the armrest dl we have one 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.120
 push-button panel that allows activation 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.720
 deactivation of all individuals 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:04.800
 devices present in the car 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:09.270
 of course here we are some grips 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.849
 typical of the area in which we go 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.909
 work that allow easy 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.250
 access to the boot PC some sockets said 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:22.440
 also that we see in the continuation of the 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:26.099
 ban and finally we have in the 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.639
 driver's and headrest 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:32.070
 passenger in the back we have two screens 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.320
 that allow you to 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.140
 displays the results of the processing 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.440
 also that if everything in particular 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.540
 demo version of this car was 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.760
 built in 2009 but we have tried 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.560
 to take her on this car all the 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.000
 technologies all the algorithms that 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.340
 we have developed over the years 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.840
 hence both those of the slow lance of 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:58.170
 2005 that also those of argo of 98 in 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.450
 1998 say they are our first 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:03.360
 prototype smart car that 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.560
 we have developed in particular 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.930
 clearly this can be 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.930
 considered the Italian answer
