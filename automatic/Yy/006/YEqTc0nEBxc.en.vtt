00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.510
 hello welcome to a new video where 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.959
 let's see the classification of 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.959
 real numbers 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.920
 the real numbers 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.050
 which are denoted 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.000
 thus 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.070
 We can divide them into 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.320
 a first division 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.320
 in rational numbers 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.810
 that are denoted with this q with this stick 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.440
 here that are the ones that can be expressed 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.440
 in fraction 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.470
 and the numbers 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.470
 and rational 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:07.239
 with is there and they are the ones that can not be 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.239
 express in fraction 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.700
 turn inside the numbers 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.700
 We can divide them rationally 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.740
 in whole numbers 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:32.450
 that are denoted with that zeta 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.450
 the fractional numbers 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.530
 we start with the whole numbers inside 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.000
 of the whole numbers we will have the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.000
 natural numbers 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.049
 that we will notice with that n 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:00.870
 we will have the 0 and we will have the integers 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.870
 negative 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.910
 the natives are the one the two the three 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.170
 the negative integers of the minus one at 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.759
 minus two minus 3 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.010
 and then we'll have the numbers 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.760
 fractionaries that we can divide 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.760
 in 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.290
 exact decimals 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:31.170
 as for example in a 27 34 or in 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.170
 periodic decimals 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.410
 which in turn we will have decimals 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.410
 pure newspapers 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.000
 as the 3.4 with period or the 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.000
 mixed 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.740
 as for example the 1.17 with period in 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.810
 7 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.660
 and the irrational numbers finally 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.210
 they are all those who do not have roots 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.550
 exact for example root of 2 which is 1 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.460
 4142 etcetera another hundred of the number of 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:21.020
 streamline most famous be the pi number 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:23.210
 which is 3.14 1592 suspension points 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.730
 so in this way that of all the 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.260
 classification of real numbers this 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.060
 it's all for the moment I wait for you in the 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.830
 next video I recommend you subscribe 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.220
 to this youtube channel and follow all 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.120
 our videos in order in the 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.120
 www.maec.es greetings
