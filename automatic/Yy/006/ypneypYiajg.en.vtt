00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
on 44 chemistry and also my power pass

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.929 
on 44 chemistry and also my power pass
assistance<00:02:23.379> is<00:02:23.560> glitch<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.250> i<00:02:24.280> can't<00:02:24.579> turn<00:02:24.819> it

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
assistance is glitch so i can't turn it

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.119 
assistance is glitch so i can't turn it
on<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.750> imagine<00:02:26.019> that<00:02:26.349> not<00:02:26.590> having<00:02:26.799> power

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
on so imagine that not having power

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.550 
on so imagine that not having power
pulse<00:02:27.430> assistance<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.209> having<00:02:28.599> 44<00:02:29.109> chemistry

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
pulse assistance and having 44 chemistry

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.080 
pulse assistance and having 44 chemistry
and<00:02:29.769> look<00:02:30.010> at<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:30.189> goals<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.519> i<00:02:30.609> scored<00:02:30.939> with
