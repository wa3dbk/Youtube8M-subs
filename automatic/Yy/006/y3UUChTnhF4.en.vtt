you and you can close it pretty quickly

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.690 
you and you can close it pretty quickly
with<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> app<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.500> mount<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.040> Wi-Fi<00:00:32.460> hub

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
with the app so you mount a Wi-Fi hub

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.340 
with the app so you mount a Wi-Fi hub
for<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> mic<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.390> hear<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> ceiling<00:00:34.200> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
for the mic you hear in the ceiling and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.590 
for the mic you hear in the ceiling and
the<00:00:34.770> idea<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.340> flashes<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> signal<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the idea is that it flashes a signal to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.450 
the idea is that it flashes a signal to
your<00:00:36.719> existing<00:00:37.260> garage<00:00:37.559> door<00:00:37.920> opener<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
your existing garage door opener and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.549 
your existing garage door opener and
then<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.360> tells<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.809> garage<00:00:40.020> door<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.410> open

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
then that tells the garage door to open

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.010 
then that tells the garage door to open
and<00:00:40.800> close<00:00:41.040> there's<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.850> sensor<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.750> door

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
and close there's a sensor on the door

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.990 
and close there's a sensor on the door
that<00:00:43.469> helps<00:00:43.829> detect<00:00:44.190> whether<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.760> garage

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
that helps detect whether the garage

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.090 
that helps detect whether the garage
door<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.539> open<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.200> shut<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.739> sends<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
door is open or shut and that sends a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.250 
door is open or shut and that sends a
signal<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.640> Wi-Fi<00:00:47.969> hub<00:00:48.180> which<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:48.930> tells

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
signal to the Wi-Fi hub which then tells

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.959 
signal to the Wi-Fi hub which then tells
your<00:00:49.379> phone<00:00:49.620> hey<00:00:49.920> your<00:00:50.070> garage<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.489> open<00:00:50.670> your

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
now I do have a pretty weak Wi-Fi signal

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.920 
now I do have a pretty weak Wi-Fi signal
coming<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.420> still<00:01:51.689> works

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
