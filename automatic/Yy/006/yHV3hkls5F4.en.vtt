00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
as well this roller is a custom-built

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.330 
as well this roller is a custom-built
roller<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.500> had<00:00:58.829> built<00:00:59.760> by<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> machine<00:01:00.239> shop<00:01:01.340> I

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
roller I had built by a machine shop I

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.620 
roller I had built by a machine shop I
had<00:01:02.789> ruined<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.570> couple<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.379> small<00:01:04.680> ones

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
had ruined a couple of the small ones

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.420 
had ruined a couple of the small ones
you<00:01:06.630> know<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.960> forcing<00:01:07.350> too<00:01:07.560> much<00:01:07.740> clay

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
you know just forcing too much clay

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.090 
you know just forcing too much clay
through<00:01:08.760> them<00:01:08.850> at<00:01:08.939> any<00:01:09.090> given<00:01:09.330> time<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.110> when

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
through them at any given time and when

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.980 
through them at any given time and when
you're<00:01:11.220> doing<00:01:11.369> large<00:01:11.729> canes<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.840> need

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
you're doing large canes you really need

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.499 
you're doing large canes you really need
to<00:01:13.140> condition<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.619> lot<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.950> clay<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:15.270> found

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
to condition a lot of clay and I found

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.539 
to condition a lot of clay and I found
this<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.869> quite<00:01:16.530> effective<00:01:16.619> way<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> doing

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
this to be quite effective way of doing

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.289 
this to be quite effective way of doing
it<00:01:18.290> this<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.350> what<00:01:19.650> I'm<00:01:19.770> shooting<00:01:19.979> for

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.640 

these<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.570> canes<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.020> make<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
these are the canes that make up the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.230 
these are the canes that make up the
body<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.990> start<00:01:27.990> off<00:01:28.140> by<00:01:28.409> making<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.369> diamond

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
body I start off by making a diamond

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.100 
body I start off by making a diamond
shaped<00:01:31.220> brown<00:01:32.220> color<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.850> then<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.509> cover<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
shaped brown color and then I cover it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.010 
shaped brown color and then I cover it
with<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:35.070> lighter<00:01:35.700> color<00:01:35.820> which<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.570> he<00:01:36.689> crew

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
with a lighter color which is he crew

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.670 
with a lighter color which is he crew
and<00:01:37.259> white<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.810> then<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> roll<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.259> against<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and white and then I roll it against a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.490 
and white and then I roll it against a
straight<00:01:40.950> edge<00:01:41.220> give<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.299> diamond<00:01:43.259> shape

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
straight edge give it a diamond shape

00:01:43.500 --> 00:02:04.340 
straight edge give it a diamond shape
and<00:01:43.799> then<00:01:43.920> start<00:01:44.220> reducing<00:01:44.399> with<00:01:44.909> my<00:01:45.090> fingers

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.090 

so<00:02:05.220> after<00:02:05.550> I<00:02:05.580> have<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.330> lot<00:02:06.870> of<00:02:07.080> these<00:02:07.229> probably

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
so after I have a lot of these probably

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.600 
so after I have a lot of these probably
somewhere<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> order<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.979> know<00:02:11.009> 20

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
somewhere in the order of you know 20

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.340 
somewhere in the order of you know 20
lineal<00:02:12.360> feet<00:02:12.630> if<00:02:12.870> not<00:02:13.080> more<00:02:13.350> I<00:02:15.110> start<00:02:16.110> cutting

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
lineal feet if not more I start cutting

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.190 
lineal feet if not more I start cutting
them<00:02:16.650> into<00:02:17.570> probably<00:02:18.570> four<00:02:18.990> inch<00:02:19.290> lengths

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
them into probably four inch lengths

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.800 
them into probably four inch lengths
four<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.320> five<00:02:22.530> inch<00:02:22.800> lengths<00:02:23.430> it's<00:02:23.670> not<00:02:23.940> super

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
four to five inch lengths it's not super

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.420 
four to five inch lengths it's not super
critical<00:02:25.320> because<00:02:25.470> these<00:02:25.740> will<00:02:25.950> actually<00:02:26.280> be

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
critical because these will actually be

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.750 
critical because these will actually be
stretched<00:02:26.820> out<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.780> reduced<00:02:28.740> in<00:02:29.010> size<00:02:29.280> before

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
stretched out and reduced in size before

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.449 
stretched out and reduced in size before
they're<00:02:30.950> assembled<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.250> official<00:02:32.730> cane

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
they're assembled in the official cane

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:45.290 
they're assembled in the official cane
so<00:02:35.459> just<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.000> lot<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.240> cutting<00:02:36.450> here<00:02:44.120> I'm<00:02:45.120> going

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
so just a lot of cutting here I'm going

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.920 
so just a lot of cutting here I'm going
to<00:02:45.510> skip<00:02:45.840> ahead<00:02:45.989> here<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.620> bit<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:48.690> kind

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
to skip ahead here in a bit but you kind

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.770 
to skip ahead here in a bit but you kind
of<00:02:48.959> get<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.230> idea<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:50.120> what<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.239> scales<00:02:51.540> are

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
of get the idea of what the scales are

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.500 
of get the idea of what the scales are
made<00:02:51.930> out<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:55.100> so<00:02:56.100> I've<00:02:56.250> got<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> basically<00:02:57.450> a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
made out of so I've got a basically a

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.890 
made out of so I've got a basically a
big<00:02:57.750> pile<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.260> them<00:02:58.410> here<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.630> here's<00:03:00.630> what<00:03:00.870> I

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
big pile of them here and here's what I

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.180 
big pile of them here and here's what I
ended<00:03:01.260> up<00:03:01.380> with<00:03:01.940> this<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.530> most<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.800> body<00:03:05.010> I

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
ended up with this is most of the body I

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.000 
ended up with this is most of the body I
still<00:03:05.340> need<00:03:05.760> an<00:03:05.940> upper<00:03:06.530> part<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.830> body

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
still need an upper part to the body

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.000 
still need an upper part to the body
that'll<00:03:08.459> connect<00:03:09.110> this<00:03:10.110> body<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.709> head

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
that'll connect this body to the head

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.890 
that'll connect this body to the head
and<00:03:11.730> that's<00:03:11.910> actually<00:03:12.150> what<00:03:12.510> I'm<00:03:12.630> gonna<00:03:12.720> be

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
and that's actually what I'm gonna be

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.160 
and that's actually what I'm gonna be
building<00:03:13.140> right<00:03:13.440> here<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.750> start<00:03:16.110> by

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
building right here so I start by

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.199 
building right here so I start by
assembling<00:03:17.660> part<00:03:18.660> these<00:03:19.049> scales<00:03:19.440> into<00:03:20.209> four

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
assembling part these scales into four

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.690 
assembling part these scales into four
or<00:03:21.239> five<00:03:21.510> deep<00:03:21.989> rows<00:03:25.070> when<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.160> stretch<00:03:26.430> these

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
or five deep rows when I stretch these

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.640 
or five deep rows when I stretch these
out<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.890> whole<00:03:29.070> time<00:03:29.250> paying<00:03:29.610> attention<00:03:30.209> to

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
out the whole time paying attention to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.490 
out the whole time paying attention to
the<00:03:31.650> image<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:33.239> want<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:34.019> end<00:03:34.290> up

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
the image that I want it to end up

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.280 
the image that I want it to end up
looking<00:03:34.890> like<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.690> I've<00:03:36.690> actually<00:03:36.930> included

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
looking like so I've actually included

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.280 
looking like so I've actually included
darker<00:03:38.130> scales<00:03:38.459> where<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.030> shading<00:03:39.299> would

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
darker scales where the shading would

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.920 
darker scales where the shading would
need<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.680> be<00:03:40.799> you<00:03:41.220> know<00:03:41.340> darker<00:03:41.850> or<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.840> know

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
need to be you know darker or you know

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.449 
need to be you know darker or you know
highlights<00:03:43.350> where<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.980> Sun<00:03:44.220> would<00:03:44.430> be

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
highlights where the Sun would be

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.610 
highlights where the Sun would be
hitting<00:03:46.730> which<00:03:47.730> adds<00:03:48.019> you<00:03:49.019> know<00:03:49.140> makes<00:03:49.470> it

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
hitting which adds you know makes it

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.620 
hitting which adds you know makes it
more<00:03:49.739> difficult<00:03:49.920> but<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.239> get<00:03:51.420> you

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
more difficult but it you get you

00:03:51.630 --> 00:04:00.970 
more difficult but it you get you
achieve<00:03:51.989> a<00:03:52.110> better<00:03:52.290> effect<00:03:52.709> in<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.010> end

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.890 

so<00:04:01.980> again<00:04:02.810> just<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.900> fair<00:04:04.110> amount<00:04:04.200> of<00:04:04.730> time<00:04:05.900> just

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
so again just a fair amount of time just

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:15.950 
so again just a fair amount of time just
spent<00:04:07.880> assembling<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:14.220> often<00:04:14.750> you're<00:04:15.750> better

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
spent assembling and often you're better

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.880 
spent assembling and often you're better
off<00:04:16.050> to<00:04:16.440> make<00:04:16.620> more<00:04:17.100> or<00:04:18.000> larger<00:04:18.690> pieces<00:04:19.590> for

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
off to make more or larger pieces for

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.570 
off to make more or larger pieces for
your<00:04:20.040> cane<00:04:20.310> because<00:04:21.710> you<00:04:22.710> know<00:04:22.830> if<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.220> end<00:04:23.370> up

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
your cane because you know if you end up

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.120 
your cane because you know if you end up
with<00:04:23.880> too<00:04:24.630> little<00:04:24.930> of<00:04:25.140> any<00:04:25.350> given<00:04:25.680> part<00:04:25.920> of<00:04:26.040> the

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
with too little of any given part of the

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.380 
with too little of any given part of the
body<00:04:26.420> the<00:04:27.420> rest<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:29.400> know<00:04:29.490> you<00:04:29.550> kind<00:04:30.270> of

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
body the rest you know you kind of

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.710 
body the rest you know you kind of
wasted<00:04:31.290> the<00:04:32.160> rest<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:33.090> other<00:04:33.240> parts

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
wasted the rest of the the other parts

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.320 
wasted the rest of the the other parts
parts<00:04:34.350> of<00:04:34.530> them<00:04:34.680> anyway<00:04:35.010> if<00:04:35.730> that<00:04:35.790> makes<00:04:36.180> any

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
parts of them anyway if that makes any

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.270 
parts of them anyway if that makes any
sense

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
sense

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.930 
sense
so<00:04:38.280> often<00:04:38.790> I<00:04:38.910> end<00:04:39.120> up<00:04:39.330> with<00:04:40.250> you<00:04:41.250> know<00:04:41.370> enough

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
so often I end up with you know enough

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:52.070 
so often I end up with you know enough
to<00:04:42.150> almost<00:04:42.450> assemble<00:04:43.170> a<00:04:43.230> second<00:04:43.650> cane<00:04:50.960> so<00:04:51.960> now

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
to almost assemble a second cane so now

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.410 
to almost assemble a second cane so now
I'm<00:04:52.260> putting<00:04:52.530> this<00:04:52.890> upper<00:04:53.640> part<00:04:54.060> of<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.270> body

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
I'm putting this upper part of the body

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.510 
I'm putting this upper part of the body
on<00:04:56.300> putting<00:04:57.300> some<00:04:57.480> more<00:04:57.630> shading<00:04:58.110> here<00:04:58.520> than

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
on putting some more shading here than

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:08.440 
on putting some more shading here than
some<00:04:59.730> outline

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.790 

you<00:05:09.450> know<00:05:09.570> being<00:05:09.780> careful<00:05:10.260> to<00:05:10.380> make<00:05:10.560> sure<00:05:10.590> that

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
you know being careful to make sure that

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.150 
you know being careful to make sure that
there's<00:05:11.220> no<00:05:11.520> voids<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.930> no<00:05:13.380> air<00:05:13.560> pockets

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
there's no voids and no air pockets

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.940 
there's no voids and no air pockets
because<00:05:14.580> air<00:05:14.880> pockets<00:05:15.330> certainly<00:05:16.260> can<00:05:16.560> kill<00:05:16.920> a

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
because air pockets certainly can kill a

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:23.090 
because air pockets certainly can kill a
cane<00:05:20.930> so<00:05:21.930> definitely<00:05:22.470> want<00:05:22.620> to<00:05:22.680> make<00:05:22.800> sure<00:05:22.980> you

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
cane so definitely want to make sure you

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.330 
cane so definitely want to make sure you
get<00:05:23.250> rid<00:05:23.460> of<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.610> air<00:05:23.730> pockets<00:05:24.270> and<00:05:25.130> that's<00:05:26.130> it

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
get rid of the air pockets and that's it

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.200 
get rid of the air pockets and that's it
for<00:05:26.490> part<00:05:26.760> one<00:05:26.970> now<00:05:27.570> we're<00:05:27.720> onto<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:27.960> head
