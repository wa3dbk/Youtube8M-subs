00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.850 
how to play that way so the first chord
we're<00:00:35.540> going<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:35.720> need<00:00:35.899> is<00:00:36.079> e

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.810 

the<00:00:39.340> second<00:00:39.700> chord<00:00:40.020> C

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
the second chord C

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.380 
the second chord C
the<00:00:43.360> third<00:00:43.600> chord<00:00:43.900> is<00:00:44.140> it<00:00:44.710> d<00:00:45.090> but<00:00:46.090> it's<00:00:46.210> not<00:00:46.360> the

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
the third chord is it d but it's not the

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.170 
the third chord is it d but it's not the
standard<00:00:46.840> d<00:00:47.170> it's<00:00:47.680> actually<00:00:47.890> a<00:00:48.430> very<00:00:48.520> easy<00:00:48.940> D

standard d it's actually a very easy D

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.260 
standard d it's actually a very easy D
so<00:00:49.600> it's<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:49.900> same<00:00:50.550> formation<00:00:51.550> as<00:00:51.910> a<00:00:51.940> seat

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
so it's the same formation as a seat

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.380 
so it's the same formation as a seat
except<00:00:52.660> to<00:00:52.780> slide<00:00:53.050> it<00:00:53.200> up<00:00:53.290> a<00:00:53.410> whole<00:00:53.559> step<00:00:53.590> so

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
except to slide it up a whole step so

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:12.359 
except to slide it up a whole step so
deep<00:00:55.390> so<00:00:57.270> let's<00:00:58.270> sing<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:59.199> first<00:00:59.980> chorus<00:01:00.489> part
