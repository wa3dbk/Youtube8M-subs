update on my red cat sandstorm buggy

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.500 
update on my red cat sandstorm buggy
you'll<00:00:07.440> have<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.710> excuse<00:00:08.340> some<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.300> mess

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
you'll have to excuse some of the mess

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.470 
you'll have to excuse some of the mess
Here<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.840> am<00:00:10.050> working<00:00:10.500> on<00:00:10.940> mounting<00:00:11.940> probably<00:00:12.450> a

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
Here I am working on mounting probably a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.709 
Here I am working on mounting probably a
truck<00:00:12.840> body<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.559> top<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.969> which<00:00:15.540> I'll

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
truck body on top of it which I'll

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.660 
truck body on top of it which I'll
probably<00:00:15.870> post<00:00:16.199> some<00:00:16.440> videos<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.190> up<00:00:17.400> and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
probably post some videos of that up and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.519 
probably post some videos of that up and
how<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:17.850> do<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.270> probably<00:00:18.660> within<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.990> coming

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
how I do that probably within a coming

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.679 
how I do that probably within a coming
week<00:00:19.740> or<00:00:19.920> two<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.820> case<00:00:21.000> someone<00:00:21.300> wants<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.570> do

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
week or two in case someone wants to do

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.730 
week or two in case someone wants to do
that<00:00:21.810> it'd<00:00:21.930> probably<00:00:22.050> just<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> regular

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
that it'd probably just be a regular

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.380 
that it'd probably just be a regular
lexan<00:00:23.279> body<00:00:23.460> but<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:23.850> probably<00:00:24.240> gonna<00:00:24.330> be

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
lexan body but it's probably gonna be

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.380 
lexan body but it's probably gonna be
pretty<00:00:24.480> thin<00:00:25.019> but<00:00:25.320> what<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> wanted<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.820> show<00:00:27.359> to

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
pretty thin but what I wanted to show to

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.650 
pretty thin but what I wanted to show to
you<00:00:27.660> guys<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.140> did<00:00:28.500> do<00:00:28.740> an<00:00:29.130> update<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.539> you

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
you guys is I did do an update to it you

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.720 
you guys is I did do an update to it you
guys<00:00:30.840> know<00:00:31.050> I've<00:00:31.170> run<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.590> thing<00:00:31.859> brushed

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
guys know I've run this thing brushed

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.299 
guys know I've run this thing brushed
and<00:00:33.000> brushless<00:00:34.160> actually<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.280> two

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
and brushless actually with two

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.020 
and brushless actually with two
different<00:00:35.550> brushless<00:00:35.910> systems<00:00:37.610> before<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.790> get

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
different brushless systems before I get

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.720 
different brushless systems before I get
there<00:00:39.530> this<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.950> motor<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.610> normally

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
there this is the motor that it normally

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.940 
there this is the motor that it normally
comes<00:00:42.149> with<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.840> regular<00:00:43.320> stock<00:00:43.770> I

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
comes with it's just a regular stock I

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.209 
comes with it's just a regular stock I
think<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.340> exposed<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> 19<00:00:45.539> turn<00:00:46.219> 550

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
think it's exposed to be a 19 turn 550

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.580 
think it's exposed to be a 19 turn 550
sized<00:00:47.460> motor<00:00:47.850> which<00:00:48.600> when<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.110> run<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.469> as

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
sized motor which when you run it as

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.819 
sized motor which when you run it as
good<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:49.829> probably<00:00:50.309> about<00:00:50.870> 18<00:00:51.870> 19<00:00:51.899> miles<00:00:52.590> per

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
good for probably about 18 19 miles per

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.500 
good for probably about 18 19 miles per
hour<00:00:52.949> maybe<00:00:53.399> maybe<00:00:54.090> 20<00:00:54.600> even<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> lipo<00:00:56.510> so

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
hour maybe maybe 20 even with a lipo so

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.869 
hour maybe maybe 20 even with a lipo so
actually<00:00:58.050> what<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.859> went<00:00:59.070> ahead<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.460> did<00:00:59.609> was

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
actually what I went ahead and did was

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.420 
actually what I went ahead and did was
my<00:01:00.180> charge<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.719> off<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.079> background

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
my charge is going off in the background

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.840 
my charge is going off in the background
I<00:01:02.489> did<00:01:03.390> try<00:01:03.660> real<00:01:03.960> quick<00:01:04.260> with<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.830> Titan<00:01:05.369> 12

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
I did try real quick with the Titan 12

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.510 
I did try real quick with the Titan 12
turn<00:01:06.119> from<00:01:06.390> Traxxas<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.619> know<00:01:07.680> everyone

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
turn from Traxxas and I know everyone

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.940 
turn from Traxxas and I know everyone
who<00:01:08.670> has<00:01:08.880> these<00:01:09.150> does<00:01:09.510> say<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.140> they<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.530> burn

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
who has these does say that they do burn

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.760 
who has these does say that they do burn
out<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.369> them<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:12.869> too<00:01:13.140> much<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.680> a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
out on them and I'm not too much of a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.380 
out on them and I'm not too much of a
fan<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.189> buying<00:01:14.580> something<00:01:15.000> or<00:01:15.240> having

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
fan on buying something or having

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.640 
fan on buying something or having
something<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.810> having<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.110> burn<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
something and having it burn out and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.980 
something and having it burn out and
they'd<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.950> switch<00:01:17.159> all<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> out<00:01:17.610> so

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
they'd have to switch all that out so

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.130 
they'd have to switch all that out so
what<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.020> did<00:01:19.140> was<00:01:19.970> Helion<00:01:20.970> see<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.780> will

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
what I did was Helion see if this will

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.530 
what I did was Helion see if this will
show<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> little<00:01:22.530> bit<00:01:22.710> about<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.070> glaze<00:01:23.670> light

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
show a little bit about that glaze light

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.090 
show a little bit about that glaze light
on<00:01:24.720> there<00:01:25.100> Killian<00:01:26.100> has<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.729> 550<00:01:27.659> motor<00:01:28.560> as<00:01:28.799> well

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
on there Killian has a 550 motor as well

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.249 
on there Killian has a 550 motor as well
as<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.430> 12<00:01:29.640> turn<00:01:29.909> motor<00:01:30.180> now<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.049> tell<00:01:31.229> you

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
as a 12 turn motor now I can tell you

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.870 
as a 12 turn motor now I can tell you
guys<00:01:31.439> right<00:01:31.530> I'll<00:01:31.890> bet<00:01:32.130> when<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.340> got<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
guys right I'll bet when I got this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.270 
guys right I'll bet when I got this
motor<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.689> magnets<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.740> motor<00:01:34.979> were

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
motor the magnets in this motor were

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.569 
motor the magnets in this motor were
stronger<00:01:35.939> than<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.720> magnets<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
stronger than the magnets here and the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.179 
stronger than the magnets here and the
tighten<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.439> run<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.829> motor

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
tighten and I have run this motor

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.039 
tighten and I have run this motor
several<00:01:41.909> times<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> couple<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.930> other

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
several times and a couple of other

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.990 
several times and a couple of other
vehicles<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.220> actually<00:01:44.549> seems<00:01:44.820> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
vehicles and it actually seems to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.330 
vehicles and it actually seems to
perform<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.570> little<00:01:45.780> bit<00:01:45.960> better<00:01:46.229> then<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
perform a little bit better then the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.600 
perform a little bit better then the
tracks<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.790> tightened<00:01:48.320> 12<00:01:49.320> turn<00:01:49.619> motor<00:01:49.920> so

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
tracks is tightened 12 turn motor so

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.980 
tracks is tightened 12 turn motor so
what<00:01:50.790> I'm<00:01:50.880> gonna<00:01:51.000> do<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.450> I'm<00:01:51.570> gonna<00:01:51.689> go<00:01:51.899> ahead

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
