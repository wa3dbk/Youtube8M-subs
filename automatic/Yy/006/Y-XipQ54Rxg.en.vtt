 U 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.260
 to 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.690

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:39.940
 Hello, I am glad to see you at the bike market today. 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:46.570
 As simple as you are a general user 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:51.640
 Unhooking the pedal you are having difficulty, Joe Il-yeon is doing this work in the direction of oxygen 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.650
 It is very easy when you are a little confused about where you need to organize your menu 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.040
 What you need to study 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:01.200
 Let's get it together and take a break now. 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.410
 Yes that generally 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.250
 When 3 r is released 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:13.320
 So if we are now in midnight, do not do this 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:18.930
 Do not do this if the pedal pedal adjuster's just go in the same direction suitability 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:23.190
 4 When you have to sleep in the same direction when lock to lock the Crown Prince 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.390
 This way it will be locked like this. 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.520
 If then there is also opposed to the full and do not manage it the same 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.140
 Do not go all the way to the left nine minutes. 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.090
 You can think of it as a twiggy that loosens backwards and limits your pedals forward . 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.640
 I 'll show you the exam. 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.560
 And the passion is this type of pedal pedal r closed months or something life appearance 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.290
 It looks like a moon or shape 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.400
 Well this is almost common to the one who is studying to study almost one kind 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.750
 99% or more 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.590
 Here the distance # yiseohui difference Irish Spring body using the display panel 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:04.150
 I have a part to do this 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:08.940
 So I have inside, so let this thing over here on the side of 3 r7 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:14.140
 If you turn it in the direction, it will be the twig, then the one over there 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.820
 If you do this , you have the logic to do this, 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.170
 Can not 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:25.840
 Left to right, nine minutes, I got it confused and broke the other direction 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:28.420
 There's a part, but it's usually in a hurry . 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:34.750
 It is marked to be able to divide 9 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:38.470
 I thought you went on a bicycle, and the right side was lighted up . 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:43.750
 There's a whole new one on the left. 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:48.100
 Left, left bicycles propagation direction is small and l are rattling here 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.310
 cr Iran will not have to write a certain Elsa Elsa l of honey party in Gaza 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.330
 Now it is left to the rafters means Delft 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.220
 I will write. 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.630
 Ah 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:04.250
 Oh, all the time will reduce to his side of the pedal pedal not look toward Episode 7 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:10.550
 For certainly right that second I heard Joe embellish so loose 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:16.280
 And the Air Force said that as it is here , 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.960
 If you spend a lot of time studying our products, 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:24.170
 So you 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:28.340
 I see more so-to-bed-rise window and the other senior Other 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:33.800
 There is no device that can pull a rest beside the seals do you see on the side 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:36.170
 Each of these hexagons has a groove that allows the study to be entered. 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.610
 Most of this is broad 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:45.440
 8 Preview 8 shows the correct pre-populated correctly 8mm 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.680
 You can unlock Charlie, and then you can write dual less than this. 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.770
 there is 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.460
 It's 15 mm. That's obviously right. 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.850
 Then you get to the hole is right this is Yumi d 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:03.400
 We can unlock it by using secretly. 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:08.410
 So the term can be found very easily in 094 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:12.820
 What I know about four per 5,000 won and 4,000 won for example now 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:17.130
 I want Dongrim Jidi to come out . We'll buy that bike now. 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:21.520
 A tolerable haughty hex wrench to ask you can never be full because 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:27.550
 We all love each other now , and the bike itself is winding down the legs of the year. 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:31.320
 But increasingly because of the coiling of at least 15cm so given to the pool later 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.320
 Ahhah, they have to solve the length 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.410
 And now, to give you the power to do so, go to a professional shop now this 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:42.940
 I need to study these specials so I can get the box office . 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:47.310
 I can sell it in 15 days because the media can do it. 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.610
 It takes a lot of study to do this , 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.910
 It is the same 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:57.640
 Here, for example, to give the points to note 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:05:00.640
 If you lock it up at the end when you lock it up, 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:04.270
 Because it is applied, it can not be done. 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:09.610
 So be careful with about the middle when japeusil 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:11.870
 Itgoyo not go to the course's before the big catch in force when the dock 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.010
 Plus I'll 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:18.890
 Suh , I 'll try to solve it . 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:25.100
 And Cai 2 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:29.390
 Keulrikeu side of the pool when the main 10 points to get hurt here with this part touching hands 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:33.470
 I'm ready, so you have to wear gloves or on the other side. 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:38.180
 You'll need to be paid so that pressing the opposite side from the other side simhaejyeot 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:44.170
 Yes, it's a little easier now. 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.170
 If this does not work out, 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.509
 That we now bike 10 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:58.930
 If you think cows are a little hoarse right levers to the seesaw seesaw principle 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:03.910
 The principle of leverage is that it is the easiest to release at this point . 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:08.080
 When I get here like this , it 's hard to work out because it's moving. 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:14.030
 So the precise Park is dancing on the exterior 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:17.570
 I have you give it 3 released with almost the bounces ah Cry For 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:21.190
 This gave loose from the other side 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.190
 I'm sorry. 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:29.050
 Oh, grab a bike dont Kakegawa Dodge direction I told you, do not confuse 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:32.600
 You will 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.630
 Yes, I'm definitely sleeping . 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.630
 5 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:47.260
 Look at it and then use the study that suits you. 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:52.000
 If you look at this earlier Hexagon 2 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:55.840
 It was one of those two. 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.920
 It's got to be weighing on the background yumiri 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:05.740
 Day of the matter is cumbersome cushion firmly down direction 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:09.360
 Now that's one thing for me now, 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.360
 If yes , 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:18.320
 Please have pushed dancin

 You gotta let us do it now, you can win itguyo 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.590
 Weapons Now, if you tell me to use the pedal this year

 Then screw the song, please rejoice a little grease between the home the more noise 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.900
 Generated g key 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:41.060
 I can prevent anything and can use the pedal a little longer ah 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:44.000
 Full zest later when you respond, please feel free to just two points 

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.060
 There are nine products at the end . 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.060
 Yes
