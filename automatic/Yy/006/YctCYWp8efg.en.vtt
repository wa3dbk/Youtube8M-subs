00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
start off by making a new layer so you

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.179 
start off by making a new layer so you
can<00:00:24.900> press<00:00:25.230> out<00:00:25.710> come<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.430> J<00:00:26.970> up<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.900> control<00:00:28.320> J

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
can press out come on J up to control J

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.670 
can press out come on J up to control J
on<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.910> PC<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:31.309> name<00:00:32.309> really<00:00:33.350> so<00:00:34.350> there's<00:00:34.530> two

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
on a PC and name really so there's two

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.250 
on a PC and name really so there's two
ways<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:35.130> do<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> first<00:00:37.020> way

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
ways to do this this is the first way

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.310 
ways to do this this is the first way
that<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.500> know<00:00:37.620> how<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.780> using<00:00:39.780> go<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
that I know how to do it is using go to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.160 
that I know how to do it is using go to
your<00:00:40.559> tool<00:00:41.489> bar<00:00:41.670> along<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.239> choose<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
your tool bar along here and choose the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.549 
your tool bar along here and choose the
clone<00:00:43.440> tool<00:00:44.010> which<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:46.230> what

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
clone tool which is this one and what

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.889 
clone tool which is this one and what
the<00:00:46.680> clone<00:00:47.100> tool<00:00:47.370> does<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.420> copies<00:00:48.570> one

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
the clone tool does is it copies one

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.610 
the clone tool does is it copies one
target<00:00:49.379> area<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.610> another<00:00:50.760> area<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.620> for

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
target area on to another area so for

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.950 
target area on to another area so for
example<00:00:53.039> I'll<00:00:53.160> show<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:54.180> hold<00:00:54.510> down<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
example I'll show you just hold down the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.350 
example I'll show you just hold down the
Alt<00:00:55.199> key<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.800> then<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.370> get<00:00:56.489> your<00:00:56.610> target

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
Alt key and then you get your target

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.810 
Alt key and then you get your target
symbol<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.590> click<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.430> want<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> copy

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
symbol and click what you want to copy

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.229 
symbol and click what you want to copy
so<00:01:00.149> they<00:01:00.300> say<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> wanted<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.930> copy<00:01:01.079> si<00:01:02.239> release

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
so they say I wanted to copy si release

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.539 
so they say I wanted to copy si release
the<00:01:03.420> Alt<00:01:03.570> key<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.559> clip<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.070> then<00:01:05.280> move

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the Alt key and the clip and then move

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.420 
the Alt key and the clip and then move
to<00:01:05.580> another<00:01:05.790> area<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:07.110> flip<00:01:08.100> down<00:01:08.280> with

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
to another area and just flip down with

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.630 
to another area and just flip down with
your<00:01:08.520> mouse<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.880> paint<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.990> target<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.640> so

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
your mouse and paint the target on so

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.450 
your mouse and paint the target on so
you<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.150> copying<00:01:13.250> from<00:01:14.250> one

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you can see it's just copying from one

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.590 
you can see it's just copying from one
place<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.420> next

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
place to the next

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.900 
place to the next
so<00:01:17.600> that's<00:01:18.040> basically<00:01:19.040> how<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.280> use<00:01:19.550> a<00:01:19.580> pen

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
so that's basically how to use a pen

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.900 
so that's basically how to use a pen
tool<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:22.420> to<00:01:23.420> use<00:01:24.170> it<00:01:24.350> on<00:01:24.560> under<00:01:25.220> eye<00:01:25.280> bags<00:01:25.610> and

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
tool so to use it on under eye bags and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:33.390 
tool so to use it on under eye bags and
stuff<00:01:26.740> just<00:01:27.740> zoom<00:01:27.950> in<00:01:28.130> on<00:01:28.250> right

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.690 

then<00:01:33.970> I<00:01:34.650> usually<00:01:35.650> change<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.250> mode<00:01:36.460> to

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
then I usually change the mode to

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.970 
then I usually change the mode to
lighten<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:39.430> they<00:01:39.580> passed<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:40.090> down<00:01:40.300> to<00:01:41.130> 20%

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
lighten and they passed you down to 20%

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.080 
lighten and they passed you down to 20%
I'll<00:01:44.980> select<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.790> target<00:01:46.180> areas<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.840> same

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
I'll select the target areas the same

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.510 
I'll select the target areas the same
the<00:01:49.090> area<00:01:49.390> I<00:01:49.930> want<00:01:50.260> pain<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.770> stop<00:01:51.040> paying<00:01:51.310> to

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
the area I want pain to stop paying to

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.080 
the area I want pain to stop paying to
run<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.440> can<00:01:53.620> see<00:01:53.830> it<00:01:53.980> just<00:01:54.220> very

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
run and you can see it just very

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.710 
run and you can see it just very
slightly<00:01:55.570> lightens<00:01:56.260> up<00:01:56.380> yeah<00:01:57.100> so<00:01:57.610> I<00:01:58.330> start

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
slightly lightens up yeah so I start

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.260 
slightly lightens up yeah so I start
doing<00:01:58.900> it<00:01:59.080> rightly<00:01:59.320> so<00:01:59.680> that<00:01:59.710> I<00:01:59.830> can<00:02:00.100> build<00:02:01.000> up

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
doing it rightly so that I can build up

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.750 
doing it rightly so that I can build up
the<00:02:01.690> effect<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.470> can<00:02:05.680> just<00:02:05.860> get<00:02:06.070> rid<00:02:06.190> of<00:02:06.250> any

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
the effect and I can just get rid of any

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:15.830 
the effect and I can just get rid of any
of<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.150> shadows

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.960 

and<00:02:16.410> could<00:02:16.860> also<00:02:17.069> use<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.730> get<00:02:17.880> revenge

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
and could also use this to get revenge

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.229 
and could also use this to get revenge
so<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:18.690> type<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.590> up<00:02:19.680> right<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:19.980> get<00:02:20.880> back<00:02:21.060> to

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
so you type it up right and get back to

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:33.339 
so you type it up right and get back to
normal

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.580 

and<00:02:33.799> then<00:02:33.920> despite<00:02:34.250> on<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.610> Korea<00:02:34.939> pasta

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
and then despite on the Korea pasta

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:48.470 
and then despite on the Korea pasta
without<00:02:36.590> Australia

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.240 

it's<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:50.160> can<00:02:50.340> zoom<00:02:50.520> out<00:02:51.830> now<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.040> looks

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
it's and you can zoom out now that looks

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.500 
it's and you can zoom out now that looks
a<00:02:53.400> little<00:02:53.519> bit<00:02:53.760> safe<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.569> obvious<00:02:56.360> why<00:02:57.360> did

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
a little bit safe and obvious why did

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.699 
a little bit safe and obvious why did
you<00:02:57.629> take<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.989> down<00:02:58.140> with<00:02:58.379> quite<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> bit

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
you take it down with quite a bit

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.890 
you take it down with quite a bit
because<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.280> don't<00:02:59.459> like

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
because I don't like

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.070 
because I don't like
start<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.890> photoshop

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
start to photoshop

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.990 
start to photoshop
so<00:03:04.820> let<00:03:05.820> me<00:03:05.850> have<00:03:06.090> it

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.820 

and<00:03:10.750> possibly<00:03:11.110> more<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.710> was<00:03:12.180> down<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:14.650> can

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
and possibly more of it was down you can

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.270 
and possibly more of it was down you can
see<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.100> effects<00:03:15.790> better<00:03:16.060> with<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:21.160> the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
see the effects better with it so the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.030 
see the effects better with it so the
other<00:03:21.490> way<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:22.060> know<00:03:22.150> how<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.480> do<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:23.500> using

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
other way I know how to do it is using

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.430 
other way I know how to do it is using
the<00:03:24.340> patch<00:03:24.550> tool<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:25.000> say<00:03:25.270> click<00:03:26.140> on<00:03:26.350> the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
the patch tool you say click on the

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:36.240 
the patch tool you say click on the
background<00:03:26.620> again<00:03:29.040> command<00:03:30.040> +<00:03:30.400> J<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:34.800> then<00:03:35.800> go

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
background again command + J and then go

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.710 
background again command + J and then go
to<00:03:36.310> your<00:03:36.520> to<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.120> palette<00:03:39.270> go<00:03:40.270> to<00:03:40.330> where<00:03:40.600> there's

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
to your to a palette go to where there's

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.900 
to your to a palette go to where there's
a<00:03:40.840> picture<00:03:41.080> of<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.380> black<00:03:41.530> state<00:03:42.010> with<00:03:42.190> band-aid

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
a picture of a black state with band-aid

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.230 
a picture of a black state with band-aid
hold<00:03:43.900> that<00:03:44.110> down<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.650> scroll<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.850> choose<00:03:46.060> the

hold that down and scroll to choose the

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.550 
hold that down and scroll to choose the
patch<00:03:46.480> tool<00:03:46.780> which<00:03:47.170> is<00:03:47.410> this<00:03:47.560> for<00:03:47.830> me<00:03:49.440> what<00:03:50.440> the

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
patch tool which is this for me what the

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.080 
patch tool which is this for me what the
patch<00:03:50.770> tool<00:03:51.070> does<00:03:51.250> it's<00:03:51.460> a<00:03:51.550> little<00:03:51.760> bit<00:03:51.880> like

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
patch tool does it's a little bit like

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.300 
patch tool does it's a little bit like
the<00:03:52.330> clone<00:03:52.480> brush<00:03:52.810> except<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.590> determine<00:03:54.160> the

the clone brush except you determine the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
Connecticut's largest course for as you

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.850 
Connecticut's largest course for as you
like<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.950> what<00:04:00.160> it<00:04:00.280> does<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.610> looks<00:04:00.640> at<00:04:01.060> the

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
like and what it does it looks at the

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.170 
like and what it does it looks at the
area<00:04:02.860> around<00:04:03.070> your<00:04:03.280> selected<00:04:03.700> area<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:04.060> the

area around your selected area and the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.890 
area around your selected area and the
pictures<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:06.400> creates<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:07.360> similar

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
pictures and it creates a similar

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.650 
pictures and it creates a similar
texture<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:08.830> that<00:04:08.860> which<00:04:09.400> is<00:04:09.550> around<00:04:09.670> with

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
texture to that which is around with

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.200 
texture to that which is around with
everything

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
everything

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.870 
everything
but<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.930> say<00:04:13.140> you<00:04:13.200> could<00:04:13.530> rate<00:04:13.740> and<00:04:14.010> say<00:04:14.610> with

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
but to say you could rate and say with

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.880 
but to say you could rate and say with
the<00:04:15.060> patch<00:04:15.570> tool<00:04:15.930> just<00:04:16.110> click<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.710> hold<00:04:17.660> down

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
the patch tool just click and hold down

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.210 
the patch tool just click and hold down
the<00:04:19.890> cursor<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.720> then<00:04:21.900> draw<00:04:22.260> exactly<00:04:22.560> where

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
the cursor and then draw exactly where

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.810 
the cursor and then draw exactly where
you<00:04:23.400> want<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:25.110> take<00:04:25.380> something<00:04:25.920> away

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.750 

and<00:04:29.350> make<00:04:30.350> sure<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:30.860> meet<00:04:31.460> up<00:04:32.420> to<00:04:32.720> make<00:04:32.870> a<00:04:33.760> full

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
and make sure you meet up to make a full

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
and make sure you meet up to make a full
enclosed<00:04:35.300> area<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:38.330> then<00:04:39.970> zoom<00:04:40.970> out<00:04:41.120> what

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
enclosed area and then zoom out what

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.390 
enclosed area and then zoom out what
I'll<00:04:41.900> probably<00:04:42.020> do<00:04:42.410> is<00:04:42.440> pick<00:04:42.860> an<00:04:43.010> eye<00:04:43.100> on<00:04:43.340> the

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
I'll probably do is pick an eye on the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.420 
I'll probably do is pick an eye on the
floor<00:04:43.780> to<00:04:44.780> change<00:04:45.050> this<00:04:45.530> I<00:04:45.710> really<00:04:46.070> because

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
floor to change this I really because

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.360 
floor to change this I really because
it's<00:04:46.580> quite<00:04:46.820> smoothly<00:04:47.500> so<00:04:50.710> flipped<00:04:51.710> inside

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
it's quite smoothly so flipped inside

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.920 
it's quite smoothly so flipped inside
the<00:04:52.700> dotted<00:04:53.150> area<00:04:53.450> and<00:04:53.900> drag<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:54.740> area<00:04:54.920> out

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
the dotted area and drag the area out

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.820 
the dotted area and drag the area out
and<00:04:56.930> you<00:04:57.020> can<00:04:57.170> see<00:04:57.350> there<00:04:57.530> it's<00:04:57.710> just

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
and you can see there it's just

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.070 
and you can see there it's just
replacing<00:04:58.490> it<00:04:58.580> with<00:04:58.730> before<00:04:59.480> head<00:04:59.630> I<00:04:59.660> know

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
replacing it with before head I know

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.480 
replacing it with before head I know
it's<00:05:00.230> not<00:05:00.350> going<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:00.620> look<00:05:00.710> exactly<00:05:00.830> like<00:05:01.340> that

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
it's not going to look exactly like that

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.630 
it's not going to look exactly like that
because<00:05:02.000> it<00:05:02.150> will<00:05:02.830> look<00:05:03.830> at<00:05:04.040> their<00:05:04.220> pictures

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
because it will look at their pictures

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.520 
because it will look at their pictures
around<00:05:04.880> like<00:05:05.090> I<00:05:05.210> said<00:05:05.390> before<00:05:05.510> and<00:05:05.840> connection

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
around like I said before and connection

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.300 
around like I said before and connection
blended<00:05:06.950> in<00:05:07.720> so<00:05:08.720> just<00:05:09.140> let<00:05:09.350> go<00:05:09.560> wherever<00:05:09.890> you

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
blended in so just let go wherever you

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.620 
blended in so just let go wherever you
know<00:05:10.570> to<00:05:11.570> use

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.010 

and<00:05:15.140> their<00:05:15.320> lips<00:05:16.000> blended<00:05:17.000> a<00:05:17.090> little<00:05:17.120> bit<00:05:17.810> with

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
and their lips blended a little bit with

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.920 
and their lips blended a little bit with
what<00:05:18.410> surrounded<00:05:18.980> so<00:05:19.400> come<00:05:20.210> on<00:05:20.360> deeds<00:05:20.690> or

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
what surrounded so come on deeds or

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.520 
what surrounded so come on deeds or
deselect<00:05:21.290> the<00:05:21.590> area<00:05:22.450> it<00:05:23.450> is<00:05:23.630> a<00:05:23.660> little<00:05:24.110> bit<00:05:24.260> too

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
deselect the area it is a little bit too

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.270 
deselect the area it is a little bit too
much<00:05:26.050> so<00:05:27.050> I<00:05:27.080> would<00:05:27.230> take<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.680> epoxy<00:05:28.040> down<00:05:28.250> a

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
much so I would take the epoxy down a

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.570 
much so I would take the epoxy down a
bit<00:05:28.550> and<00:05:29.120> you<00:05:29.600> can<00:05:29.660> see<00:05:30.280> some<00:05:31.280> of<00:05:31.310> the

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
bit and you can see some of the

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.900 
bit and you can see some of the
background<00:05:32.420> image<00:05:32.660> coming<00:05:32.990> through<00:05:33.850> so<00:05:34.850> I

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
background image coming through so I

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.420 
background image coming through so I
usually<00:05:35.120> use<00:05:35.660> this<00:05:35.870> one<00:05:36.110> because<00:05:36.920> it's<00:05:37.190> a<00:05:37.280> lot

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
usually use this one because it's a lot

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.090 
usually use this one because it's a lot
quicker<00:05:38.170> but<00:05:39.170> if<00:05:39.290> you<00:05:39.410> wanted<00:05:39.650> to<00:05:39.800> do<00:05:39.950> it

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
quicker but if you wanted to do it

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:50.180
