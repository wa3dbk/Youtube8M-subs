to put a stretch on the static nerve
normally<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.969> could<00:00:45.149> lift<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.539> leg<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
normally we could lift the leg the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.479 
normally we could lift the leg the
entire<00:00:46.020> way<00:00:46.500> off<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.890> table<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.399> there

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
entire way off the table and there

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.330 
entire way off the table and there
should<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.730> no<00:00:47.940> pain<00:00:48.329> if<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:49.230> patient<00:00:49.739> has<00:00:49.980> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
should be no pain if a patient has a

should be no pain if a patient has a
pinched<00:00:51.000> sciatic<00:00:51.390> nerve<00:00:51.840> at<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.110> lumbar

spine or up around that area of the hip
you<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.559> aggravate<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.489> pain<00:00:56.760> by<00:00:57.180> putting<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
you can aggravate that pain by putting a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.569 
you can aggravate that pain by putting a
stretching<00:00:58.109> force<00:00:58.379> by<00:00:58.590> rate<00:00:58.859> raising<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> leg

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
stretching force by rate raising the leg

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.180 
stretching force by rate raising the leg
so<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.809> shouldn't<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.320> able<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> lift<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.890> leg

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
so we shouldn't be able to lift that leg

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.799 
so we shouldn't be able to lift that leg
the<00:01:02.340> entire<00:01:02.430> way<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.210> there's<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.510> problem
