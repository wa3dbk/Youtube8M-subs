00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.370
 Y 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.529
 hey I get it once in my head 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.640
 I repeat or when I enter your false 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.349
 promises 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.480
 I am as always to put things 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.910
 clear the points about the i's the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.160
 letters on the table miss more 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.190
 be with her to have her on but 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.110
 I swore that she would not fall a tear 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.050
 typical as Monday return to routine 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.780
 that's my life, just listen and imagine 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.210
 cycles and changes nights that I do not control 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.610
 put in a zulo when I think being 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.980
 only what they say out there 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.739
 believe it in lacoste I take them in the 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.020
 pocket not in the cool pole 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.210
 Sometimes I'm short of breath and there's no other 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.149
 to pull and clench your teeth with 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.100
 parents never belittle anyone who does not 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.229
 You will be better for missing me 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.509
 You turn on words that escape between 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.979
 puffs on a Friday releasing silk 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.619
 Maybe they want to be free 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.450
 drunkenness and arcades interspersed every 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.820
 night there is no money for waste in 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.250
 me for old habits sometimes I get 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.740
 go other times I come from more you do not deserve 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.670
 demand more and you before you do not give it and that is 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.100
 all at the end 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.350
 We seek welfare to be well with the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.560
 colleagues who give the others hype 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.020
 there I hope you stay in life take out 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.850
 two tickets to get out of the routine and 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.890
 in the middle of the journey I reconsidered 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.110
 intestines I have chosen the right path 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.390
 to guide you in this life a suicide 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.970
 I suffer when it is not necessary sometimes 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.250
 important medium other times in the middle 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.659
 the rope a gave but not learned the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.930
 lesson always changing my mind 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.180
 how to take me seriously gives me phobia 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.920
 growing up and getting older and see that 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.470
 have truncated my dreams of when I was a 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.750
 I raise to give all that you do not scratch you deserved 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.929
 something better and everything I think and if not with the 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.569
 head made a mess smile of very few 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.360
 They are me I trust that I keep that 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.819
 What I got with my kids came to us 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.000
 Prince pious you are nobody and nobody 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.210
 It's going to take away my thing. Nobody is going to 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.210
 remove mine 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.210
