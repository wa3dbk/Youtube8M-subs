00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.729 
of GI Joe three and three-quarter inch
figures<00:02:18.129> so<00:02:18.430> when<00:02:19.090> he's<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.420> child<00:02:19.870> size<00:02:20.319> I<00:02:20.349> mean

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
figures so when he's a child size I mean

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.800 
figures so when he's a child size I mean
that<00:02:20.950> makes<00:02:21.189> him<00:02:21.430> even<00:02:21.939> smaller<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:22.629> you're

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
that makes him even smaller so you're

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.990 
that makes him even smaller so you're
looking<00:02:23.140> at<00:02:23.290> just<00:02:23.530> over<00:02:23.769> two<00:02:24.189> inches<00:02:24.670> here

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
looking at just over two inches here

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.030 
looking at just over two inches here
very<00:02:25.719> very<00:02:25.810> small<00:02:26.349> indeed

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
very very small indeed

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.330 
very very small indeed
but<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.549> sculpt<00:02:27.939> is<00:02:28.030> very<00:02:28.329> nice<00:02:28.799> in<00:02:29.799> terms<00:02:30.159> of

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
but the sculpt is very nice in terms of

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.179 
but the sculpt is very nice in terms of
articulation<00:02:31.150> he<00:02:32.049> can<00:02:32.260> turn<00:02:32.469> his<00:02:32.769> head<00:02:32.980> left

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
articulation he can turn his head left

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.679 
articulation he can turn his head left
and<00:02:33.549> right<00:02:34.049> so<00:02:35.049> he<00:02:35.590> can<00:02:36.030> look<00:02:37.030> out<00:02:37.269> for<00:02:37.299> any

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
and right so he can look out for any

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.860 
and right so he can look out for any
incoming<00:02:38.549> Pteranodons

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
incoming Pteranodons

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.720 
incoming Pteranodons
he's<00:02:40.870> got<00:02:41.670> arms<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.939> rotate<00:02:43.469> 360<00:02:44.469> so<00:02:45.189> you<00:02:45.250> can

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
he's got arms that rotate 360 so you can

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.920 
he's got arms that rotate 360 so you can
have<00:02:46.000> him<00:02:46.239> doing<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.109> YMCA<00:02:48.389> he<00:02:49.389> does<00:02:49.659> come

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
have him doing the YMCA he does come

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.470 
have him doing the YMCA he does come
with<00:02:50.049> this<00:02:50.230> little<00:02:50.650> torch<00:02:51.099> but<00:02:51.819> unfortunately

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
with this little torch but unfortunately

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.300 
with this little torch but unfortunately
it's<00:02:52.629> molded<00:02:53.049> into<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.349> plastic<00:02:53.439> it's<00:02:54.069> not<00:02:54.099> an

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
it's molded into the plastic it's not an

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.479 
it's molded into the plastic it's not an
accessory<00:02:54.819> so<00:02:55.209> you're<00:02:56.200> forced<00:02:56.680> for<00:02:56.919> him<00:02:57.099> to

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
accessory so you're forced for him to

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.449 
accessory so you're forced for him to
permanently<00:02:58.180> hold<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:59.739> torch<00:03:00.040> which<00:03:00.310> is

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
permanently hold the torch which is

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.390 
permanently hold the torch which is
something<00:03:00.639> I'm<00:03:00.819> never<00:03:01.000> keen<00:03:01.389> on<00:03:01.889> he<00:03:02.889> can<00:03:03.069> twist

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
something I'm never keen on he can twist

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.909 
something I'm never keen on he can twist
the<00:03:04.269> waist<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.989> that's<00:03:05.590> where<00:03:05.829> the

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:05.919 
the waist and that's where the

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.250 
the waist and that's where the
articulation<00:03:06.609> stops<00:03:07.030> guys<00:03:07.329> bit

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
articulation stops guys bit

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.309 
articulation stops guys bit
disappointing<00:03:09.239> but<00:03:10.239> in<00:03:10.450> terms<00:03:10.719> of<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.930> sculpt

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
disappointing but in terms of the sculpt

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.649 
disappointing but in terms of the sculpt
he's<00:03:11.469> very<00:03:11.739> very<00:03:11.980> nice<00:03:12.280> another<00:03:13.120> thing<00:03:13.389> it's

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
he's very very nice another thing it's

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.839 
he's very very nice another thing it's
very<00:03:13.930> difficult<00:03:14.379> to<00:03:14.650> actually<00:03:14.769> pose<00:03:15.280> him<00:03:15.639> I'll

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
very difficult to actually pose him I'll

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.089 
very difficult to actually pose him I'll
see<00:03:16.030> if<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.209> can<00:03:16.329> get<00:03:16.510> him<00:03:16.599> to<00:03:16.689> stand<00:03:17.069> tried<00:03:18.069> a

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
see if I can get him to stand tried a

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.149 
see if I can get him to stand tried a
couple<00:03:18.549> times<00:03:18.760> unsuccessfully<00:03:19.470> there<00:03:20.470> we<00:03:20.620> go

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
couple times unsuccessfully there we go

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.009 
couple times unsuccessfully there we go
that's<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.879> first<00:03:22.120> time<00:03:22.299> I've<00:03:22.449> gone<00:03:22.569> to<00:03:22.780> stand

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
that's the first time I've gone to stand

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.520 
that's the first time I've gone to stand
so<00:03:23.650> there<00:03:24.519> we<00:03:24.609> go<00:03:24.760> he<00:03:25.090> does<00:03:25.299> lean<00:03:25.959> forward

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
so there we go he does lean forward

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.770 
so there we go he does lean forward
somewhat<00:03:26.979> but<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.579> can<00:03:27.849> make<00:03:28.239> him<00:03:28.479> stand

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
somewhat but you can make him stand

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.559 
somewhat but you can make him stand
fantastic<00:03:29.709> his<00:03:30.129> sculpt<00:03:30.639> is<00:03:30.790> actually<00:03:31.269> pretty

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
fantastic his sculpt is actually pretty

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:32.000 
fantastic his sculpt is actually pretty
good

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
good

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.339 
good
I'd<00:03:33.010> say<00:03:33.189> the<00:03:33.340> likeness<00:03:33.549> is<00:03:34.060> actually<00:03:34.479> pretty

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
I'd say the likeness is actually pretty

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.339 
I'd say the likeness is actually pretty
close<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.979> the<00:03:36.099> original<00:03:36.579> actor<00:03:37.030> I<00:03:37.599> would<00:03:37.930> say

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
close to the original actor I would say

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.469 
close to the original actor I would say
he<00:03:38.709> looks<00:03:38.949> a<00:03:39.069> little<00:03:39.159> bit<00:03:39.310> smaller<00:03:39.939> in<00:03:40.209> terms

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:40.479 
he looks a little bit smaller in terms

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.420 
he looks a little bit smaller in terms
of<00:03:40.629> his<00:03:40.750> build<00:03:41.049> than<00:03:41.439> the<00:03:41.560> original<00:03:42.040> boy<00:03:42.220> who

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
of his build than the original boy who

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.580 
of his build than the original boy who
played<00:03:42.639> him<00:03:42.879> I<00:03:43.060> would<00:03:43.989> say<00:03:44.109> this<00:03:44.229> one<00:03:44.409> looks

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
played him I would say this one looks

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.619 
played him I would say this one looks
more<00:03:44.709> like<00:03:44.859> a<00:03:44.949> younger<00:03:45.220> version<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.909> him<00:03:46.120> but

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
more like a younger version of him but

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.030 
more like a younger version of him but
in<00:03:46.750> terms<00:03:46.989> of<00:03:47.139> the<00:03:47.229> sculpt<00:03:47.590> work<00:03:47.769> that<00:03:47.949> they

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
in terms of the sculpt work that they

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.710 
in terms of the sculpt work that they
put<00:03:48.069> into<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.489> shirt<00:03:48.909> there<00:03:49.209> you<00:03:49.299> can<00:03:49.479> see<00:03:49.689> all

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
put into the shirt there you can see all

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.140 
put into the shirt there you can see all
that<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.439> creases<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.370> folds<00:03:51.849> really

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
that the creases and the folds really

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.149 
that the creases and the folds really
nice<00:03:52.359> you<00:03:53.079> can<00:03:53.229> see<00:03:53.349> the<00:03:53.439> backpack<00:03:53.650> that's

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
really good as well the the detail that

really good as well the the detail that
they've<00:04:21.400> gone<00:04:21.549> into<00:04:21.789> on<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.750> sculpt<00:04:23.110> is

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
they've gone into on the sculpt is

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.740 
they've gone into on the sculpt is
actually<00:04:23.529> very<00:04:23.680> very<00:04:24.039> impressive<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:24.969> despite

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
actually very very impressive so despite

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.879 
actually very very impressive so despite
the<00:04:25.870> bad<00:04:26.050> articulation

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
the bad articulation

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.459 
the bad articulation
he's<00:04:27.520> actually<00:04:27.729> not<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.150> bad<00:04:28.360> little<00:04:28.810> sculpt

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:29.469 
he's actually not a bad little sculpt

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:33.270 
he's actually not a bad little sculpt
and<00:04:29.650> here's<00:04:30.009> his<00:04:30.159> little<00:04:30.460> torch<00:04:31.949> so<00:04:32.949> you<00:04:33.009> can

and here's his little torch so you can
see<00:04:33.689> detail<00:04:34.689> on<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:34.990> torch<00:04:35.289> there<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:36.479> here's

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
see detail on the torch there and here's

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.800 
see detail on the torch there and here's
his<00:04:37.629> other<00:04:37.870> hand<00:04:38.520> so<00:04:39.520> yeah<00:04:39.849> pretty<00:04:40.330> nice<00:04:40.569> in

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
his other hand so yeah pretty nice in

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.200 
his other hand so yeah pretty nice in
terms<00:04:40.840> of<00:04:41.229> detail<00:04:41.650> here's<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.729> Alpha

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
terms of detail here's the Alpha

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.270 
terms of detail here's the Alpha
Pteranodon<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:43.960> comes<00:04:44.229> with<00:04:44.530> Eric<00:04:44.830> Kirby

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
Pteranodon that comes with Eric Kirby

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.059 
Pteranodon that comes with Eric Kirby
and<00:04:45.479> he's<00:04:46.479> a<00:04:46.539> little<00:04:46.960> bit<00:04:47.139> disappointing<00:04:47.949> I

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
and he's a little bit disappointing I

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:50.730 
and he's a little bit disappointing I
have<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:48.490> say<00:04:48.759> in<00:04:49.240> terms<00:04:49.689> of<00:04:49.870> articulation

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
have to say in terms of articulation

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.600 
have to say in terms of articulation
he's<00:04:50.949> very<00:04:51.250> simple<00:04:51.930> his<00:04:52.930> head<00:04:53.199> can<00:04:53.530> turn<00:04:53.610> from

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
he's very simple his head can turn from

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.709 
he's very simple his head can turn from
left<00:04:54.879> to<00:04:55.030> right<00:04:55.389> and<00:04:57.360> his<00:04:58.360> arms<00:04:58.900> can<00:04:59.349> extend

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:00.719 
left to right and his arms can extend

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:04.730 
left to right and his arms can extend
like<00:05:01.719> so<00:05:02.080> as<00:05:02.349> far<00:05:02.590> as<00:05:02.740> you<00:05:02.830> want<00:05:02.860> them<00:05:03.189> to<00:05:03.219> go

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
like so as far as you want them to go

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.820 
like so as far as you want them to go
it's<00:05:05.740> a<00:05:05.830> bit<00:05:06.069> ugly<00:05:06.250> that<00:05:06.699> I'm<00:05:07.289> not<00:05:08.289> to<00:05:08.439> impress

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
it's a bit ugly that I'm not to impress

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.360 
it's a bit ugly that I'm not to impress
with<00:05:09.039> that<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:10.810> wings<00:05:11.080> are<00:05:11.319> made<00:05:11.800> from<00:05:12.159> like<00:05:12.340> a

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
with that the wings are made from like a

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.390 
with that the wings are made from like a
rubbery<00:05:12.879> material<00:05:13.710> so<00:05:14.710> you<00:05:15.069> can<00:05:15.250> actually

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
rubbery material so you can actually

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.420 
rubbery material so you can actually
bend<00:05:15.939> them<00:05:16.210> like<00:05:16.240> this

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
bend them like this

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.189 
bend them like this
stop<00:05:18.430> sort<00:05:18.789> of<00:05:18.849> here<00:05:19.270> because<00:05:19.990> of<00:05:20.110> the

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
stop sort of here because of the

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.649 
stop sort of here because of the
rigidity<00:05:20.500> of<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:21.039> plastic<00:05:21.580> but<00:05:22.270> these<00:05:22.449> are

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:22.659 
rigidity of the plastic but these are

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.709 
rigidity of the plastic but these are
very<00:05:22.689> bendy<00:05:23.409> so<00:05:24.069> I<00:05:24.370> mean<00:05:24.639> it's<00:05:24.939> a<00:05:25.150> cool<00:05:25.330> action

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:25.719 
very bendy so I mean it's a cool action

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:30.029 
very bendy so I mean it's a cool action
figure<00:05:26.319> it's<00:05:26.620> not<00:05:27.509> outstanding<00:05:28.509> in<00:05:29.469> terms<00:05:29.830> of

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
figure it's not outstanding in terms of

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.800 
figure it's not outstanding in terms of
this<00:05:30.189> being<00:05:30.250> sort<00:05:30.909> of<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.000> gimmick<00:05:31.509> of<00:05:31.659> the

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
this being sort of the gimmick of the

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.260 
this being sort of the gimmick of the
action<00:05:32.169> figure<00:05:32.680> it's<00:05:33.370> it's<00:05:33.759> a<00:05:33.940> bit<00:05:34.120> of<00:05:34.210> a

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
action figure it's it's a bit of a

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.570 
action figure it's it's a bit of a
letdown<00:05:34.509> if<00:05:34.900> I'm<00:05:35.080> honest<00:05:35.440> getting<00:05:36.190> a<00:05:36.279> closer

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
letdown if I'm honest getting a closer

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.149 
letdown if I'm honest getting a closer
look<00:05:37.000> at<00:05:37.180> the<00:05:37.389> the<00:05:37.900> pteranodon<00:05:38.409> sculpt<00:05:39.009> you

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
look at the the pteranodon sculpt you

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:40.829 
look at the the pteranodon sculpt you
can<00:05:39.310> see<00:05:39.610> that<00:05:39.789> it's<00:05:39.940> actually<00:05:40.089> really<00:05:40.599> nicely

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:40.839 
can see that it's actually really nicely

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.629 
can see that it's actually really nicely
done<00:05:41.229> and<00:05:41.409> the<00:05:41.500> level<00:05:41.800> of<00:05:41.919> artistry<00:05:42.250> that's

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
done and the level of artistry that's

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.339 
done and the level of artistry that's
gone<00:05:42.819> into<00:05:43.029> this<00:05:43.270> thing<00:05:43.479> is<00:05:43.629> really<00:05:44.080> really

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
gone into this thing is really really

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.680 
gone into this thing is really really
good<00:05:44.680> you<00:05:45.400> can<00:05:45.430> see<00:05:45.789> all<00:05:45.879> the<00:05:46.029> folds<00:05:46.569> and

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
good you can see all the folds and

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.719 
good you can see all the folds and
creases<00:05:46.960> that<00:05:47.349> have<00:05:47.589> been<00:05:47.740> sculpted<00:05:48.339> in<00:05:48.460> there

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
creases that have been sculpted in there

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.610 
creases that have been sculpted in there
it's<00:05:49.330> just<00:05:49.419> a<00:05:49.690> shame<00:05:49.960> that<00:05:50.169> this<00:05:50.319> sort<00:05:50.560> of

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
it's just a shame that this sort of

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.209 
it's just a shame that this sort of
level<00:05:50.979> of<00:05:51.300> artistry<00:05:52.300> has<00:05:53.139> been<00:05:53.379> wasted<00:05:53.889> on<00:05:54.039> a

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:54.219 
level of artistry has been wasted on a

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.480 
level of artistry has been wasted on a
figure<00:05:54.639> that<00:05:54.669> really<00:05:55.150> does<00:05:55.360> very<00:05:55.659> little<00:05:56.490> but

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
figure that really does very little but

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.189 
figure that really does very little but
I<00:05:57.520> suppose<00:05:58.000> you<00:05:58.029> know<00:05:58.330> it's<00:05:58.509> it's<00:05:58.779> a<00:05:58.870> dinosaur

00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 
I suppose you know it's it's a dinosaur

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.579 
I suppose you know it's it's a dinosaur
figure<00:05:59.680> it<00:05:59.800> does<00:05:59.830> its<00:06:00.189> job<00:06:00.250> and<00:06:01.110> it's<00:06:02.110> probably

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:02.589 
figure it does its job and it's probably

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:04.260 
figure it does its job and it's probably
more<00:06:02.770> than<00:06:02.949> you'd<00:06:03.129> get<00:06:03.310> on<00:06:03.430> a<00:06:03.460> museum<00:06:04.000> piece

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
more than you'd get on a museum piece

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.829 
more than you'd get on a museum piece
but<00:06:05.050> for<00:06:05.529> a<00:06:05.560> drastic<00:06:05.949> park<00:06:06.129> toy<00:06:06.550> I<00:06:06.849> expect<00:06:07.719> a

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:07.839 
but for a drastic park toy I expect a

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:11.070 
but for a drastic park toy I expect a
sort<00:06:08.080> of<00:06:08.139> a<00:06:08.259> different<00:06:08.740> level<00:06:08.949> of<00:06:10.080> playability

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
sort of a different level of playability

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.429 
sort of a different level of playability
and<00:06:11.529> I'd<00:06:11.620> say<00:06:11.830> this<00:06:11.979> one<00:06:12.219> lacks<00:06:12.550> that<00:06:13.479> so<00:06:14.259> the

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:14.439 
and I'd say this one lacks that so the

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:16.469 
and I'd say this one lacks that so the
only<00:06:14.469> redeeming<00:06:15.099> feature<00:06:15.490> of<00:06:15.849> this<00:06:16.089> action

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
only redeeming feature of this action

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.420 
only redeeming feature of this action
figure<00:06:16.810> is<00:06:17.050> the<00:06:17.199> fact<00:06:17.439> that<00:06:17.529> you<00:06:17.710> can<00:06:17.860> reenact

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
figure is the fact that you can reenact

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.269 
figure is the fact that you can reenact
the<00:06:18.729> scene<00:06:18.759> from<00:06:19.330> the<00:06:19.449> film<00:06:19.839> with<00:06:20.529> Eric<00:06:20.889> Kirby

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:21.279 
the scene from the film with Eric Kirby

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:23.459 
the scene from the film with Eric Kirby
where<00:06:21.699> he's<00:06:21.819> picked<00:06:22.150> up<00:06:22.360> by<00:06:22.689> the<00:06:22.750> Pteranodon

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:23.469 
where he's picked up by the Pteranodon

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:25.860 
where he's picked up by the Pteranodon
and<00:06:23.500> carried<00:06:24.039> off<00:06:24.250> the<00:06:24.969> only<00:06:25.150> thing<00:06:25.539> is<00:06:25.689> it's

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
and carried off the only thing is it's

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.300 
and carried off the only thing is it's
actually<00:06:26.050> really<00:06:26.500> difficult<00:06:26.740> with<00:06:27.189> this

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
actually really difficult with this

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.820 
actually really difficult with this
rubbery<00:06:27.699> plastic<00:06:27.939> to<00:06:28.449> actually<00:06:28.779> get<00:06:28.960> Eric<00:06:29.650> to

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
rubbery plastic to actually get Eric to

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.309 
rubbery plastic to actually get Eric to
stay<00:06:30.250> in<00:06:30.550> the<00:06:30.669> grip<00:06:30.939> of<00:06:31.089> the<00:06:31.150> Pteranodon<00:06:31.750> what

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 
stay in the grip of the Pteranodon what

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.079 
stay in the grip of the Pteranodon what
I<00:06:32.409> tend<00:06:32.650> to<00:06:32.740> do<00:06:32.919> is<00:06:33.069> just<00:06:33.219> lightly<00:06:33.520> place<00:06:33.909> him

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:34.089 
I tend to do is just lightly place him

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.420 
I tend to do is just lightly place him
in<00:06:34.240> there<00:06:34.389> and<00:06:34.419> then<00:06:34.719> hang<00:06:35.080> him<00:06:35.289> but<00:06:36.009> it<00:06:36.250> only

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
in there and then hang him but it only

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.450 
in there and then hang him but it only
takes<00:06:36.759> a<00:06:36.969> small<00:06:37.120> knock<00:06:37.509> to<00:06:38.169> actually<00:06:38.620> take<00:06:38.919> him

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
takes a small knock to actually take him

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.700 
takes a small knock to actually take him
off<00:06:39.550> the<00:06:40.270> pteranodon<00:06:40.840> it<00:06:40.990> it's<00:06:41.169> not<00:06:41.380> like<00:06:41.590> the

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
off the pteranodon it it's not like the

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.879 
off the pteranodon it it's not like the
Pteranodon<00:06:42.160> has<00:06:42.430> a<00:06:42.460> strong<00:06:43.120> grip<00:06:43.600> I<00:06:43.900> suppose

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:44.889 
Pteranodon has a strong grip I suppose

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:46.230 
Pteranodon has a strong grip I suppose
maybe<00:06:45.100> they<00:06:45.280> designed<00:06:45.639> it<00:06:45.759> this<00:06:45.850> way<00:06:46.030> so<00:06:46.090> that

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
maybe they designed it this way so that

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.490 
maybe they designed it this way so that
you<00:06:46.360> could<00:06:46.600> sort<00:06:46.780> of<00:06:46.810> pick<00:06:47.020> him<00:06:47.169> up<00:06:47.259> and<00:06:47.440> carry

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
you could sort of pick him up and carry

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.350 
you could sort of pick him up and carry
him<00:06:47.770> off<00:06:47.979> but<00:06:48.220> the<00:06:48.520> Pteranodon<00:06:48.970> would<00:06:49.120> need<00:06:49.270> to

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
him off but the Pteranodon would need to

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.290 
him off but the Pteranodon would need to
be<00:06:49.479> flying<00:06:49.840> backwards<00:06:50.880> for<00:06:51.880> that<00:06:52.000> to<00:06:52.180> be

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
be flying backwards for that to be

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.930 
be flying backwards for that to be
possible<00:06:52.509> so<00:06:53.400> yeah<00:06:54.569> not<00:06:55.569> the<00:06:55.900> most<00:06:56.080> impressive

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
possible so yeah not the most impressive

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.980 
possible so yeah not the most impressive
gimmick<00:06:58.560> no<00:06:59.560> missile<00:06:59.949> firing<00:07:00.370> device<00:07:00.990> with

have<00:07:04.810> it<00:07:04.930> guys<00:07:04.960> that's<00:07:05.440> the<00:07:05.560> action<00:07:06.160> figure

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
have it guys that's the action figure

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.110 
have it guys that's the action figure
for<00:07:06.729> Erik<00:07:07.180> Kirby<00:07:07.720> with<00:07:08.620> alpha<00:07:09.250> Pteranodon<00:07:09.970> and

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
for Erik Kirby with alpha Pteranodon and

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.629 
for Erik Kirby with alpha Pteranodon and
I<00:07:10.449> have<00:07:10.630> to<00:07:10.810> say<00:07:11.020> overall<00:07:11.650> I'd<00:07:12.099> say<00:07:12.130> this<00:07:12.430> is<00:07:12.490> a

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 
I have to say overall I'd say this is a

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:14.939 
I have to say overall I'd say this is a
bit<00:07:12.880> of<00:07:13.000> a<00:07:13.060> disappointing<00:07:13.780> figure<00:07:14.229> it<00:07:14.560> doesn't

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:14.949 
bit of a disappointing figure it doesn't

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:17.339 
bit of a disappointing figure it doesn't
come<00:07:15.130> with<00:07:15.310> enough<00:07:15.699> to<00:07:16.270> make<00:07:16.479> this<00:07:16.690> a<00:07:16.750> drastic

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:17.349 
come with enough to make this a drastic

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:20.189 
come with enough to make this a drastic
park<00:07:17.560> toy<00:07:17.949> for<00:07:18.520> me<00:07:18.669> it<00:07:18.970> feels<00:07:19.360> more<00:07:19.660> like<00:07:19.720> a

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 
park toy for me it feels more like a

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:24.360 
park toy for me it feels more like a
Burger<00:07:20.800> King<00:07:20.919> or<00:07:21.340> McDonald's<00:07:21.449> toy<00:07:23.099> but<00:07:24.099> you

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.370 
Burger King or McDonald's toy but you

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.370 
Burger King or McDonald's toy but you
know<00:07:24.490> the<00:07:24.699> sculpt<00:07:25.120> is<00:07:25.240> really<00:07:25.570> good<00:07:25.780> and<00:07:26.020> the

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:26.380 
know the sculpt is really good and the

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.370 
know the sculpt is really good and the
design<00:07:26.800> of<00:07:26.830> the<00:07:27.400> both<00:07:27.880> pieces<00:07:28.210> is<00:07:28.780> really<00:07:28.810> good

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:29.380 
design of the both pieces is really good

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.350 
design of the both pieces is really good
it's<00:07:30.009> just<00:07:30.070> a<00:07:30.310> shame<00:07:30.610> that<00:07:30.639> the<00:07:31.060> actual

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 
it's just a shame that the actual

it's just a shame that the actual
features<00:07:31.720> the<00:07:31.840> articulation<00:07:32.650> and<00:07:32.860> the
