00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 do not 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.490
 let's see a very important step in the 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.110
 edition and in the selection of 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.780
 images we can send 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.540
 our photos to clients or publishers of 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.670
 image and they are going to judge our 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.170
 I work to see if they like what 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.060
 We are doing if you like 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.759
 images but they will tend to 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.770
 try to give us some nuance about 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.739
 our work and move it to its point 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.200
 of view that can be very good and can 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.239
 be the worst thing that can happen to you because 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.280
 really you have a point of view and 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.200
 they have another and usually they 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.800
 how are those who pay will end 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.110
 winning the battle 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.480
 It is important that when we 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.690
 let's send pictures, do not limit yourself to 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.000
 send our images in jpg quality 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.519
 compressed directly from row without 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.340
 try absolutely nothing if we 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.620
 we send a raul directly weird is a 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.629
 neutral file and being neutral what 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.420
 we do is that they see a product 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.710
 super neutral is to say from that 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.500
 moment they are going to make a 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.909
 interpretation about our photo and if 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.759
 we are going to put a little bit of 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.590
 Contrast or convert to black and white 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.450
 they will be able to comment and they will be able to 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.340
 tell you is that I do not see it so 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.100
 contrasted I like more what I 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.259
 You sent me, I am more in favor of sending 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.450
 a more personal project a project already 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.360
 more or less routed so that they 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.009
 start to see where we were going as 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.929
 we see we have this image with the 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.780
 symbol in the upper right 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.890
 that has already been manipulated in raw camera 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.390
 I'm going to open the photo 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.180
 we have this image 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.909
 if we go here we see that we have tone 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.979
 Colored or black and white are three 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.159
 options in this case let's see the 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.990
 original image this is the original this 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.640
 is the color image a bit more 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.070
 rescued a little bit of dominant no 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.979
 I'm looking for a perfect result 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.960
 I'm looking for an approximation to what 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.450
 that I have thought is going to be this 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.369
 project obviously I already have to 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.250
 have premeditated at that time before 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.420
 of sending editor I select anyone 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.789
 of the three in this case I'm going to 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.180
 select the color made us appear 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.390
 the image exactly as it was before 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.280
 I select the photo and with control 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.209
 let's develop settings copy 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.170
 settings I have the settings copied 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.260
 I select two images for example 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.910
 these two 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.830
 develop settings paste settings 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.680
 I'm going to tell you to hit all - 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.580
 exhibition we could leave the exhibition 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.460
 we're not going to actually stop 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.490
 here we could omit any detail 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.590
 of the image now we have the three 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.330
 matched images all three are 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.900
 manipulated we will select with 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.940
 control we take control and we see the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.130
 three images with the same air this 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.410
 is a little bit darker I do not think that 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.090
 we have no problem the editor is going to 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.950
 understand that there are more luminous photos and 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.050
 darker but simply what 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.570
 we have done is to make a 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.340
 next challenge course that now 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.860
 we could go to our window 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.370
 export could we selected these 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.040
 three photos and send these three photos to 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.440
 editor that tells us another option then 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.180
 exactly as we have seen this 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.120
 image that is the pattern that I have taken 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.340
 of reference had different styles 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.170
 we do the same thing we go to black and white 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.020
 let's give a golden tone that I like 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.180
 plus 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:36.500
 we remove him in fact we go back we copy 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.500
 develop settings copy settings 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.050
 at that time I would have sent the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.060
 three photos with the color tone a 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.590
 little bit of saturated and with a tad of 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.630
 dominant yellowish and then you 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.050
 I could send these others and in this case 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.760
 yes that would give a little freedom to 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.590
 I like both styles with both 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.570
 styles I see it in color this way 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.760
 I could have looked at it from 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.620
 this way but choose the editor 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.870
 that for that it gives us freedom and has 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.790
 made an order is a way that I 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.800
 I think it should be valued when it comes to 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.870
 work professionally or work from 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.880
 amateur way very easily already 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.459
 we can see how everything will be routed in 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.950
 this report we can see a photo that 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.510
 work really well in color or a 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.580
 photo that works really well in 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.890
 black and white this in fashion also 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.260
 it works especially well to do these 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.260
 adjustments is especially easy let's 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.990
 trying on the same image 345 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.919
 adjustments and we see it in a way 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.540
 especially good and a photo that 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.130
 will work in color and another that 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.780
 will work in black and white of this 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.550
 way we simply have to retouch 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.350
 one in camera raw we do it 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.540
 especially fast and then we copy 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.540
 adjustments and we paste adjustments in the other
