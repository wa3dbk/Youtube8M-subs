00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.320
 musical games 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.880
 a continuing education offer for teachers of music schools and of 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.039
 general education elementary schools 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:15.230
 because you want to experience first-hand how these games are played like they are 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.310
 then, in the truest sense of the word, they can tear them off the whirlpool 

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:21.230
 just play yourself 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.130
 Surely they will feel in this training as well as they the 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.690
 Lust of the game can spur on musical excellence 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.160
 Such musical games as almost every music educator ever in 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.780
 integrated his lessons 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.290
 to motivate his students to learn a little better 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.220
 can 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.540
 Starting point to a musical problem 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.010
 So you could solve this problem with the help of a game easier 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.020
 However, the opposite way of thinking seems to be much more promising 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.910
 his 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.480
 because there are children playing the decades sometimes even centuries 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.140
 have survived and even in today's technological time with a lot 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.690
 Fun great stamina and high concentration can be played 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.860
 The game rules of these games can be filled with musical content 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.010
 and so children learn in music and instrumental lessons with just 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.050
 such fun with perseverance and concentration 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.110
 an example 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.080
 For sure you know that you are on your way to Jerusalem on free chairs 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.700
 set as soon as the music stops 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.640
 as unmusical 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.119
 to do this honor 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.990
 if, for example, they sat down yesterday if they had a specific one 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.190
 Recognize intervals or when the students are playing the homework 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.070
 then implement it 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.530
 a Tiemeyer thing that makes a mistake in the foreplay 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.310
 You will experience that even the success and students are visible 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.990
 that become critical when it comes to the question 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.130
 Oberstaufen still right or Stone wrong 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.720
 And so by the way the musical claim of the student increases 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.020
 clearly even bean that this noticed 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.999
 Do you know how to play the cold ice? 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:13.260
 Charles Chalet the Hammer is even warmer 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.140
 to call or even gifts and the Crescendi to play 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:22.789
 while Ronald and 16 runs do well or other technical content 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:28.329
 which, for example, increase their pace basically on the region just because 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.159
 the game partner then the big chance from the deceptive even before the 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.159
 Get hold of the landscape 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.789
 compare the expression of this girl 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.959
 At least twelfth round in the game fruit salad a rhythm right 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.030
 wants to clap with the facial expressions of one of her students in the regular 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:55.239
 Round hour clapping with real quarter and eighth note image 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:59.289
 they can not imagine that 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:01.379
 then they certainly have not experienced 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.609
 the seasoned music teacher seemingly completely detached from any 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:06.949
 self-control 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:09.639
 only aim at remaining empty chair 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.789
 Malone because they know next to a child recognized 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.799
 they would rather experience the games in a hands-on way with students 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.299
 no problem 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.299
 Just invite your students to this training 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.800
 and in the implementation teacher against students then they have the largest 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.599
 Learning success and the most intense experience 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.339
 complemented by this training program of musical games 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.940
 theoretical explanations of the learning behavior 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.900
 to the question of losing must or even to organizational 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.849
 requirements 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.240
 they also learn 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.240
 to be able to perform each game in several variations 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:49.010
 but not only 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.669
 this is the same games circumnavigate one goes now 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:57.069
 but also that one and the same game can be played both in groups and in individual 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.649
 and rich can be played 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:02.369
 They should be interested in a varied and entertaining 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:03.920
 Have further education 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.500
 every teacher at once as well as something in their lessons altogether 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.980
 We can look forward to your call soon 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.290
