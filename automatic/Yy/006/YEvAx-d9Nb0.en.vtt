going to introduce at some point an
amendment<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.250> strike<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.970> from<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.270> bill

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
amendment to strike it from the bill

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.260 
amendment to strike it from the bill
we've<00:01:51.230> got<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.620> votes<00:01:51.800> to<00:01:51.920> defeat<00:01:52.220> that<00:01:52.400> we

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
we've got the votes to defeat that we

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.300 
we've got the votes to defeat that we
got<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.540> devotes<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.050> feet<00:01:54.230> that<00:01:54.380> then<00:01:55.100> the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
got to devotes the feet that then the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.640 
got to devotes the feet that then the
Republicans<00:01:56.060> if<00:01:56.270> they<00:01:56.510> are<00:01:56.720> as<00:01:56.960> foolish<00:01:57.260> as<00:01:57.380> I

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
Republicans if they are as foolish as I

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.800 
Republicans if they are as foolish as I
think<00:01:57.890> they<00:01:58.010> may<00:01:58.220> be<00:01:58.280> then<00:01:59.030> they<00:01:59.270> may<00:01:59.480> try<00:01:59.750> to

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
think they may be then they may try to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.630 
think they may be then they may try to
hold<00:01:59.930> up<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.500> defense<00:02:00.860> authorization<00:02:01.040> bill

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
hold up the defense authorization bill

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.330 
hold up the defense authorization bill
and<00:02:02.200> they're<00:02:03.200> going<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:03.410> probably<00:02:03.650> filibuster

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
and they're going to probably filibuster

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.510 
and they're going to probably filibuster
that<00:02:04.550> I<00:02:04.760> believe<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:06.080> at<00:02:06.260> that<00:02:06.290> point<00:02:06.770> the

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
that I believe that at that point the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.120 
that I believe that at that point the
issue<00:02:07.729> is<00:02:08.119> are<00:02:08.420> these<00:02:08.570> guys<00:02:08.929> so<00:02:09.470> out<00:02:09.770> there

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
issue is are these guys so out there

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.610 
issue is are these guys so out there
that<00:02:11.120> they're<00:02:11.420> willing<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.870> punish<00:02:12.440> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
that they're willing to punish the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.290 
that they're willing to punish the
Defense<00:02:12.980> Department<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.910> fighting

the frame we have enough votes to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
it as hard as we can in terms of the the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.280 
it as hard as we can in terms of the the
timing<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.550> if<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.910> goes<00:02:34.180> as<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:35.110> say

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
timing of that if that goes as you say

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.810 
timing of that if that goes as you say
it's<00:02:35.440> possible<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.280> could<00:02:36.370> go<00:02:36.550> if<00:02:36.670> that

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
it's possible that it could go if that

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.460 
it's possible that it could go if that
repeal<00:02:37.180> happens<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.750> timing<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.350> the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
repeal happens the timing is that the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.780 
repeal happens the timing is that the
Defense<00:02:38.740> Department<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.220> studying<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.610> issue

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
Defense Department is studying the issue

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.180 
Defense Department is studying the issue
through<00:02:40.600> December<00:02:41.230> they've<00:02:41.680> got<00:02:41.860> another<00:02:42.100> I

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
through December they've got another I

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.400 
through December they've got another I
think<00:02:42.280> 60<00:02:43.270> days<00:02:43.450> or<00:02:43.720> something<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.260> they

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
think 60 days or something that they

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.440 
think 60 days or something that they
after<00:02:45.070> which<00:02:45.220> they<00:02:45.430> would<00:02:45.580> have<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.730> delay<00:02:46.150> any

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
after which they would have to delay any

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.000 
after which they would have to delay any
repeal<00:02:46.900> process<00:02:47.320> so<00:02:47.410> we'd<00:02:47.530> be<00:02:47.620> looking<00:02:47.770> at

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
repeal process so we'd be looking at

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.950 
repeal process so we'd be looking at
best-case<00:02:48.910> scenario<00:02:49.300> for<00:02:49.330> repeal<00:02:49.750> would<00:02:49.840> be

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
best-case scenario for repeal would be

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.260 
best-case scenario for repeal would be
sometime<00:02:50.320> in<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.560> spring<00:02:50.680> with<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.640> cut<00:02:51.880> with

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
sometime in the spring with the cut with

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.970 
sometime in the spring with the cut with
the<00:02:52.300> policy<00:02:52.780> under<00:02:52.990> such<00:02:53.230> intense<00:02:53.710> scrutiny

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
the policy under such intense scrutiny

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.010 
the policy under such intense scrutiny
that<00:02:54.400> study<00:02:55.180> underway<00:02:55.480> at<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.750> Defense

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
the courts and politically why not

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.440 
the courts and politically why not

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
is happening toward ending the policy

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.390 
is happening toward ending the policy
because<00:03:13.180> that<00:03:13.690> is<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.200> compromise<00:03:15.129> we

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
because that is the compromise we

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.100 
because that is the compromise we

everybody's<00:03:20.680> looking<00:03:21.010> for<00:03:21.040> in<00:03:21.489> my<00:03:22.060> view<00:03:22.120> if<00:03:22.660> I

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
everybody's looking for in my view if I

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.440 
everybody's looking for in my view if I
could<00:03:23.410> just<00:03:23.440> wave<00:03:23.860> a<00:03:23.890> wand<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:25.030> was<00:03:25.180> just<00:03:25.269> be

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
could just wave a wand it was just be

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.660 
could just wave a wand it was just be
flat<00:03:25.720> repealed<00:03:26.140> no<00:03:27.040> one<00:03:27.190> else<00:03:27.310> maybe<00:03:27.519> we

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
flat repealed no one else maybe we

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.670 
flat repealed no one else maybe we
should<00:03:27.849> spend<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.180> everyone<00:03:28.900> suspended<00:03:29.560> would

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
should spend it everyone suspended would

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.610 
should spend it everyone suspended would
be<00:03:29.799> able<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:30.010> come<00:03:30.099> back<00:03:30.310> if<00:03:30.459> they<00:03:30.580> wanted<00:03:30.879> to

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
be able to come back if they wanted to

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.289 
be able to come back if they wanted to
but<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.769> truth<00:03:32.980> of<00:03:33.099> the<00:03:33.220> matter<00:03:33.340> is<00:03:33.519> we<00:03:33.910> had<00:03:34.180> to

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
but the truth of the matter is we had to

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.869 
but the truth of the matter is we had to
build<00:03:34.569> a<00:03:34.750> consensus<00:03:34.959> for<00:03:35.500> this<00:03:35.680> working<00:03:36.670> very
