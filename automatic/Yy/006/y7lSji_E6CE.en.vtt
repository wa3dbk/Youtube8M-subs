the wheel front wheels move but these

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.380 
the wheel front wheels move but these
ones<00:00:29.039> if<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.340> try<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.580> move<00:00:29.789> them<00:00:29.910> they<00:00:30.090> break

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
ones if you try to move them they break

ones if you try to move them they break
off<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.489> yeah<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:34.260> only<00:00:34.500> articulate<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
off so yeah the only articulate and the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.280 
off so yeah the only articulate and the
fork<00:00:36.450> thing<00:00:37.230> articulation<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.840> grab<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> Lego

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
fork thing articulation is grab a Lego

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.119 
fork thing articulation is grab a Lego
piece<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:42.170> put<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.379> there<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.829> it

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
piece like this put it on there and it

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.660 
piece like this put it on there and it
doesn't<00:00:44.489> slide<00:00:44.730> up<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.210> goes<00:00:45.809> up<00:00:46.399> like<00:00:47.399> that

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.299 

so<00:00:50.670> yeah<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.809> transform<00:00:55.469> them<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.890> extra

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
so yeah and so transform them it's extra

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.750 
so yeah and so transform them it's extra
simple<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.920> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.160> his<00:00:59.280> gun<00:00:59.520> as

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
simple this is going to be his gun as

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.130 
simple this is going to be his gun as
you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.570> holes<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:03.140> flip

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
you can see the little holes and flip

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.250 
you can see the little holes and flip
the<00:01:04.530> legs<00:01:04.769> out<00:01:06.799> so<00:01:08.180> that<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.540> almost<00:01:09.900> see

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the legs out so that you can almost see

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.340 
the legs out so that you can almost see
all<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.280> transformation<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.570> then<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.140> on

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
all the transformation and then you on

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.560 
all the transformation and then you on
go<00:01:14.010> out<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:16.040> not<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.360> it's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
go out like that not like this so it's

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:28.990 
go out like that not like this so it's
like<00:01:23.180> like<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.570> he<00:01:24.720> has<00:01:24.810> big<00:01:26.150> bulky<00:01:27.590> arms

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
like like that so he has big bulky arms

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.350 
like like that so he has big bulky arms
so<00:01:30.259> put<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> weapon<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.869> goes<00:01:34.320> back

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
so put the weapon you this goes back

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.280 
so put the weapon you this goes back
closer<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.470> assembly<00:01:37.890> then<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.390> tab

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
closer to the assembly then you just tab

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:51.220 
closer to the assembly then you just tab
it<00:01:40.500> into<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.869> part<00:01:42.869> over<00:01:43.200> here

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:57.280 

get<00:01:52.230> a<00:01:52.260> closer<00:01:52.530> look<00:01:52.650> there<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.850> there<00:01:54.510> is

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.810 

boom<00:01:58.290> boom<00:01:59.810> later
