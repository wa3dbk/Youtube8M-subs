right off the bat you're getting

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.910 
right off the bat you're getting
presumably<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.139> better<00:00:13.349> deal<00:00:13.530> because<00:00:13.710> this

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
presumably a better deal because this

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.950 
presumably a better deal because this
will<00:00:14.009> start<00:00:14.219> at<00:00:14.370> 499<00:00:14.849> that's<00:00:15.540> going<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.750> give

will start at 499 that's going to give
you<00:00:16.109> an<00:00:16.379> atom<00:00:16.650> processor<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.279> going<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.490> cost

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
you an atom processor it's going to cost

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.310 
you an atom processor it's going to cost
a<00:00:17.760> little<00:00:17.910> bit<00:00:18.029> more<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.570> get<00:00:18.690> core<00:00:18.960> i<00:00:18.990> three

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
a little bit more to get core i three

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.290 
a little bit more to get core i three
and<00:00:19.350> 4i<00:00:19.650> five<00:00:19.980> power<00:00:20.220> but<00:00:20.850> there<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.119> lot<00:00:21.270> of
