we're looking at a cornfield this is a

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.589 
we're looking at a cornfield this is a
factory<00:00:06.600> farm<00:00:09.110> and<00:00:10.110> we<00:00:10.230> could<00:00:10.380> see<00:00:10.530> corn<00:00:11.599> now

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
factory farm and we could see corn now

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.960 
factory farm and we could see corn now
this<00:00:12.809> corn<00:00:14.839> isn't<00:00:15.839> directly<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.310> use<00:00:17.550> for

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
this corn isn't directly in the use for

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.320 
this corn isn't directly in the use for
humans<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:20.060> for<00:00:21.060> they<00:00:21.930> give<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.350> to

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
humans but it is for they give this to

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:32.540 
humans but it is for they give this to
cows<00:00:24.330> chickens<00:00:28.789> pigs<00:00:31.219> don't<00:00:32.219> do<00:00:32.279> they<00:00:32.399> give

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
cows chickens pigs don't do they give

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.520 
cows chickens pigs don't do they give
them<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.730> dogs<00:00:32.940> though<00:00:34.040> however<00:00:35.690> I've<00:00:36.690> seen

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
them to dogs though however I've seen

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.350 
them to dogs though however I've seen
them<00:00:37.860> spraying<00:00:38.399> pesticides<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:41.340> corn

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.389 

lots<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.570> pesticides<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:47.719> these<00:00:48.719> are<00:00:48.989> foods

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
lots of pesticides and these are foods

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.830 
lots of pesticides and these are foods
in<00:00:50.399> which<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.510> eaten<00:00:52.350> by<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.550> pigs<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.510> such

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
in which are eaten by the pigs and such

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.680 
in which are eaten by the pigs and such
and<00:00:55.820> thus<00:00:56.820> would<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.360> get<00:00:58.879> cows<00:00:59.879> when<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.449> eat

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
and thus would we get cows when we eat

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.959 
and thus would we get cows when we eat
cows<00:01:00.989> which<00:01:01.260> are<00:01:01.440> called<00:01:01.739> beef<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.579> are<00:01:02.730> eating

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
cows which are called beef we are eating

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.789 
cows which are called beef we are eating
what<00:01:03.300> they<00:01:03.359> are<00:01:03.690> eating<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.559> what

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
what they are eating and this is what

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.550 
what they are eating and this is what
they<00:01:05.040> are<00:01:05.220> eating<00:01:05.430> at<00:01:06.360> least<00:01:06.540> some<00:01:06.990> cows<00:01:07.260> will

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
they are eating at least some cows will

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.210 
they are eating at least some cows will
be<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.880> farm<00:01:09.240> spans<00:01:09.869> for<00:01:10.260> many<00:01:10.710> many

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
be and this farm spans for many many

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.700 
be and this farm spans for many many
acres<00:01:13.340> but<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> way<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.549> see<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.710> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
acres but the way I see it is the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.399 
acres but the way I see it is the
pesticides<00:01:17.340> stop<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.990> insects<00:01:19.530> from<00:01:19.890> eating

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
pesticides stop the insects from eating

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.149 
pesticides stop the insects from eating
totally<00:01:22.409> big-time<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.159> it

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
totally big-time so because of that it

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.830 
totally big-time so because of that it
to<00:01:26.970> me<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.990> playing<00:01:28.320> God's<00:01:28.920> work<00:01:32.840> which

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
to me is like playing God's work which

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.780 
to me is like playing God's work which
means<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.770> animals<00:01:35.310> will<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.520> going

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
means that the animals will be going

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.520 
means that the animals will be going
through<00:01:35.970> many<00:01:36.119> transitional<00:01:36.840> changes<00:01:37.380> which

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
through many transitional changes which

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.910 
through many transitional changes which
the<00:01:37.710> world<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.310> through<00:01:38.340> anyway<00:01:39.890> but<00:01:40.890> I

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the world is going through anyway but I

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.789 
the world is going through anyway but I
have<00:01:41.130> not<00:01:41.280> seen<00:01:41.640> many<00:01:41.850> people<00:01:42.680> having<00:01:43.680> their

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
have not seen many people having their

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.490 
have not seen many people having their
own<00:01:43.829> gardens

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500

go up the grid instead they go to their

our food the nutrasweet all of the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.840 
our food the nutrasweet all of the
aspartame<00:03:04.620> which<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> same<00:03:05.310> thing<00:03:05.610> you

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
aspartame which is the same thing you

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.150 
aspartame which is the same thing you
can<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.180> list<00:03:06.390> goes<00:03:06.630> on<00:03:07.850> but

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.360 

I<00:03:11.720> don't<00:03:12.720> like<00:03:12.900> seeing<00:03:13.290> every<00:03:13.740> year<00:03:14.070> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
I don't like seeing every year the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.370 
I don't like seeing every year the
machine<00:03:14.940> come<00:03:15.240> by<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.600> spraying<00:03:16.020> chemicals

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
machine come by and spraying chemicals

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.030 
machine come by and spraying chemicals
on<00:03:16.860> here<00:03:19.040> but<00:03:20.040> they<00:03:20.160> say<00:03:20.550> that<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:22.650> makes<00:03:22.860> the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
on here but they say that it makes the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.910 
on here but they say that it makes the
quality<00:03:23.460> of<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.600> food<00:03:24.900> better<00:03:25.530> because

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
quality of the food better because

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.890 
quality of the food better because
insects<00:03:26.520> don't<00:03:26.850> eat<00:03:27.120> them<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:27.510> yet<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.870> are

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
insects don't eat them and yet you are

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.700 
insects don't eat them and yet you are
eating<00:03:28.260> them<00:03:29.540> yourself<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:30.840> does<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.440> quality

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
eating them yourself so does the quality

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.600 
eating them yourself so does the quality
get<00:03:32.070> better<00:03:32.340> instead<00:03:32.850> of<00:03:33.920> taking<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.040> food<00:03:35.250> or

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
get better instead of taking the food or

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.190 
get better instead of taking the food or
the<00:03:35.820> certain<00:03:36.180> amounts<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:36.780> were<00:03:36.900> eaten<00:03:37.170> by

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
the certain amounts that were eaten by

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.360 
the certain amounts that were eaten by
insect<00:03:37.740> insects<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.670> then<00:03:40.250> putting<00:03:41.250> that

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
insect insects and then putting that

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.510 
insect insects and then putting that
into<00:03:41.700> some<00:03:42.510> sort<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.750> compost<00:03:43.470> or<00:03:43.950> giving<00:03:44.400> it

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
into some sort of compost or giving it

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.340 
into some sort of compost or giving it
to<00:03:44.640> animals<00:03:44.970> no<00:03:45.390> we<00:03:45.660> just<00:03:45.930> have<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.200> put

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
to animals no we just have to put

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.720 
to animals no we just have to put
pesticides<00:03:46.950> on<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.460> that<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:49.080> foods<00:03:52.730> our

in not oh well what can you do but we
live<00:06:02.289> in<00:06:02.320> a<00:06:02.470> world<00:06:03.090> that's<00:06:04.090> filled<00:06:04.510> with

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
live in a world that's filled with

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.650 
live in a world that's filled with
insanity<00:06:06.599> so<00:06:07.599> in<00:06:07.750> order<00:06:08.020> to<00:06:08.760> get<00:06:09.760> sanity<00:06:10.450> back

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
insanity so in order to get sanity back

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.700 
insanity so in order to get sanity back
in<00:06:10.960> my<00:06:11.200> opinion<00:06:11.970> whether<00:06:12.970> it<00:06:13.270> be<00:06:13.479> based<00:06:13.870> on<00:06:14.200> the

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
in my opinion whether it be based on the

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.690 
in my opinion whether it be based on the
foods<00:06:15.070> that<00:06:15.310> we<00:06:15.490> eat<00:06:16.770> whether<00:06:17.770> it<00:06:18.010> be<00:06:18.130> based<00:06:18.370> on

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
foods that we eat whether it be based on

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.310 
foods that we eat whether it be based on
how<00:06:19.000> we<00:06:19.060> run<00:06:19.450> our<00:06:19.510> economic<00:06:20.349> conditions<00:06:21.070> and

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
how we run our economic conditions and

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.500 
how we run our economic conditions and
so<00:06:23.320> many<00:06:23.770> other<00:06:24.099> different<00:06:24.460> things<00:06:27.510> the

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
so many other different things the

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.879 
so many other different things the
humanities<00:06:29.139> got<00:06:29.470> to<00:06:29.620> start<00:06:30.330> making<00:06:31.330> positive

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
humanities got to start making positive

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:38.550 
humanities got to start making positive
decisions<00:06:34.770> looking<00:06:35.770> at<00:06:35.889> facts<00:06:36.280> and<00:06:37.410> then<00:06:38.410> in

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
decisions looking at facts and then in

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.710 
decisions looking at facts and then in
analyzing<00:06:39.550> the<00:06:39.639> facts<00:06:39.940> so<00:06:40.180> we<00:06:40.210> look<00:06:40.479> at<00:06:40.599> the

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
analyzing the facts so we look at the

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.640 
analyzing the facts so we look at the
facts<00:06:41.080> of<00:06:41.440> what<00:06:41.590> is<00:06:41.710> put<00:06:41.979> in<00:06:42.130> this<00:06:42.220> food<00:06:42.610> and

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
facts of what is put in this food and

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.610 
facts of what is put in this food and
think<00:06:44.650> wait<00:06:44.860> a<00:06:44.919> second<00:06:45.370> here<00:06:46.470> look<00:06:47.470> at<00:06:47.590> what

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
think wait a second here look at what

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.740 
think wait a second here look at what
this<00:06:47.919> is<00:06:48.070> causing<00:06:49.110> the<00:06:50.110> chain<00:06:50.500> of<00:06:50.680> animals

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.770 

look<00:06:54.750> at<00:06:54.870> what<00:06:54.990> this<00:06:55.110> is<00:06:55.169> causing<00:06:56.659> for<00:06:57.659> the

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
look at what this is causing for the

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.040 
look at what this is causing for the
effects<00:06:58.169> of<00:06:58.759> how<00:06:59.759> we<00:06:59.819> eat<00:07:00.150> our<00:07:00.330> foods<00:07:00.659> what

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
effects of how we eat our foods what

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.640 
effects of how we eat our foods what
kind<00:07:01.439> of<00:07:01.620> health<00:07:01.949> effects<00:07:02.340> it<00:07:02.490> has<00:07:03.530> and<00:07:04.530> when

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
kind of health effects it has and when

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.429 
kind of health effects it has and when
this<00:07:04.770> can<00:07:04.949> happen<00:07:05.159> I<00:07:05.430> think<00:07:05.460> we<00:07:05.759> can<00:07:05.879> live<00:07:06.000> in<00:07:06.120> a

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:06.439 
this can happen I think we can live in a

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:09.159 
this can happen I think we can live in a
much<00:07:07.439> better<00:07:08.099> world

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:09.169 
much better world

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.140 
much better world
