00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.770
 I also tried 105 recently on it food 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.299

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.299

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.160

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.510

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.020

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:56.490

 arc on which the canister hangs 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.639
 extra little yellow well 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.780
 arcs protect from everything 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.780
 such here 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.060

 Well, everything is a motorcycle 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.080
 meant for 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.080
 Named currents for long journeys 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:11.900

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:15.920
 Navigator charging mount under 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.920

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.930
 there is what else you need by the way if you know 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.530
 about some more extra 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.560

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.280
 need for long trips write 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:36.770

 says crazy on the road at all 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.360
 but the footstep of the central thing is very 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.360
 useful 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:28.380
