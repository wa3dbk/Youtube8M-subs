00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
close together i can preview them all

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.330 
close together i can preview them all
with<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> one<00:00:42.120> piece<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.980> only<00:00:44.129> show

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
with the one piece of you I we only show

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.330 
with the one piece of you I we only show
one<00:00:44.579> at<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.360> time<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.260> show<00:00:46.469> basic<00:00:47.010> stats

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
one at a time so we can show basic stats

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
one at a time so we can show basic stats
so<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.090> shield<00:00:48.360> has<00:00:48.660> two

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.700 
so I can see that this shield has two
protection<00:00:49.649> as<00:00:50.219> well<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.610> +1<00:00:50.940> defense<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:52.649> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
protection as well as +1 defense so you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.510 
protection as well as +1 defense so you
can<00:00:52.829> get<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.980> quick<00:00:53.640> grasp<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.180> what<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:55.520> core

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
can get a quick grasp of what the core

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.770 
can get a quick grasp of what the core
features<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.090> piece<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> loose<00:00:57.570> are

features of that piece of loose are

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.810 
features of that piece of loose are
without<00:00:58.109> even<00:00:58.350> having<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.590> pick<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:58.920> but

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
without even having to pick it up but

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.369 
without even having to pick it up but
what<00:00:59.940> I<00:00:59.969> might<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.329> pick<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.989> shield

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
acts of legends we've also got some

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.320 
acts of legends we've also got some
common<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:56.990> junk<00:03:57.440> items<00:03:57.770> below<00:03:58.280> as<00:03:58.760> well<00:03:58.820> I

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
common and junk items below as well I

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.090 
common and junk items below as well I
might<00:03:59.840> hold<00:04:00.050> on<00:04:00.110> to<00:04:00.170> those<00:04:00.350> and<00:04:00.620> sell<00:04:00.800> them<00:04:00.980> at

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
might hold on to those and sell them at

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.330 
might hold on to those and sell them at
a<00:04:01.130> later<00:04:01.160> point<00:04:02.950> so<00:04:03.950> if<00:04:04.010> we<00:04:04.040> go<00:04:04.160> into<00:04:04.250> my

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
a later point so if we go into my

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.900 
a later point so if we go into my
shields<00:04:05.470> shields<00:04:06.470> are<00:04:06.710> special<00:04:07.520> because<00:04:07.640> they

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
shields shields are special because they

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.240 
shields shields are special because they
actually<00:04:08.090> have<00:04:08.540> only<00:04:09.290> one<00:04:09.560> modifier<00:04:10.040> and

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
actually have only one modifier and

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.000 
actually have only one modifier and
that's<00:04:11.030> their<00:04:11.210> magic<00:04:11.600> damage<00:04:11.750> so<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:12.710> magic

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
that's their magic damage so the magic

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.140 
that's their magic damage so the magic
in<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.370> game<00:04:13.520> is<00:04:13.730> controlled<00:04:14.390> by<00:04:14.450> shields<00:04:16.150> so

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
in the game is controlled by shields so

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.610 
in the game is controlled by shields so
at<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.330> moment<00:04:17.480> I've<00:04:17.750> got<00:04:17.930> a<00:04:17.959> lightning

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
at the moment I've got a lightning

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.410 
at the moment I've got a lightning
shield<00:04:18.799> with<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.610> little<00:04:19.820> lightning<00:04:20.150> symbol

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
shield with the little lightning symbol

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.450 
shield with the little lightning symbol
on<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:20.600> icon<00:04:20.930> I've<00:04:21.590> also<00:04:21.739> in<00:04:21.920> my<00:04:22.040> inventory<00:04:22.250> I

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
on the icon I've also in my inventory I

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.570 
on the icon I've also in my inventory I
put<00:04:22.670> a<00:04:22.700> fire<00:04:23.060> shield<00:04:23.380> if<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.530> quit<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:24.980> well<00:04:25.460> it

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
put a fire shield if I quit that well it

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.270 
put a fire shield if I quit that well it
looks<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.910> same<00:04:26.090> it<00:04:26.690> actually<00:04:26.870> we<00:04:27.590> changed<00:04:28.190> my

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
looks the same it actually we changed my

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.500 
looks the same it actually we changed my
magic<00:04:28.580> to<00:04:28.670> use<00:04:28.790> fire<00:04:31.120> might<00:04:32.120> go<00:04:32.210> back<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.420> this

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
magic to use fire might go back to this

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.030 
magic to use fire might go back to this
lightning<00:04:32.870> shield<00:04:33.020> oh<00:04:33.230> it's<00:04:33.410> got<00:04:33.560> slightly

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
lightning shield oh it's got slightly

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.680 
lightning shield oh it's got slightly
better<00:04:34.280> stats<00:04:34.670> and<00:04:35.000> it'll<00:04:35.360> actually<00:04:35.450> give<00:04:35.630> me

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
better stats and it'll actually give me

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.690 
better stats and it'll actually give me
much<00:04:35.990> more<00:04:36.020> magic<00:04:36.530> damage<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:37.370> I'll<00:04:37.460> stick<00:04:37.670> to
