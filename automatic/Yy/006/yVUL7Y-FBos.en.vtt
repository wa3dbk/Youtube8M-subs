remove juror 1 removed your open though
I<00:00:02.460> showed<00:00:02.730> you<00:00:02.850> how<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:02.970> do<00:00:03.120> that<00:00:03.300> by<00:00:03.480> releasing

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
I showed you how to do that by releasing

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.289 
I showed you how to do that by releasing
the<00:00:04.110> least<00:00:04.650> alliance<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.310> copy<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:06.000> window

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
the least alliance and copy the window

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:15.470 
the least alliance and copy the window
out<00:00:12.830> King<00:00:13.830> Tut<00:00:14.130> that's<00:00:14.790> where<00:00:14.969> your<00:00:15.269> seam<00:00:15.450> is

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
out King Tut that's where your seam is

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.000 
out King Tut that's where your seam is
going<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.780> end<00:00:15.929> up<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.289> if<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.410> have<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.560> jagged

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
going to end up so if you have a jagged

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.019 
going to end up so if you have a jagged
cut<00:00:17.160> you're<00:00:17.369> not<00:00:17.460> going<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.670> get<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> smooth

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029

cut you're not going to get a smooth
scene<00:00:19.820> again<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:20.939> look<00:00:21.060> at<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.240> profile<00:00:21.720> and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
scene again you look at the profile and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.070 
scene again you look at the profile and
the<00:00:22.800> profile<00:00:23.189> shows<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.779> the<00:00:24.779> smaller

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
the profile shows you that the smaller

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.570 
the profile shows you that the smaller
slot<00:00:25.410> goes<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.949> metal<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.369> wider

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
slot goes on the metal in the wider

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.140 
slot goes on the metal in the wider
proximity<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:29.340> apply<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.609> all<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.939> do<00:00:30.029> is

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
proximity and to apply it all you do is

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.690 
proximity and to apply it all you do is
just<00:00:30.300> squeeze<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.779> on<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.309> get<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.340> over<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
just squeeze it on it get it over the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.299 
just squeeze it on it get it over the
metal<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:36.260> forcing<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> gasket<00:00:37.829> down<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
metal and forcing the gasket down on the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.280 
metal and forcing the gasket down on the
position<00:00:38.760> when<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.570> get<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> corners

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
position when you get to the corners

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.580 
position when you get to the corners
it's<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.710> be<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> little<00:00:41.040> bit<00:00:41.160> trickier

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
it's going to be a little bit trickier

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.440 
it's going to be a little bit trickier
but<00:00:43.590> you'll<00:00:43.739> notice<00:00:43.920> does<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:45.210> apply

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
but you'll notice does it just apply

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
but you'll notice does it just apply
enough<00:00:45.750> force<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.739> slip<00:00:47.489> past

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.870 

you<00:00:54.800> got<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:55.070> make<00:00:55.160> sure<00:00:55.280> that<00:00:55.400> you're<00:00:55.520> on<00:00:55.640> on

you got to make sure that you're on on
both<00:00:56.060> sides<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:56.540> you<00:00:56.690> get<00:00:56.780> a<00:00:56.840> corner<00:00:57.230> around<00:00:57.530> I

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
both sides and you get a corner around I

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.130 
both sides and you get a corner around I
like<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:58.910> pound<00:00:59.090> it<00:00:59.330> into<00:00:59.450> the<00:00:59.570> corner<00:00:59.900> to<00:00:59.990> make

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
like to pound it into the corner to make

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.240 
like to pound it into the corner to make
sure<00:01:00.320> that<00:01:00.470> it's<00:01:00.620> all<00:01:00.740> the<00:01:00.830> way<00:01:00.950> because<00:01:01.160> that

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
sure that it's all the way because that

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.280

you're going along time off a little bit

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.410 
you're going along time off a little bit
and<00:01:04.160> then<00:01:04.280> we<00:01:04.370> cut<00:01:04.670> your<00:01:04.820> seam<00:01:05.030> if<00:01:05.150> you<00:01:05.210> put<00:01:05.390> a

and then we cut your seam if you put a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.050 
and then we cut your seam if you put a
window<00:01:05.750> when<00:01:05.870> you'll<00:01:05.990> come<00:01:06.020> up<00:01:06.170> short<00:01:06.910> to<00:01:07.910> make

right<00:02:53.090> up<00:02:53.209> around<00:02:53.510> make<00:02:53.720> sure<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:53.930> don't

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
right up around make sure you don't

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.920 
right up around make sure you don't
spray<00:02:54.290> your<00:02:54.440> partner

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.050 

now<00:03:00.440> because<00:03:00.620> everything's<00:03:01.159> wd-40<00:03:01.849> is<00:03:01.909> going

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
now because everything's wd-40 is going

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.640 
now because everything's wd-40 is going
to<00:03:02.120> get<00:03:02.209> slippery<00:03:02.599> so<00:03:03.049> once<00:03:03.319> you<00:03:03.409> get<00:03:03.530> it

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
to get slippery so once you get it

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.589 
to get slippery so once you get it
started

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
started

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.940 
started
I<00:03:05.829> started<00:03:06.829> by<00:03:06.920> opening<00:03:06.950> up<00:03:07.249> the<00:03:07.400> groove

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
I started by opening up the groove

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.140 
I started by opening up the groove
getting<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.159> in<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.489> now<00:03:10.760> what<00:03:10.879> I'm<00:03:10.969> going<00:03:11.120> to

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
getting it in and now what I'm going to

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.809 
getting it in and now what I'm going to
do<00:03:11.269> is<00:03:11.389> I<00:03:11.480> love<00:03:11.870> sliding<00:03:12.379> it<00:03:12.469> in<00:03:12.769> I'm<00:03:13.639> also

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
do is I love sliding it in I'm also

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.839 
do is I love sliding it in I'm also
keeping<00:03:14.120> pressure<00:03:14.540> forward<00:03:15.139> and<00:03:16.129> the<00:03:16.519> key<00:03:16.700> is

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
keeping pressure forward and the key is

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.509 
keeping pressure forward and the key is
to<00:03:16.879> get<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.209> corner<00:03:17.540> in<00:03:17.749> first<00:03:18.340> be<00:03:19.340> careful

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
to get this corner in first be careful

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.470 
to get this corner in first be careful
with<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.849> oil<00:03:19.999> because<00:03:20.209> you're<00:03:20.329> going<00:03:20.420> to

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
with the oil because you're going to

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.849 
with the oil because you're going to
slip<00:03:20.749> a<00:03:20.780> little<00:03:20.930> over<00:03:21.200> you'll<00:03:21.499> want<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.680> slip

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
slip a little over you'll want to slip

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.140 
slip a little over you'll want to slip
and<00:03:21.889> hit<00:03:22.069> yourself<00:03:22.159> in<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.519> face

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
and hit yourself in the face

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.520 
and hit yourself in the face
so<00:03:23.599> as<00:03:23.689> you're<00:03:23.810> starting<00:03:24.109> to<00:03:24.200> get<00:03:24.319> into<00:03:24.469> the

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
so as you're starting to get into the

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.050 
so as you're starting to get into the
corner<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.989> use<00:03:27.139> a<00:03:27.170> halt<00:03:27.409> to<00:03:27.439> keep<00:03:27.739> it<00:03:27.889> in<00:03:28.099> while

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
corner to use a halt to keep it in while

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.220 
corner to use a halt to keep it in while
still<00:03:29.329> applying<00:03:29.629> pressure<00:03:29.930> in<00:03:30.170> that

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
still applying pressure in that

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.659 
still applying pressure in that
direction<00:03:30.469> to<00:03:30.799> keep<00:03:30.980> it<00:03:31.099> and<00:03:31.310> that<00:03:31.430> y'all<00:03:31.579> is

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
direction to keep it and that y'all is

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.360 
direction to keep it and that y'all is
going<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.849> make<00:03:31.939> sure<00:03:31.969> you<00:03:32.209> stay<00:03:32.389> in<00:03:32.419> down<00:03:32.750> here

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
going to make sure you stay in down here

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:41.570 
going to make sure you stay in down here
this<00:03:34.370> is<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.579> tricky<00:03:34.909> part

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.460 

so<00:03:42.090> I'm<00:03:42.180> applying<00:03:42.450> pressure<00:03:42.780> this<00:03:43.080> way<00:03:43.290> and

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
so I'm applying pressure this way and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.110 
so I'm applying pressure this way and
I'm<00:03:43.560> also<00:03:43.710> applying<00:03:43.890> some<00:03:44.280> downforce<00:03:44.820> Gators

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
I'm also applying some downforce Gators

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.920 
I'm also applying some downforce Gators
try<00:03:45.270> to<00:03:45.330> keep<00:03:45.540> this<00:03:45.720> end<00:03:45.960> in<00:03:50.630> try<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.690> come

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
try to keep this end in try to come

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.500 
try to keep this end in try to come
around<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.170> other<00:03:52.260> side

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.690 

alright<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:57.600> now<00:03:57.750> I'm<00:03:58.050> in<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.590> bottom<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:59.130> got

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
alright so now I'm in the bottom I got

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:27.000 
alright so now I'm in the bottom I got
to<00:03:59.940> keep<00:04:00.060> working<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.510> around

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.510 

this<00:04:27.550> is<00:04:27.700> easier<00:04:28.420> it<00:04:28.990> looks<00:04:29.380> easier<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:29.950> is<00:04:30.130> so

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
how it can be frustrating it looks like

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.440 
how it can be frustrating it looks like
you<00:04:33.010> can<00:04:33.100> be<00:04:33.190> very<00:04:33.310> frustrating<00:04:36.270> you<00:04:37.270> make

Gary you say whooping in there real fast
well<00:04:47.410> like<00:04:47.710> like<00:04:47.980> on<00:04:48.160> top<00:04:48.400> these<00:04:48.550> guys<00:04:48.820> it

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
well like like on top these guys it

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.610 
well like like on top these guys it
depends<00:04:49.240> on<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.480> type<00:04:49.750> of<00:04:49.780> gasket<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.380> we

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
depends on the type of gasket that we

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.290 
depends on the type of gasket that we
have<00:04:50.830> because<00:04:51.070> sometimes<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.580> manufacturers

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
have because sometimes the manufacturers

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.330 
have because sometimes the manufacturers
you<00:04:53.050> get<00:04:53.200> it<00:04:53.290> different<00:04:53.650> running<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.160> last

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
you get it different running the last

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.300 
you get it different running the last
time<00:04:54.640> you<00:04:54.850> had<00:04:55.030> it<00:04:55.560> so<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:56.710> changes<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:57.190> little

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
time you had it so it changes a little

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
time you had it so it changes a little
bit

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
bit

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.520 
bit
they<00:04:59.230> don't<00:04:59.380> always<00:04:59.530> just<00:04:59.830> snap<00:05:00.070> right<00:05:00.100> in

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
they don't always just snap right in

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.130 
they don't always just snap right in
pretty<00:05:02.530> close

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:28.110 

just<00:05:06.320> keep<00:05:06.530> working

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.089 

you<00:05:29.120> have<00:05:29.300> that<00:05:29.449> little<00:05:29.689> bit<00:05:29.870> of<00:05:29.900> play<00:05:30.169> in<00:05:30.919> the

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
you have that little bit of play in the

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:33.040 
you have that little bit of play in the
window<00:05:31.430> so<00:05:32.150> now<00:05:32.240> what<00:05:32.360> you<00:05:32.419> got<00:05:32.569> to<00:05:32.599> do<00:05:32.750> now<00:05:32.870> is

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
window so now what you got to do now is

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.619 
window so now what you got to do now is
you<00:05:33.139> got<00:05:33.289> to<00:05:33.879> try<00:05:34.879> to<00:05:34.939> make<00:05:35.150> sure<00:05:35.180> you're<00:05:35.449> even

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:35.629 
you got to try to make sure you're even

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:37.510 
you got to try to make sure you're even
on<00:05:35.870> both<00:05:36.080> sides<00:05:36.349> so<00:05:36.560> when<00:05:36.650> you<00:05:36.740> snap<00:05:37.009> lock<00:05:37.250> it

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
on both sides so when you snap lock it

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.459 
on both sides so when you snap lock it
you're<00:05:38.509> even<00:05:38.810> all<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:38.990> way<00:05:39.020> around<00:05:39.199> through

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:39.469 
you're even all the way around through

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:40.719 
you're even all the way around through
you're<00:05:39.620> too<00:05:39.740> close<00:05:39.919> to<00:05:39.979> the<00:05:40.189> edge<00:05:40.310> here<00:05:40.340> even

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
you're too close to the edge here even

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:42.219 
you're too close to the edge here even
after<00:05:40.789> your<00:05:41.000> snap<00:05:41.210> lock<00:05:41.419> you<00:05:41.599> can<00:05:41.780> punch<00:05:42.050> this

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
after your snap lock you can punch this

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.070 
after your snap lock you can punch this

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
little tighter up and down it's just the

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:50.950 
little tighter up and down it's just the
ends<00:05:49.969> I'm<00:05:50.060> worried<00:05:50.330> about<00:05:50.360> though<00:05:50.689> there's

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
ends I'm worried about though there's

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.839 
ends I'm worried about though there's
it's<00:05:51.169> going<00:05:51.469> to<00:05:51.530> be<00:05:51.590> about<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:51.889> same<00:05:52.099> top<00:05:52.669> and

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
it's going to be about the same top and

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:55.540 
it's going to be about the same top and
bottom<00:05:53.180> okay<00:05:53.949> all<00:05:54.949> right<00:05:55.069> so<00:05:55.159> now<00:05:55.279> I'm<00:05:55.370> ready

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
bottom okay all right so now I'm ready

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.529 
bottom okay all right so now I'm ready
to<00:05:55.580> put<00:05:55.759> a<00:05:55.789> snap<00:05:56.090> lock<00:05:56.330> on<00:05:58.120> I'm<00:05:59.120> going<00:05:59.270> to<00:05:59.330> spray

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
to put a snap lock on I'm going to spray

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:05.030 
to put a snap lock on I'm going to spray
with<00:05:59.689> wd-40

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.910 

I<00:06:07.460> usually<00:06:08.460> start<00:06:08.790> right<00:06:08.970> here<00:06:09.120> in<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.300> middle

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
I usually start right here in the middle

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.310 
I usually start right here in the middle
just<00:06:10.920> get<00:06:11.070> one<00:06:11.340> piece<00:06:11.610> to<00:06:11.790> start<00:06:12.050> forcing<00:06:13.050> it

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
just get one piece to start forcing it

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.050 
just get one piece to start forcing it
in<00:06:13.500> with<00:06:13.650> the<00:06:13.770> oil<00:06:13.980> and<00:06:16.820> again<00:06:17.820> it's<00:06:17.940> a<00:06:18.000> little

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
in with the oil and again it's a little

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.850 
in with the oil and again it's a little
bit<00:06:18.180> slippery<00:06:18.450> go<00:06:18.720> to<00:06:18.780> the<00:06:18.900> wd-40<00:06:19.500> so<00:06:19.650> you<00:06:19.740> got

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
bit slippery go to the wd-40 so you got

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.480 
bit slippery go to the wd-40 so you got
an<00:06:19.950> empirical<00:06:22.820> ones<00:06:23.820> are<00:06:24.030> a<00:06:24.060> little<00:06:24.150> trickier

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
an empirical ones are a little trickier

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.370 
an empirical ones are a little trickier
it's<00:06:26.490> just<00:06:26.700> applying<00:06:27.330> that<00:06:27.600> forward<00:06:28.050> pressure

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
it's just applying that forward pressure

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.280 
it's just applying that forward pressure
I'm<00:06:28.560> kind<00:06:28.770> of<00:06:28.830> dragging<00:06:29.010> the<00:06:29.340> oil<00:06:29.490> forward<00:06:30.290> by

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
I'm kind of dragging the oil forward by

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.340 
I'm kind of dragging the oil forward by
leaning<00:06:31.680> it<00:06:31.770> back<00:06:31.980> slightly<00:06:33.080> just<00:06:34.080> making

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
leaning it back slightly just making

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.460 
leaning it back slightly just making
sure<00:06:34.500> that<00:06:34.620> that<00:06:34.740> seal<00:06:35.010> goes<00:06:35.280> down<00:06:36.260> you<00:06:37.260> got<00:06:37.380> to

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
sure that that seal goes down you got to

00:06:37.470 --> 00:07:01.140 
sure that that seal goes down you got to
change<00:06:37.710> angles<00:06:38.160> and<00:06:38.310> positions

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.760 

and<00:07:02.150> you<00:07:02.330> snap<00:07:02.630> that<00:07:02.840> last<00:07:03.080> piece<00:07:03.319> in<00:07:03.590> right

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770 
and you snap that last piece in right

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:13.050 
and you snap that last piece in right
there

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.060 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.250 

to<00:07:14.060> make<00:07:14.210> sure<00:07:14.390> that<00:07:14.420> it's<00:07:14.720> in<00:07:14.870> all<00:07:14.990> the<00:07:15.050> way<00:07:15.140> in

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.260 
to make sure that it's in all the way in

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:31.390 
to make sure that it's in all the way in
the<00:07:15.380> field<00:07:15.710> if<00:07:16.490> you<00:07:16.640> give<00:07:17.540> it<00:07:17.660> a<00:07:17.720> little<00:07:17.750> bit

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:41.029 

well<00:07:32.400> done

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:45.300 

again

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.310 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.370
