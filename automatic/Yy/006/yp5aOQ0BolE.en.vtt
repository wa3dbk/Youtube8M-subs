the<00:03:06.280> universe<00:03:07.230> come<00:03:08.230> out<00:03:08.500> of<00:03:08.709> music<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:09.790> I

the universe come out of music and I

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.410 
the universe come out of music and I

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
believe that music is the creation the

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.380 
believe that music is the creation the
universe<00:03:13.810> isn't<00:03:14.519> necessarily<00:03:15.519> matter<00:03:15.970> and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
universe isn't necessarily matter and

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.860 
universe isn't necessarily matter and
energy<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:17.290> believe<00:03:17.920> its<00:03:18.250> music<00:03:18.849> and<00:03:19.030> it's

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
energy I believe its music and it's

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.199 
energy I believe its music and it's
converted<00:03:20.440> into<00:03:20.590> matter<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.160> energy<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.670> think

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
converted into matter and energy I think

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.990 
converted into matter and energy I think
music<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.620> creation<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.400> we<00:03:24.580> all<00:03:24.790> exist
