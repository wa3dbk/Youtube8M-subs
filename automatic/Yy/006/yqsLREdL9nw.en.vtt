gonna have to stand them up alright

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.030 
gonna have to stand them up alright
let's<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.570> this

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.110 

we're<00:00:59.040> going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> launch<00:00:59.460> some<00:00:59.730> projectiles

we're going to launch some projectiles

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.910

into<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> beds<00:01:00.900> of<00:01:01.050> our<00:01:01.170> trucks<00:01:01.470> to<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.860> how

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
into the beds of our trucks to see how

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.770

they<00:01:02.040> hold<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:02.970> we<00:01:03.060> want<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.450> be<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
they hold up but we want this to be the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.500 
they hold up but we want this to be the
ultimate<00:01:04.050> test<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.489> need<00:01:05.640> some<00:01:05.910> special

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510
