chewing it and then dropping it that's a

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.390 
chewing it and then dropping it that's a
change<00:00:45.140> in<00:00:45.290> eating<00:00:45.530> pattern<00:00:45.830> so<00:00:46.040> the<00:00:46.159> key<00:00:46.369> here

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
change in eating pattern so the key here

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.399 
change in eating pattern so the key here
is<00:00:46.699> to<00:00:46.879> be<00:00:47.119> aware<00:00:47.420> of<00:00:47.479> your<00:00:47.690> rabbits<00:00:47.989> normal

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
eating pattern so that if there's any

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.399 
eating pattern so that if there's any
change<00:00:50.150> you<00:00:50.330> can<00:00:50.479> detect<00:00:50.780> them<00:00:50.930> because<00:00:51.229> a

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
change you can detect them because a

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.020 
change you can detect them because a
change<00:00:51.890> in<00:00:52.010> eating<00:00:52.129> patterns<00:00:52.519> is<00:00:52.670> one<00:00:52.820> of<00:00:52.909> the

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
change in eating patterns is one of the

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.789 
change in eating patterns is one of the
main<00:00:53.269> ways<00:00:53.479> and<00:00:53.720> to<00:00:53.839> tell<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.110> rabbit<00:00:54.470> is<00:00:54.559> say

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:54.799 
main ways and to tell the rabbit is say

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:57.490 
main ways and to tell the rabbit is say

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.399 
have a Howcast video about how to take
your<00:01:26.270> rabbits<00:01:26.570> temperature<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.229> might

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
your rabbits temperature so you might

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.020 
your rabbits temperature so you might
want<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.649> take<00:01:27.799> a<00:01:27.829> look<00:01:28.039> at<00:01:28.100> that<00:01:28.280> once<00:01:28.939> you

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
want to take a look at that once you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.039 
want to take a look at that once you
learn<00:01:29.210> how<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.390> take<00:01:29.570> your<00:01:29.749> rabbits

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
temperature you'll be able to detect

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.399 
temperature you'll be able to detect
drops<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:32.090> body<00:01:32.299> temperature<00:01:32.780> which<00:01:32.990> are<00:01:33.200> the

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
drops in body temperature which are the

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.260 
drops in body temperature which are the
most<00:01:33.679> frequent<00:01:34.310> way<00:01:34.490> of<00:01:34.789> knowing<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:35.240> a

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
most frequent way of knowing that a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.239 
most frequent way of knowing that a
rabbits<00:01:35.659> on<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.869> downhill<00:01:36.200> slide<00:01:36.710> very

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249 
rabbits on a downhill slide very

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:39.429 
rabbits on a downhill slide very
important<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.759> be<00:01:37.850> able<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.149> do<00:01:38.270> at<00:01:38.479> home<00:01:38.509> we

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
important to be able to do at home we

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.440 
important to be able to do at home we
think<00:01:39.679> that's<00:01:40.399> the<00:01:40.520> main<00:01:40.729> thing<00:01:40.939> because<00:01:41.329> they

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
think that's the main thing because they

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.690 
think that's the main thing because they
can't<00:01:41.719> tell<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.259> you<00:01:42.499> just<00:01:42.530> I<00:01:43.039> don't<00:01:43.549> know

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
can't tell you you just I don't know

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.039 
can't tell you you just I don't know
that's<00:01:43.909> what's<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.179> nice<00:01:44.329> about<00:01:44.390> spending<00:01:44.899> so

that's what's so nice about spending so

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.660 
that's what's so nice about spending so
much<00:01:45.200> time<00:01:45.229> with<00:01:45.530> your<00:01:45.590> rabbit<00:01:45.829> you<00:01:46.219> just<00:01:46.429> get

they're prey on the signal - yeah if you
see<00:02:04.909> a<00:02:04.939> change<00:02:05.299> I<00:02:05.569> should<00:02:05.780> have<00:02:05.869> mentioned

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
see a change I should have mentioned

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.169

poops a certain amount per day and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.270 
poops a certain amount per day and
suddenly<00:02:15.200> you're<00:02:15.350> not<00:02:15.380> seeing<00:02:15.830> any<00:02:16.010> poops

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
eye on it you should know your rabbits

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.560 
eye on it you should know your rabbits
normal<00:02:25.400> patterns<00:02:25.820> so<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.240> if<00:02:26.330> there's<00:02:26.510> a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
normal patterns so that if there's a

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.880 
normal patterns so that if there's a
change<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.080> normal<00:02:27.380> pattern<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.800> can

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
change in the normal pattern you can

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.350 
change in the normal pattern you can
pick<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.190> up<00:02:28.280> quickly<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.850> do<00:02:29.000> something

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
pick it up quickly and do something

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.020 
pick it up quickly and do something
about<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.650> unlike<00:02:30.650> dogs<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.130> cats<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.820> don't

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
about it unlike dogs and cats you don't

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.670 
about it unlike dogs and cats you don't
have<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.360> kind<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.630> waiting<00:02:32.990> time<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.560> you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
have the kind of waiting time that you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.830 
have the kind of waiting time that you
do<00:02:33.860> with<00:02:34.520> those<00:02:34.670> species<00:02:34.970> for<00:02:35.300> example<00:02:35.360> if<00:02:35.780> a

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
do with those species for example if a

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.620 
do with those species for example if a
dog<00:02:36.050> doesn't<00:02:36.410> eat<00:02:36.590> one<00:02:36.800> morning<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:38.450> wife
