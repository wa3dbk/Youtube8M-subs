far it's going to do this real quick and

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.130 
far it's going to do this real quick and
I<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> animations<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.729> not<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
I like the animations for it and not the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.359 
I like the animations for it and not the
character<00:01:40.140> animations<00:01:40.740> because<00:01:41.220> they're

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
character animations because they're

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.590 
character animations because they're
pretty<00:01:41.640> much<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> same<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> other<00:01:42.420> ones

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
pretty much the same as the other ones

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.620

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
but I like the you know the power

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.109 
but I like the you know the power
animation<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:47.939> stuff

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
animation so just like a little stuff

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.740

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
to power set and I want to go through

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.449 
to power set and I want to go through
time<00:02:12.780> here<00:02:13.050> real<00:02:13.200> quick<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.560> show<00:02:13.680> off<00:02:14.220> the

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
time here real quick and show off the

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.110 
time here real quick and show off the
some<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.849> moves<00:02:15.720> here<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.489> techie<00:02:17.489> outburst

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
some of the moves here a techie outburst

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.850 
some of the moves here a techie outburst
so<00:02:18.540> what<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.810> does<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:18.959> freeze<00:02:19.260> your<00:02:19.410> target

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
so what it does is freeze your target

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.610 
so what it does is freeze your target
and<00:02:20.040> everybody<00:02:20.790> enemies<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> time<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.810> think

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
and everybody enemies a time I think

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.199 
and everybody enemies a time I think
I've<00:02:22.709> seen<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:22.950> one<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.250> bit<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.790> think<00:02:24.090> so

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
I've seen that one a bit I think so

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.539 
I've seen that one a bit I think so
giant<00:02:24.780> ball<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:24.989> think<00:02:25.349> so<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:25.799> it's<00:02:26.400> pretty

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
giant ball I think so so it's pretty

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:35.860 
giant ball I think so so it's pretty
cool<00:02:26.790> looking<00:02:27.000> at<00:02:27.440> tip<00:02:28.440> top<00:02:28.819> oral<00:02:29.819> extortion

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
power for the you know quantum power

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.470 
power for the you know quantum power
here<00:02:56.910> it's<00:02:57.299> actually<00:02:57.569> a<00:02:58.250> controller<00:02:59.250> power<00:02:59.489> so

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.210 

so<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.540> know<00:03:03.720> if<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:03.989> like<00:03:04.170> let<00:03:04.709> controllers

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
so you know if you like let controllers

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.280 
so you know if you like let controllers
I<00:03:05.370> definitely<00:03:05.790> give<00:03:05.970> this<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.209> shot<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.630> from

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
I definitely give this a shot and from

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.229 
I definitely give this a shot and from
what<00:03:07.440> my<00:03:07.590> brother<00:03:07.739> said<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.400> know<00:03:08.489> being<00:03:09.120> a

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
what my brother said you know being a

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.650 
what my brother said you know being a
dps<00:03:09.720> for<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:11.280> know<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.489> quantum<00:03:11.910> powers<00:03:12.299> that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
dps for you know the quantum powers that

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.900 
dps for you know the quantum powers that
they're<00:03:12.840> they're<00:03:13.260> pretty<00:03:13.470> strong<00:03:13.739> so<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.310> can

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
they're they're pretty strong so I can

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.789 
they're they're pretty strong so I can
see<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> nerf<00:03:15.389> probably<00:03:15.840> hitting<00:03:15.989> pretty<00:03:16.500> soon

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
see a nerf probably hitting pretty soon

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.699 
see a nerf probably hitting pretty soon
so<00:03:17.100> if<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.370> guys<00:03:17.459> get<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.670> chance<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.420> know

so if you guys get a chance to you know
play<00:03:19.709> this<00:03:19.920> early<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.280> say<00:03:20.459> take<00:03:20.639> full

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
play this early I say take full

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.840 
play this early I say take full
advantage<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.630> as<00:03:21.780> much<00:03:21.989> as<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.170> can<00:03:22.380> so

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
advantage of it as much as you can so

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.789 
advantage of it as much as you can so
anyways<00:03:23.850> let's<00:03:24.569> take<00:03:25.109> a<00:03:25.139> look<00:03:25.380> at<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.769> know

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
anyways let's take a look at it you know

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.780 
anyways let's take a look at it you know
so<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.220> other<00:03:26.400> ones<00:03:26.489> here<00:03:26.850> quantum<00:03:27.359> tunneling

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
so the other ones here quantum tunneling

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.150 
so the other ones here quantum tunneling
whoa<00:03:29.790> that's<00:03:30.299> pretty<00:03:30.359> cool<00:03:30.690> that's<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.650> lot<00:03:31.799> a

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
whoa that's pretty cool that's a lot a

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.890 
whoa that's pretty cool that's a lot a
lot<00:03:32.849> of<00:03:33.000> description<00:03:33.680> time<00:03:34.680> bubble

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
lot of description time bubble

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.789 
lot of description time bubble

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
distortion wave work barrage and what's

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.879 
distortion wave work barrage and what's
this<00:03:40.859> time<00:03:41.160> bomb<00:03:41.900> ok<00:03:42.900> let's<00:03:43.139> go<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.290> check<00:03:43.799> out

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
this time bomb ok let's go to check out

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.330 
this time bomb ok let's go to check out
spacer<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:45.230> I'm<00:03:46.230> going<00:03:46.590> with<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.919> Space<00:03:47.130> rat

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
spacer and I'm going with the Space rat

anyways<00:04:04.190> take<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.220> look<00:04:05.370> at<00:04:05.520> this<00:04:05.670> one<00:04:05.850> first

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
anyways take a look at this one first

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.120 
anyways take a look at this one first
and<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:07.170> already<00:04:07.290> have<00:04:07.530> them<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:07.800> i<00:04:07.830> can<00:04:08.010> show

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
and I already have them so i can show

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.210 
and I already have them so i can show
you<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.370> animations<00:04:09.210> they're<00:04:09.600> pretty<00:04:09.720> cool

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
like say you saw them before i'm gonna

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.200 
like say you saw them before i'm gonna
go<00:04:12.570> down<00:04:12.750> here<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.310> fight<00:04:14.310> an<00:04:14.430> enemy<00:04:14.580> here<00:04:15.030> and

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
go down here and fight an enemy here and

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.070 
go down here and fight an enemy here and
see<00:04:15.360> would<00:04:15.600> give<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.560> guys<00:04:16.680> a<00:04:16.709> look<00:04:17.100> i<00:04:17.930> look<00:04:18.930> at

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
see would give you guys a look i look at

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.420 
see would give you guys a look i look at
the<00:04:19.260> power<00:04:19.920> set<00:04:20.580> soon<00:04:21.770> this<00:04:22.770> one<00:04:22.950> stuns<00:04:23.250> them

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
the power set soon this one stuns them

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.890 
the power set soon this one stuns them
