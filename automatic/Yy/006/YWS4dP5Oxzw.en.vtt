00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.259 
I mean it is possible I've done it a few
times<00:02:20.079> but<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:20.920> shows<00:02:21.129> absolutely<00:02:21.310> disasters

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
times but it shows absolutely disasters

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.209

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
and they flipped it up I mean that

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.789 
and they flipped it up I mean that

which<00:02:48.849> is<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.000> little<00:02:49.329> disappointing<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:50.200> would

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
which is a little disappointing I would

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.500 
which is a little disappointing I would
have<00:02:50.680> definitely<00:02:50.889> liked<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.609> seen<00:02:51.970> three

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
have definitely liked to seen three

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.490 
have definitely liked to seen three
points<00:02:52.810> come<00:02:52.959> out<00:02:52.989> of<00:02:53.169> that<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.379> it's

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
points come out of that and it's

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.869 
points come out of that and it's
important<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:54.069> start<00:02:54.340> picking<00:02:54.609> up<00:02:54.730> three

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
important I start picking up three

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.849 
important I start picking up three
points<00:02:55.269> against<00:02:55.599> a<00:02:55.720> team<00:02:55.989> like<00:02:56.019> Leo<00:02:56.379> just

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
points against a team like Leo just

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.319 
points against a team like Leo just
because<00:02:57.189> I<00:02:57.220> really<00:02:57.609> do<00:02:57.730> want<00:02:57.939> that<00:02:58.000> first

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329

place<00:02:58.569> in<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.840> group<00:02:59.049> but<00:02:59.349> I<00:02:59.530> suppose<00:03:00.099> we<00:03:00.250> just

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
place in the group but I suppose we just

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.559 
place in the group but I suppose we just
have<00:03:00.519> to<00:03:00.609> wait<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:00.790> see<00:03:00.970> how<00:03:01.150> everyone<00:03:01.540> else

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
have to wait and see how everyone else

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.449 
have to wait and see how everyone else
does<00:03:01.900> against<00:03:02.260> each<00:03:02.379> other<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.829> kind<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.310> hope

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
does against each other I kind of hope

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.539 
does against each other I kind of hope
the<00:03:03.669> basil<00:03:04.090> beat<00:03:04.269> Juventus<00:03:05.169> but<00:03:05.439> I'm<00:03:05.739> a<00:03:06.189> little

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
the basil beat Juventus but I'm a little

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:07.979 
the basil beat Juventus but I'm a little
bit<00:03:06.669> skeptical<00:03:07.150> or<00:03:07.180> something<00:03:07.510> like<00:03:07.599> that<00:03:07.659> but

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
bit skeptical or something like that but

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.509 
bit skeptical or something like that but
like<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.530> said<00:03:08.590> we'll<00:03:08.919> see<00:03:08.950> we'll<00:03:09.280> see<00:03:09.310> how<00:03:09.489> it

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
like I said we'll see we'll see how it

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.369 
like I said we'll see we'll see how it
all<00:03:09.760> pans<00:03:09.970> out<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.450> mean<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.019> could<00:03:11.139> have<00:03:11.290> been

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
all pans out I mean it could have been

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.860 
all pans out I mean it could have been
worse<00:03:11.530> we<00:03:11.709> could<00:03:11.859> have<00:03:11.980> lost<00:03:12.159> but<00:03:12.750> we<00:03:13.750> had<00:03:13.840> a

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
worse we could have lost but we had a

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.569
