00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
first attack and that netted me another

upgrading<00:02:46.689> heroes<00:02:47.049> like<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.439> this<00:02:47.620> case<00:02:47.680> do

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
upgrading heroes like in this case do

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.190 
upgrading heroes like in this case do
make<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.730> big<00:02:49.150> difference<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:49.720> don't<00:02:49.900> think<00:02:50.049> it's

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
make a big difference I don't think it's

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.009 
make a big difference I don't think it's
just<00:02:50.260> base<00:02:50.920> design<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.549> fact<00:02:51.849> I'm<00:02:52.090> pretty<00:02:52.150> sure

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
just base design in fact I'm pretty sure

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.839 
just base design in fact I'm pretty sure
I<00:02:53.049> could<00:02:53.230> change<00:02:53.560> my<00:02:53.709> base<00:02:54.069> design<00:02:54.459> up<00:02:54.670> to

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
I could change my base design up to

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.240 
I could change my base design up to
another<00:02:55.120> relatively<00:02:55.780> popular<00:02:56.620> layout<00:02:57.069> and

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
another relatively popular layout and

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.130 
another relatively popular layout and
still<00:02:57.909> see<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.180> lot<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.450> victories<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:58.870> is

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
still see a lot of victories that is

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.990 
still see a lot of victories that is
something<00:02:59.409> I<00:02:59.530> will<00:02:59.680> try<00:02:59.890> in<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.159> future<00:03:00.519> but

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
something I will try in the future but

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.690 
something I will try in the future but
for<00:03:01.060> now<00:03:01.329> and<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.049> just<00:03:02.290> figures<00:03:02.530> I<00:03:02.920> finally

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
for now and it just figures I finally

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.460 
for now and it just figures I finally
don't<00:03:04.120> care<00:03:04.450> about<00:03:04.569> trophies<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.319> I<00:03:05.379> am

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
don't care about trophies and I am

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.559 
don't care about trophies and I am
winning<00:03:05.709> them<00:03:05.950> left<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.519> right<00:03:06.849> now<00:03:07.389> this

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
winning them left and right now this

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.119 
winning them left and right now this
does<00:03:07.810> give<00:03:08.019> me<00:03:08.079> an<00:03:08.260> idea<00:03:08.409> for<00:03:08.829> a<00:03:08.859> future

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
does give me an idea for a future

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.740 
does give me an idea for a future
episode<00:03:09.370> though<00:03:09.819> and<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.090> would<00:03:10.269> be<00:03:10.299> we<00:03:10.569> do

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
episode though and that would be we do

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.660 
episode though and that would be we do
have<00:03:10.959> some<00:03:11.109> members<00:03:11.500> in<00:03:11.620> los<00:03:11.799> Phoenix<00:03:12.129> with

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
have some members in los Phoenix with

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.640 
have some members in los Phoenix with
some<00:03:12.879> lower-level<00:03:13.260> 20-something<00:03:14.260> heroes

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
some lower-level 20-something heroes

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.250 
some lower-level 20-something heroes
that<00:03:15.159> are<00:03:15.189> still<00:03:15.639> pulling<00:03:16.120> out<00:03:16.299> to<00:03:16.659> star<00:03:16.959> wins

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
that are still pulling out to star wins

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.649 
that are still pulling out to star wins
against<00:03:17.709> Supermax<00:03:18.430> basis<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.629> is

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
against Supermax basis so it is

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.780 
against Supermax basis so it is
certainly<00:03:20.200> possible<00:03:20.290> but<00:03:21.250> in<00:03:21.370> this<00:03:21.519> case

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
certainly possible but in this case

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.059 
certainly possible but in this case
we've<00:03:22.060> got<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.269> late<00:03:22.629> clan<00:03:22.989> castle<00:03:23.290> deployment

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
we've got a late clan castle deployment

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.399 
we've got a late clan castle deployment
and<00:03:24.189> that<00:03:24.459> is<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.810> tactical<00:03:25.810> error<00:03:25.989> you've<00:03:26.260> got

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
and that is a tactical error you've got

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.500 
and that is a tactical error you've got
a<00:03:26.439> bunch<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.829> small<00:03:27.250> units<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.939> they're<00:03:28.329> kind

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
a bunch of small units and they're kind

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.780 
a bunch of small units and they're kind
of<00:03:28.599> stranded<00:03:28.989> on<00:03:29.319> the<00:03:29.470> outside<00:03:30.010> now<00:03:30.609> they<00:03:30.760> are

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
of stranded on the outside now they are

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.339 
of stranded on the outside now they are
getting<00:03:31.090> protected<00:03:31.569> a<00:03:31.750> little<00:03:32.019> bit<00:03:32.139> by<00:03:32.290> this

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
getting protected a little bit by this

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.259 
getting protected a little bit by this
golem<00:03:33.040> but<00:03:33.430> as<00:03:33.579> you'll<00:03:33.849> see<00:03:34.090> they'll

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
golem but as you'll see they'll

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.789 
golem but as you'll see they'll
eventually<00:03:34.480> work<00:03:34.989> their<00:03:35.199> way<00:03:35.319> through<00:03:35.349> that

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
eventually work their way through that

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.800 
eventually work their way through that
wall<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.340> now<00:03:36.730> that<00:03:37.000> protection<00:03:37.449> is<00:03:37.540> pretty

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
wall and now that protection is pretty

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.869 
wall and now that protection is pretty
much<00:03:37.930> gone<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.739> splash<00:03:39.099> damage<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.579> going<00:03:39.790> to

much gone the splash damage is going to
