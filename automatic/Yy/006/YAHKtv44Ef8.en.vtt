00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
ventilation it's really lightweight like

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.310 
ventilation it's really lightweight like
it's<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.610> light<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.720> book<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:12.990> can

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
it's a really light in that book you can

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.090 
it's a really light in that book you can
carry<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.710> around<00:01:14.210> almost<00:01:15.210> anywhere<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.100> as

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
carry this around almost anywhere and as

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.490 
carry this around almost anywhere and as
you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.150> SD<00:01:18.479> card<00:01:18.780> slot<00:01:19.049> we

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
you can see we have the SD card slot we

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.120 
you can see we have the SD card slot we
have<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> combined<00:01:20.479> microphone<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.130> headphone

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
have a combined microphone and headphone

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.420 
have a combined microphone and headphone
jack<00:01:23.600> 2<00:01:24.600> USB<00:01:25.140> 2.0<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:27.020> one<00:01:28.020> Ethernet<00:01:28.290> port<00:01:29.220> and

one non removable battery and it's only
three<00:01:37.979> cells<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:38.970> not<00:01:39.090> gonna<00:01:39.240> last<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
three cells so it's not gonna last you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.840 
three cells so it's not gonna last you
really<00:01:39.960> long<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.729> for

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
really long but this is just for

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.889 
really long but this is just for
lightweight<00:01:43.520> computing<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.540> see<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:45.780> have

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
lightweight computing we can see we have

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.380 
lightweight computing we can see we have
a<00:01:45.930> full<00:01:46.290> keyboard<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.700> no<00:01:48.470> no<00:01:49.470> number<00:01:49.979> pad<00:01:50.399> its

a full keyboard but no no number pad its

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.800 
a full keyboard but no no number pad its

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.020 
one sonic master audio full trackpad
right<00:02:03.750> there<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:05.009> use<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.610> touchscreen

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
right there and I use the touchscreen

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.230 
right there and I use the touchscreen
way<00:02:06.570> more<00:02:06.750> often<00:02:06.930> than<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> trackpad

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
way more often than the trackpad

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.650 
way more often than the trackpad
cuz<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.750> feel<00:02:09.260> like<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.590> trackpad<00:02:10.330> isn't<00:02:11.330> so

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
cuz I feel like the trackpad isn't so

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.530 
cuz I feel like the trackpad isn't so
sensitive<00:02:12.350> well<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:13.490> sensitive<00:02:13.640> but<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.300> feel

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
sensitive well it's sensitive but I feel

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.320 
sensitive well it's sensitive but I feel
like<00:02:14.600> it's<00:02:14.860> like<00:02:15.860> moving<00:02:16.580> most<00:02:16.820> of<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.120> time

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
like it's like moving most of the time

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.290 
like it's like moving most of the time
when<00:02:17.540> I'm<00:02:17.660> using<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.670> power<00:02:19.910> on<00:02:20.150> button

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
when I'm using it so the power on button

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.470 
when I'm using it so the power on button
is<00:02:20.540> on<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.690> top<00:02:20.780> right-hand<00:02:21.350> side<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.580> I'm

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
is on the top right-hand side and I'm

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.130 
is on the top right-hand side and I'm
just<00:02:23.780> powered<00:02:24.380> on<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.800> PC<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.810> we<00:02:26.810> can<00:02:26.990> see

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
just powered on the PC and we can see

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.110 
just powered on the PC and we can see
the<00:02:27.260> indicator<00:02:27.500> lights<00:02:28.040> right<00:02:28.310> now<00:02:28.460> we<00:02:29.030> have

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
the indicator lights right now we have

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.260 
the indicator lights right now we have
five<00:02:29.330> indicator<00:02:29.840> lights<00:02:30.760> one<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.880> them<00:02:32.030> is

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
five indicator lights one of them is

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.150 
five indicator lights one of them is
charging<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.260> second<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.780> what<00:02:35.780> power<00:02:36.650> on<00:02:36.890> a
