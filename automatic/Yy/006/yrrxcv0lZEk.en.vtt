00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.520
 the arrow I bring how to install the baseband 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.920
 or the base band in experience and 15th 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.020
 first what I'm going to tell you is how 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.510
 disable the antivirus in this case the 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.580
 avast you can do it with your 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.530
 antivirus I recommend it so that 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.600
 do not have any problem with power 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.310
 run the programs that they are going to do 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.960
 double click on the avast 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.260
 I want to show a little window if you 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.080
 what they are going to do is go to safety and 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.760
 the next is shield of the system 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.770
 files you are going to have 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.739
 enabled or are you going to have the 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.180
 option here start the will have as 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.920
 shaded as it is now to have 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.730
 Then what are they going to have to do? 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.100
 is to select stop and it's going to 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.720
 appear a 10 minute window a 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.310
 time until it reboots I put it 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.130
 one hour because 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.650
 just to affirm the tutorial so 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.510
 well we closed the avast window here 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.820
 I have the winrar that I will leave it in 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.290
 the description so they can 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.020
 download it and they can install the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.600
 baseband as you can see weighs 41 8 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.260
 megabytes 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.260
 I'm going to open it 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.200
