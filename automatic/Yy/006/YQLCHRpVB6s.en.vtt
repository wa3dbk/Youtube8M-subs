00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
cutout around the home button so it

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.220 
cutout around the home button so it
looks<00:03:18.940> like<00:03:19.000> it's<00:03:19.209> gonna<00:03:19.330> line<00:03:19.630> up<00:03:19.660> with<00:03:20.110> the

stick to something else or being just
sort<00:04:23.710> of<00:04:23.770> slightly<00:04:24.039> eschewed<00:04:24.610> so<00:04:25.060> this

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
sort of slightly eschewed so this

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.830 
sort of slightly eschewed so this

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
little bit more securely over time and I

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.719 
little bit more securely over time and I
don't<00:05:16.460> know<00:05:17.000> that<00:05:17.180> I<00:05:17.479> love<00:05:17.840> the<00:05:18.110> look<00:05:18.289> of<00:05:18.410> it

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
don't know that I love the look of it

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.790 
don't know that I love the look of it
just<00:05:19.729> the<00:05:19.970> faceplate<00:05:20.539> attached<00:05:20.870> so<00:05:21.500> I'm<00:05:21.650> gonna

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
just the faceplate attached so I'm gonna

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.469 
just the faceplate attached so I'm gonna
pop<00:05:22.010> it<00:05:22.039> back<00:05:22.190> in<00:05:22.490> this<00:05:22.639> bumper<00:05:23.030> shell<00:05:23.210> here

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
pop it back in this bumper shell here

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.080 
pop it back in this bumper shell here
now<00:05:23.720> obviously<00:05:24.289> this<00:05:24.440> won't<00:05:24.710> be<00:05:24.919> a

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
now obviously this won't be a

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
now obviously this won't be a
