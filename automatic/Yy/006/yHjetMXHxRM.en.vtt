00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
actually cut off just to make this

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.860 
actually cut off just to make this
little<00:01:37.640> banjo<00:01:38.640> thing<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.030> think

reinforce the lip of the box itself so
that<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.600> window<00:02:00.840> lid<00:02:01.020> closes<00:02:02.480> it<00:02:03.480> actually

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
that the window lid closes it actually

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.630 
that the window lid closes it actually
provides<00:02:04.260> more<00:02:04.560> tension<00:02:05.010> across<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.460> back

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
provides more tension across the back

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.120 
provides more tension across the back
here<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.150> want<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.570> adding<00:02:06.810> up<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.140> Ashland

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
here I want to adding up the Ashland

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.550 
here I want to adding up the Ashland
logo<00:02:08.490> and<00:02:08.640> everything<00:02:08.700> intact<00:02:09.270> just<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.840> show

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
logo and everything intact just to show

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.170 
logo and everything intact just to show
off<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.770> fact<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.010> it<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> cigar<00:02:11.760> box

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
off the fact that it is a cigar box

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.900 
off the fact that it is a cigar box
so<00:02:13.080> therefore<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.890> model<00:02:14.400> name<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.820> the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
so therefore the model name is the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.210 
so therefore the model name is the
astral<00:02:15.300> Churchill<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.350> neck<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.860> can<00:02:17.040> see

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
astral Churchill the neck you can see

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.520 
astral Churchill the neck you can see
his<00:02:17.640> mahogany<00:02:18.510> with<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.900> oak<00:02:19.020> strip<00:02:19.320> for

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
his mahogany with the oak strip for

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.980 
his mahogany with the oak strip for
reinforcement<00:02:20.190> down<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.460> middle

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
reinforcement down the middle

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.570 
reinforcement down the middle
it's<00:02:21.990> pieced<00:02:22.380> together<00:02:22.590> because<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.460> is

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
it's pieced together because this is

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.130 
it's pieced together because this is
actually<00:02:23.760> from<00:02:25.160> previous<00:02:26.160> instrum<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.780> from

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
actually from previous instrum is from

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.560 
actually from previous instrum is from
scrap<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:29.370> everything<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:30.240> kind<00:02:30.480> of

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
scrap so everything is just kind of

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.120 
scrap so everything is just kind of
laminated<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.620> glued<00:02:31.860> together<00:02:32.240> used<00:02:33.240> some

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
laminated and glued together used some

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.580 
laminated and glued together used some
standard<00:02:35.130> guitar<00:02:35.430> tuning<00:02:35.790> machines<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.590> puts

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
standard guitar tuning machines and puts

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.530 
standard guitar tuning machines and puts
them<00:02:37.740> in<00:02:37.860> set<00:02:38.070> pieces<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.460> maple<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:39.090> there

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
them in set pieces of maple in there

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.260 
them in set pieces of maple in there
now<00:02:40.320> we've<00:02:40.470> got<00:02:40.710> maple<00:02:41.250> headstock<00:02:41.850> overlay

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
now we've got maple headstock overlay

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.380 
now we've got maple headstock overlay
with<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.690> have<00:02:43.110> any<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.530> light<00:02:43.740> on<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.390> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
with that have any in light on it the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.000 
with that have any in light on it the
nut<00:02:45.840> here<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.320> awful<00:02:46.650> but<00:02:47.390> also<00:02:48.390> book<00:02:48.930> OD<00:02:49.200> yeah

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
nut here is awful but also book OD yeah

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.590 
nut here is awful but also book OD yeah
which<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.459> found<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.150> makes<00:02:51.450> pretty

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
which I found that it makes pretty

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.740 
which I found that it makes pretty
decent<00:02:52.080> nuttin<00:02:52.350> bridge<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:54.480> fretboard

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
decent nuttin bridge the fretboard

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.820 
decent nuttin bridge the fretboard
itself<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.220> cocobolo<00:02:57.140> it's<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.290> fairly

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
itself it is cocobolo it's a fairly

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.530 
itself it is cocobolo it's a fairly
light<00:02:59.010> colored<00:02:59.370> piece<00:02:59.610> had<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.940> lot<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.120> red<00:03:00.390> in

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
light colored piece had a lot of red in

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.270 
light colored piece had a lot of red in
it<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:01.020> I<00:03:01.110> thought<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.410> was<00:03:01.500> pretty<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.070> went

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
it and I thought it was pretty so I went

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.850 
it and I thought it was pretty so I went
