00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 haley youtuber I'm all gaming 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.580
 party and oh my god it's all over again 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.200
 go with animal crossing juli a big 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.840
 trick video again from me 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.059
 I hope we will not do the tricks soon 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.800
 go out 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.560
 yes you can take with me 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.020
 Camera on and I hope that it is not 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.939
 will be more long because yes this 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.320
 strike the brow me mega crass the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.730
 camera itself it was good but this one 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.739
 does not necessarily have to be and therefore 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.670
 if i have a cellphone years new then 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.190
 I probably take the phone 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.750
 also because something I would like to ask you 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.430
 not present again I have to say 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.410
 how you want that and then we catch 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.260
 I'm in the water right now 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.940
 and we do the cash and for 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.559
 Beginners who never did the trick 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.739
 I admit I have it too 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.390
 so far I would manage three times 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.530
 quite honestly recommend the water 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.699
 because it is the easiest and yes me 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.949
 I did it that way 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.809
 Flower oriented where I start and 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.170
 I have the third one here 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.610
 flower started and was depressed and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.979
 always sneaking forward 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.260
 so now lets me take a quick look at the finger 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.080
 position I say so 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.080
 So yes, this presses the whole time and 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.450
 here you have your sliding pad must 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.369
 you as slowly as possible only once 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.759
 Do the front he should you can 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.880
 either doing it or something or something 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.110
 thumb up I 'm doing my whole up 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.670
 and then I'll just hit it 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.590
 At the same time, I do not want to go down 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.590
 too fast or too slow will be back 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.790
 yes , bad fast will make you believe 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.790
 say or 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.590
 well no matter who catch are saying that 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.450
 now time to 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:55.580
 and yes you have to stop right 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.310
 slowly go forward 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.500
 until it goes so fast forward and me 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.830
 am back too fast now is back and 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.360
 it must always tacken as a piece had 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.130
 I go forward so about so yes 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.840
 so good 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.560
 he would have to hold it down just like that 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.560
 and yes 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.200
 but did not work 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.710
 he is fast did not work out yes that 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.710
 I'll try again 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.990
 So you see your trick fight for mine 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.820
 God it's beautiful that he works and 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.660
 not so beautiful meets the picture 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.190
 That's pretty handy, kaka is 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.720
 if you wanted to go away just have to 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.540
 who go up again or you have to 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.830
 approach and so little white and only at 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.480
 got talent managed 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.070
 I do not know if this is true even with the big one 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.540
 I can make tree I have a thousand 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:54.370
 Tried it I did not get it 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.080
 it gets boring kathi bin and you 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.220
 You can also try it in houses 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.930
 I only took the water now 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.550
 because it is somehow that 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.690
 easiest i would say it takes 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.010
 Not too long and yes that would be it 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.930
 because actually you can fish quietly 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:13.690
 Fishing is pretty cool as are you 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:15.489
 maybe not so disabled anymore 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.040
 and I was pleased that it too 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.290
 a video has worked and I now 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.729
 say that 's it, she subscribes 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.500
 still wanted to see more videos from me 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.270
 and she also does not want to miss and 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.310
 but subscribe to the rocker and 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.680
 subscribe but also my second channel 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.780
 the capital left at the video 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.870
 description or would I say there I am 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.870
 I 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.580
 see you next time
