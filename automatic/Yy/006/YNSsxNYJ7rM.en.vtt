00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
so this is how it works you just take

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.420 
so this is how it works you just take
off<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.840> back<00:01:13.080> panel<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:14.100> you'll<00:01:14.310> see

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
off this back panel and what you'll see

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.030 
off this back panel and what you'll see
is<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.810> samsung<00:01:16.229> galaxy<00:01:16.619> note<00:01:16.799> 2<00:01:17.009> has

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
is that the samsung galaxy note 2 has

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.190 
is that the samsung galaxy note 2 has
already<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.150> connection<00:01:18.799> for<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:20.100> wireless

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
already the connection for a wireless

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.289 
already the connection for a wireless
back<00:01:22.200> cover<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:23.040> Samsung<00:01:23.460> never<00:01:23.640> released<00:01:24.060> it

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
back cover but Samsung never released it

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.719 
back cover but Samsung never released it
so<00:01:25.280> what<00:01:26.280> you'll<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.479> put<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.869> one

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
so what you'll do is you put this one

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.569 
so what you'll do is you put this one
adapter<00:01:29.729> right<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.270> these<00:01:31.170> two<00:01:31.590> golden<00:01:32.189> pins

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
adapter right on these two golden pins

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.710 
adapter right on these two golden pins
and<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:35.340> connects<00:01:37.159> here<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.280> go<00:01:38.540> you<00:01:39.540> can

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
and so it connects here you go you can

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.050 
and so it connects here you go you can
of<00:01:39.840> course<00:01:40.880> stick<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.210> glue<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.930> your

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
of course stick it and glue it to your

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.899 
of course stick it and glue it to your
battery<00:01:45.060> which<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.990> won't<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:46.680> because<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.700> also

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
battery which I won't do because it also

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.380 
battery which I won't do because it also
is<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.600> very<00:01:48.930> solid<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.950> put<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:51.149> back

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
is it's very solid of you put the back

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.100 
is it's very solid of you put the back
cover<00:01:51.420> back<00:01:51.899> back<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.040> see<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.810> a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
cover back back on and you see it is a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.359 
cover back back on and you see it is a
bit<00:01:55.590> yeah<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:57.060> know<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:58.320> can't<00:01:58.619> even<00:01:58.950> see<00:01:59.340> that

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
bit yeah I know you can't even see that

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.520 
bit yeah I know you can't even see that
there's<00:01:59.759> something<00:02:00.119> underneath<00:02:00.540> what<00:02:01.350> you

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
there's something underneath what you

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.010 
there's something underneath what you
can<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.549> feel<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.659> build

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
can do is you can feel that the build

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.350 
can do is you can feel that the build
quality<00:02:04.170> gets<00:02:04.740> much<00:02:05.219> more<00:02:05.430> solid<00:02:05.820> because<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
quality gets much more solid because the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.160 
quality gets much more solid because the
battery<00:02:07.170> cover<00:02:07.439> sits<00:02:08.479> even<00:02:09.479> better<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
battery cover sits even better on the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.210 
battery cover sits even better on the
Galaxy<00:02:10.590> Note<00:02:10.739> 2<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.849> does<00:02:12.379> move<00:02:13.379> out<00:02:13.530> this

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
Galaxy Note 2 and it does move out this

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.820 
Galaxy Note 2 and it does move out this
adapt<00:02:15.060> trip<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.750> what<00:02:16.080> you'll<00:02:16.230> do<00:02:16.380> next<00:02:16.560> is

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
adapt trip so what you'll do next is

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.220 
adapt trip so what you'll do next is
just<00:02:17.280> put<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.580> Galaxy<00:02:17.970> Note<00:02:18.090> 2<00:02:18.330> on<00:02:18.540> this
