00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello everyone here the vegan cat and a 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.820
 day more I bring you a video but this time 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.460
 is to comment on a topic that the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.679
 truth is that it has been many years since 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.350
 brings head is a subject of 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.289
 education awareness more than anything 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.470
 and it's about marketing and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.090
 abandonment of turtles in recent years 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.550
 when it's been quite 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:32.140
 it was very common to have water turtles 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.890
 buy them that they were a gift in 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.309
 a tombola finally gave me any 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.989
 thing and of course you have to admit that they are 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:46.600
 very cute when they are very little turtles 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:50.199
 little girls that are just a coin 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.980
 what happens that these turtles grow up although 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.079
 do not believe it they grow when we have a 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.109
 small turtle anywhere 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.500
 Well, you can have I do not know what's going on 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:05.320
 that turtles are growing and this 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.380
 size is still quite acceptable such 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.570
 to act is about 7 years old but we 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.009
 we find that turtles are still 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.920
 growing 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.870
 she is 23 years old, she has even 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.030
 more than me 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.620
 this is what we find after 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.990
 from a time of having the turtles 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.200
 even sometimes the series are made 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.090
 large without actually having 23 years 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.430
 happens when the turtles come to this 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.900
 size simply people do not find 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.030
 where to have them and decide to leave 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.050
 many have been found in 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:45.430
 containers in a box on the street there are 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:48.400
 people who choose to drop them in a river and 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.180
 what happens with releasing them in a river gentlemen 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.180
 It is a mistake for us here in Spain 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.260
 native turtle is the leprous turtle 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.050
 and it's disappearing mostly because of 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.790
 people that good that you release to these 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:10.050
 turtles are very invasive 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.630
 so much with all the fauna and flora and it 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.710
 do with the total territory of the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.930
 rivers treatment ponds wherever 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.600
 people want to let them get done with 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.330
 the domain and destroy everything doing 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.730
 that is not so much autochthonous 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.130
 reproduce and disappearing by 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.380
 Of course it is not that I am against 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.170
 these turtles logically live as with 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.690
 four is simply that who decides 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.150
 have or adopt a turtle 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.700
 of these you have to be aware of what 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.180
 what is doing a turtle can 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.540
 live more than 40 years and reach 40 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.960
 centimeters is a lot but logically 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.590
 you have to know to what dimensions 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.110
 an animal can arrive before 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.490
 accept it true then it is a 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.670
 problematic in addition to being 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.040
 a gift that people do or that 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.650
 buy the children as if they were 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.160
 toys and gentlemen is not a toy 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.230
 besides being animals that require 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.130
 a lot of care that requires having 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.540
 spaces prepared for them with 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.900
 a temperature with rays 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:30.710
 ultraviolet a specific feed 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:34.010
 space sun in the end basic care not 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.230
 it's worth having them in a terrarium for life 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.000
 where the animal can neither be the 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.350
 return 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.550
 then I from here I encourage you not to 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:49.880
 promote the trade of turtles not 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.130
 buy turtles please because in your 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.280
 The vast majority usually come from state 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.740
 wild in which they are already free and the 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.160
 choose to 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.310
 see them and sell them when they are too 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.550
 little girls that sometimes is even 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.610
 forbidden to sell them so small but 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.490
 the merchants good they just seek 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.400
 money if you have a turtle and it turns out 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.549
 that for some problem you can not 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.129
 keep having it 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.650
 look for someone who does have 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:24.280
 conditions and does not abandon them go for 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.620
 favor 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.170
 a river is not a place to leave a 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.230
 turtle that has lived all his life in a 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:35.160
 terrarium or that you have been feeding 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.380
 every day do not think you're going to see 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.380
 As a general rule, you will not know how 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.870
 feed yourself how to look for life 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.900
 and then there are many many 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:51.010
 protective of animals that have 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.560
 turtles for adoption in all countries 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.320
 whether we are here in Spain or in 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.170
 Latin America there are many people who do not 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.830
 You can have these turtles in places 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:05.800
 that have been invaded by 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.580
 too many turtles of these and they look for 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.540
 adopters so whoever is totally 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.300
 decided who has all the 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.380
 conditions to have these animals 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.770
 I encourage you to visit these pages 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.960
 of associations that do not give up if in 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.600
 that moment there is no adoption that 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.090
 there are always unfortunately after a 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.690
 there is always time in adoption 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:35.380
 and what good before having one that they know 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:38.080
 well what are you doing because this 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.440
 is for your whole life we are accepting 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.020
 a responsibility is a life and not a 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.460
 wrong toy in a toy to give him 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.860
 to the children so well I hope that 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:54.310
 this help some turtle in the world 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.960
 so that it does not become abandoned or not 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.360
 be a victim of animal trade 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.540
 until the next video guys up 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.540
 then
