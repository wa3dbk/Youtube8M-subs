both checkers and newcomers alike what

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.820 
both checkers and newcomers alike what
was<00:00:06.299> it<00:00:06.420> about<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.870> script<00:00:07.230> for<00:00:07.470> into

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
was it about the script for into

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.140 
was it about the script for into
darkness<00:00:08.130> that<00:00:08.309> sort<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.550> drew<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.030> I

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
darkness that sort of drew you in I

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.549 
darkness that sort of drew you in I
think<00:00:09.210> you<00:00:09.389> get<00:00:09.570> all<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.750> best<00:00:09.870> lines<00:00:10.050> for<00:00:10.380> one

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
think you get all the best lines for one

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.700 
think you get all the best lines for one
thing<00:00:11.960> what<00:00:12.960> drew<00:00:13.110> me<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.380> think<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.620> was

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
thing what drew me and I think it was

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.760 
thing what drew me and I think it was
the<00:00:14.480> development<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.630> characters<00:00:16.080> you

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
the development of the characters you

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.410 
the development of the characters you
know<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.730> first<00:00:17.910> film<00:00:18.150> was<00:00:18.330> about

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
know the first film was about

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.910 
know the first film was about
establishing<00:00:18.779> all<00:00:19.199> these<00:00:19.320> characters<00:00:19.740> and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
establishing all these characters and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.260 
establishing all these characters and
this<00:00:20.010> one<00:00:20.160> we<00:00:20.340> kind<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.880> really<00:00:21.060> hit<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
this one we kind of really hit the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.050 
this one we kind of really hit the
ground<00:00:21.300> running<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.519> those<00:00:23.519> relationships

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
ground running and those relationships

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.060 
ground running and those relationships
are<00:00:24.539> particularly<00:00:25.160> Kirk<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.490> Spock<00:00:26.810> are

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
are particularly Kirk and Spock are

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.490 
are particularly Kirk and Spock are
deepened<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:30.300> always<00:00:31.080> seemed<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.349> me<00:00:31.439> that

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
deepened and it always seemed to me that

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.220 
deepened and it always seemed to me that
the<00:00:31.710> script<00:00:32.040> had<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> real<00:00:32.489> emotional<00:00:33.480> heart<00:00:33.989> to

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the script had a real emotional heart to

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.709 
the script had a real emotional heart to
it<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.860> think<00:00:35.070> that's<00:00:35.219> one<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> reasons

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
it and I think that's one of the reasons

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.590 
it and I think that's one of the reasons
why<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:37.399> so<00:00:38.399> well-received<00:00:38.850> what<00:00:39.450> were<00:00:39.510> you

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
why it's so well-received what were you

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.760 
why it's so well-received what were you
particularly<00:00:39.960> excited<00:00:40.320> about<00:00:40.350> exploring

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
particularly excited about exploring

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.850 
particularly excited about exploring
with<00:00:41.160> bones<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.670> time<00:00:41.850> around<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.739> was<00:00:43.739> just

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
with bones this time around I was just

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.520 
with bones this time around I was just
really<00:00:44.250> kind<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.399> looking<00:00:44.730> forward<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.530> you

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
really kind of looking forward to you
