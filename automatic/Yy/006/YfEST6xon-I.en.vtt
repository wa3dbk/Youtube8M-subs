00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.019
 cooking and fast today we 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.410
 let's make an ultra caramel cake 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.710
 easy 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.730
 let's go for the recipe of 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.520
 caramel cake 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.760
 we will need 200 g of flour 150 g 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.029
 of sugar 100 g of butter 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.930
 250 g caramel dessert cream 3rd and 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.930
 a packet of baking powder 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.930
 we start by breaking the 2 we put the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.610
 sugar and windows 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.680
 our two ingredients to make them 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:44.780
 well sparkling then we add the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.780
 two jars of caramel dessert cream 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:55.620
 that's really what will give us this 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:01:01.859
 little taste of childhood and stirred well 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.420
 between each ingredient now I 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.049
 put my butter to melt in the microwave 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:12.320
 for about 25 seconds 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.320
 I add my melted butter and mix 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:25.700
 now with my friend I come there 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:40.760
 place the flour with the yeast 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:44.020
 chemical and I sift the whole thing with 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:48.190
 my crazy and I just mix the flour 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.190
 gently to the rest of the preparation 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:03.800
 so at this point if we want we can 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:12.680
 add a little bit of salt and have 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:14.959
 stirred as it should I pour my 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.850
 preparation in a silicone mold 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.850
 that I slightly buttered 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.350
 I tap the mold to chase 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.560
 any air bubbles we go 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.940
 bake in an oven so preheated to 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.170
 170 Â° for about 45 minutes then 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.940
 at the exit of the oven I can tell you 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.930
 that it smells very very good we're going 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.890
 control the cooking 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:55.110
 so I serve a pic inside 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.110
 the peak springs dry is that it's cooked 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.490
 then we will go to demoulding 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:18.730
 wow super result so I put that 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:22.569
 directly on my plate and I 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.940
 go back here is the result so it's 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:29.370
 not bad for a perfect cooking 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.269
 but nice caramel color 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.410
 no now it's missing more than 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:42.400
 go to tasting 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:51.220
 so I cut a slice I you 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:53.410
 shows on the inside we have this little taste 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.049
 caramel that reminds us of our childhood 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.780
 the recipe is well balanced now 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.549
 you just have to try it 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.810
 after having feasted with my recipe I 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.760
 really advise you to try 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.480
 good appetite to all and to invite oneself on 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.480
 fast food to
