00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
have mods for it to um I guess use them

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.560 
have mods for it to um I guess use them
in<00:02:01.950> game<00:02:02.159> even<00:02:02.579> though<00:02:02.700> they're<00:02:02.880> not<00:02:03.030> really

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
in game even though they're not really

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.959 
in game even though they're not really
supposed<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.680> be<00:02:04.829> there<00:02:05.070> they're<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.520> coded

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
supposed to be there they're just coded

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.119 
supposed to be there they're just coded
there's<00:02:06.930> mods<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.530> stuff<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:07.979> they're

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
there's mods and stuff so they're

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.410 
there's mods and stuff so they're
actually<00:02:08.310> there<00:02:08.940> um<00:02:10.370> so<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.640> might<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.239> might

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
actually there um so we might you might

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.800 
actually there um so we might you might
want<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.720> expect<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.230> maybe

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
want to expect that maybe

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.970 
want to expect that maybe
skins<00:02:14.770> are<00:02:15.250> not<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:16.060> far<00:02:16.330> developed<00:02:16.780> as<00:02:17.470> to

what<00:02:18.130> we've<00:02:18.280> heard<00:02:18.489> they<00:02:18.970> probably<00:02:19.270> won't<00:02:19.480> be

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
what we've heard they probably won't be

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
next update again that could be in the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
next big step update but we're not sure

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.220 
next big step update but we're not sure
quite<00:02:47.769> yet<00:02:47.850> another<00:02:48.850> thing<00:02:49.120> leather<00:02:49.959> and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
quite yet another thing leather and

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.650 
quite yet another thing leather and
cobwebs<00:02:50.739> have<00:02:51.130> been<00:02:51.519> coated<00:02:51.880> they've<00:02:52.510> been

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
cobwebs have been coated they've been

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.449 
cobwebs have been coated they've been
coated<00:02:52.930> for<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.200> little<00:02:53.380> while<00:02:53.590> cobwebs<00:02:54.220> make

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
coated for a little while cobwebs make

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.860 
coated for a little while cobwebs make
you<00:02:54.610> slower<00:02:54.880> just<00:02:55.209> like<00:02:55.330> they're<00:02:55.480> supposed<00:02:55.600> to

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
you slower just like they're supposed to

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.930 
you slower just like they're supposed to
they<00:02:55.959> look<00:02:56.319> fine<00:02:56.560> so<00:02:57.190> we<00:02:57.310> can<00:02:57.430> probably<00:02:57.700> be

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
they look fine so we can probably be

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.710 
they look fine so we can probably be
expecting<00:02:58.599> cobwebs<00:02:59.140> on<00:02:59.440> leather<00:03:00.510> maybe<00:03:01.510> not

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
expecting cobwebs on leather maybe not

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.050 
expecting cobwebs on leather maybe not
to<00:03:01.930> create<00:03:02.200> armor<00:03:02.560> but<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:03.220> could<00:03:03.640> be<00:03:03.819> it<00:03:04.000> could

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
to create armor but it could be it could

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.890 
to create armor but it could be it could
be<00:03:04.360> put<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.720> game<00:03:04.900> for<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.230> drop<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:06.580> it's<00:03:07.540> not

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
be put in the game for a drop I it's not

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.930 
be put in the game for a drop I it's not
expected<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.769> they're<00:03:09.220> going<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.370> put<00:03:09.580> armor

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
expected that they're going to put armor

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.270 
expected that they're going to put armor
they<00:03:10.480> seem<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.900> be<00:03:11.019> in<00:03:11.200> progress<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:12.040> they

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
they seem to be in progress and they

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.940 
they seem to be in progress and they
seem<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.519> have<00:03:12.610> issues<00:03:13.209> with<00:03:13.390> them<00:03:13.739> just<00:03:14.739> for

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
seem to have issues with them just for

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.610 
seem to have issues with them just for
performance<00:03:15.580> for<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.360> older<00:03:16.720> devices<00:03:17.049> they

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
performance for the older devices they

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.160 
performance for the older devices they
really<00:03:17.890> have<00:03:18.070> trouble<00:03:18.340> with<00:03:18.640> buckets

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
really have trouble with buckets

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.039 
really have trouble with buckets
especially<00:03:20.170> because<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.130> source<00:03:21.400> blocks<00:03:22.049> and

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
especially because the source blocks and

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.580 
especially because the source blocks and
when<00:03:23.709> it<00:03:23.829> moves<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.370> creates<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.730> lot<00:03:24.880> of<00:03:24.940> memory

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
when it moves it creates a lot of memory

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.810 
when it moves it creates a lot of memory
there<00:03:26.590> generates<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.310> lot<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.459> memory<00:03:27.790> that

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
there generates a lot of memory that

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.729 
there generates a lot of memory that
needs<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.269> be<00:03:29.100> produced<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.569> also<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:32.319> armor

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
needs to be produced and also the armor

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.789 
needs to be produced and also the armor
it's<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.459> don't<00:03:34.000> see<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.660> huge<00:03:35.319> difference<00:03:35.680> i

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
it's I don't see the huge difference i

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.949 
it's I don't see the huge difference i
guess<00:03:36.010> they<00:03:36.130> got<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.370> create<00:03:36.609> a<00:03:36.640> new<00:03:36.790> GUI<00:03:37.150> they

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
guess they got to create a new GUI they

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.720 
guess they got to create a new GUI they
guy<00:03:38.109> deal<00:03:38.319> with<00:03:38.410> all<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:38.620> stuff<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.489> it's

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
guy deal with all that stuff so it's

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.309 
guy deal with all that stuff so it's
still<00:03:40.030> in<00:03:40.120> progress<00:03:40.329> and<00:03:40.870> we<00:03:40.930> can<00:03:41.109> probably

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
still in progress and we can probably

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.340 
still in progress and we can probably
expect<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:41.920> for<00:03:42.609> the<00:03:42.760> update<00:03:43.420> coming<00:03:43.750> after

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
expect that for the update coming after

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
expect that for the update coming after
0.5<00:03:44.739> point<00:03:45.609> one<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:47.560> that's<00:03:47.709> pretty<00:03:48.010> much<00:03:48.190> an

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
0.5 point one so that's pretty much an

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.039 
0.5 point one so that's pretty much an
overview<00:03:48.850> of<00:03:48.910> everything<00:03:49.120> we<00:03:49.540> know<00:03:49.720> up<00:03:49.989> to

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
overview of everything we know up to

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.090 
overview of everything we know up to
this<00:03:50.319> date<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.549> date<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.910> recording<00:03:52.480> um<00:03:53.100> so

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
this date to the date of recording um so
