Coria<00:01:51.159> that<00:01:51.369> i<00:01:51.640> later<00:01:52.119> that<00:01:52.359> just<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:52.689> too

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
Coria that i later that just is too

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.990 
Coria that i later that just is too
expensive<00:01:53.140> as<00:01:53.439> well<00:01:53.649> as<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.579> reason<00:01:54.880> why<00:01:54.969> I

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
expensive as well as the reason why I

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.300 
expensive as well as the reason why I
like<00:01:55.149> it<00:01:55.299> comes<00:01:55.600> with<00:01:55.719> also<00:01:56.079> long-lasting<00:01:56.829> but

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
like it comes with also long-lasting but

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.010 
like it comes with also long-lasting but
do<00:01:57.460> keep<00:01:57.640> in<00:01:57.759> mind<00:01:57.819> that<00:01:58.060> I<00:01:58.149> do<00:01:58.270> use<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.659> primer

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
do keep in mind that I do use a primer

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.139 
do keep in mind that I do use a primer
and<00:01:59.289> I<00:01:59.350> do<00:01:59.409> use<00:01:59.770> an<00:01:59.920> eyeshadow<00:02:00.100> underneath<00:02:00.850> the

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149

car later

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.959 
car later
