you I play top layer and this is a
gerund<00:00:05.370> toppling<00:00:05.879> quick<00:00:06.150> guide<00:00:06.330> so<00:00:07.109> let's

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
gerund toppling quick guide so let's

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.060 
gerund toppling quick guide so let's
start<00:00:07.529> with<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.099> runes<00:00:08.309> i<00:00:08.910> take<00:00:09.740> 1580<00:00:10.740> rooms

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
start with the runes i take 1580 rooms

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.570 
start with the runes i take 1580 rooms
because<00:00:12.110> he<00:00:13.110> skills<00:00:13.410> mostly<00:00:13.980> with<00:00:14.099> AD<00:00:14.280> and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
because he skills mostly with AD and

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.730 
because he skills mostly with AD and
doesn't<00:00:15.059> really<00:00:15.179> need<00:00:15.360> more<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:17.570> durability

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
doesn't really need more of durability

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.920 
doesn't really need more of durability
why<00:00:19.740> because<00:00:20.100> has<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> shield<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.750> can

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
why because has a shield and you can

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.070 
why because has a shield and you can
start<00:00:22.170> with<00:00:23.240> items<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.390> survive<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:24.900> laning

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
start with items to survive in laning

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.890 
start with items to survive in laning
phase<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.650> then<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.640> take<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.300> armor<00:00:27.599> seals

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
phase and then you take the armor seals

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.160 
phase and then you take the armor seals
and<00:00:28.170> magic<00:00:28.289> resist<00:00:28.590> glyphs<00:00:29.330> just<00:00:30.330> because<00:00:30.990> you

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
and magic resist glyphs just because you

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.220 
and magic resist glyphs just because you
need<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> durability<00:00:33.079> on<00:00:34.079> skills<00:00:34.559> actually

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
need the durability on skills actually

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.950 
need the durability on skills actually
and<00:00:37.230> start<00:00:38.070> by<00:00:39.860> maxing<00:00:40.860> q<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.550> e<00:00:41.780> depends<00:00:42.780> on

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
and start by maxing q or e depends on

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.240 
and start by maxing q or e depends on
you<00:00:43.219> if<00:00:44.219> i<00:00:44.399> were<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:45.590> lane<00:00:46.590> against<00:00:46.890> someone

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
you if i were to lane against someone

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.170 
you if i were to lane against someone
like<00:00:47.280> ajax<00:00:47.850> i<00:00:48.120> would<00:00:48.719> max<00:00:49.559> Q<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.520> spam<00:00:51.000> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
like ajax i would max Q and spam it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.560 
like ajax i would max Q and spam it
forward<00:00:51.899> lean<00:00:52.170> against<00:00:52.530> someone<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.570> Shen

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
forward lean against someone like Shen

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.459 
forward lean against someone like Shen
probably<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.739> max<00:00:56.250> e<00:00:56.600> but<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:58.050> would

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
probably with the max e but I would

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.369 
probably with the max e but I would
start<00:00:58.739> with<00:00:58.800> Q<00:00:59.190> then<00:00:59.670> get<00:00:59.969> e<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.690> get<00:01:00.930> w

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
start with Q then get e and then get w

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.109 
start with Q then get e and then get w
anyway<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:04.019> pretty<00:01:04.260> much<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.790> let's<00:01:05.790> jump

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
anyway so that pretty much it let's jump

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.980 
anyway so that pretty much it let's jump
in<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.299> game<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.659> check<00:01:07.020> masteries<00:01:08.869> to<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
in the game and check masteries to the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.649 
in the game and check masteries to the
field<00:01:10.260> job<00:01:10.680> justice<00:01:11.689> ok<00:01:12.689> for<00:01:13.049> masteries<00:01:14.659> that

field job justice ok for masteries that

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.810 
field job justice ok for masteries that
is<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.229> master<00:01:16.740> builder<00:01:16.920> them<00:01:17.250> pretty<00:01:17.520> much

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
is the master builder them pretty much

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.810 
is the master builder them pretty much

more some block damage reduced lows flat
health<00:01:47.850> more<00:01:48.329> help<00:01:48.950> reduce<00:01:49.950> CC<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.790> damage

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
health more help reduce CC and damage

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.389 
health more help reduce CC and damage
they<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.630> reduce<00:01:51.990> mint<00:01:52.259> which<00:01:52.590> probably

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
they can reduce mint which probably

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.330 
they can reduce mint which probably

actual item vote i would start with coat
armor<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.079> then<00:02:05.040> probably<00:02:05.430> would<00:02:05.820> aim<00:02:06.030> for

Doran shield or Dorrans plate why

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.280 
Doran shield or Dorrans plate why
because

I'm<00:05:33.880> actually<00:05:34.060> thinking<00:05:34.480> if<00:05:35.220> if<00:05:36.220> you<00:05:36.550> would

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730

like if you get some like black fever
earlier<00:05:38.920> you<00:05:39.190> could<00:05:39.340> even<00:05:39.520> start<00:05:39.940> by

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
earlier you could even start by

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.080 
earlier you could even start by
assassinating<00:05:41.530> people<00:05:41.860> like<00:05:42.310> jump<00:05:42.880> with

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
flash q UW and then just killing them
