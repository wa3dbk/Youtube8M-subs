00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
of around all the crevices now this is a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.469 
of around all the crevices now this is a
bonnet<00:01:43.159> that's<00:01:43.369> been<00:01:43.609> in<00:01:43.789> for<00:01:43.999> a<00:01:44.030> week<00:01:44.270> in<00:01:44.450> the

what<00:01:49.369> I've<00:01:49.490> decided<00:01:49.579> to<00:01:49.999> do<00:01:50.329> it<00:01:51.200> works<00:01:51.409> better

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
what I've decided to do it works better

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.359 
what I've decided to do it works better
if<00:01:52.929> I<00:01:53.929> left<00:01:54.109> it<00:01:54.229> into<00:01:54.469> say<00:01:54.619> three<00:01:54.979> weeks<00:01:55.130> it

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
if I left it into say three weeks it

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.279 
if I left it into say three weeks it
would<00:01:55.850> remove<00:01:56.240> all<00:01:56.389> the<00:01:56.539> paint<00:01:56.810> but<00:01:57.079> what<00:01:57.200> I've

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
would remove all the paint but what I've

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.950 
would remove all the paint but what I've
actually<00:01:57.409> done

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.920 

this<00:02:04.960> is<00:02:05.080> y'all<00:02:05.290> AHA<00:02:05.700> now<00:02:06.700> coated<00:02:07.150> that<00:02:07.299> with

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
this is y'all AHA now coated that with

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.690 
this is y'all AHA now coated that with
some<00:02:08.550> paint<00:02:09.550> stripper<00:02:11.130> let<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.250> dry<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:12.640> put

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
some paint stripper let it dry and put

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.590 
some paint stripper let it dry and put
it<00:02:12.910> in<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.120> tank

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
it in the tank

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.080 
it in the tank
now<00:02:13.990> again<00:02:14.620> it's<00:02:14.860> still<00:02:15.040> that's<00:02:15.400> been<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:15.910> for

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
now again it's still that's been in for

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.650 
now again it's still that's been in for
a<00:02:16.150> week<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.670> can<00:02:21.790> actually<00:02:22.030> get<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.300> compare

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
a week you can actually get to compare

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.760 
a week you can actually get to compare
the<00:02:22.840> two<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:25.930> better<00:02:26.110> off<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.350> do<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.590> bit

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
the two so it's better off to do a bit

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.840 
the two so it's better off to do a bit
of<00:02:26.800> paint<00:02:27.069> stripping<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.520> get<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.730> actual

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
of paint stripping to get the actual

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.580 
of paint stripping to get the actual
paint<00:02:28.270> off<00:02:28.420> first<00:02:28.450> before<00:02:28.989> you<00:02:29.230> put<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:29.530> a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
paint off first before you put it in a

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.290 
paint off first before you put it in a
solution<00:02:32.340> but<00:02:33.340> what<00:02:33.519> seems<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.850> work<00:02:33.940> better

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
solution but what seems to work better

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.600 
solution but what seems to work better
or<00:02:34.420> gain<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:35.019> is<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.500> paint<00:02:35.739> strip<00:02:36.100> at<00:02:36.280> first

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
or gain is is to paint strip at first

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.750 
or gain is is to paint strip at first
and<00:02:36.970> then<00:02:37.930> pressure<00:02:38.260> wash<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.890> off<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.430> then

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
and then pressure wash that off and then

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.060 
and then pressure wash that off and then
put<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:40.480> it's<00:02:40.600> a<00:02:40.690> much<00:02:40.900> easier<00:02:41.140> system

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
put it in and it's a much easier system

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.340 
put it in and it's a much easier system
what<00:02:42.670> you're<00:02:42.850> doing<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.209> putting<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.019> tank

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
what you're doing is putting it in tank

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.960 
what you're doing is putting it in tank
and<00:02:44.560> waiting<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.010> week<00:02:45.220> or<00:02:45.400> waiting<00:02:45.730> two<00:02:45.940> weeks

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
and waiting a week or waiting two weeks

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.809 
and waiting a week or waiting two weeks
you<00:02:46.720> don't<00:02:46.870> have<00:02:47.050> to<00:02:47.110> spend<00:02:47.350> hours<00:02:47.560> sanding<00:02:48.310> so

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
you don't have to spend hours sanding so

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.040 
you don't have to spend hours sanding so
it's<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.030> lot<00:02:49.209> easier<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.840> do<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:51.810> think<00:02:52.810> it's

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
it's a lot easier to do I think it's

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.540 
it's a lot easier to do I think it's
worth<00:02:53.080> having<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.590> gun<00:02:53.769> one<00:02:54.069> thing<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.370> note

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
worth having a gun one thing to note

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.090 
worth having a gun one thing to note
about<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.819> -<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.569> is<00:02:55.930> slower<00:02:56.319> in<00:02:56.650> colder

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
about it - it is slower in colder

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.699 
about it - it is slower in colder
weather<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:58.150> summer<00:02:58.989> it'll<00:02:59.319> work<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.590> lot

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
weather so summer it'll work a lot

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.009 
weather so summer it'll work a lot
quicker<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.970> cold<00:03:01.239> weather<00:03:01.420> -<00:03:01.630> seem<00:03:01.840> to

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
quicker and the cold weather - seem to

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.610 
quicker and the cold weather - seem to
react<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.769> bit<00:03:02.890> slower<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.170> go<00:03:05.410> at<00:03:05.530> it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
react a bit slower so have a go at it

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.370 
react a bit slower so have a go at it
it's<00:03:06.190> worth<00:03:06.370> doing<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:07.630> it'll<00:03:07.840> save<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.230> some

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
it's worth doing and it'll save you some

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.759 
it's worth doing and it'll save you some
bucks

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
bucks

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:17.620 
bucks
thank<00:03:09.250> you

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.690
