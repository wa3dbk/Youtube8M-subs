00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
bobbin thread however has basically very

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.139 
bobbin thread however has basically very
little<00:01:16.889> distance<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.670> travel

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
little distance to travel

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.940 
little distance to travel
that's<00:01:18.539> why<00:01:18.749> coin<00:01:19.109> oft<00:01:19.319> and<00:01:19.530> you'll<00:01:19.619> find<00:01:19.889> that

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
that's why coin oft and you'll find that

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.520 
that's why coin oft and you'll find that
your<00:01:20.189> top<00:01:20.399> tension<00:01:20.840> needs<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.139> tightened

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
your top tension needs to be tightened

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
your top tension needs to be tightened
up<00:01:22.619> as<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.249> bobbin<00:01:23.700> tension<00:01:23.850> pulls<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.359> little

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
up as the bobbin tension pulls a little

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.599 
up as the bobbin tension pulls a little
harder<00:01:24.899> it<00:01:25.350> doesn't<00:01:25.679> have<00:01:25.799> quite<00:01:26.069> so<00:01:26.249> far<00:01:26.429> to

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:26.609 
harder it doesn't have quite so far to

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:28.969 
harder it doesn't have quite so far to
go<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.270> top<00:01:27.509> thread<00:01:27.749> has<00:01:27.959> to<00:01:28.200> make<00:01:28.649> up<00:01:28.859> the

you we're now thinking in three
dimensions<00:02:51.069> that<00:02:51.640> if<00:02:51.819> they<00:02:52.060> hook<00:02:52.660> assembly<00:02:53.350> is

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
dimensions that if they hook assembly is

behind the needle and you pull the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.559 
behind the needle and you pull the
machine<00:02:55.900> towards<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:57.370> actually<00:02:57.580> close

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
machine towards you you actually close

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.720 
machine towards you you actually close
the<00:02:58.989> gap<00:02:59.200> between<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.920> needle<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.549> hook

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
the gap between the needle and the hook

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.880 
the gap between the needle and the hook
making<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.299> tighter<00:03:01.569> those<00:03:02.170> two<00:03:02.410> actually

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
making it tighter those two actually

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.910 
making it tighter those two actually
kiss<00:03:03.280> if<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.390> move<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.750> opposite<00:03:05.230> direction

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
kiss if you move the opposite direction

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.130 
kiss if you move the opposite direction
push<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.459> quilting<00:03:06.880> machine<00:03:07.030> away<00:03:07.360> from<00:03:07.930> you

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
push the quilting machine away from you

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.920 
push the quilting machine away from you
the<00:03:08.530> needle<00:03:08.890> actually<00:03:09.040> drives<00:03:09.549> toward<00:03:10.540> you

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
the needle actually drives toward you

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.350 
the needle actually drives toward you
when<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.830> happens<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.459> opens<00:03:12.880> up<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.150> little

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
when that happens it opens up a little

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.870 
when that happens it opens up a little
air<00:03:13.540> space<00:03:13.930> between<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:15.010> needle<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.549> the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
air space between the needle and the

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.150 
air space between the needle and the
hook<00:03:16.030> assembly<00:03:16.569> and<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:17.380> can<00:03:17.590> create<00:03:17.890> change

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
hook assembly and that can create change

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.150 
hook assembly and that can create change
in<00:03:18.370> your<00:03:18.489> tension<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.720> lastly<00:03:20.530> moving<00:03:20.950> in<00:03:21.069> the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
in your tension and lastly moving in the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.460 
in your tension and lastly moving in the
opposite<00:03:21.730> direction<00:03:21.910> if<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:22.870> move<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.440> your

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
opposite direction if you move to your

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.630 
opposite direction if you move to your
left<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:25.600> deal<00:03:26.100> drags<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.329> right<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:30.459> if

left the deal drags to the right and if

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.490 
left the deal drags to the right and if
it<00:03:30.790> drags<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.510> right<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:32.049> can<00:03:32.230> see<00:03:32.470> that

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
it drags to the right you can see that

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.710 
it drags to the right you can see that
it's<00:03:33.070> actually<00:03:33.400> not<00:03:33.880> going<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.269> get<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.600> the

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
it's actually not going to get to the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.059 
it's actually not going to get to the
meeting<00:03:35.049> place<00:03:35.230> for<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.590> hook<00:03:35.829> at<00:03:36.010> the

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.540 
thread but if the thread is actually
locked<00:05:52.790> in<00:05:53.060> the<00:05:53.150> layers<00:05:53.360> of<00:05:53.630> the<00:05:53.750> quilt<00:05:54.050> I

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
locked in the layers of the quilt I

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.400 
locked in the layers of the quilt I
won't<00:05:55.550> feel<00:05:55.850> that<00:05:56.120> but<00:05:56.720> my<00:05:56.870> eyes<00:05:57.080> might

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
won't feel that but my eyes might

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.350 
won't feel that but my eyes might
actually<00:05:57.650> see<00:05:58.130> that<00:05:58.310> thread<00:05:58.610> inside<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.150> hole

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
actually see that thread inside the hole

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.390 
actually see that thread inside the hole
so<00:06:00.170> the<00:06:00.290> next<00:06:00.500> time<00:06:00.740> you're<00:06:00.920> using<00:06:01.280> two

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
so the next time you're using two

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.160 
so the next time you're using two
different<00:06:01.730> colors<00:06:02.030> of<00:06:02.060> thread<00:06:02.330> for<00:06:02.480> example

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170 
different colors of thread for example

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.360 
different colors of thread for example
and<00:06:03.290> you're<00:06:03.380> thinking<00:06:03.560> that<00:06:03.890> your<00:06:03.980> tension

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.790 
and you're thinking that your tension
in<00:06:04.580> balance<00:06:04.970> remember<00:06:05.930> you<00:06:06.260> still<00:06:06.560> might<00:06:06.770> be

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
in balance remember you still might be

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.560 
in balance remember you still might be
seeing<00:06:07.190> the<00:06:07.280> freight<00:06:07.520> inside<00:06:07.850> the<00:06:08.030> hole<00:06:08.240> and

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
seeing the freight inside the hole and

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.300 
seeing the freight inside the hole and
you<00:06:09.020> could<00:06:09.169> take<00:06:09.350> the<00:06:09.380> quilt<00:06:09.740> off<00:06:10.010> of<00:06:10.190> your
