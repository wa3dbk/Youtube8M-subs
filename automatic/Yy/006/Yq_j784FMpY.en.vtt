00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.530
 Hello Tong Tong, We have a Galaxy S6 deployment today 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.559

 If there are any parts, we will review them. 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:41.309
 Galaxy s6 's house plus first 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:47.280
 What eopneyo special exterior box is big thing on the surface, then, now that the color 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:51.210
 It is a black sapphire version of a box, 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:56.489
 I feel a little different than what I followed. 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:01.769
 This is what I'm talking about. 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.800
 Now that you've used 4 gig rams And now you have a high speed wireless charging 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:11.070
 Now that you are 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:13.229
 Another thing that you ahtta lt bands have sex in earned five caps 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.490
 In this way, 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:22.530
 I will give you 10 support. 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:26.909
 From 4g lte we can now continue to 5g 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:32.940
 I will see you. 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:36.960
 Now I want to compare two Galaxy s6 hatches and h + 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:41.729
 We are in a state where no s6 minutes are written. 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.470
 So, first of all, let's open the example first. 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.110
 A superhero 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.140
 Let's open it up. 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.140
 Ah 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:57.579
 Oh, pull-party maid 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.579
 Galaxy s6 layout plus 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.100
 Before that, now 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:09.640
 Compared to the protective film on the top 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:13.319
 I guess that's why it's been turned on by more publicity turns. 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:19.049
 Well, if it's like this now , 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:22.139
 I feel quite different from the Galaxy s6 Edge 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:25.459
 So I 've done a comparison in the store now . 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.459
 h part always 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:38.520
 I 've been telling you that the jaws are always a bit sharp now. 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:40.440
 Now, the case s 6h plus naejil the diamond light to Yogyakarta 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.930
 It was 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.550
 So it's much more so because it's so much more grabbing 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.040
 When I heard 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:57.000
 It feels so much less so that pressure is put on it . 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.790
 In the case of s6 edge, it's better than this. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.070
 Is that so? 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:11.170
 To hold only the part of the perfusion 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:15.280
 I feel like she's much more comfortable. 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:19.420
 In terms of specs, it's almost identical to Note Five. 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.730
 Now what'll tendeyo one another that there is no difference that the fans 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:27.010
 It's like this. 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:30.040
 First, let's briefly nadugo kid is next to a wooden box box 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.819
 The manual contains a simple manual. 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.030
 And so much attached card with tree 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:43.870
 And if you look inside, 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:47.519
 If you look at the earphone and usb butt 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.519
 This charger comes in. 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:57.730
 Earphone 2 s Note that the earphone in the note looks like the same ear 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.670
 We will try to test the performance once. 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:05.560
 I will put the opening machine here. 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:10.689
 Now that we have much practical examples and especially with homemade 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:13.359
 We will now upload it to Samsung Fay. 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:18.430
 I thank you guys for drinking so far. 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:21.940
 Wait till you raise me because I'm young in the next building. 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:27.580
 From now on, we're going to be doing some activity. 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:34.979
