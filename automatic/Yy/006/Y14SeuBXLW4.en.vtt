00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.829
 wall with games brand rights 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.629
 the terminator of his characters then altogether 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.559
 belonged to the warner film company 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.660
 brothers 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.930
 the project was developed for several 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.410
 platforms namely on pc and playstation 3 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.070
 and xbox 360 on ios and even on mobile 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.409
 phones 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.840
 version support is limited so far 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.360
 only one windows operating system 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.960
 The basis of the game lay diesel engine 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.390
 The game was announced on November 15 , 2007 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.220
 years when the company for halcon company 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.680
 announced help in games 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.780
 affiliated video development studio and you 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.330
 the game was in development for 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.340
 several months by green companies and 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.770
 halcon games long before the shoot 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.840
 movie of the same name CEO 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.909
 peter levin said halcon decided 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.130
 develop the game yourself they 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.170
 acquire another studio to create 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.210
 games originally multiplayer 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.250
 the regime was planned not to develop 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.850
 to release the game according to 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.579
 by schedule 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.659
 however, he soon appeared as actors 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.229
 voice acting became gideon emery moon bloodgood 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:54.659
 Rose McGowan Kamon Shawn Measles Cooper Nolan 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.090
 North unfortunately the game failed 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.149
 about the reasons for the failure we will talk a 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.340
 for now let's get to the game itself 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.200
 terminator became out first 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.360
 single player project he will be the most 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.700
 interesting to both fans of the terminator and 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.310
 lovers of good singleplayer games 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.560
 step a couple of words about the plot of the game after 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.810
 the next combat mission john conor 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.060
 receives a signal asking for help from 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.780
 groups of resistance fighters stuck in 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.730
 sky thread 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.040
 Conor so that is not going to 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.040
 get to your passing fighting with 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.110
 hordes of terminators finding survivors and 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.630
 driving at high speeds by car 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.459
 tracks and subway lines and play us 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.450
 to be behind the appointed leader 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.209
 resistance 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.340
 john connor personally i think that the hulk 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.140
 managed to tell the players excellent 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.360
 a story that once again 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.890
 shows us that Conor's heroism 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.370
 comes to recklessness 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.829
 absurd and total madness however he 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.900
 inspires his actions around 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.730
 its people so that they are ready 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.810
 stand up to the last for faith in the best 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.030
 future 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.459
 of course you have to come to terms with 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.739
 wood animations are a bit soapy 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.410
 textures but the game can be forgiven 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.660
 due to its release six years earlier in 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.060
 the game is just amazing atmosphere 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.190
 we are shown excellent conditions in which 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.769
 survivors have to 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.350
 exist in structure project 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.920
 made in the style of the movie joke problem and 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.829
 kintso 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.730
 cut scene harmoniously replaced by gameplay 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.579
 and vice versa 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.889
 the game came out dynamic at first before 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.590
 you boring monotonous thriller from 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:31.200
 third person but gradually he is gaining 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.180
 revs small narrow space 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.760
 full of different loopholes for tactical 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.010
 maneuvers are replaced by crazy races 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.959
 over destroyed los angeles and hot 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.540
 shooting in small spaces 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.790
 cards are designed in such a way that 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.250
 we have a lot of room to maneuver 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.670
 and choosing your own unique playing style and 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.079
 it all happens with great music 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.030
 emphasizing the dynamics of action in the game 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.970
 we will hear both recycled 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.889
 classic and brand new 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.109
 soundtracks for war with skyneta machines 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.660
 we will go with good weapons 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.650
 at our disposal will be machines 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.530
 shotguns 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.780
 grenades immortal lpg and other weapons 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.419
 we even have to manage the turret 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.930
 skynet tank in the game several types 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.060
 of enemies 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.290
 starting with what we saw in the movie and 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.210
 ending but 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.510
 both specially created for the game 

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.320
 terminators against us will fight 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.380
 t600 wasps 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.260
 moto terminators spiders and even hunters 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.730
 skyneta as for partners then in 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.710
 this game they are really something 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.170
 does they shoot at emptiness and 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.840
 do unknown things than leave the whole 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.330
 the player's job caused the game to fail as 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.790
 for me pretty ridiculous critics 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.980
 put the game low ratings referring to 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.080
 mediocre visuals and 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.270
 christian bale's lack of voice 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.730
 John Connor's voice acting instead 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.610
 Conor became Gideon Emery 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.830
 yes yes this is the same gi of call of 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.270
 duty advanced warfare nonetheless 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.400
 slasher terminator 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.560
 great action movie that will help you 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.750
 pass a few hours fascinating 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.590
 single player there are good 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.940
 characters and interesting developments 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.350
 fascinating but true in some places 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.960
 monotonous gameplay 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.500
 My personal score of the game is 8 points from 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.040
 ten 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.770
 like terminator fans 10 points out of 10 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.270
 Thank you all for your attention in touch with you 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:27.500
 was alcatraz prison 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.500
 good luck for i.e.
