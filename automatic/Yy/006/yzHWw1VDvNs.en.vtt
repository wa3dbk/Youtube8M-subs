 a new product that has just 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.090
 to get motorola droid 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.839
 reason that it's a phone with a 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.700
 4.3 inch screen to give 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.820
 an idea we are putting there aside 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:24.060
 the iphone 4s to see the difference 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.500
 in terms of screen size much more 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.360
 slim also that the iphone phone 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.400
 4s as you can see the control of 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.700
 turned on volume controls 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.060
 as for the back as well as 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.300
 the iphone has the battery already inserted 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.210

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.510
 we have a hd video recording like 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:55.410
 can see a rear camera of 8 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:01:00.170
 megapixels with a flash l 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.640
 that phone has 4g technology 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.330
 lte 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.370
 and it will also logically work with 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.060
 3g and 2g technology 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.590

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.830
 when we ran the application was 10 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.830
