00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
think they look better plus I think the

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:08.840 
think they look better plus I think the
pants<00:04:53.480> is<00:04:53.600> actually<00:04:53.900> more<00:04:53.990> comfortable

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.900 

the<00:05:31.830> tires<00:05:32.070> are<00:05:32.280> good<00:05:32.370> to<00:05:32.490> hold<00:05:32.580> there<00:05:32.820> and
