00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.190
 the murderer 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.250
 hi friends retuve chinga darkness 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.790
 I was damn it is youtube x of ha ha 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.920
 LOL 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.980
 good here with the new update of 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.470
 something else the download and good I changed 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.470
 the campaign map and I put the map of 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.470
 pillar of tuna is revision number 5 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.220
 spectacular draws us spectacular 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.220
 spectacular massacre 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.720
 now teach the new campaign we're going 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.720
 to single player and select new game 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.840
 the remains of the ship but we have to 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.400
 get time in case the monitor or his 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.049
 sentinels discovering a way to 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.350
 activate the final weapon leave it without the 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.119
 index the machinery of these guns is 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.310
 a main trigger mechanism of 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.050
 halo are three pulse generators 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.090
 basic also the sign of hernialde 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.270
 denies them and allow you to shoot at 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.580
 deep space energy levels 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.900
 they are huge I can not even calculate 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.300
 the scope of the impulse 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.920
 so if we win or destroy these 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.320
 generators the monitor will have to 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.020
 repair them before you can use halo like this 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.580
 we will have a little more time I am 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.260
 marking as navigation point the 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.490
 generator location is even more 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.780
 close we have to move forward and 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.780
 neutralize the device 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.950
 now this campaign is more difficult and 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.619
 because I like it more I've put 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.550
 three maps of the water effects of 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.379
 game 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.900
 will be more more and if we play with the 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.569
 skates so I recommend a remote to 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.519
 the most comfortable to play all do 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.780
 and I forgot I corrected some 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.780
 mistakes that the game had 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.170
 the spectacular massacre shits that they 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.170
 said 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.960
 the remains of the ship but we have to 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.550
 get it in case the monitor or if 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.200
 they write them they write a way to 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.450
 activate the final weapon left without the 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.610
 index 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.260
 the machinery of these guns is a 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.260
 main firing mechanism 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.470
 and not like shooting deep space 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.280
 the energy levels are internal neither 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.280
 I can even calculate 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.190
 let's finally get time 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.190
 monitors 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.420
 we get a spectacular 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.240
 it is always generating 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.900
 as to give deep space 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.020
 if I can calculate the range of 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.360
 cleaning 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.980
 so if damaged or we describe these 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.000
 generators the monitor will have to 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.590
 repair them before you can use the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.600
 remains of the ship but we have to 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.670
 to get it 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.600
 in they discover a way to activate the 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:03.290
 weapon 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:05.210
 it's much more sacred and xp shooting in that 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.680
 map is the winder yes there they 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.200
 I will show the weapons that I have added 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.790
 some already teach them but as two 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:20.789
 weapons are not taught by killers 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:20.789
 a killer killer 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.479
 well we have this weapon that is the 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.180
 every vine or something like that are also all 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.550
 those of alocÃ©n good almost all are the 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.279
 sniper the crystals the rifle 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.379
 assault the magnum the rocket the second 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:03.930
 put the energetic swords of halo 4 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.930
 I also put the halo smg 2 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.670
 there is also I put the plasma weapon that 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.670
 it was very good 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.290
 yes 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.940
 and 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.190
 Now you can mount the host and also 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.020
 the tank but be very careful with the 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.330
 tank now to be able to ride the 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.280
 tank they need to have two weapons because 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.650
 if you mount with a weapon you will get a 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.360
 error and something very important is to try 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.100
 that they do not kill you when you are with the 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.260
 tank because when you relive it no longer 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.120
 you can move sideways and to 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.310
 prevent it you must press the touch 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.260
 to give a blow and if in case already 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.600
 you went up if they killed you and you can not 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.520
 move sideways so you need 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.410
 get on again and being up 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.460
 you crush the touch of hitting and you 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.460
 solve heriste 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.550
 if they did not understand me by the sound of 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.470
 game then ya no way x now 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.650
 I will show some maps that have this 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.650
 game 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.730
 now 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.630
 do not 

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.220
 and there are still many more maps by 

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:48.039
 example of winder danger cannon 

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.810
 timberland dead island coagulation 

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:53.080
 map guardians of the new online 

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:55.810
 pull of l 34 prisioner of the lic 

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:58.569
 infiniti I piro povia chill out and my 

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:01.270
 own and others that I do not know apart from 

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:03.879
 of the video remember the link will be 

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.860
 mega do not forget to give little hand up and 

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:08.560
 subscribe to be attentive to each 

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.030
 update there I think the link what 

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:14.819
