so<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.360> was<00:00:12.540> still<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> good<00:00:12.840> wicket<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.380> was<00:00:13.500> a

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
so it was still a good wicket it was a

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.530 
so it was still a good wicket it was a
good<00:00:14.099> betting<00:00:14.370> we<00:00:14.460> hit<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.670> probably<00:00:15.360> what

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
good betting we hit that probably what

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.359 
good betting we hit that probably what
it<00:00:15.570> did<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> other<00:00:16.529> week<00:00:16.830> at<00:00:16.949> seven<00:00:17.250> done

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
it did that the other week at seven done

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.880 
it did that the other week at seven done
was<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:17.820> swung<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.300> seemed<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.859> spent<00:00:19.859> a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
was it just swung and seemed and spent a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.109 
was it just swung and seemed and spent a
little<00:00:20.010> bit<00:00:20.130> particular<00:00:20.609> at<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.699> start<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
little bit particular at the start and

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.019 
little bit particular at the start and
stole<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.539> cme<00:00:22.020> ball<00:00:22.320> very<00:00:22.529> well<00:00:22.910> someone<00:00:23.910> we

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
stole the cme ball very well someone we

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.519 
stole the cme ball very well someone we
hadn't<00:00:24.300> seen<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.720> series<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.320> little

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
hadn't seen in the series is a little

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.380 
hadn't seen in the series is a little
bit<00:00:25.650> quicker<00:00:25.830> than<00:00:26.039> what<00:00:26.189> we<00:00:26.279> expected<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.269> he

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
bit quicker than what we expected and he

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.519 
bit quicker than what we expected and he
certainly<00:00:27.570> got<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.869> bit<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.109> movement<00:00:28.260> off<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
certainly got a bit of movement off the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.950 
certainly got a bit of movement off the
same<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.189> that's<00:00:30.029> something<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.359> be<00:00:30.539> pretty

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
same so that's something to be pretty

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.690 
same so that's something to be pretty
well<00:00:31.260> for<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> rest<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> series<00:00:32.070> that

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
well for the rest of the series that

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.700 
well for the rest of the series that
that's<00:00:33.300> that's<00:00:33.780> obviously<00:00:34.320> what's<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.649> to

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that's that's obviously what's going to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.560 
that's that's obviously what's going to
be<00:00:34.800> coming<00:00:34.950> at<00:00:35.160> us<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:36.149> having<00:00:36.360> said<00:00:36.510> that

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
be coming at us but having said that

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.569 
be coming at us but having said that
yeah<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:36.960> think<00:00:37.350> from<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.070> moment<00:00:38.460> Glenn

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
yeah I think from the moment Glenn

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.369 
yeah I think from the moment Glenn
Maxwell<00:00:38.790> stride<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> crease<00:00:39.870> he<00:00:40.110> made<00:00:40.260> it

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
Maxwell stride to the crease he made it

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:50.209 
Maxwell stride to the crease he made it
look<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.680> different<00:00:40.890> wicket<00:00:48.829> 295<00:00:49.829> was<00:00:50.100> not

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
look like a different wicket 295 was not

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.029 
look like a different wicket 295 was not
296<00:00:50.730> something<00:00:51.059> important<00:00:51.629> those<00:00:51.750> runs<00:00:52.039> yeah

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
296 something important those runs yeah

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.619 
296 something important those runs yeah
we<00:00:53.190> were<00:00:53.340> confident<00:00:53.760> but<00:00:53.910> I'm<00:00:54.000> sure<00:00:54.210> India

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
we were confident but I'm sure India

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.090 
we were confident but I'm sure India
probably<00:00:54.960> were<00:00:55.020> as<00:00:55.140> well<00:00:55.320> given<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.980> way

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
probably were as well given the the way

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.279 
probably were as well given the the way
the<00:00:56.280> series<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.760> gone<00:00:56.969> strong<00:00:57.960> batting

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the series is gone strong batting

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.479 
the series is gone strong batting
line-ups<00:00:58.620> I'm<00:00:58.770> sure<00:00:58.949> they<00:00:59.100> would<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.280> been

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
line-ups I'm sure they would have been

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.569 
line-ups I'm sure they would have been
but<00:00:59.670> we<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:00.329> felt<00:01:00.570> there<00:01:00.690> was<00:01:00.809> enough<00:01:01.579> enough

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
but we just felt there was enough enough

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.160 
but we just felt there was enough enough
movement<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.300> wicket<00:01:03.629> particularly

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
movement in the wicket particularly

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.800 
movement in the wicket particularly
early<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.430> looking<00:01:05.430> at<00:01:05.519> our<00:01:05.610> scorecard<00:01:05.909> it

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
early on looking at our scorecard it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.050 
early on looking at our scorecard it
would<00:01:06.960> suggest<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.650> new<00:01:08.250> batters<00:01:08.670> found<00:01:08.909> it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
would suggest that new batters found it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.550 
would suggest that new batters found it
difficult<00:01:09.180> at<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> wicket<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.140> was<00:01:10.290> hard<00:01:10.470> to

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
difficult at the wicket it was hard to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.890 
difficult at the wicket it was hard to
get<00:01:10.710> started<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.330> were<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.750> know<00:01:12.780> we're

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
get started so we were you know we're

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.120 
get started so we were you know we're
hoping<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.530> could<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.830> couple<00:01:13.979> of

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
hoping if we could get a couple of

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.440 
hoping if we could get a couple of
wickets<00:01:14.280> c-could<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.909> could<00:01:15.119> make<00:01:15.299> that

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
wickets c-could you could make that

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.990 
wickets c-could you could make that
quite<00:01:15.630> challenging<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.920> certainly<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
quite challenging and certainly the the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.249 
quite challenging and certainly the the
pace<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.479> Mitch<00:01:18.689> was<00:01:18.900> getting<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.229> through

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
pace that Mitch was getting it through

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.960 
pace that Mitch was getting it through
early<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.159> looked<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.700> was<00:01:20.820> going

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
early on it looked like that was going

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.880 
early on it looked like that was going
to<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.229> quite<00:01:22.229> difficult<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.650> play<00:01:22.830> at

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
to be quite difficult to play at

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.080 
to be quite difficult to play at
different<00:01:23.250> stages<00:01:23.400> through<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> game<00:01:23.970> as

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
different stages through the game as

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.810 
different stages through the game as
well

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.850 

yeah<00:01:30.820> I<00:01:31.330> don't<00:01:32.050> think<00:01:32.380> anyone's<00:01:32.740> thinking

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
yeah I don't think anyone's thinking

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.310 
yeah I don't think anyone's thinking
about<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.550> number<00:01:33.790> one<00:01:33.910> ranking<00:01:34.270> it's<00:01:34.450> as<00:01:34.750> has

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
about the number one ranking it's as has

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.470 
about the number one ranking it's as has
been<00:01:35.530> said<00:01:35.710> all<00:01:35.860> along<00:01:35.980> it's<00:01:36.340> it's<00:01:36.760> an<00:01:36.940> end<00:01:37.090> in

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
been said all along it's it's an end in

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.800 
been said all along it's it's an end in
product<00:01:37.930> end<00:01:38.140> result<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.970> more<00:01:40.180> about<00:01:40.330> just

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
product end result it's more about just

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.560 
product end result it's more about just
each<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:41.800> every<00:01:41.980> game<00:01:42.190> certainly<00:01:42.850> 50<00:01:43.270> overs

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
each and every game certainly 50 overs

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.080 
each and every game certainly 50 overs
we<00:01:43.690> were<00:01:43.870> confident<00:01:44.410> and<00:01:44.620> happy<00:01:45.550> to<00:01:45.760> back<00:01:45.940> I

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
we were confident and happy to back I

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.540 
we were confident and happy to back I
think<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.330> way<00:01:46.950> duckworth-lewis<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.340> with

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
think the way duckworth-lewis and with

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.190 
think the way duckworth-lewis and with
fallout<00:01:48.790> is<00:01:49.060> set<00:01:49.270> up<00:01:49.390> i<00:01:49.570> think<00:01:49.600> if<00:01:49.930> it<00:01:50.080> had

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
fallout is set up i think if it had

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.870 
fallout is set up i think if it had
become<00:01:50.350> a<00:01:50.530> 20-over<00:01:51.010> game<00:01:51.250> but<00:01:51.460> probably<00:01:51.729> would

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
become a 20-over game but probably would

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.370 
become a 20-over game but probably would
have<00:01:51.940> suited<00:01:52.390> india<00:01:52.780> quite<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:52.990> bit<00:01:58.290> found<00:01:59.290> it

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
have suited india quite a bit found it
