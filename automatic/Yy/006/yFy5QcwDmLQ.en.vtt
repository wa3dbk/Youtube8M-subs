00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
dollars an issue although I believe the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.599

can subscribe to both I think for a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.440 
can subscribe to both I think for a
yearly<00:00:32.099> subscription<00:00:32.730> for<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.000> six<00:00:33.180> issues
