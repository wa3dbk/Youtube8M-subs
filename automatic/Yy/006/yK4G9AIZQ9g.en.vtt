00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
hey to just when it's a come real quick

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.360 
hey to just when it's a come real quick
and<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.540> just<00:00:06.660> watched<00:00:07.170> mahogany<00:00:07.740> curls<00:00:08.069> video

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
and I just watched mahogany curls video

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.580 
and I just watched mahogany curls video
and<00:00:08.639> she<00:00:08.850> did<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.270> roller<00:00:09.540> set<00:00:09.870> with<00:00:10.049> perm<00:00:10.290> rods

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
and she did a roller set with perm rods

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.029 
and she did a roller set with perm rods
so<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.549> was<00:00:12.539> inspired<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.199> do<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.529> same<00:00:13.740> thing

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:14.039 
so I was inspired to do the same thing

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.820 
so I was inspired to do the same thing
since<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.549> wanted<00:00:14.850> to<00:00:14.940> show<00:00:15.289> what<00:00:16.289> my<00:00:16.500> hair

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
since I wanted to show what my hair

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.980 
since I wanted to show what my hair
would<00:00:16.980> actually<00:00:17.400> do<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:17.850> same<00:00:18.270> style<00:00:18.600> so

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
would actually do in that same style so

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.470 
would actually do in that same style so
my<00:00:19.710> hair<00:00:19.919> is<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.070> little<00:00:20.189> bit<00:00:20.369> thinner<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.240> hers

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
my hair is a little bit thinner in hers

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.810 
my hair is a little bit thinner in hers
and<00:00:21.509> it<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.169> different<00:00:22.710> texture<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.279> it's

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
and it is a different texture so it's

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.819 
and it is a different texture so it's
going<00:00:23.999> to<00:00:24.060> turn<00:00:24.179> out<00:00:24.240> different<00:00:24.839> but<00:00:25.230> pretty

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:25.829 
going to turn out different but pretty

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.710 
going to turn out different but pretty
much<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> same<00:00:26.279> technique<00:00:26.789> she<00:00:27.089> didn't<00:00:27.390> honey

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
much the same technique she didn't honey

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.880 
much the same technique she didn't honey

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.240 

so<00:02:18.140> now<00:02:18.380> I'm<00:02:18.590> just<00:02:18.710> going<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.950> let<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.280> dry<00:02:20.050> and

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
so now I'm just going to let it dry and

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.010 
so now I'm just going to let it dry and
see<00:02:22.250> how<00:02:22.400> long<00:02:22.460> that<00:02:22.640> takes<00:02:23.060> hopefully<00:02:23.750> a

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
see how long that takes hopefully a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.480 
see how long that takes hopefully a
little<00:02:24.380> dry<00:02:24.590> before<00:02:24.740> it's<00:02:25.040> time<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.250> go<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.430> bed

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
little dry before it's time to go to bed

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:36.700
