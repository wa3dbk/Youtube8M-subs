guitarists to get into changing chords

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.310

because they're not going to make so

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.870 
because they're not going to make so
many<00:02:37.410> mistakes<00:02:37.620> because<00:02:38.430> they<00:02:38.520> don't<00:02:38.670> have<00:02:38.790> to

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
many mistakes because they don't have to

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
press the strings down as much which

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.510 
press the strings down as much which
means<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.770> strings<00:02:41.010> aren't<00:02:41.220> going<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.400> get

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
means the strings aren't going to get

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.550 
means the strings aren't going to get

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
to get in between there and change okay

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.340 
to get in between there and change okay
now<00:02:46.980> for<00:02:47.040> sound<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:47.880> has<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:48.600> pretty<00:02:49.080> good

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
now for sound this has a pretty good

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.750 
now for sound this has a pretty good
sound

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.809 

it<00:02:55.239> has<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.420> great<00:02:55.780> volume<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:57.250> has<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.489> little

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
it has a great volume it has a little

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.369 
it has a great volume it has a little
bit<00:02:57.879> more<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.239> high-end<00:02:58.480> than<00:02:58.900> amid<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.290> the

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
bit more of a high-end than amid and the

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.589 
bit more of a high-end than amid and the
low<00:02:59.590> that's<00:03:00.549> just<00:03:00.760> because<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:01.180> laminate

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
low that's just because the laminate

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.710 
low that's just because the laminate
doesn't<00:03:01.930> give<00:03:02.049> it<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.230> nice<00:03:02.530> warm<00:03:03.220> feeling<00:03:03.720> like

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
doesn't give it a nice warm feeling like
