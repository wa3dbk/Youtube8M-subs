00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
Sarah Shepherds plots are hard not to

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.559 
Sarah Shepherds plots are hard not to
get<00:02:25.099> five<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.459> five<00:02:25.610> -<00:02:25.819> they're<00:02:26.239> really<00:02:26.390> well

no<00:02:31.340> saw<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.209> it's<00:02:32.810> in<00:02:32.930> all<00:02:33.109> four<00:02:33.439> stories<00:02:34.250> and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
no saw and it's in all four stories and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.920 
no saw and it's in all four stories and
pretty<00:02:34.549> sure<00:02:34.670> all<00:02:34.819> or<00:02:35.359> three<00:02:35.659> of<00:02:35.780> them<00:02:35.900> and

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
pretty sure all or three of them and

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.690 
pretty sure all or three of them and
it's<00:02:36.260> really<00:02:36.439> funny<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.829> see<00:02:37.129> how<00:02:37.640> she

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
it's really funny to see how she

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.970 
it's really funny to see how she
connects<00:02:38.269> certain<00:02:38.540> elements<00:02:39.230> within<00:02:39.680> all

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
connects certain elements within all

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.679 
connects certain elements within all
four<00:02:40.280> stories<00:02:40.730> they're<00:02:41.060> kind<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.269> connected

four stories they're kind of connected

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.479

stories were good they made sense they

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.509 
stories were good they made sense they
were<00:02:45.079> logistical<00:02:45.680> for<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:45.889> character<00:02:46.340> they

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
were logistical for the character they

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.199 
were logistical for the character they
weren't<00:02:46.730> out<00:02:46.849> of<00:02:46.970> character<00:02:47.329> stories<00:02:47.959> so<00:02:48.950> yeah

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
fancy clothes and they're all together

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.659 
fancy clothes and they're all together
and<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:30.530> says<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:30.889> is<00:03:30.949> making<00:03:31.159> a<00:03:31.340> list<00:03:31.489> and

and it says a is making a list and
checking<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:32.120> twice<00:03:32.449> and<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.299> didn't<00:03:35.480> take

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
this to school so that's why it took me

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.319

a little longer exists like pitch white
and<00:03:38.480> I<00:03:38.510> didn't<00:03:38.720> want<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:38.930> like<00:03:39.019> get<00:03:39.739> a<00:03:39.799> gross

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
is I'm not sure about anywhere else

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.530 
is I'm not sure about anywhere else
um<00:03:53.449> suspense<00:03:54.199> I<00:03:54.379> give<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:54.829> 4<00:03:55.159> out<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.340> 5<00:03:55.540> these

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
um suspense I give it a 4 out of 5 these

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.140 
um suspense I give it a 4 out of 5 these
books<00:03:56.840> this<00:03:57.260> one<00:03:57.560> was<00:03:57.709> a<00:03:57.760> suspenseful<00:03:58.760> because

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
books this one was a suspenseful because

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.719 
books this one was a suspenseful because
I<00:03:59.180> think<00:03:59.569> reading<00:04:00.139> it<00:04:00.379> over<00:04:00.889> and<00:04:01.310> even<00:04:01.549> really

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:01.729 
I think reading it over and even really

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:02.979 
I think reading it over and even really
the<00:04:01.849> first<00:04:02.000> time<00:04:02.239> I'd<00:04:02.419> already<00:04:02.569> know<00:04:02.690> what

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
the first time I'd already know what

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.990 
the first time I'd already know what
happened<00:04:03.470> after<00:04:03.620> this<00:04:03.919> and<00:04:04.340> before<00:04:04.849> this

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
happened after this and before this

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.339 
happened after this and before this
because<00:04:05.389> I<00:04:05.419> was<00:04:05.599> already<00:04:05.750> onto<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.109> tenth

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
because I was already onto the tenth

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:07.930 
because I was already onto the tenth
book<00:04:06.530> by<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.799> time<00:04:07.010> this<00:04:07.129> came<00:04:07.340> out<00:04:07.519> so<00:04:07.790> yeah

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
book by the time this came out so yeah

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.960 
book by the time this came out so yeah
and<00:04:08.269> also<00:04:08.979> their<00:04:09.979> short<00:04:10.250> stories<00:04:10.669> so<00:04:10.879> they

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
and also their short stories so they

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.059 
and also their short stories so they
can't<00:04:11.150> be<00:04:11.269> too<00:04:11.479> suspense<00:04:11.959> driven<00:04:12.440> as<00:04:12.620> much<00:04:12.919> as

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
can't be too suspense driven as much as

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.759 
can't be too suspense driven as much as
a<00:04:13.099> book<00:04:13.370> could<00:04:13.609> be<00:04:13.729> I<00:04:14.229> find<00:04:15.229> because<00:04:15.590> the

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
a book could be I find because the

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:16.990 
a book could be I find because the
stories<00:04:16.039> are<00:04:16.130> shorter<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.639> book<00:04:16.789> just

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
stories are shorter and the book just

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.259 
stories are shorter and the book just
goes<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.239> little<00:04:17.720> bit<00:04:17.870> longer<00:04:18.139> so<00:04:18.349> yeah<00:04:19.269> overall

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
goes a little bit longer so yeah overall

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.670 
goes a little bit longer so yeah overall
I<00:04:20.599> get<00:04:20.750> this<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:20.900> 4<00:04:21.229> out<00:04:21.260> of<00:04:21.409> 5

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
I get this a 4 out of 5

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.730 
I get this a 4 out of 5
I<00:04:21.919> would<00:04:22.070> absolutely
