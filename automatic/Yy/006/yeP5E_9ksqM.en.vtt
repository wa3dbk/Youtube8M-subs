00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 or the youtube peÃ±a here manuel bad in 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.049
 plants against zombies today I'm going to 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.460
 talk about all the new skills 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:15.000
 of the cactus we first started with the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.320
 potato nuggets that are the sisters 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.390
 Little chiquititas of potatoes for taboo if 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.699
 we can deploy more 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.720
 They are very funny because they are very 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:33.970
 little ones but what is the bad thing they do 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:39.090
 half damage if they do half damage 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.090
 that's how bad these nuggets are 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.680
 the good clear the other of the great 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.310
 we can deploy three of this we can 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.430
 unfold up to five is worth up to five 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.460
 with what we will do if we are a good 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.720
 cactus and we use the head well we can 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.790
 cover more ground the truth is that to me 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.809
 I like a little more the normals 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.960
 for the multiplayer modes mode but 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.770
 for example here in the horde mode the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.690
 zombies have literally almost to 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.530
 eat them 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.840
 so nothing said is half of 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.180
 powerful that his little sisters the big 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.680
 but you can put more with which 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.530
 they cover more land and 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.870
 because that's the advantage that it that 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.210
 we can put more although they are less 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.240
 powerful so there you have to use the 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.420
 head is already depending on you as 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.670
 play more with the cactus or less how 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.380
 can take advantage of these skills but 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.270
 there is at least this one that 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.940
 take advantage of it well well well since the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.369
 cactus there is no cactus that can 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.490
 play more to russo to a style more than 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.490
 risky or nothing the cactus is defense 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.009
 Protection perimeter protection and 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.680
 long distance shooting is not not 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.659
 for nothing else it is better otherwise 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.060
 we want to kill an enemy 100% way 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.910
 sure we put two potatoes of these very 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.640
 followed and until now I am going to talk to you 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.900
 of the in new kind of nut there is 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.440
 the iron maiden the maid of 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.350
 iron 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.380
 what is your quality the maid of 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.380
 iron 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:32.130
 has three times as much resistance as 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.130
 cantankerous nuts with which they are very 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.510
 very good to defend or protect 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.319
 behind them if they resist what they are 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.170
 listening to the triple is triple what 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.170
 which in a shooting that suddenly come 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.510
 we do not realize and we are submerged 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.410
 in an incredible shooting comes perfect 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.620
 it is a perfect coverage that is the bad thing 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.590
 of the iron maiden the bad thing is that 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.110
 shares the same recharge time as 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.100
 if they were grumpy nuts 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.730
 normal 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.910
 the bad thing is that it covers a lot 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.400
 less than if it were a barrier of nuts 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.640
 cantankerous but otherwise it is 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.680
 great vale 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.720
 the truth to me I like stability 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.640
 It depends on the game mode and depends 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.280
 also from the map if the maps are very 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.920
 narrow vouchers we put the maid 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.020
 of iron we are behind it and what 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.500
 safer is that the shovels almost that neither 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.470
 affect us are worth however in gardens 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.690
 and cemeteries almost not because there are 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.989
 a lot of place where people can help us 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.209
 surprise more the truth is that not me 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.880
 almost I do not prefer it but how come 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.730
 saying is according to the style of play 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.310
 nothing more said what if you are a zombie and 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.980
 we want to tear this this nut 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.250
 armored we're going to have to give him the 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.920
 triple the desire that if they were nuts 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.490
 cantankerous and now let's talk about 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:14.500
 the new Tripoli again the new type 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:17.410
 of drone the drone artichoke in what 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.700
 difference to work the artichoke drone 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.880
 it's shots worth shots ago less 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.880
 hurt 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.460
 but what is your advantage the drone 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:34.630
 artichoke has more health has 20 the 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.820
 dron garlic has 5 the artichoke drone has 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.190
 the advantage that launches the missiles or 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.700
 Missile attacks regenerates much more 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.830
 fast but it 's a drawback too 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.800
 in this attack is that he only throws a 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.440
 missile that is not the same as the garlic dron 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.660
 so do not think that because this is 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.420
 more modern will get us out of trouble 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.450
 no no no no no no 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.940
 no no no no no like in all modes a 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.800
 the time to both launch the work as 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.500
 the drone artichoke we are going to have to 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.730
 be covered by an area where there is 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.260
 there is danger or is an area already there 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:14.200
 where are the enemies attacking because 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.630
 is that if it does not matter how well 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.320
 let's handle the weapon in question because we 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.600
 they will end up fishing by catching brown 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.200
 using it and they will kill us but for sure 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.470
 sure let's do it right say if points 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.800
 flown so nothing is worth what 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.830
 I recommend I recommend it in gardens 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.040
 and cemeteries in other ways like duel 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.050
 by teams or in horde mode almost 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.870
 not in the horde mode it can happen a bit 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.210
 but in team duel not because the 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.990
 very changing responses and maybe 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.210
 the enemies are a few seconds ahead 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.150
 yours and then they can be on the side 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.640
 or just behind so nothing 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.190
 the truth is that I do not like it either 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.530
 very much if I had to keep some 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.900
 of the three skills of the blissful 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.660
 cactus the truth is that it is not either 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.210
 I do not like it any excess 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.240
 I do not like any in excess so 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.130
 least for my game style good nothing 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.860
 as I always say thank you for having me 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:21.960
 seen and a hug everyone remember here 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.960
 they have my playlists
