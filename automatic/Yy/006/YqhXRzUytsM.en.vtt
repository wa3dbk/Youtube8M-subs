00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.650
 Hey, youtube group. 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.119
 Today I'm going to show a different video to 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.699
 to mess 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.480
 No one is in a video that will 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.640
 showing a new program knows that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.269
 what is a test but actually there is 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.160
 a new program is one with a range where 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.450
 friends of mine this government was made 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.329
 for breeders to test on new things 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:45.680
 he is very crazy he looks only 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:50.190
 The way it 's good to have it, it's good, it's 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.789
 well up in the eternal year this I do not 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.370
 I understood nothing but had the color and put 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:02.219
 another can not get back 30 so far 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:06.000
 try not work, then you do not have 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.670
 30 other things I wanted to say 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.909
 there are enough islands hidden in the woods 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:18.740
 I at least the two that did not pull it out 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:21.560
 do not hide from the samba is get out of here 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.560
 she is more or less round 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.330
 it looks like a country the act has a bridge 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.330
 destroyed I think someone lived here 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.470
 which has a good mountain of rocks 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.040
 first stage of your life 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.930
 first thing I found out was 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.350
 like this 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.660
 It's kind of a sand thing I just do not know. 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.100
 explain right 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.910
 I think I do not even know 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.910
 it's the color of the earth 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:02.150
 half crazy and if you have the squares well 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.500
 square heritage very large 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.660
 has another good there is that here it is not 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.600
 away from a police officer it's just you 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.140
 arrives on the initial map and I came back 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.140
 initial 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:23.450
 O 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:27.590
 there she looks like a face two eyes 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.720
 nose and mouth on the head 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.150
 she is weak yellow and red 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.890
 I think it's a good thing I could not see 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.080
 no color 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.910
 now I do not know how to release there are people who 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:50.080
 was released by the market but never 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:53.330
 I tested and did not win and soon that's it 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.170
 I wanted to ask you to write 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.500
 but my channel there that I did not even vote for the video 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.190
 and a favorite sound and medium do not know if 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.459
 Like this on the channel, it's also worth it. 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.570
 will have more videos about new kuga by taking 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.570
 Such things were good
