00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:04.899 
hey goalkeepers today we're gonna be

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:06.450 
hey goalkeepers today we're gonna be
looking<00:00:05.170> at<00:00:05.229> the<00:00:05.350> techniques<00:00:05.859> on<00:00:06.069> how<00:00:06.430> to

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:06.460 
looking at the techniques on how to

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.759 
looking at the techniques on how to
forward<00:00:06.939> dive<00:00:07.330> the<00:00:07.960> forward<00:00:08.290> divers<00:00:08.650> are

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:08.769 
forward dive the forward divers are

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.320 
forward dive the forward divers are
catching<00:00:09.130> technique<00:00:09.309> which<00:00:09.730> goalkeepers

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
catching technique which goalkeepers

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.990 
catching technique which goalkeepers
used<00:00:10.630> to<00:00:10.810> stop<00:00:11.140> and<00:00:11.380> protect<00:00:11.980> shots<00:00:12.280> which<00:00:12.820> are

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
used to stop and protect shots which are

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.509 
used to stop and protect shots which are
fired<00:00:13.269> at<00:00:13.450> you<00:00:13.660> below<00:00:14.140> waist<00:00:14.440> high<00:00:14.769> there<00:00:15.430> are

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 
fired at you below waist high there are

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.220 
fired at you below waist high there are
different<00:00:15.820> four<00:00:16.059> dive<00:00:16.299> techniques<00:00:16.779> out<00:00:16.990> there

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
different four dive techniques out there

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.359 
different four dive techniques out there
I'm<00:00:17.439> going<00:00:17.679> to<00:00:17.769> be<00:00:17.830> showing<00:00:18.130> you<00:00:18.279> the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
I'm going to be showing you the

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.670 
I'm going to be showing you the
techniques<00:00:18.789> that<00:00:19.060> I<00:00:19.180> find<00:00:19.630> the<00:00:19.869> most<00:00:20.110> easiest

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
techniques that I find the most easiest

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.250 
techniques that I find the most easiest
and<00:00:20.920> safest<00:00:21.250> to<00:00:21.640> use<00:00:21.850> so<00:00:22.570> first<00:00:22.810> let's<00:00:22.990> look<00:00:23.140> at

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
and safest to use so first let's look at

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.859 
and safest to use so first let's look at
the<00:00:23.350> body<00:00:23.529> position<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:25.210> need<00:00:25.330> to<00:00:25.480> have<00:00:25.630> one

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
the body position you need to have one

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.750 
the body position you need to have one
leg<00:00:26.080> bent<00:00:26.289> on<00:00:26.529> the<00:00:26.680> floor<00:00:26.949> and<00:00:27.190> the<00:00:27.369> other<00:00:27.550> leg

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
leg bent on the floor and the other leg

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.269 
leg bent on the floor and the other leg
bent<00:00:28.029> at<00:00:28.210> 90<00:00:28.570> degrees<00:00:28.990> pointing<00:00:29.380> to<00:00:29.830> the<00:00:30.039> side

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
bent at 90 degrees pointing to the side

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.279 
bent at 90 degrees pointing to the side
whichever<00:00:31.150> way<00:00:31.390> the<00:00:31.539> shot<00:00:31.779> is<00:00:31.869> coming<00:00:32.199> from

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:32.289 
whichever way the shot is coming from

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:34.290 
whichever way the shot is coming from
will<00:00:32.529> determine<00:00:32.890> where<00:00:33.280> my<00:00:33.519> leg<00:00:33.789> should<00:00:34.059> be

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
will determine where my leg should be

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.290 
will determine where my leg should be
for<00:00:34.989> example<00:00:35.079> if<00:00:35.770> a<00:00:36.160> shot<00:00:36.399> is<00:00:36.579> slightly<00:00:36.880> coming

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
for example if a shot is slightly coming

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.360 
for example if a shot is slightly coming
to<00:00:37.390> my<00:00:37.540> left<00:00:37.780> hand<00:00:38.140> side<00:00:38.500> then<00:00:39.040> it's<00:00:39.220> my

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
to my left hand side then it's my

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.729 
to my left hand side then it's my
opposite<00:00:39.970> leg<00:00:40.149> my<00:00:40.510> right<00:00:40.840> leg<00:00:41.110> that<00:00:41.350> should<00:00:41.620> be

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
opposite leg my right leg that should be

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.310 
opposite leg my right leg that should be
on<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.040> floor<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.600> vice-versa<00:00:43.630> make<00:00:44.110> sure

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
on the floor and vice-versa make sure

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.110 
on the floor and vice-versa make sure
the<00:00:44.469> gap<00:00:44.649> in<00:00:44.860> between<00:00:45.190> your<00:00:45.340> legs<00:00:45.520> is<00:00:45.760> no

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
the gap in between your legs is no

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.690 
the gap in between your legs is no
bigger<00:00:46.420> than<00:00:46.719> two<00:00:47.050> footballs<00:00:47.559> wide<00:00:47.800> your

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
bigger than two footballs wide your

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.760 
bigger than two footballs wide your
chest<00:00:49.000> always<00:00:49.390> needs<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:49.690> be<00:00:49.840> pointing<00:00:50.290> to<00:00:50.559> the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
chest always needs to be pointing to the

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.619 
chest always needs to be pointing to the
floor<00:00:51.040> this<00:00:51.550> will<00:00:51.790> help<00:00:52.000> you<00:00:52.090> hold<00:00:52.329> the<00:00:52.480> ball

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
floor this will help you hold the ball

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.330 
floor this will help you hold the ball
and<00:00:52.960> if<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.200> ball<00:00:53.379> takes<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:53.739> last-second

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
and if the ball takes a last-second

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.459 
and if the ball takes a last-second
bubble<00:00:54.730> it<00:00:55.149> will<00:00:55.300> still<00:00:55.600> bounce<00:00:55.809> into<00:00:56.320> your

bubble it will still bounce into your

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.170 
bubble it will still bounce into your
chest<00:00:56.739> giving<00:00:57.280> you<00:00:57.370> a<00:00:57.399> second<00:00:57.850> chance<00:00:57.879> to

chest giving you a second chance to

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.049 
chest giving you a second chance to
collect<00:00:58.600> it<00:00:58.950> your<00:00:59.950> arms<00:01:00.280> need<00:01:00.399> to<00:01:00.430> be<00:01:00.550> slightly

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
collect it your arms need to be slightly

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.209 
collect it your arms need to be slightly
bent<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:01.510> fill<00:01:01.780> in<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:01.989> gap<00:01:02.260> in<00:01:02.500> between<00:01:02.710> your

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
board pass through your legs all your

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.169 
board pass through your legs all your
arms<00:01:07.749> your<00:01:08.709> hands<00:01:08.950> needs<00:01:09.219> to<00:01:09.279> be<00:01:09.399> cupped<00:01:09.939> so<00:01:10.090> it

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.179 
arms your hands needs to be cupped so it

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:11.879 
arms your hands needs to be cupped so it
acts<00:01:10.420> as<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.630> ramp<00:01:10.929> for<00:01:11.139> the<00:01:11.200> ball<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.529> roll<00:01:11.709> up

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:11.889 
acts as a ramp for the ball to roll up

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:14.010 
acts as a ramp for the ball to roll up
your<00:01:11.920> arms<00:01:12.459> always<00:01:12.909> make<00:01:13.389> sure<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:13.749> get<00:01:13.869> your

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
your arms always make sure you get your

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.039 
your arms always make sure you get your
hands<00:01:14.289> behind<00:01:14.499> the<00:01:14.979> ball<00:01:15.240> 100%<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:16.689> there's<00:01:16.869> no

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
hands behind the ball 100% so there's no

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.559 
hands behind the ball 100% so there's no
chance<00:01:17.319> of<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.619> ball<00:01:17.799> slipping<00:01:18.219> through<00:01:18.569> when

chest before you start to fall forward

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.629 
chest before you start to fall forward
if<00:01:25.719> you<00:01:26.170> try<00:01:26.409> and<00:01:26.469> catch<00:01:26.740> whilst<00:01:27.099> falling

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:27.639 
if you try and catch whilst falling

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:29.550 
if you try and catch whilst falling
forward<00:01:28.060> in<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.209> dive<00:01:28.450> it's<00:01:28.779> gonna<00:01:29.020> make<00:01:29.289> it<00:01:29.469> a

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
forward in the dive it's gonna make it a

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.289 
forward in the dive it's gonna make it a
lot<00:01:29.859> more<00:01:30.069> harder<00:01:30.429> for<00:01:30.549> you<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.759> hold<00:01:30.999> on<00:01:31.149> to

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
lot more harder for you to hold on to

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.349 
lot more harder for you to hold on to
the<00:01:31.450> ball<00:01:32.429> when<00:01:33.429> landed<00:01:33.759> on<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:33.969> floor<00:01:34.209> you

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
the ball when landed on the floor you

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:35.940 
the ball when landed on the floor you
should<00:01:34.539> always<00:01:34.779> be<00:01:35.079> landing<00:01:35.469> on<00:01:35.590> your

should always be landing on your
forearms<00:01:36.459> and<00:01:36.639> never<00:01:37.029> your<00:01:37.299> elbows<00:01:37.779> a<00:01:38.109> few

forearms and never your elbows a few

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.379 
forearms and never your elbows a few
important<00:01:39.069> points<00:01:39.399> when<00:01:39.520> land<00:01:39.789> and<00:01:39.999> is<00:01:40.119> that
