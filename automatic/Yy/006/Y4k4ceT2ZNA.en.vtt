00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
high foom for my server so let's take

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.910 
high foom for my server so let's take
you<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.910> first<00:00:36.149> ability<00:00:36.680> counter<00:00:37.680> attack

your skill is the high o counteract

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.350 
your skill is the high o counteract
chance<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.399> example<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:44.879> I'm<00:00:45.000> fighting

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
chance so for example if I'm fighting

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.560 
chance so for example if I'm fighting
someone<00:00:45.710> my<00:00:46.710> salsa<00:00:46.980> go<00:00:47.219> was<00:00:47.370> quite<00:00:47.520> high<00:00:47.670> what

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
someone my salsa go was quite high what

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.920 
someone my salsa go was quite high what
I<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:49.020> if<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:51.270> guy<00:00:51.420> attacks<00:00:51.719> me

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
I can do if it if this guy attacks me

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.229 
I can do if it if this guy attacks me
for<00:00:52.920> example<00:00:53.219> pretend<00:00:53.489> somebody<00:00:53.789> here<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.180> he

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
for example pretend somebody here and he

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.029 
for example pretend somebody here and he
attacks<00:00:54.449> me<00:00:54.660> there's<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.199> slight<00:00:55.469> chance<00:00:55.739> I'm

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
attacks me there's a slight chance I'm

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.920 
attacks me there's a slight chance I'm
I'm<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.699> reflect<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.210> half<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> damage

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
I'm going to reflect a half the damage

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.950 
I'm going to reflect a half the damage
he<00:00:58.109> does<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.410> me<00:00:58.440> back<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.699> if<00:00:59.969> he<00:01:00.120> hits<00:01:00.329> me<00:01:00.510> with

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
he does to me back so if he hits me with

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.380 
he does to me back so if he hits me with
this<00:01:01.109> sword<00:01:01.350> from<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:01.710> there's<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.699> 50-50

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
this sword from here there's a 50-50

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.840 
this sword from here there's a 50-50
chance<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.409> hit<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.559> back<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:05.339> half<00:01:05.460> damage

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
chance I can hit it back for half damage

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.000 
chance I can hit it back for half damage
which<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.119> quite<00:01:06.330> good<00:01:06.360> actually<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.080> the
