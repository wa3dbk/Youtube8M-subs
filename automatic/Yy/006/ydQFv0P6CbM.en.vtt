00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.029

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.890

 I coat it in four pieces 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.340
 We cut it so later 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.340
 can work together 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.350

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.800

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.370
