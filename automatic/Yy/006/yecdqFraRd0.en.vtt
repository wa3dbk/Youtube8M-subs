00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
to take the 3ds apart to actually

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.189 
to take the 3ds apart to actually
install<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.920> capture<00:01:02.250> card<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.910> da<00:01:03.270> is

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
install the capture card and this da is

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.580 
install the capture card and this da is
the<00:01:05.100> main<00:01:05.670> event<00:01:06.000> okay<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.990> reason<00:01:07.080> you

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the main event okay so the reason you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.960 
the main event okay so the reason you
would<00:01:07.710> get<00:01:07.860> one<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.040> these<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.670> pretty

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
would get one of these is it is pretty

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.679 
would get one of these is it is pretty
much<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.420> normal<00:01:10.170> 3ds<00:01:10.970> but<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> reason

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
much just a normal 3ds but the reason

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.850 
much just a normal 3ds but the reason
you<00:01:12.780> would<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> these<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.680> because

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
you would have one of these is because

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.160 
you would have one of these is because
of<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.189> little<00:01:14.400> bad<00:01:14.610> boy<00:01:14.720> okay<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
of this little bad boy okay that is the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.469 
of this little bad boy okay that is the
USB<00:01:18.439> port<00:01:19.439> for<00:01:19.860> actually<00:01:20.369> capturing<00:01:20.909> all<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
USB port for actually capturing all the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.140 
USB port for actually capturing all the
visual<00:01:21.990> stuff<00:01:22.259> from<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> 3ds<00:01:23.040> usually<00:01:24.030> they

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
visual stuff from the 3ds usually they

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.310 
visual stuff from the 3ds usually they
wouldn't<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.659> installed<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.229> would

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
wouldn't have that installed that would

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.300 
wouldn't have that installed that would
probably<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.369> IR<00:01:26.729> port<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:28.409> there<00:01:29.159> you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
probably be the the IR port so there you

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.330 
probably be the the IR port so there you
have<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.150> 3d<00:01:31.049> s<00:01:31.350> okay<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.250> think

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
have it that is the 3d s okay so I think

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.920 
have it that is the 3d s okay so I think
the<00:01:32.490> next<00:01:32.610> logical<00:01:32.759> step<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.689> actually

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the next logical step is to actually

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.240 
the next logical step is to actually
plug<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.740> see<00:01:34.829> if<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.159> any

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
plug this in and see if we get any

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.830 
plug this in and see if we get any
visuals<00:01:35.670> off<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.150> see<00:01:36.479> what<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> quality

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
visuals off it and see what the quality

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.870 
visuals off it and see what the quality
of<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> product<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.340> I'll<00:01:38.520> see<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.759> guys

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.069 
are in Super Mario 3d Land and this is
direct<00:01:44.100> capture<00:01:44.610> from<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.909> 3ds<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.869> think

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
direct capture from the 3ds and I think

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.389 
direct capture from the 3ds and I think
you'll<00:01:46.320> agree<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:46.770> actually<00:01:47.009> really<00:01:47.189> quite

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
you'll agree it's actually really quite

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.969 
you'll agree it's actually really quite
nice<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:48.240> very<00:01:48.570> clear<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.259> gonna<00:01:49.829> be

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
nice it's very clear it's gonna be

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.590 
nice it's very clear it's gonna be
perfect<00:01:50.340> for<00:01:50.399> doing<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.820> episodes<00:01:51.390> with

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
perfect for doing the episodes with

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.179 
perfect for doing the episodes with
obviously<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.649> standard<00:01:52.950> gameplay

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
obviously this is just standard gameplay

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.260
