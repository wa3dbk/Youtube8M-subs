00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
yesterday and it actually took me a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.499 
yesterday and it actually took me a
total<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:13.730> altogether<00:00:14.730> about<00:00:14.910> eight<00:00:15.269> hours

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
total of altogether about eight hours

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.140 
total of altogether about eight hours
and<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.760> went<00:00:17.760> straight<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:19.279> didn't<00:00:20.279> stop<00:00:20.670> or

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
and I went straight I didn't stop or

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.439 
and I went straight I didn't stop or
anything<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:22.189> sat<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.430> did<00:00:23.640> them<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
anything I just sat and did them the

whole<00:00:24.689> day<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.769> think<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.510> this<00:00:27.510> is

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
whole day and I think that this is

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.609 
whole day and I think that this is
actually<00:00:28.590> my<00:00:28.769> first<00:00:29.130> time<00:00:30.289> twisting<00:00:31.289> my<00:00:31.410> hair

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
twists any type of twist in my hair

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.500 
twists any type of twist in my hair
myself<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:39.050> I<00:00:40.050> must<00:00:40.410> say<00:00:40.680> I'm<00:00:40.980> pretty<00:00:41.940> proud

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
myself and I must say I'm pretty proud

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.779 
myself and I must say I'm pretty proud
of<00:00:42.870> myself<00:00:43.050> let<00:00:43.379> me<00:00:43.500> take<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.920> scarf<00:00:44.280> off<00:00:44.460> so

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
of myself let me take the scarf off so

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.060 
of myself let me take the scarf off so
the<00:00:44.850> child<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.210> kind<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.480> get<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.410> idea<00:00:46.980> of

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the child can kind of get the idea of

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.500 
the child can kind of get the idea of
the<00:00:47.700> length<00:00:49.280> one<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.370> my<00:00:50.430> girlfriend's<00:00:51.180> wanted

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the length one of my girlfriend's wanted

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.420 
the length one of my girlfriend's wanted
me<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.660> make<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.960> video<00:00:52.170> saw<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.800> chocolate<00:00:53.010> sea

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
me to make a video saw the chocolate sea

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.400 
me to make a video saw the chocolate sea
and<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.910> guess<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.390> she<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> closer

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and I guess so that she can get a closer

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.910 
and I guess so that she can get a closer
look<00:00:55.559> yourself<00:00:56.030> but<00:00:57.030> they<00:00:57.899> are<00:00:58.109> pretty<00:00:58.530> full

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
look yourself but they are pretty full

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.479 
look yourself but they are pretty full

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
few twists but the thing that I liked

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.940 
few twists but the thing that I liked
about<00:01:54.659> these<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:55.409> why<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.530> thought<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.860> they

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
about these and why I thought that they

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.800 
about these and why I thought that they
were<00:01:56.069> going<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.580> easy<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:57.119> me<00:01:57.209> to<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.509> is

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
were going to be so easy for me to do is

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.160 
were going to be so easy for me to do is
the<00:01:58.229> fact<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.679> started<00:01:59.220> them<00:01:59.929> with<00:02:00.929> a

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the fact that I started them with a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.339 
the fact that I started them with a
braid<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.310> then<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.479> start<00:02:03.720> twisting

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
braid and then you just start twisting

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:06.859 
braid and then you just start twisting
you<00:02:05.039> didn't<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.459> to<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:06.060> roll<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.720> twist

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
you didn't have to do the roll and twist

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.100 
you didn't have to do the roll and twist
like<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.349> do<00:02:07.530> with<00:02:07.739> kinky<00:02:08.190> because<00:02:08.759> I

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
like you do with kinky because I

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.309 
like you do with kinky because I
couldn't<00:02:10.110> do<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.380> so<00:02:11.340> all<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.209> did<00:02:12.480> was<00:02:13.049> just

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
couldn't do that so all I did was just

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.490 
couldn't do that so all I did was just
twist<00:02:13.680> twist<00:02:14.040> twist<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.260> what<00:02:16.470> I

really<00:02:48.299> quick<00:02:49.170> I'm<00:02:49.799> actually<00:02:50.069> just<00:02:50.730> on<00:02:50.910> a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
really quick I'm actually just on a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.879 
really quick I'm actually just on a
quick<00:02:51.209> break<00:02:51.720> from<00:02:52.109> work<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:54.560> once<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.680> just

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
quick break from work so once you just

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:05.390 
quick break from work so once you just
come<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.130> share

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.650 

so<00:03:06.400> here<00:03:07.270> it<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:08.850> there's<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.940> few<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.390> I<00:03:10.480> could

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
so here it is there's a few that I could

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.260 
so here it is there's a few that I could
probably<00:03:10.840> extend<00:03:11.800> out<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.340> little<00:03:12.880> bit<00:03:13.120> more

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
probably extend out a little bit more

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.030 
probably extend out a little bit more
like<00:03:13.510> this<00:03:13.690> one<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:13.990> could<00:03:14.170> probably<00:03:14.470> make<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:14.950> a

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
like this one I could probably make it a

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.730 
like this one I could probably make it a
little<00:03:15.220> bit<00:03:15.400> longer<00:03:15.640> but<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.270> kind<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:17.020> like<00:03:17.200> how

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
little bit longer but I kind of like how

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.360 
little bit longer but I kind of like how
it's<00:03:18.190> layered

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
it's layered

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.220 
it's layered
now<00:03:22.440> they<00:03:23.440> are<00:03:23.680> not<00:03:23.950> too<00:03:24.250> tight<00:03:24.550> and<00:03:24.990> I<00:03:25.990> should

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
now they are not too tight and I should

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.780 
now they are not too tight and I should
have<00:03:26.290> put<00:03:26.500> some<00:03:26.530> edge<00:03:26.890> control<00:03:27.430> on<00:03:27.610> that

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
have put some edge control on that

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.020 
have put some edge control on that
weight<00:03:28.060> just<00:03:28.270> like<00:03:28.420> I<00:03:28.540> can<00:03:28.780> see<00:03:28.960> it<00:03:29.050> but

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
weight just like I can see it but

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.160 
weight just like I can see it but
they're<00:03:31.030> not<00:03:31.270> too<00:03:31.480> tight<00:03:33.870> definitely<00:03:34.870> be<00:03:35.020> able

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
they're not too tight definitely be able

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.610 
they're not too tight definitely be able
to<00:03:35.350> do<00:03:35.560> some<00:03:35.800> things<00:03:35.830> with<00:03:36.220> them<00:03:37.260> once<00:03:38.260> I<00:03:38.410> get

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
to do some things with them once I get

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.080 
to do some things with them once I get
used<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.950> them<00:03:39.100> because<00:03:39.430> this<00:03:39.580> is<00:03:39.640> my<00:03:39.820> first

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
used to them because this is my first

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.940 
used to them because this is my first
time<00:03:40.330> actually<00:03:40.540> have<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:40.930> puffy<00:03:41.530> twist<00:03:41.800> all

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
time actually have a puffy twist all

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.360 
time actually have a puffy twist all
together<00:03:42.210> the<00:03:43.210> hair<00:03:43.510> is<00:03:43.690> very<00:03:43.720> light<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.710> this

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
together the hair is very light and this

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.210 
together the hair is very light and this
soft<00:03:45.730> I<00:03:46.120> like<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.690> a<00:03:46.780> lot<00:03:46.990> when<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:47.710> open<00:03:48.130> the

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
soft I like it a lot when you open the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.590 
soft I like it a lot when you open the
pack<00:03:48.430> up<00:03:48.610> it's<00:03:48.880> like<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.150> hair<00:03:49.300> just<00:03:49.450> like

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
pack up it's like the hair just like

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.380 
pack up it's like the hair just like
puffs<00:03:49.990> out<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:51.070> it<00:03:51.280> becomes<00:03:51.700> like<00:03:51.940> this<00:03:51.970> big

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
puffs out and it becomes like this big

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.930 
puffs out and it becomes like this big
poof<00:03:52.660> of<00:03:52.840> hair<00:03:53.050> so<00:03:53.410> that's<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.490> only<00:03:54.640> thing

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
poof of hair so that's the only thing

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.080 
poof of hair so that's the only thing
that<00:03:55.060> I<00:03:55.120> would<00:03:55.180> say<00:03:55.950> about<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.100> process<00:03:57.640> on

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
that I would say about the process on

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.090 
that I would say about the process on
why<00:03:58.450> it<00:03:58.510> took<00:03:58.780> so<00:03:58.840> long<00:03:59.020> is<00:03:59.410> because<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.890> do

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
why it took so long is because you do

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.950 
why it took so long is because you do
have<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.400> when<00:04:00.910> you're<00:04:01.030> taking<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:01.480> hair<00:04:01.720> out
