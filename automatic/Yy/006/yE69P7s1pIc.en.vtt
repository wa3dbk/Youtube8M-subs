they did with these rip cards is with

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.580 
they did with these rip cards is with
the<00:03:03.060> mini<00:03:03.240> card<00:03:03.510> inside<00:03:03.870> they<00:03:04.110> put<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.320> black

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
the mini card inside they put a black

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.530 
the mini card inside they put a black
piece<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:05.010> paper<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.310> front<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.030> a

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
piece of paper in front of it and a

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.030 
piece of paper in front of it and a
black<00:03:06.780> piece<00:03:07.020> of<00:03:07.170> paper<00:03:07.320> on<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> back<00:03:07.770> of<00:03:07.800> it

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
black piece of paper on the back of it

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.760
