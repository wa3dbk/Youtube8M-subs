common problem

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.209 
common problem
not<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:12.090> much<00:00:12.360> aesthetically<00:00:13.200> although<00:00:14.070> it

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
not so much aesthetically although it

the<00:00:16.970> environmental<00:00:17.970> contamination<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:19.320> get

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
the environmental contamination to get

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.650 
the environmental contamination to get
to<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.580> top<00:00:21.050> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.470> cable<00:00:22.970> that<00:00:23.970> feeds<00:00:24.390> from

the battery to the starter motor more

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.830 
the battery to the starter motor more
often<00:00:27.720> than<00:00:27.930> not<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.380> see<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.920> rubber<00:00:29.220> boot

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
often than not I see this rubber boot

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.590 
often than not I see this rubber boot
pushed<00:00:30.840> out<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.380> way<00:00:31.700> distorted<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.940> don't

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
pushed out of the way distorted I don't

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.740 
pushed out of the way distorted I don't
know<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.079> created<00:00:34.530> by<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.739> heat<00:00:35.190> or<00:00:35.750> it's

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
know if it's created by the heat or it's

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.780 
know if it's created by the heat or it's
just<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.230> way<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.680> rubber<00:00:37.890> expands<00:00:38.520> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
just the way the rubber expands and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.500 
just the way the rubber expands and
contracts<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.469> do<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.860> these<00:00:41.070> I
