itself<00:00:20.460> appears<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.939> be<00:00:21.029> very<00:00:21.060> reminiscent<00:00:21.630> of

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
itself appears to be very reminiscent of

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.840 
itself appears to be very reminiscent of
the<00:00:21.990> iOS<00:00:22.650> game<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.519> it's<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:23.760> been

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the iOS game but it's just been

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.519 
the iOS game but it's just been
optimized<00:00:24.330> for<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.630> larger<00:00:24.930> screen<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.350> let's

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
optimized for a larger screen so let's

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.250 
optimized for a larger screen so let's
say<00:00:25.710> 27<00:00:26.519> inch<00:00:26.670> imac<00:00:26.810> but<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.900> game<00:00:28.109> itself

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
say 27 inch imac but the game itself

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.740 
say 27 inch imac but the game itself
also<00:00:28.710> allows<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.400> use<00:00:29.609> your<00:00:29.640> iDevice<00:00:30.300> as<00:00:30.539> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
also allows you to use your iDevice as a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.569 
also allows you to use your iDevice as a
controller<00:00:31.199> very<00:00:31.740> much<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.250> currently

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
controller very much like you currently

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.850 
controller very much like you currently
can<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.630> apple<00:00:33.870> TV<00:00:34.200> through<00:00:34.500> Apple's

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860

can on the apple TV through Apple's
AirPlay<00:00:35.040> technology<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.510> unless<00:00:36.690> you're<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
AirPlay technology so unless you're a

AirPlay technology so unless you're a
huge<00:00:37.200> fan<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.469> real<00:00:37.770> racing<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.280> might<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.550> hard

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
huge fan of real racing it might be hard

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.459 
huge fan of real racing it might be hard
to<00:00:38.790> justify<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.450> 13<00:00:39.870> dollar<00:00:40.020> price<00:00:40.260> tag

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
to justify that 13 dollar price tag

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.930 
to justify that 13 dollar price tag
