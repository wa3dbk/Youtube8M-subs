00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:11.530
 hi how about how are you welcome 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:13.510
 again you are surely seeing this 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.789
 video is because you are those people at 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.130
 who have a hard time climbing 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.560
 weight gain muscle mass but in this 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.720
 I'll bring you three singles 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.760
 steps part in peace is the construction 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.279
 of your muscles so that it starts to rise 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.590
 of weight so that we begin to rise but 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.890
 of weight with a lean muscle we're not going to 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.559
 going up fat we're going to gain weight with 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.690
 pure muscle ok well these three are the 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.690
 in simple steps and let's start 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.239
 many people believe that the secret to 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.300
 climb we advance with the really is in 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.730
 the gym lifting weights by lifting 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.910
 those extreme weights but not really the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.350
 secret is in the food I think it goes 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.960
 to be the basis of the calculation of calories 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.530
 What do you need for this calculation? 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.670
 use the harris vending equation 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.619
 this is a very simple equation where 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.600
 let's first calculate the rate 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.610
 basal metabolic for men what 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.790
 let's do the following way let's 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.810
 to multiply your weight by 10 then you 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.500
 let's add your height plus 6.25 and you 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.950
 let's subtract your age percent and that 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.509
 we are going to add 5 for women you 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.619
 weight by 10 your height by 6.25 less 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.619
 age by 5 and this we will subtract 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.619
 162 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.040
 Now that you have your metabolic rate 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.100
 we're just going to calculate the calories 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.710
 what you require according to the intensity 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.479
 of the exercise that you do in case 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.009
 Do little or no exercise on 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.570
 previous result you will multiply 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:55.590
 by 1.2 lightweight exercise by 1.375 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.399
 moderate exercise by 1.55 exercise 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.280
 very strong for 1,700 25 and exercise 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.340
 extreme like who says for athletes 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.259
 1.9 well, these are the calories that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.550
 you will need to consume but these are 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.190
 the calories you need to 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.800
 keep fighting and six in shape 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.260
 but really our goal is to go up 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.410
 muscle mass then let's do what 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.410
 following 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.219
 ok to the previous calculation we are going to add 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.319
 500 calories in order to consume more 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:31.170
 calories that our body is 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.450
 burning but it's not that simple no 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.280
 let's put any amount of 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.340
 food to connect calories 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.129
 here is the most important thing we are going to 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.250
 really put those macronutrients 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:47.010
 of good quality is very important but 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.799
 very very important and protein consumption 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.930
 of good quality of life 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.930
 ok then let's go to step number 3 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.130
 here the most important thing is the combination 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.830
 adequate protein 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.220
 carbohydrates and fats the proteins are 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.290
 very very very important since at the time 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.390
 training or do exercise your 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.520
 muscles are going to require proteins from 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.620
 good quality to be able to rebuild 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.660
 more everything is repaired and so they can 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.050
 grow we're going to get him then 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.270
 Good quality good proteins we can 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.350
 put proteins like the serum of 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:30.120
 milk egg chicken let's put turkey 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:33.280
 red meat meat lean tuna salmon 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.770
 casein and milk and carbohydrates 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.620
 of great quality to increase your mass 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.410
 muscle are potatoes oats rice 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.200
 the beans see all the vegetables 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.020
 green leaf pasta and for 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.890
 healthy fats olive oil oil 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.950
 sunflower coconut oil nuts 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.590
 avocados olives and good making a 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.890
 combination of carbohydrate proteins 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.240
 fats properly you're really going to 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.030
 Can achieve 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.890
 of weight gain mass increase 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.990
 muscle but now that we already have here 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.120
 in the nutrition advisory channel 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.830
 personalized here below I leave you 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.420
 our mail so that they complement them 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.720
 and we have all the information 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.880
 corresponding is how you see are three 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.250
 simple steps to start climbing 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.370
 muscle mass is very important that 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.100
 consume carbohydrates proteins and 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.460
 good quality fats so that they rise 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.740
 really bad muscle do not upload 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.840
 only fat ok this only the 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.700
