00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.049
 Save folks but join that you 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.350
 area 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.049
 I'm going to inform you guys, these days. 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.700
 will only be reviewed while there is less 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.640
 orders do not arrive 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.220
 I'll hold on and videos talking about 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.410
 products that I already consume and may have 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.220
 surety will have a lot of news in this 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.099
 reviews 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.330
 I 'm here in this scenario here the bank 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.099
 pale face 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.349
 many people were stationed in 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.870
 leaving here is a blank to pay 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.449
 So let's stop beating from here. 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.470
 Let's see what you 're going to say today. 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:43.280
 I'm going to report my use of the protein in the ship. 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.280
 foods 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.479
 I researched a few days ago and did not see 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.440
 nobody talking about this protein give 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.979
 force 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.299
 I'm very fan of this brand and I decided 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:01:00.350
 buy protein from them to try 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:03.439
 a little bit for you take a look 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.440
 the taste of her is dante chocoleite 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:10.440
 Dutch chocolate 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:16.140
 What can I talk about the taste? 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.220
 first the taste is good is good the if 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.500
 mixture 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.200
 I'll tell you 95% on the water how to sign 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 are the small pieces that the protein does not 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.310
 mix totally but it is not 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.030
 nothing that will level and you consume 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.909
 protein stay hopefully so I even 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.740
 I tried mixing in the fox for 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.320
 check if it was really a problem of the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.840
 dust removal typing on the street 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.640
 marginal is of the protein itself and not 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.760
 can still dissolve 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.860
 little bits the taste of it is strange sweet 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.310
 so there are plenty of two mainly 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.310
 the small pieces that are very sweet 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.970
 so I was curious and saw that the table 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.009
 nutritional and see who has a substance 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:14.150
 that I will pronounce in Portuguese that 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.150
 flame row tone x and y 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.130
 Enough lentil charlie and such I do not know I 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.990
 I'll speak in Portuguese, I have one. 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.660
 wanted to show you here 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:33.100
 if I can compute my finger here 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:36.670
 Look there guys, chila, tone the chile and ball. 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.960
 It is a natural sweetener to find in 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:44.740
 fibers of many vegetables 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:49.180
 It is as sweet as sucrose but it is 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.490
 about 40% less caloric 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.130
 chile is totally being 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.420
 implanted in oral hygiene products 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.430
 that will be the subject of a next video of mine 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.700
 I'll talk about it then one 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.700
 work that will be new to the area it is 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:14.250
 to show you a speech 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.250
 the first one is different 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:28.540
 It's a little strange I had never picked it up 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:31.960
 scope of this shape is not foam where 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.910
 You mix me up a little bit for me. 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.040
 I do not consider how this is normal 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.050
 because it has some protein excuse 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.750
 a lot and it's not easy 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.940
 the problem is not structured 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.090
 completely in the water getting 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.590
 95% was still quite a 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.180
 small pieces 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.340
 but if you ask me and still 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:57.700
 did not feel good about everything 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.030
 sure the guys felt great and you 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.420
 recommend me to give you the recommended use 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:09.070
 of this protein lime canopy 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:13.480

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.670
 things all supplements that people 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.650
 do not know I 'm sure that good 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.080
 people do not even know that there is 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.420
 a protein from the canal fuse I came to 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.530
 discover a little time ago 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.420
 even made a box and receives faults and mail 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.130
 field as was the protein that many 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.380
 people did not know 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.470
 we are here for that crowd to 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.560
