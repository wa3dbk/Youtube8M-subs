 smartphone the moment you do 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.119
 moves away beyond a certain distance from 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.950

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.990
 take our phone user of 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.610
 steal rho from the moment it comes 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.729

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.380
 software how it interacts and how it comes about 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.439
 managed or click from the smartphone in

 what is necessary to go to activate the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:43.140
 bluetooth connection is little then we go 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.250
 to see here we are approaching a 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.320
 let's go to the camera 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.450
 in our dedicated application or 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.040

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.939
 we continue the screens 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.270
 here it is now the search for the will begin 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.270
 devices 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.380
 let's try to see if here by pressing one 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.750
 time 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.780
 effect as you can see has 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:17.970
 we recognized the device we perform 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:20.700
 pairing for a few moments 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.230
 the connection should be 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.660
 perfect consolidated this is the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.660
 or click settings screen 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.959
 let's see to find 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.580
 here is to avoid the reflection then how 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.709
 you can see the first option is 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:43.500

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.610
 which maybe we can't find it in 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.590
 that anti-loss moment is the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.430
 function we were talking about earlier 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.209
 ie evening revenue when the phone 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.739
 will be beyond the safety distance 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.829
 while reminder message is 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.069

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:21.269
