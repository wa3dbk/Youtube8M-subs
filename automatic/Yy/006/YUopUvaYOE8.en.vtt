 Alex and have not been on the channel for a long time 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.769
 no vidos because I was sick lying 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.480

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.039

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.630
 how to make fps in country more 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.340
 a hundred 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.080
 I think experienced cruisers already know this. 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.810
 chip but novices we have no less 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.210

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.750
 how to do it and on pirates and how it 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.759
 make an incentive and the first thing we do 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.860
 This we prescribe team in order 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.660
 to show us fps in the lower right 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.790
 corner but at least i have so on 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.129
 command no count 3 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.020
 on the pirate and on the incentive it is the same 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.300
 then we prescribe if you pirate 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.100
 pay attention prescribed command 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.910
 developer one after which we prescribe 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:02.670
 fps max command for example 150 also 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.680
 possible and large 200 and 300, and then 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.799
 pay attention to the taste it will be you 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.220

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.710
 other team be careful here 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.130
 fps overnight command 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.710
 one prescribed this command and then 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.780
 we also prescribed fps max 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.670
 for example also 150 and fps in the lower right 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:33.180
 the corner will show you how much you are here 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.050
 list at least 200 what affects these 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.480
 teams you ask 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.250
 these commands are most often used 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.630
 movie maker and to smooth 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.930

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.210
 the team I will tell you that it is prohibited on 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.830
 official tournaments in lan tournaments but 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.410
 nothing prevents you from using it 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.040
 for example on servers it will help a lot 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:00.460

 laptop owners face 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.899
 Well, I tried on a weak computer 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.430
 where fps falls, that is, I registered more 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.410
 for example one hundred fifty one hundred sixty 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.130
 years really helping shooting becomes 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.620
