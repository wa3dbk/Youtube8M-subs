00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
that's nice as well now it's a dual core

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.979 
that's nice as well now it's a dual core
Celeron<00:00:32.430> dual<00:00:32.759> core<00:00:32.940> running<00:00:33.210> at<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:33.600> point

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
Celeron dual core running at one point

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.299

seven three gigahertz

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.160 
seven three gigahertz
also<00:00:35.910> we've<00:00:36.030> got<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.180> gigabyte<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.660> RAM<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
also we've got a gigabyte of RAM and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.690 
also we've got a gigabyte of RAM and
this<00:00:37.440> comes<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.710> Windows<00:00:38.040> Vista<00:00:38.250> Home<00:00:38.550> basic

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
this comes with Windows Vista Home basic

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.000 
this comes with Windows Vista Home basic
and<00:00:39.510> now<00:00:39.750> basically<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.440> down<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> lot<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and now basically it's down a lot of the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.729 
and now basically it's down a lot of the
glitz<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.879> guess<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> lot<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.930> lot<00:00:43.649> of

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
glitz and I guess a lot of the a lot of

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.799 
glitz and I guess a lot of the a lot of
the<00:00:43.800> visual<00:00:43.920> effects<00:00:44.460> which<00:00:44.969> does<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.480> fact

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the visual effects which does in fact

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.840 
the visual effects which does in fact
make<00:00:46.140> your<00:00:46.289> computer<00:00:46.530> run<00:00:46.680> faster<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.760> if

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
make your computer run faster so if

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.010 
make your computer run faster so if
you're<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.090> using<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.480> computer<00:00:48.840> for

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you're just using a computer for

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.840 
you're just using a computer for
business<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.559> said<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.829> do<00:00:49.950> some<00:00:50.160> checking

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
business like I said to do some checking

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.760 
business like I said to do some checking

emails maybe you want to store some

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.229 
emails maybe you want to store some
files<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.670> do<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.120> can

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
files on here you can do that you can

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.580 
files on here you can do that you can
also<00:00:54.360> use<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:54.930> some<00:00:55.110> photo<00:00:55.289> editing

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
also use it to do some photo editing

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
also use it to do some photo editing
with<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.860> dual<00:00:56.039> core<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.270> gonna<00:00:57.480> run

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
with that dual core but it is gonna run

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.260 
with that dual core but it is gonna run
a<00:00:57.840> bit<00:00:58.140> faster<00:00:58.550> since<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.730> doesn't<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.120> all

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
a bit faster since it doesn't have all

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.330 
a bit faster since it doesn't have all
the<00:01:00.449> extra<00:01:00.780> effects<00:01:01.079> turned<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.680> that

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the extra effects turned on so that that

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.770 
the extra effects turned on so that that
can<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> bonus<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.000> mean<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> depends<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.629> what
