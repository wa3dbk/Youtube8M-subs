00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:03.439 

another<00:00:02.129> factor<00:00:02.639> that<00:00:02.669> affects<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.179> climate

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
another factor that affects the climate

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.480 
another factor that affects the climate
of<00:00:03.689> an<00:00:03.780> area<00:00:04.049> is<00:00:04.200> whether<00:00:04.500> it's<00:00:04.740> in<00:00:04.920> that<00:00:05.250> area

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
of an area is whether it's in that area

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.760 
of an area is whether it's in that area
a<00:00:05.730> region<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.390> near<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.600> large<00:00:06.960> body<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.470> water

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
a region is near a large body of water

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.990 
a region is near a large body of water
now<00:00:07.950> we're<00:00:08.099> not<00:00:08.189> talking<00:00:08.370> about<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.670> small

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
now we're not talking about a small

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.990 
now we're not talking about a small
little<00:00:09.300> lake<00:00:09.540> but<00:00:10.500> something<00:00:10.950> huge<00:00:11.670> like<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
little lake but something huge like the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.089 
little lake but something huge like the
Gulf<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.330> Mexico<00:00:12.780> one<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.230> oceans<00:00:13.440> even

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
Gulf of Mexico one of the oceans even

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.700 
Gulf of Mexico one of the oceans even
Lake<00:00:14.370> Ontario<00:00:14.549> slightly<00:00:15.269> as<00:00:15.389> well<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:16.260> imagine

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
Lake Ontario slightly as well so imagine

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.700 
Lake Ontario slightly as well so imagine
we<00:00:16.859> have<00:00:17.100> two<00:00:17.850> locations<00:00:18.630> two<00:00:19.050> cities<00:00:19.470> so

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
we have two locations two cities so

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.580 
we have two locations two cities so
here's<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.580> land<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.390> here's<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.289> large

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
here's the land and here's the large

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.730 
here's the land and here's the large
body<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.130> water<00:00:23.430> over<00:00:24.180> here<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.289> some<00:00:25.470> places

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
body of water over here so some places

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.609 
body of water over here so some places
are<00:00:26.160> inland<00:00:27.119> cities<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:27.840> they're<00:00:27.990> really<00:00:28.260> far

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
are inland cities so they're really far

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.279 
are inland cities so they're really far
away<00:00:28.769> let's<00:00:29.160> think<00:00:29.369> like<00:00:29.699> Nebraska<00:00:29.910> or<00:00:30.689> Kansas

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
away let's think like Nebraska or Kansas

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.260 
away let's think like Nebraska or Kansas
so<00:00:31.529> here<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.420> city<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.440> we'll<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.550> city<00:00:36.000> B

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
so here is city a and we'll have city B

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.569 
so here is city a and we'll have city B
which<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.600> right<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.230> water<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.010> we're

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
which is right on the water and we're

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.400 
which is right on the water and we're
talking<00:00:38.760> about<00:00:38.879> maybe<00:00:39.090> Washington<00:00:39.780> DC<00:00:40.200> or

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
talking about maybe Washington DC or

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.600 
talking about maybe Washington DC or
Miami<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> one<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.960> an<00:00:46.079> inland<00:00:46.680> location<00:00:47.370> city

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
Miami so one is an inland location city

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.619 
Miami so one is an inland location city
a<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.239> other<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> coastal<00:00:49.289> city<00:00:49.530> city

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
a the other is a coastal city city

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.990 
a the other is a coastal city city
b-because<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.660> waters<00:00:52.530> high<00:00:53.100> specific<00:00:53.850> heat

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000 

it<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.149> gonna<00:00:57.270> take<00:00:57.360> longer<00:00:57.989> for<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.710> water

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
it is gonna take longer for that water

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.189 
it is gonna take longer for that water
to<00:00:59.160> heat<00:00:59.640> up<00:00:59.670> it's<00:01:00.420> also<00:01:00.539> gonna<00:01:00.719> take<00:01:00.899> longer

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
to heat up it's also gonna take longer

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.750 
to heat up it's also gonna take longer
for<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.559> water<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.920> cool<00:01:02.219> down<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.670> you

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
for that water to cool down so you

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.830 
for that water to cool down so you
remember<00:01:03.000> from<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> front<00:01:03.449> page<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.660> your

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
remember from the front page of your

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.899 
remember from the front page of your
reference<00:01:04.229> tables<00:01:04.530> liquid<00:01:05.460> water<00:01:05.670> has<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
reference tables liquid water has a

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.330 
reference tables liquid water has a
specific<00:01:06.840> heat<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.110> over<00:01:07.350> four<00:01:07.710> joules<00:01:08.189> per

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
specific heat of over four joules per

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.850 
specific heat of over four joules per
gram<00:01:08.790> yet<00:01:09.479> land<00:01:09.869> which<00:01:10.140> has<00:01:10.260> made<00:01:10.409> out<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.650> rock

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
gram yet land which has made out of rock

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.789 
gram yet land which has made out of rock
maybe<00:01:11.100> some<00:01:11.400> basalt<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.000> granite<00:01:12.500> that<00:01:13.500> has<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
maybe some basalt and granite that has a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.030 
maybe some basalt and granite that has a
specific<00:01:14.430> heat<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.790> less<00:01:15.180> than<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.930> joule<00:01:16.799> per

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.130 
specific heat of less than one joule per
gram<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.939> land<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.509> gonna<00:01:18.689> heat<00:01:19.110> up

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
gram so that that land is gonna heat up

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.219 
gram so that that land is gonna heat up
a<00:01:19.500> lot<00:01:20.070> faster<00:01:20.729> than<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.479> water<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.049> gonna

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
a lot faster than the water is gonna

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.340 
a lot faster than the water is gonna
heat<00:01:22.560> up<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> if<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.869> looked<00:01:25.080> at<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
heat up so if we looked at the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.749 
heat up so if we looked at the
temperatures<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:27.390> cities<00:01:28.070> over<00:01:29.070> -<00:01:29.130> over<00:01:29.700> a

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
temperatures of the cities over - over a

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.480 
temperatures of the cities over - over a
year<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:31.290> might<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.710> city<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
year we might see that city a the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.609 
year we might see that city a the
hottest<00:01:33.000> temperature<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.659> City<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.049> maybe<00:01:34.380> it's

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
hottest temperature at City a maybe it's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.490 
hottest temperature at City a maybe it's
up<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.979> 95<00:01:35.909> degrees<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.869> let's<00:01:36.900> say<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
up to 95 degrees so let's say that's the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.520 
up to 95 degrees so let's say that's the
hottest<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.520> gets<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:39.420> whereas<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.780> say<00:01:39.930> 96

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
hottest it gets or whereas I say 96

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.499 
hottest it gets or whereas I say 96
let's<00:01:41.250> say<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> hottest<00:01:41.880> temperature<00:01:42.329> gets

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
let's say the hottest temperature gets

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.980 
let's say the hottest temperature gets
up<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> 96<00:01:43.560> degrees<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.729> City<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:47.570> yet<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
up to 96 degrees it's City a yet in the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.990 
up to 96 degrees it's City a yet in the
wintertime<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.680> coldest<00:01:50.280> temperature<00:01:50.759> is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
wintertime the coldest temperature is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.569 
wintertime the coldest temperature is
found<00:01:51.360> at<00:01:51.509> City<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.840> drops<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.100> way<00:01:53.310> down

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
found at City a drops all the way down

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.139 
found at City a drops all the way down
to<00:01:54.390> let's<00:01:54.720> say<00:01:54.960> there<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.380> 4<00:01:56.130> degrees<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
to let's say there is 4 degrees so the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.380 
to let's say there is 4 degrees so the
coldest<00:01:57.689> gets<00:01:58.130> 4<00:01:59.130> degrees<00:01:59.430> Fahrenheit<00:01:59.820> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
coldest gets 4 degrees Fahrenheit the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.450 
coldest gets 4 degrees Fahrenheit the
range<00:02:00.840> or<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.829> difference<00:02:02.670> between<00:02:03.570> them<00:02:03.840> is

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
range or the difference between them is

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.270 
range or the difference between them is
quite<00:02:05.460> largely<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.180> we<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> large<00:02:06.750> range

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
quite largely so we have a large range

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.949 
quite largely so we have a large range
in<00:02:08.280> temperature

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.199 

from<00:02:12.409> wintertime<00:02:13.040> coldest<00:02:13.609> temperature<00:02:14.030> to

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.220 
gonna get up to 96
maybe<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.639> summertime<00:02:35.120> temperature<00:02:36.109> is

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
maybe that summertime temperature is

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.170 
maybe that summertime temperature is
gonna<00:02:36.620> get<00:02:36.859> up<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.340> around<00:02:37.700> there<00:02:37.939> or<00:02:38.060> do<00:02:38.120> we

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
gonna get up to around there or do we

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.750 
gonna get up to around there or do we
got<00:02:38.269> 85<00:02:38.870> degrees<00:02:39.379> so<00:02:39.920> for<00:02:40.159> city<00:02:40.370> be<00:02:40.579> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
got 85 degrees so for city be the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.330 
got 85 degrees so for city be the
hottest<00:02:41.060> that's<00:02:41.389> gonna<00:02:41.540> get<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:42.260> about<00:02:42.590> 85

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
hottest that's gonna get is about 85

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.509 
hottest that's gonna get is about 85
degrees<00:02:43.849> Fahrenheit<00:02:44.419> in<00:02:44.659> the<00:02:45.349> wintertime<00:02:45.739> the

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
degrees Fahrenheit in the wintertime the

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.270 
degrees Fahrenheit in the wintertime the
water<00:02:46.939> has<00:02:47.389> a<00:02:47.419> lot<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:47.930> energy<00:02:48.379> in<00:02:48.859> it<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.159> it's

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
water has a lot of energy in it and it's

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.460 
water has a lot of energy in it and it's
gonna<00:02:49.400> take<00:02:49.849> a<00:02:49.879> long<00:02:50.269> time<00:02:50.629> to<00:02:50.840> cool<00:02:51.109> down

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
gonna take a long time to cool down

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.589 
gonna take a long time to cool down
so<00:02:51.950> it's<00:02:52.099> not<00:02:52.220> gonna<00:02:52.430> cool<00:02:52.669> down<00:02:52.700> as<00:02:53.060> quickly

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
so it's not gonna cool down as quickly

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.319 
so it's not gonna cool down as quickly
as<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.049> land<00:02:54.379> does<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:55.310> it's<00:02:55.700> temperature

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
as the land does so it's temperature

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.199 
as the land does so it's temperature
might<00:02:56.599> drop<00:02:56.870> down<00:02:57.139> to<00:02:57.319> about<00:02:57.400> 12<00:02:58.400> degrees<00:02:58.669> in

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
might drop down to about 12 degrees in

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.699 
might drop down to about 12 degrees in
the<00:02:59.719> wintertime<00:03:02.169> you'll<00:03:03.169> notice<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.590> we

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
the wintertime you'll notice that we

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:10.899 
the wintertime you'll notice that we
have<00:03:03.829> a<00:03:03.859> much<00:03:04.150> lower<00:03:05.150> temperature<00:03:05.870> range<00:03:09.909> now

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
have a much lower temperature range now

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:16.869 
have a much lower temperature range now
we<00:03:10.969> have<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:12.280> 73<00:03:13.280> degree<00:03:14.319> range<00:03:15.319> so<00:03:16.250> if<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.579> live

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
we have a 73 degree range so if you live

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.240 
we have a 73 degree range so if you live
near<00:03:17.150> a<00:03:17.180> large<00:03:17.599> body<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.139> water<00:03:18.500> what<00:03:18.829> happens

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
near a large body of water what happens

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.050 
near a large body of water what happens
is<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.639> large<00:03:20.629> body<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:21.109> water<00:03:21.760> heats<00:03:22.760> up

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
is the large body of water heats up

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.750 
is the large body of water heats up
