running<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:30.359> series<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:30.990> 100%<00:00:31.349> walk

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.100 

it's<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.400> little<00:00:41.580> too<00:00:41.730> much<00:00:41.970> you<00:00:42.870> know<00:00:42.990> it's

kind of watching out the sound and it's
overdoing<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.100> bit<00:00:47.130> so<00:00:47.670> I'm<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:47.970> to<00:00:48.030> put

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
overdoing it a bit so I'm going to put

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.880 
overdoing it a bit so I'm going to put
the<00:00:48.300> X<00:00:48.420> blender<00:00:48.810> in<00:00:48.930> parallel<00:00:49.470> mode<00:00:49.710> which

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
the X blender in parallel mode which

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.400 
the X blender in parallel mode which
means<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.340> mix<00:00:50.580> the<00:00:50.820> wah<00:00:50.970> with<00:00:51.960> my<00:00:52.140> dry

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
means I can mix the wah with my dry

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.650 
means I can mix the wah with my dry
signal<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.130> then<00:00:53.700> here's<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> old<00:00:54.360> foot

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
signal and then here's the old foot

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.560 

it's<00:01:07.170> mixed<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:08.070> know<00:01:08.220> dry<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.060> all<00:01:09.240> guitar

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
it's mixed you know dry it's all guitar

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:56.550

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.080 

that's<00:01:57.560> not<00:01:57.710> near<00:01:57.950> as<00:01:58.100> washed-out<00:01:58.520> signing<00:01:58.969> so

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
that's not near as washed-out signing so

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.609 
that's not near as washed-out signing so
it's<00:01:59.270> kind<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.450> useful<00:01:59.659> to<00:01:59.930> use<00:02:00.049> that<00:02:00.259> way<00:02:00.409> if

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
it's kind of useful to use that way if

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:01.749 
it's kind of useful to use that way if
you<00:02:00.710> want<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:00.890> kind<00:02:00.979> of<00:02:01.100> control<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.490> amount

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
you want to kind of control the amount

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.050 
you want to kind of control the amount
of<00:02:01.909> dry<00:02:02.229> with<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.740> amount<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.250> walk<00:02:04.490> when

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
of dry with the amount of walk when

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.020 
of dry with the amount of walk when
you're<00:02:05.210> playing<00:02:05.689> or<00:02:05.899> recording
