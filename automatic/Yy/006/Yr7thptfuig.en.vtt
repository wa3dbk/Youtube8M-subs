00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
really fantastic so they really didn't

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.939 
really fantastic so they really didn't
have<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.239> change<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.600> whole<00:00:57.690> lot<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:58.590> shall<00:00:58.770> see

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
have to change a whole lot we shall see

the<00:01:00.079> brushed<00:01:01.079> aluminum<00:01:01.140> cover<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
the brushed aluminum cover this is a

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.350 
the brushed aluminum cover this is a
bonded<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> magnesium<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.339> uh<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:06.180> looks

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
bonded to magnesium so it uh it looks

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.060 
bonded to magnesium so it uh it looks
really<00:01:06.600> nice<00:01:06.780> because<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.710> aluminum

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
really nice because it is that aluminum

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.140 
really nice because it is that aluminum
we'll<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.700> get<00:01:08.790> some<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
we'll see if we can get some of the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.750 
we'll see if we can get some of the
grain<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.810> might<00:01:10.799> be<00:01:10.830> hard<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> pick<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.369> and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
grain there might be hard to pick up and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.240 
grain there might be hard to pick up and
then<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.780> bonds<00:01:13.320> did<00:01:13.470> magnesium<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.100> it's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
then it's bonds did magnesium so it's

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.870 
then it's bonds did magnesium so it's
nice<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.430> tough<00:01:14.760> yeah<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.259> full<00:01:16.880> mag
