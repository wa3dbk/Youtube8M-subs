00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.350 

and<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.260> think<00:00:01.500> I'm<00:00:01.560> gonna<00:00:01.740> make<00:00:01.920> this<00:00:02.070> video

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
and I think I'm gonna make this video

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.070 
and I think I'm gonna make this video
I<00:00:03.389> took<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.350> turbo<00:00:05.279> mufflers<00:00:05.670> off<00:00:06.049> put<00:00:07.049> some

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
I took the turbo mufflers off put some

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.730 
I took the turbo mufflers off put some
Jegs<00:00:07.680> two<00:00:08.370> chambered<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.290> guess<00:00:10.290> welded

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
Jegs two chambered I guess welded

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.850 
Jegs two chambered I guess welded
mufflers<00:00:11.130> on<00:00:12.080> it's<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.170> little<00:00:13.380> louder<00:00:13.559> but<00:00:13.710> I

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
mufflers on it's a little louder but I

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.200 
mufflers on it's a little louder but I
think<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.070> sounds<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.400> lot<00:00:14.549> better<00:00:14.610> than<00:00:14.940> those

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
think it sounds a lot better than those

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.529 
think it sounds a lot better than those
I<00:00:15.809> just<00:00:16.230> didn't<00:00:16.379> like<00:00:16.470> those<00:00:16.650> turbos<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.539> they

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
I just didn't like those turbos and they

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.230 
I just didn't like those turbos and they
were<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.720> think<00:00:18.990> they<00:00:19.230> were<00:00:19.350> too<00:00:19.529> quiet<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.460> I'm

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
were I think they were too quiet so I'm

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.490 
were I think they were too quiet so I'm
in<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> garage<00:00:21.630> here<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.170> might<00:00:22.289> sound

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
in the garage here so it might sound

00:00:22.500 --> 00:01:06.080 
in the garage here so it might sound
allow<00:00:22.920> them<00:00:23.210> normal<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:27.109> it's<00:00:28.109> not<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.470> bad

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.539 

50<00:01:06.780> feet<00:01:06.960> away<00:01:07.110> from<00:01:07.259> here<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:07.979> not<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.130> at

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
50 feet away from here it's not that at

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:58.660 
50 feet away from here it's not that at
all<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.210> think<00:01:09.810> I'm<00:01:09.930> from<00:01:10.110> Missoula<00:01:10.560> goes

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.190 

hey<00:01:59.670> that's<00:01:59.939> nice<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.540> guess<00:02:00.899> all<00:02:01.110> that

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
hey that's nice I guess all that

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.350 
hey that's nice I guess all that
compression<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.920> they<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.490> big<00:02:02.970> box<00:02:03.180> like

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
compression that they like big box like

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.620 
compression that they like big box like
compression<00:02:03.689> they'll<00:02:04.079> wrap<00:02:04.350> pretty<00:02:04.710> good<00:02:05.630> so

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
compression they'll wrap pretty good so

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.850 
compression they'll wrap pretty good so
I<00:02:06.689> think<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.020> sounds<00:02:07.229> better<00:02:07.289> with<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.649> one

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
I think it sounds better with this one

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.850 
I think it sounds better with this one
so<00:02:08.390> we're<00:02:09.390> gonna<00:02:09.479> stay<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:09.899> these<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.739> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
so we're gonna stay with these get the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.500 
so we're gonna stay with these get the
tailpipes<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.640> now<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.849> might<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.060> might<00:02:12.420> be

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
tailpipes on it now it might I might be

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.580 
tailpipes on it now it might I might be
able<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.660> get<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.870> mufflers<00:02:13.200> up<00:02:13.319> underneath

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
able to get the mufflers up underneath

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.190 
able to get the mufflers up underneath
the<00:02:13.739> car<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.160> put<00:02:14.340> tailpipes<00:02:14.760> on<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.150> with<00:02:16.080> an

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
the car and put tailpipes on it with an

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.009 
the car and put tailpipes on it with an
h-pipe<00:02:16.590> nips<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.099> that<00:02:17.280> won't<00:02:17.489> be<00:02:17.610> too<00:02:17.790> bad

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
h-pipe nips and that won't be too bad

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.690 
h-pipe nips and that won't be too bad
well<00:02:19.019> maybe<00:02:19.290> if<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.769> get<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.040> done<00:02:20.220> I'll<00:02:20.400> make

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
well maybe if I get it done I'll make

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.300 
well maybe if I get it done I'll make
another<00:02:20.880> video<00:02:21.090> see<00:02:21.360> what<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.540> sounds<00:02:21.810> like

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
another video see what it sounds like

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.660 
another video see what it sounds like
okay<00:02:23.310> there<00:02:23.760> we're<00:02:24.330> all<00:02:24.360> done
