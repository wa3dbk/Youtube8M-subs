00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
of it it's a lot easier to do the second

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.569 
of it it's a lot easier to do the second
time<00:00:39.360> around<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.750> know<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.020> one<00:00:40.170> goes<00:00:40.320> off

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
time around I know this one goes off

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.010 
time around I know this one goes off
notley<00:00:41.579> they<00:00:42.059> change<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.480> out<00:00:42.600> each<00:00:42.899> one<00:00:45.020> so

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
notley they change it out each one so

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.580 
notley they change it out each one so
and<00:00:48.469> and<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.620> missed<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.920> again<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.590> basically

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
and and I missed it again so basically

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.069 
and and I missed it again so basically
it's<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.520> gotten<00:00:53.850> tougher<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.960> an

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
it's it's gotten tougher this one is an

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.720 
it's it's gotten tougher this one is an
advanced<00:00:55.410> chest<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:55.920> most<00:00:56.129> likely<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.520> got

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
advanced chest so most likely it's got
