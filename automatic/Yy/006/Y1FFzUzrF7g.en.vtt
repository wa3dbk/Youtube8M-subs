00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:03.409 

what<00:00:02.129> about<00:00:02.310> this<00:00:02.460> steel<00:00:02.730> bar<00:00:02.970> thing<00:00:03.210> I

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
what about this steel bar thing I

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.680 
what about this steel bar thing I
thought<00:00:04.020> steal<00:00:04.319> bikes<00:00:04.560> were<00:00:05.540> we're<00:00:06.540> heavy

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
thought steal bikes were we're heavy

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.500 
thought steal bikes were we're heavy
they<00:00:07.500> were<00:00:07.560> probably<00:00:08.220> in<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.760> 60s<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.360> 70s

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
they were probably in the 60s and 70s

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.470 
they were probably in the 60s and 70s
and<00:00:09.929> then<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.290> technology<00:00:10.559> just<00:00:11.360> adapted<00:00:12.360> and

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
and then the technology just adapted and

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.850 
and then the technology just adapted and
adapted<00:00:12.780> around<00:00:13.049> not<00:00:13.170> an<00:00:13.259> expert<00:00:13.559> on<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.830> but

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
adapted around not an expert on it but

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.919 
adapted around not an expert on it but
rental<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.120> think<00:00:15.480> Reynolds<00:00:15.780> are<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
rental to the I think Reynolds are the

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.140 
rental to the I think Reynolds are the
leading<00:00:16.640> manufacturer<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.670> steel<00:00:17.880> frame

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
leading manufacturer of steel frame

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.599 
leading manufacturer of steel frame
bikes<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:19.199> they<00:00:19.350> have<00:00:19.470> their<00:00:19.619> English<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.490> is

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
bikes and they have their English so is

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.310 
bikes and they have their English so is
it<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> Reynold<00:00:21.180> frame<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.810> Reynolds<00:00:22.170> frame

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
it a Reynold frame is a Reynolds frame

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.710 
it a Reynold frame is a Reynolds frame
rails<00:00:22.529> 8:31<00:00:23.160> yeah<00:00:23.400> okay<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.330> which<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
rails 8:31 yeah okay and which is the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.599 
rails 8:31 yeah okay and which is the
most<00:00:24.930> up<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.230> date<00:00:25.380> Reynolds<00:00:25.859> tubing<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.460> can

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
most up to date Reynolds tubing you can

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.900 
most up to date Reynolds tubing you can
buy<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.260> don't<00:00:28.920> think<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.310> can<00:00:29.490> get<00:00:29.640> lighter

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
buy so I don't think you can get lighter

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.770 
buy so I don't think you can get lighter
still<00:00:30.269> frame<00:00:30.480> bike<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:32.450> suppose<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.600> could

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
still frame bike I suppose you could

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780 
still frame bike I suppose you could
lighten<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.829> bit<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:35.250> some<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
lighten it a bit with some of the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.729 
lighten it a bit with some of the
components<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.630> got<00:00:36.870> fairly<00:00:37.350> topping

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
components but it's got fairly topping

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.549 
components but it's got fairly topping
components<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:38.610> well<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.200> if<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.379> want

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
components on it as well so if you want

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.110 
components on it as well so if you want
a<00:00:40.649> lighter<00:00:40.890> bike<00:00:41.190> than<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.940> buy

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
a lighter bike than this you have to buy

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.060 
a lighter bike than this you have to buy
a<00:00:43.219> carbon<00:00:44.219> fiber<00:00:44.460> frame<00:00:45.710> which<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.860> cost

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
a carbon fiber frame which have cost

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.470 
a carbon fiber frame which have cost
about<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> same<00:00:47.489> amount<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.760> money<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.329> it's

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
about the same amount of money and it's

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.090 
about the same amount of money and it's
more<00:00:48.660> brittle<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.110> harder<00:00:49.469> ride<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.010> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
more brittle or harder ride it's a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.010 
more brittle or harder ride it's a
twitchy<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.579> ride<00:00:50.789> yeah<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.149> doesn't<00:00:51.300> give<00:00:51.600> them

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
twitchy a ride yeah it doesn't give them

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.740 
twitchy a ride yeah it doesn't give them
doesn't<00:00:52.440> give<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.680> much<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.180> about<00:00:54.300> I

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
doesn't give as much so for about I

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.650 
doesn't give as much so for about I
think<00:00:55.050> man<00:00:55.410> has<00:00:55.680> got<00:00:55.860> basically<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> same<00:00:56.969> no

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
think man has got basically the same no

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.529 
think man has got basically the same no
matter<00:00:57.809> who<00:00:58.260> spend<00:00:58.760> bike<00:00:59.760> that's<00:01:00.210> carbon

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
matter who spend bike that's carbon

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.970 
matter who spend bike that's carbon
fiber<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:00.989> not<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.170> same<00:01:01.350> components<00:01:01.920> as

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
fiber it's not the same components as

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.340 
fiber it's not the same components as
mine<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.460> pretty<00:01:02.730> much<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.000> same<00:01:03.030> by<00:01:03.420> it's

fine<00:01:42.330> bye<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.870> with<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> same<00:01:43.740> components<00:01:44.370> as

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
fine bye can with the same components as

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.030 
fine bye can with the same components as
this<00:01:44.610> which<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.150> Shimano<00:01:45.480> 105<00:01:46.040> same

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
this which is like Shimano 105 same

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.790 
this which is like Shimano 105 same
brakes<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.700> gears<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.500> that<00:01:49.500> would<00:01:49.650> be

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
brakes and gears and that would be

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.300 
brakes and gears and that would be
lighter<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.150> comfortable<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.980> not<00:01:53.160> much

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
lighter and comfortable it's not much

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.980 
lighter and comfortable it's not much
with<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.640> Center<00:01:54.030> where<00:01:54.180> if<00:01:54.600> they<00:01:54.810> about

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
with that Center where if they about

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.870 
with that Center where if they about
1500<00:01:55.650> this<00:01:55.800> this<00:01:56.040> bike<00:01:56.250> could<00:01:56.400> be<00:01:56.490> about<00:01:56.640> 800

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
1500 this this bike could be about 800

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.390 
1500 this this bike could be about 800
follow<00:01:57.480> half<00:01:57.750> apart<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.650> this<00:01:59.130> K<00:01:59.280> equivalent

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
follow half apart and this K equivalent

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.970 
follow half apart and this K equivalent
by<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.210> carbon-fiber<00:02:00.750> would<00:02:01.260> be<00:02:01.380> about<00:02:01.530> 7/8

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
by can carbon-fiber would be about 7/8

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.460 
by can carbon-fiber would be about 7/8
month<00:02:02.160> or<00:02:02.310> two<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:02.970> that's<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.210> tiny<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.660> 1500

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
month or two but that's a tiny one 1500

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.610 
month or two but that's a tiny one 1500
and<00:02:05.070> make<00:02:05.220> all<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.520> way<00:02:05.580> up<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.820> about<00:02:05.940> 5<00:02:06.210> grand

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
and make all the way up to about 5 grand

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.500 
and make all the way up to about 5 grand
but<00:02:07.700> that's<00:02:08.700> ridiculous<00:02:09.149> because<00:02:09.210> once<00:02:09.450> you

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
but that's ridiculous because once you

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.420 
but that's ridiculous because once you
get<00:02:09.660> past<00:02:09.869> 1500<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.770> wouldn't<00:02:11.010> even<00:02:11.100> notice

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
get past 1500 you wouldn't even notice

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.940 
get past 1500 you wouldn't even notice
and<00:02:11.910> then<00:02:12.000> no<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.450> club<00:02:12.780> rider<00:02:13.050> there's

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
and then no like a club rider there's

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.260 
and then no like a club rider there's
such<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> subtle<00:02:14.580> difference<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.120> might

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
such a subtle difference that you might

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.580 
such a subtle difference that you might
as<00:02:15.330> well<00:02:15.390> just<00:02:15.540> go<00:02:15.690> 1,500<00:02:16.260> quid<00:02:18.440> that's<00:02:19.440> what

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
as well just go 1,500 quid that's what

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.690 
as well just go 1,500 quid that's what
I've<00:02:19.680> learned<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.100> last<00:02:20.130> couple<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.550> years

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
in 15 to 20 years and now oh really

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.540 
in 15 to 20 years and now oh really
what<00:02:28.470> would<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.830> say<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.070> still<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> last

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
what would you say it still the last

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.340 
what would you say it still the last
longer<00:02:29.850> than<00:02:30.060> carbon<00:02:30.450> fiber<00:02:30.690> yeah<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.170> does

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
longer than carbon fiber yeah it does

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.160 
longer than carbon fiber yeah it does
yeah<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:32.160> also<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.610> it's<00:02:32.850> got<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.600> headset

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170

yeah and also that it's got the headset
isn't<00:02:34.290> integrated<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.790> thing<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.120> I

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
isn't integrated so the thing that I

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.820 
isn't integrated so the thing that I
only<00:02:36.240> lost<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.930> headset<00:02:37.260> only<00:02:37.350> last<00:02:37.590> five

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
years on any bike line

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.850 
years on any bike line
yeah<00:02:39.330> if<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.540> do<00:02:39.690> enough<00:02:39.870> miles<00:02:40.110> on<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.410> your

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
yeah if you do enough miles on it your

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.970 
yeah if you do enough miles on it your
headset<00:02:41.190> pretty<00:02:41.430> much<00:02:41.610> lost<00:02:42.120> by<00:02:42.360> gears<00:02:42.709> so<00:02:43.709> if

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
headset pretty much lost by gears so if

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.280 
headset pretty much lost by gears so if
you<00:02:44.070> buy<00:02:44.220> modern<00:02:44.610> carbon<00:02:45.000> fiber<00:02:45.360> -<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.170> by

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
you buy modern carbon fiber - and by

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.740 
you buy modern carbon fiber - and by
candlelight<00:02:46.800> my<00:02:46.950> friends<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:48.390> headsets

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
candlelight my friends the headsets

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.330 
candlelight my friends the headsets
integrate<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:49.380> like<00:02:49.709> if<00:02:49.830> they<00:02:49.980> go<00:02:50.160> this

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
integrate it so like if they go this

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.890 
integrate it so like if they go this
thing<00:02:50.489> off<00:02:50.610> my<00:02:50.760> whole<00:02:50.940> graph<00:02:51.150> alright<00:02:51.660> well

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
thing off my whole graph alright well

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.030 
thing off my whole graph alright well
that<00:02:52.020> makes<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.320> big<00:02:52.440> difference<00:02:52.500> there's<00:02:53.010> a

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
that makes a big difference there's a

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.740 
that makes a big difference there's a
bike<00:02:53.220> for<00:02:53.370> life<00:02:53.520> so<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:54.209> replace<00:02:54.450> -<00:02:54.600> head

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
bike for life so you can replace - head

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.440 
bike for life so you can replace - head
senior<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.610> can<00:02:56.760> place<00:02:56.940> everything<00:02:57.300> else

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
senior and you can place everything else

go what does the I think just in case
yeah<00:03:16.990> it's<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.440> bit<00:03:17.620> like<00:03:17.710> mr.<00:03:18.130> Baran's<00:03:18.460> and

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610

I've<00:03:39.520> got<00:03:39.670> I've<00:03:39.760> got<00:03:39.790> 34<00:03:40.420> year<00:03:40.630> old<00:03:40.780> doors

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
I've got I've got 34 year old doors

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.490 
I've got I've got 34 year old doors
galaxy<00:03:41.850> and<00:03:42.850> it's<00:03:43.510> in<00:03:43.600> a<00:03:43.660> bit<00:03:43.810> of<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.960> state<00:03:44.200> but

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
galaxy and it's in a bit of a state but

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.010 
galaxy and it's in a bit of a state but
it<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.340> will<00:03:45.490> hooks<00:03:45.670> totally<00:03:46.150> fine<00:03:46.420> it's<00:03:46.630> quiet

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
it it will hooks totally fine it's quiet

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.380 
it it will hooks totally fine it's quiet
a<00:03:47.430> lot<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.490> things<00:03:48.670> have<00:03:48.760> been<00:03:48.790> replaced<00:03:49.180> but

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
a lot of things have been replaced but

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.980 
a lot of things have been replaced but
I'm<00:03:49.450> still<00:03:49.660> riding<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.050> around<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:52.510> this<00:03:52.660> is<00:03:52.840> I

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
I'm still riding it around so this is I

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.180 
I'm still riding it around so this is I
mean<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.320> suppose<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:53.650> this<00:03:53.770> could<00:03:54.010> last

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
mean the suppose that this could last

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.230 
mean the suppose that this could last
for<00:03:54.460> 34<00:03:54.760> years

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
for 34 years

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.410 
for 34 years
you<00:03:56.110> probably<00:03:56.350> want<00:03:56.800> but<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.940> galaxies<00:03:58.390> are

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
you probably want but the galaxies are

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.150 
you probably want but the galaxies are
more<00:03:58.630> robust<00:03:59.020> it's<00:03:59.260> er<00:03:59.440> it's<00:03:59.470> a<00:03:59.830> head<00:04:00.010> more

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
more robust it's er it's a head more

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.490 
more robust it's er it's a head more

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600

lights<00:04:07.810> or<00:04:08.020> invite<00:04:08.260> probably<00:04:08.650> won't<00:04:08.800> last<00:04:08.950> out

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
lights or invite probably won't last out

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.460 
lights or invite probably won't last out
for<00:04:09.489> years<00:04:09.820> but<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.570> reckon<00:04:10.930> I've<00:04:11.020> good<00:04:11.110> loss<00:04:11.290> if

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
for years but I reckon I've good loss if

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.650 
for years but I reckon I've good loss if
I<00:04:11.590> could<00:04:11.739> do<00:04:11.860> 20<00:04:12.160> years<00:04:12.190> on<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.120> copter<00:04:13.420> it

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
I could do 20 years on the copter it

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.840 
I could do 20 years on the copter it
probably<00:04:14.440> replaced<00:04:14.800> it<00:04:14.980> in<00:04:15.130> other<00:04:15.459> gears<00:04:15.700> and

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
probably replaced it in other gears and

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.970 
probably replaced it in other gears and
the<00:04:15.940> bikes<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:16.480> the<00:04:16.810> headset<00:04:17.200> mm-hmm<00:04:17.770> I'll

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
the bikes and the headset mm-hmm I'll

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.590 
the bikes and the headset mm-hmm I'll
still<00:04:18.220> have<00:04:18.370> this<00:04:18.520> frame<00:04:18.820> it's<00:04:19.180> amazing

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
still have this frame it's amazing

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.930 
still have this frame it's amazing
because<00:04:20.010> imagine<00:04:21.010> anything<00:04:21.669> that's<00:04:21.820> gonna

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
because imagine anything that's gonna

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.060 
because imagine anything that's gonna
last<00:04:22.210> all<00:04:22.780> in<00:04:22.990> tarney's<00:04:23.380> all<00:04:23.530> in<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.710> final

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
last all in tarney's all in the final

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.070 
last all in tarney's all in the final
frames<00:04:24.280> worth<00:04:24.460> like<00:04:24.669> 500<00:04:25.000> quid<00:04:25.450> mm-hmm<00:04:25.960> and

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
frames worth like 500 quid mm-hmm and

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.000 
frames worth like 500 quid mm-hmm and
then<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.590> components<00:04:27.100> are<00:04:27.190> worth<00:04:27.310> about<00:04:27.430> 300

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
then the components are worth about 300

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.980 
then the components are worth about 300
you<00:04:29.190> just<00:04:29.370> place<00:04:29.640> all<00:04:29.790> those<00:04:30.060> over<00:04:30.300> every<00:04:30.780> 10

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
you just place all those over every 10

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.280 
you just place all those over every 10
years<00:04:32.300> unless<00:04:33.300> you<00:04:33.450> mind<00:04:33.630> I'll<00:04:33.750> give<00:04:33.960> you<00:04:34.140> one

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290

the front and nine on the back so had 27
gears<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.880> this<00:04:51.030> has<00:04:51.150> got<00:04:51.270> two<00:04:51.450> on<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.600> front

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720

and ten on the back of you there's only

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.090 
and ten on the back of you there's only
got<00:04:53.400> 20<00:04:53.820> but<00:04:54.360> it's<00:04:54.510> a<00:04:54.600> lighter<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:55.650> what<00:04:56.040> you

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
got 20 but it's a lighter and what you

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.190 
got 20 but it's a lighter and what you
call<00:04:56.220> a<00:04:56.280> compact<00:04:56.760> gear<00:04:57.300> set<00:04:57.570> so<00:04:57.720> these<00:04:58.020> are

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
call a compact gear set so these are

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.110 
call a compact gear set so these are
really<00:04:58.380> close<00:04:58.710> together<00:04:58.950> mmm<00:04:59.580> it's<00:05:00.030> really

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
really close together mmm it's really

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.410 
really close together mmm it's really
compact<00:05:00.780> so<00:05:01.590> you<00:05:01.680> get<00:05:01.830> really<00:05:02.130> subtle<00:05:02.670> gear

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
compact so you get really subtle gear

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.130 
compact so you get really subtle gear
changes<00:05:03.980> and<00:05:04.980> you<00:05:05.640> don't<00:05:05.850> need<00:05:06.060> 27<00:05:06.600> gears<00:05:06.810> it's

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
changes and you don't need 27 gears it's

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.660 
changes and you don't need 27 gears it's
really<00:05:07.410> about<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.740> rain<00:05:07.950> just<00:05:08.250> fill<00:05:08.430> out<00:05:08.490> how

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
really about the rain just fill out how

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.430 
really about the rain just fill out how
many<00:05:08.730> so<00:05:09.150> okay<00:05:09.420> they've<00:05:09.750> they've<00:05:10.080> managed<00:05:10.380> to

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
many so okay they've they've managed to

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.870 
many so okay they've they've managed to
give<00:05:10.650> you<00:05:10.740> quite<00:05:10.950> right<00:05:11.220> with<00:05:11.490> it<00:05:11.580> with<00:05:11.760> this

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
give you quite right with it with this

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.390 
give you quite right with it with this
cognate<00:05:12.330> this<00:05:12.450> cog<00:05:12.770> mmm<00:05:13.800> that's<00:05:13.950> what<00:05:14.160> bigger

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
cognate this cog mmm that's what bigger

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.250 
cognate this cog mmm that's what bigger
that's<00:05:14.610> quite<00:05:14.850> smaller<00:05:15.180> sure<00:05:15.420> and<00:05:16.020> so<00:05:16.140> you've

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
that's quite smaller sure and so you've

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.980 
that's quite smaller sure and so you've
got<00:05:16.380> just<00:05:16.590> as<00:05:16.710> good<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.890> range<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:18.750> it<00:05:18.870> got

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
got just as good a range and it got

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.480 
got just as good a range and it got
really<00:05:19.200> subtle<00:05:19.710> clicks<00:05:19.980> when<00:05:20.220> you<00:05:20.280> change

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
really subtle clicks when you change

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.460 
really subtle clicks when you change
gears<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:21.120> compact<00:05:21.600> so<00:05:22.020> I've<00:05:22.320> actually

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
gears and compact so I've actually

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.460 
gears and compact so I've actually
waited<00:05:23.070> about<00:05:23.220> three<00:05:23.730> months<00:05:24.180> until<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.290> new

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
waited about three months until the new

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.320 
waited about three months until the new
model<00:05:26.280> came<00:05:26.460> out<00:05:26.580> because<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:26.970> know<00:05:27.030> it<00:05:27.210> was

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
model came out because I know it was

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.270 
model came out because I know it was
gonna<00:05:27.480> have<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:27.870> 28<00:05:28.470> compacts

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
gonna have the 28 compacts

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.280 
gonna have the 28 compacts
I'm<00:05:30.030> sure<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:30.360> gears<00:05:30.570> is<00:05:30.840> that<00:05:31.020> that's<00:05:31.170> the

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
I'm sure the gears is that that's the

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.550 
I'm sure the gears is that that's the
most<00:05:31.500> vital<00:05:31.950> thing<00:05:32.160> isn't<00:05:32.370> it<00:05:35.570> is<00:05:36.570> that<00:05:36.870> do

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
most vital thing isn't it is that do

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.530 
most vital thing isn't it is that do
that<00:05:37.740> need<00:05:38.220> to<00:05:38.370> be<00:05:38.400> get<00:05:38.760> worn<00:05:38.970> I<00:05:39.240> mean<00:05:39.420> if

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
that need to be get worn I mean if

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.570 
that need to be get worn I mean if
you're<00:05:39.660> writing<00:05:39.930> it<00:05:40.170> all<00:05:40.410> the<00:05:40.590> time<00:05:40.800> would<00:05:41.460> it

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
you're writing it all the time would it

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.430 
you're writing it all the time would it
be<00:05:41.700> that<00:05:41.880> the<00:05:42.090> gears<00:05:42.330> would<00:05:42.720> that<00:05:42.930> last<00:05:43.200> two

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
be that the gears would that last two

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.280 
be that the gears would that last two
years<00:05:43.800> neither<00:05:44.040> lost<00:05:44.400> for<00:05:44.900> ages<00:05:45.930> oh<00:05:46.110> really

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
years neither lost for ages oh really

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.770 
years neither lost for ages oh really
sure<00:05:46.590> exactly<00:05:46.680> how<00:05:47.220> long<00:05:47.370> but<00:05:47.430> they<00:05:48.420> lost<00:05:48.660> they

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
sure exactly how long but they lost they

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.420 
sure exactly how long but they lost they
probably<00:05:48.960> outlive<00:05:49.260> the<00:05:49.380> headset<00:05:49.770> oh<00:05:50.010> really

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
probably outlive the headset oh really

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.460 
probably outlive the headset oh really
yeah<00:05:51.180> Leslie<00:05:51.480> kind<00:05:51.750> of<00:05:51.840> damage<00:05:52.140> unless<00:05:52.350> you

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
yeah Leslie kind of damage unless you

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.710 
yeah Leslie kind of damage unless you
want<00:05:52.650> to<00:05:52.740> knock<00:05:52.950> this<00:05:53.220> and<00:05:53.460> damage<00:05:53.730> it<00:05:53.940> these

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
want to knock this and damage it these

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.930 
want to knock this and damage it these
bits<00:05:55.110> of<00:05:55.200> technology<00:05:55.380> aren't<00:05:55.830> amazing<00:05:56.580> lane

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
bits of technology aren't amazing lane

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.690 
bits of technology aren't amazing lane
though<00:05:57.210> they're<00:05:57.510> so<00:05:57.800> over<00:05:58.800> the<00:05:58.920> last<00:05:59.040> 60<00:05:59.460> years

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
though they're so over the last 60 years

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.490 
though they're so over the last 60 years
so<00:05:59.970> much<00:06:00.180> ingenuity<00:06:00.750> has<00:06:01.020> gone<00:06:01.170> into<00:06:01.290> this

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
so much ingenuity has gone into this

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.340 
so much ingenuity has gone into this
technology<00:06:01.770> of<00:06:02.070> these<00:06:02.220> bits<00:06:02.460> in<00:06:02.670> that<00:06:03.170> you<00:06:04.170> can

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
technology of these bits in that you can

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.020 
technology of these bits in that you can
get<00:06:04.530> one<00:06:04.680> I've<00:06:04.920> got<00:06:04.980> one<00:06:05.280> at<00:06:05.430> home<00:06:05.550> in<00:06:05.730> a<00:06:05.820> bag

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
get one I've got one at home in a bag

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.660 
get one I've got one at home in a bag
that's<00:06:06.360> about<00:06:06.720> 30<00:06:07.080> 30<00:06:07.920> years<00:06:08.220> old

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
that's about 30 30 years old

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.910 
that's about 30 30 years old
a<00:06:08.700> Korean<00:06:09.120> yellow<00:06:09.510> one<00:06:09.780> and<00:06:09.990> I<00:06:10.170> had<00:06:10.500> it<00:06:10.590> fitted

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
a Korean yellow one and I had it fitted

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.530 
a Korean yellow one and I had it fitted
to<00:06:11.070> an<00:06:11.160> old<00:06:11.280> bike<00:06:11.520> about<00:06:11.730> two<00:06:12.060> years<00:06:12.180> going<00:06:12.420> it

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
to an old bike about two years going it

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.240 
to an old bike about two years going it
worked<00:06:12.750> perfect<00:06:13.410> that's<00:06:13.560> amazing<00:06:13.830> because<00:06:14.100> I

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
worked perfect that's amazing because I

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.950 
worked perfect that's amazing because I
would<00:06:14.400> have<00:06:14.520> thought<00:06:14.640> the<00:06:14.850> gears<00:06:15.090> were<00:06:15.420> you

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
would have thought the gears were you

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.530 
would have thought the gears were you
know<00:06:16.110> it's<00:06:16.260> so<00:06:16.380> delicate<00:06:17.090> yeah<00:06:18.090> and<00:06:18.390> either

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
know it's so delicate yeah and either

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.600 
know it's so delicate yeah and either
the<00:06:18.930> technology<00:06:19.170> by<00:06:19.800> technologies<00:06:20.280> all<00:06:20.430> been

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
the technology by technologies all been

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.630 
the technology by technologies all been
in<00:06:20.760> here<00:06:20.970> mmm<00:06:21.770> so<00:06:22.770> over<00:06:22.980> the<00:06:23.100> last<00:06:23.250> 60<00:06:23.610> years

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
in here mmm so over the last 60 years

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.430 
in here mmm so over the last 60 years
been<00:06:23.940> a<00:06:23.970> hell<00:06:24.180> a<00:06:24.210> lot<00:06:24.450> this<00:06:24.810> the<00:06:25.080> front<00:06:25.260> bit

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
been a hell a lot this the front bit

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.600 
been a hell a lot this the front bit
hasn't<00:06:25.620> changed<00:06:26.190> me

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
hasn't changed me

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.250 
hasn't changed me
this<00:06:27.120> technology's<00:06:27.660> that<00:06:27.960> hasn't<00:06:28.110> really

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
this technology's that hasn't really

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.460 
this technology's that hasn't really
moved<00:06:28.680> and<00:06:29.670> this<00:06:29.850> is<00:06:30.060> I<00:06:30.180> have<00:06:30.300> so<00:06:30.510> much<00:06:30.690> R&amp;D<00:06:31.290> is

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
moved and this is I have so much R&amp;D is

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.080 
moved and this is I have so much R&amp;D is
going<00:06:31.770> go<00:06:31.980> to<00:06:32.010> that<00:06:32.460> mmm<00:06:32.910> it's<00:06:33.480> amazing<00:06:33.600> big

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
going go to that mmm it's amazing big

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.760 
going go to that mmm it's amazing big
that's<00:06:37.090> pretty<00:06:37.300> much<00:06:37.420> it<00:06:37.480> min<00:06:37.810> the<00:06:37.900> bikes<00:06:38.140> the

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
that's pretty much it min the bikes the

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.260 
that's pretty much it min the bikes the
brakes<00:06:39.040> and<00:06:39.220> everything<00:06:39.520> else<00:06:39.640> and<00:06:39.790> are<00:06:40.030> as

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
brakes and everything else and are as

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:47.520 
brakes and everything else and are as
they<00:06:40.480> were<00:06:40.510> no<00:06:41.260> I<00:06:41.530> think<00:06:43.770> a<00:06:44.820> lot<00:06:45.820> of<00:06:45.850> my<00:06:46.530> looking

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
they were no I think a lot of my looking

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.560 
they were no I think a lot of my looking
very<00:06:47.710> simple<00:06:48.100> it's<00:06:48.820> all<00:06:48.910> integrated<00:06:49.180> to<00:06:49.540> the

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
very simple it's all integrated to the
