America I was really interested in the
open-plan<00:00:48.160> design<00:00:48.370> because<00:00:49.300> it<00:00:49.660> reflected

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
open-plan design because it reflected

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.549

ordinary<00:01:02.679> things<00:01:03.100> of<00:01:03.250> life<00:01:03.460> like<00:01:04.210> sharing<00:01:04.540> a

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
ordinary things of life like sharing a

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.930 
ordinary things of life like sharing a
meal<00:01:04.720> together<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:06.010> that<00:01:06.310> was<00:01:06.430> reflected<00:01:06.640> in

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
meal together so that was reflected in

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.700 
meal together so that was reflected in
high<00:01:07.090> that<00:01:07.300> say<00:01:07.450> their<00:01:07.600> dining<00:01:07.960> spaces<00:01:08.290> would

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710

be made really special

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.630 
be made really special
I<00:01:10.200> believe<00:01:11.200> that<00:01:12.030> how<00:01:13.030> we<00:01:13.090> choose<00:01:13.479> to<00:01:13.750> live<00:01:13.930> is

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
I believe that how we choose to live is

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.240 
I believe that how we choose to live is
very<00:01:15.640> much<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:15.909> reflection<00:01:16.180> on<00:01:16.990> our<00:01:17.680> personal

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
very much a reflection on our personal

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.210 
very much a reflection on our personal
vision<00:01:18.820> of<00:01:19.030> life<00:01:19.329> for<00:01:20.229> my<00:01:20.320> own<00:01:20.470> house<00:01:20.710> here<00:01:21.100> at

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.980 
vision of life for my own house here at
the<00:01:21.340> origami<00:01:21.700> guys<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.860> have<00:01:24.430> an<00:01:24.579> idea<00:01:24.700> that<00:01:25.360> the

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
the origami guys I have an idea that the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.780 
the origami guys I have an idea that the
house<00:01:26.439> would<00:01:26.619> be<00:01:26.770> like<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:27.009> little<00:01:27.310> grouping<00:01:27.670> of

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
house would be like a little grouping of

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.870 
house would be like a little grouping of
coffee<00:01:28.000> dress<00:01:28.360> around<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.320> old<00:01:29.470> Dan<00:01:29.710> but<00:01:30.640> when

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
coffee dress around the old Dan but when

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.730 
coffee dress around the old Dan but when
you<00:01:30.970> came<00:01:31.149> round<00:01:31.360> inside<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.200> house<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:32.619> then

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
you came round inside the house and then

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.679 
you came round inside the house and then
towards<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.369> garden<00:01:33.549> and<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.030> fields<00:01:34.509> that

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
towards the garden and the fields that

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.649 
towards the garden and the fields that
it<00:01:35.619> would<00:01:35.799> really<00:01:35.979> open<00:01:36.100> up<00:01:36.549> and<00:01:36.759> be<00:01:36.939> this

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
it would really open up and be this

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.899 
it would really open up and be this
amazing<00:01:38.079> glassy<00:01:38.950> house<00:01:39.159> that<00:01:39.430> embraced<00:01:39.759> the

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
amazing glassy house that embraced the

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.469 
amazing glassy house that embraced the
landscape<00:01:40.450> I<00:01:40.689> was<00:01:41.140> actually<00:01:41.500> brought<00:01:41.710> up<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:42.280> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
landscape I was actually brought up in a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.380 
landscape I was actually brought up in a
1960s<00:01:43.479> envelope<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:44.560> what<00:01:45.250> I<00:01:45.460> loved<00:01:45.969> about<00:01:46.180> it

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
1960s envelope and what I loved about it

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.830 
1960s envelope and what I loved about it
was<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.079> sense<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.680> us<00:01:48.219> as<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.490> family<00:01:48.840> really

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
was the sense of us as a family really

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.749 
was the sense of us as a family really
living<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:50.409> sharing<00:01:50.770> life<00:01:51.159> together

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
living and sharing life together

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.690 
living and sharing life together
for<00:01:52.329> instance<00:01:52.630> my<00:01:52.840> own<00:01:52.960> house<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:54.310> have<00:01:54.490> four

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
for instance my own house we have four

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.580 
for instance my own house we have four
cooks<00:01:55.000> not<00:01:55.420> just<00:01:55.689> one<00:01:55.899> cook<00:01:56.170> in<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.439> kitchen

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
cooks not just one cook in the kitchen

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.700 
cooks not just one cook in the kitchen
so<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:58.000> kitchen<00:01:58.390> has<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.750> be<00:01:58.840> designed<00:01:59.020> that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
so the kitchen has to be designed that

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.039 
so the kitchen has to be designed that
we<00:01:59.799> can<00:01:59.950> all<00:02:00.100> work<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.880> entertain<00:02:01.810> together

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
we can all work and entertain together

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.700 
we can all work and entertain together
in<00:02:02.619> that<00:02:02.920> open<00:02:03.399> and<00:02:03.520> free<00:02:03.880> way<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:05.020> way<00:02:05.170> I<00:02:05.200> make

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
in that open and free way the way I make

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.930 
in that open and free way the way I make
modern<00:02:06.009> houses<00:02:06.609> feel<00:02:06.939> homely<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:09.640> look<00:02:09.820> at

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
modern houses feel homely is to look at

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.840 
modern houses feel homely is to look at
the<00:02:10.030> broad<00:02:10.270> spectrum<00:02:10.570> of<00:02:11.110> design<00:02:12.010> for<00:02:12.730> me

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
the broad spectrum of design for me

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.720 
the broad spectrum of design for me
personally<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:14.290> think<00:02:14.650> materials<00:02:15.370> are<00:02:15.550> very

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
personally I think materials are very

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.620 
personally I think materials are very
important<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.390> how<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.660> make<00:02:16.840> it

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
important to how to make it

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.930 
important to how to make it

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
I feel homely I used a lot of juror

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.090 
I feel homely I used a lot of juror
