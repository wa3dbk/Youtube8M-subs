with<00:06:01.360> a<00:06:01.389> passport<00:06:02.849> this<00:06:03.849> isn't<00:06:04.150> the<00:06:04.330> best

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
with a passport this isn't the best

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.330 
with a passport this isn't the best
example<00:06:05.110> because<00:06:05.320> i'm<00:06:05.530> showing<00:06:05.860> you<00:06:05.919> within<00:06:06.190> a

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
video within a screen but let me open up

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:10.710 
video within a screen but let me open up
blend<00:06:09.520> and<00:06:09.669> then<00:06:09.789> it<00:06:09.909> you<00:06:10.060> can<00:06:10.210> get<00:06:10.360> a<00:06:10.389> quick

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
blend and then it you can get a quick

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.029 
blend and then it you can get a quick
understanding<00:06:11.050> of<00:06:11.409> how<00:06:11.530> it<00:06:11.680> works<00:06:11.830> and<00:06:11.949> you

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 
understanding of how it works and you

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.589 
understanding of how it works and you
first<00:06:12.280> boot<00:06:12.430> it<00:06:12.580> up<00:06:12.669> so<00:06:13.000> it's<00:06:13.150> searching<00:06:13.449> for

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
first boot it up so it's searching for

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.810 
first boot it up so it's searching for
the<00:06:13.659> passport<00:06:13.870> connected<00:06:14.590> it's<00:06:15.159> loading<00:06:15.699> the

the passport connected it's loading the
dashboard<00:06:16.270> and<00:06:16.590> that<00:06:17.590> pops<00:06:17.830> up<00:06:18.039> and<00:06:18.220> nicely

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
dashboard and that pops up and nicely

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.290 
dashboard and that pops up and nicely
comes<00:06:18.970> out<00:06:19.150> here<00:06:19.479> so<00:06:20.080> what<00:06:20.710> you<00:06:20.830> can<00:06:20.979> do<00:06:21.220> is<00:06:21.580> if

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300

then you reply back and forth nothing

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.330 
then you reply back and forth nothing
too<00:07:08.660> special<00:07:08.930> but<00:07:09.380> it's<00:07:09.560> so<00:07:09.890> convenient

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
too special but it's so convenient

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.950 
too special but it's so convenient
because<00:07:10.820> you<00:07:11.000> get<00:07:11.090> the<00:07:11.210> little<00:07:11.360> toast<00:07:11.690> in<00:07:11.900> the

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
because you get the little toast in the

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.500 
because you get the little toast in the
bottom<00:07:12.200> right<00:07:12.350> corner<00:07:12.380> and<00:07:12.920> you<00:07:13.120> can<00:07:14.120> reply<00:07:14.480> to

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:14.510 
bottom right corner and you can reply to

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.830 
bottom right corner and you can reply to
them<00:07:14.840> without<00:07:15.170> having<00:07:15.590> to<00:07:15.650> use<00:07:15.740> your<00:07:15.860> phone<00:07:15.920> I

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 
them without having to use your phone I

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.890 
them without having to use your phone I
think<00:07:17.840> that<00:07:18.170> is<00:07:18.410> a<00:07:18.440> pretty<00:07:19.160> quick<00:07:19.660> overview<00:07:20.660> of

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:20.900 
think that is a pretty quick overview of

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.650 
think that is a pretty quick overview of
everything<00:07:21.380> that<00:07:21.890> you<00:07:21.950> can<00:07:22.040> do<00:07:22.220> with<00:07:22.250> it

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.660 
everything that you can do with it

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.620 
everything that you can do with it
