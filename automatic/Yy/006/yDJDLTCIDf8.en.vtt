00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 Hello everyone, so welcome to me 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.940
 channel day more good then as you see in the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.900
 title and I bring you a hall with a 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.679
 web page called info 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.240
 you know those Chinese websites and nothing 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.460
 receive the package I think it's the order 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.900
 in mid-November receive package 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.029
 December 20 but I've caught it 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.560
 now because it was already in Spain which 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.279
 it made me eternal or does it mean 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.630
 worked a lot considered but good I 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.220
 In fact, I already thought he was lost 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.320
 and I say that to me you've forgotten me already 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.769
 what I had asked for but good 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.320
 Fortunately it has come and he has 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:38.870
 there was one thing that has not convinced me 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.760
 completely but not by the store but 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.030
 because it's okay but well do what 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.199
 I tell the first thing that will teach you 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.879
 with has nothing to do with clothes or 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.650
 with makeup or things like that is something 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.119
 I needed 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.920
 and I took it because they also have their 

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:55.970
 part of house things and others and good 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.070
 I make you a little introducing because 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.500
 I have taken it and it is because I am very 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.790
 blind already you know if you have but instagram 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.900
 that if you do not have me but it will be before 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.610
 He left all the links in social networks 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.060
 in the information box as always 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.650
 and good yes yes tucked in grass condition 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.720
 seen hours or have seen some video 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.370
 which is the fast vaccine because it is 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.800
 very blind I have a lot of myopia 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.550
 then I see it 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.590
 I used to wear a digital watch, not because 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.180
 I liked it just because of the fact 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.460
 that had light then at night 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.710
 who woke up could have it now if 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.650
 I do not need a huge clock to see the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.960
 plan to see the time and it's what I 've 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.540
 done to see what time this is 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.860
 that the fun and the good thing is that good 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.070
 I did not know until tonight 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.690
 unforeseen that has a super dim light 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.580
 then you can see it now to anyone 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.950
 which is super good and then apart 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.360
 if it does not have light it is a very clock 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.280
 simple means you do not have much 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.840
 story but I needed and I 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.240
 I took it for that all new because it has 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.909
 the temperature the alarm date 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.009
 obviously and the time to say a 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.360
 watch me free but I needed that 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.880
 Well then, sir, because what 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.729
 I ordered another one of the things is also a 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.259
 clock and that in fact me when I asked 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.700
 I thought it was a discovery and 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.820
 has come to madrid and I do not see for all 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.760
 sides the difference that there I saw it for 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.620
 15 euros and this does not cost for each 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.260
 fifteen euros take her to the same position 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.670
 I'm going to teach you, let's go, I'm telling you 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.070
 who apparently you are now maris 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.830
 all sides and I did not know then I have in 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.130
 this model 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.950
 Well, it's like a leather has 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:34.580
 four or five strips the clock and then 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.680
 well what a leather strip is 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.150
 braided the other are braided are 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.470
 three shelves of zones between them and 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.230
 then then another one with a kind of 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.820
 beads and a leaf that hangs in the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.080
 very good palace and I tell you to think 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.400
 bad big discovery to do 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.760
 not because I 'm in France, I have not 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.500
 seen but here is in madrid is in 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.090
 toxic so press it I took it the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.740
 truth is that very happy with him 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.140
 like it very much needs several I say no 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.760
 as soon as I took them digitally 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.230
 broke and I need that for the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.690
 exams because if you do not pass the time 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.920
 I do not know what he will do then this one 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.950
 it seemed a very good option 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.080
 I am also teaching everything 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.940
 all the things that I am teaching the 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.739
 I will leave in the information box the 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.840
 links so you can see him a little bit 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.580
 more in depth I will teach you 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.680
 Now the thing that I tell you that has not 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.050
 liked not because it is not good but 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.209
 because it does not fit me and it's this skirt 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.390
 you can see on the screen is this 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.880
 skirt that the truth is that I 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.440
 it seems beautiful what happens is that there 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.640
 than to be a country that as you already know 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.700
 that comment that fattened a bit 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.810
 then he entered but it is bad but good 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.190
 so I hope that when I go back to 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.560
 gaza if I go back to the gazar I do not 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.360
 come into my life I will enter I will enter and I 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.959
 it will be fine and I will like it but 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.830
 I promise it's fine I'm going to say 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.940
 back pants and I think that 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.220
 it would be like that, history plus nothing 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.540
 it would be 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.220
 on the other hand after I received another 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.720
 T-shirt that here was one thing that 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.090
 it caught my attention it seems beautiful to me 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.090
 it's super good there are a few I want 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:06.790
 convince everything is not bad but not what 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.790
 I saw in the picture then these things 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.440
 is this shirt to see what is the 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.019
 straight 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.620
 this is for me mushroom is long sleeve 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.660
 As you can see, this part is lace 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.760
 transparent everything is transparent - the 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.280
 front part that has a lining 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.260
 below then they teach us what 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.040
 I already tell you that I have left precious 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.450
 does this mean it stays that way 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.070
 the structure of the shoulders and remains 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.940
 set out 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.770
 this is like tulle and it adapts to your 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.240
 shoulders but I tell you that it does not have very 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.270
 well because this is what I mean in the 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.000
 image I did not see it and I understand and I 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.430
 I imagine that it could be cut off from 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.420
 some way and in fact I think I'm going 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.440
 to do because I think it's a vision 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.570
 superior and it is here and I tell you that 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.740
 put is not so bad the thing is that 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.000
 I do not understand why you're there then 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.640
 I do not know if it's because he's doing the 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.200
 function that the flowers are 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.290
 they are perfectly flat and remain 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.000
 well or that then I sure is 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.580
 It looks beautiful and already has very good with 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.189
 size 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.900
 but this did not still get the point 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:14.430
 I do not know if it is like this software 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.009
 It is obviously like that but I want to say 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.979
 I do not know if it is so that this does not lose the 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.110
 ok but I do not know but they look good and 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.240
 is set that yes that means already 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.349
 finally another one that is my favorite the 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.479
 leave personal because it's really my 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.479
 favorite and this is 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:34.219
 has I love the texture of the fabric 

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:38.889
 it will be very bad what you want but I 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:38.889
 love the texture of the fabric and it's like that 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.740
 it is assumed that this part with this is 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.990
 for the front 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.319
 but the chest part and in the sleeve 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:52.930
 he also has these as well as broken is 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:55.150
 pretty long I tried it on and it flips me 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.120
 how is it stays very tight but 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.160
 I do not know how to say it 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.440
 is very tight and I tell you that the 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.750
 Fabric is super soft and fits super 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.070
 well and the subject of the details these me 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.210
 I like that it is foolish to do 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.820
 T-shirt means you do not have much 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.740
 mystery but I already tell you that I like 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.740
 very much how is it 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.900
 so nothing these are the little things that 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:23.020
 I missed the raw news tell you that 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.430
 I have another request that I have to 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.860
 come from another website also from 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.860
 this style that 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.629
 I flipped a lot all the things that 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.500
 he told me in some other video I think 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:37.629
 but eye they have things very little pimp 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.500
 that is very cool 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:43.680
 the things 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.630
 but the truth is that great things in 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.870
 the skirt is not a shame because 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.970
 I tell you that I find it super pretty 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:53.030
 but I do not know if you see the 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:55.580
 dimensions but they have shown that 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.680
 it seems for a girl and then this 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.240
 it stretches a lot but it reaches a point in 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.890
 the one that no matter how much you stretch 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.040
 just as nice then how I was 

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.140
 first of all 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.790
 but good if I can advance then what 

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.380
 I will comment so none of this has been 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.670
 the video I hope you liked it and 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.670
 see you next video
