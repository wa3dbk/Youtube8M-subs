00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.650
 fun 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.270
 we have 8 special stages our participants 32 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.270
 kilometer afraid of fighting 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.699
 this is currently the only thing 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.699
 decision 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.870
 In speed more excitement adrenaline 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.870
 full speed I think 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.270
 when motor racing enthusiasts have nothing to do 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.340
 motor sports fans are depressed and this is a minus 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.920
 and whether there might want to where it should not 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.340
 and this is not only a minus but many penalties 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.110
 we are on the Cup 17 is a plus and so far unique 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.660
 and this is not only a plus but a solid

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.330
 format 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.509
 interesting for a man who is already 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:21.430
 survived survived this amateur stage 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:23.380
 sprint when a lot of participants when 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.080
 set up and wait for your arrival 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.780
 when it is either standard tire options 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.780
 urban or nails in this format 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.450

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.610
 Immediately attracted the attention of all arrived 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.340

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.759
 participants and let them melt this

 Alexander died city of Ekaterinburg 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.549
 Well , let me remind you again Malinin Alexander 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.549
 After all , the phone is already a year old 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.690
 they 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.200
 knew it equals 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.200
 and the other 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.250
 The main thing in rubber is one for all 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.349
 and issued on equal terms to all 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.629
 participants just before the races so that 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.060
 eliminate the possibility and the slightest 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.860
 the finalization of the manushyan implies 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.560
 the same size all yes that is 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.840
 In this case, the size was selected from 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.879
 a certain class of car dates in 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.250
 In this case, 225 45 17 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.620
 performance on cold at work 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.730

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.730
 Sweden is going to a fig not 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.709
 This is no longer a civilian, usually Yashin, but 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.730
 still not extreme with nails 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.980
 sports middle ground 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.500
 safe for transmission civil 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.450
 car yes yes you heard it right in 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.670
 one standings at the start can be seen 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.520
 combat eric and absolutely that is 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.550
 absolutely civil audi and even 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.860
 rear wheel drive band but unique on the cup 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.720
 so that it brings together participants who 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.850
 in ordinary official competitions 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.239
 never cross well first 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.040
 civilian cars with audi a5 how there 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.799
 or a4 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.109
 BMW basically does not get sports 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.370
 competitions and reveal serial 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.370
 cars without modifications 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.080
 by the way the pilot is also the situation on 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.299
 start and famous racers with experience and 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.299

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.530
 new patch and. 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.030

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.430
 interesting cars are collected in one place 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:35.050
 everything is fast and dynamic and very good 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.050

 start-finish start-finish 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.570
 and again the start of the race came out extremely 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.170
 dynamic one day each of 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.380

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.210
 the result of each special sections offset 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.390
 judging system rally rights to 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.430
 error no idea is more than entitled to 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.500
 be a good hold compared to 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.750
 civil rubber plus some 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.750
 equalization is car performance 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:20.630

 I don't know yet 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.460
 I think it will justify one hundred percent here 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.490
 driving level only 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.040
