00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
same side because then I could build a

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.940 
same side because then I could build a
sliding<00:02:25.480> dock<00:02:25.810> but<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.290> didn't<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:26.650> whatever

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
so the answer the question that I was

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.400 
so the answer the question that I was
wondering<00:02:29.410> for<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.560> long<00:02:29.680> time<00:02:29.890> is<00:02:31.230> does<00:02:32.230> it

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
wondering for a long time is does it

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.950 
wondering for a long time is does it
hook<00:02:32.530> up<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.770> dual<00:02:32.920> monitors<00:02:33.370> Lenovo<00:02:34.330> said<00:02:34.720> no

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
hook up to dual monitors Lenovo said no

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.840 
hook up to dual monitors Lenovo said no
and<00:02:35.290> they<00:02:35.770> were<00:02:35.800> right<00:02:36.100> because<00:02:36.520> it<00:02:36.640> doesn't

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
and they were right because it doesn't

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.000 
and they were right because it doesn't
hook<00:02:36.910> up<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.150> two<00:02:37.300> monitors<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:38.440> hooks<00:02:38.800> up<00:02:38.980> to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
hook up to two monitors it hooks up to

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.860 
hook up to two monitors it hooks up to
three<00:02:39.370> monitors<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:41.050> here<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:42.510> let<00:02:43.510> me<00:02:43.630> just

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
and scrolling just fine and let's try

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.490 
and scrolling just fine and let's try
all<00:04:27.680> three<00:04:27.950> at<00:04:28.040> once<00:04:28.070> oh<00:04:28.900> we<00:04:29.900> are<00:04:30.080> getting<00:04:30.440> a

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
all three at once oh we are getting a

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.830 
all three at once oh we are getting a
bit<00:04:30.620> of<00:04:30.770> lag<00:04:30.980> here<00:04:31.400> on<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.730> Jimmy<00:04:31.940> Kimmel<00:04:32.150> well

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
for a moment I think it lagged so let me

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.470 
for a moment I think it lagged so let me
put<00:04:35.240> all<00:04:35.330> three<00:04:35.600> at<00:04:35.810> once<00:04:35.840> oh<00:04:37.030> you<00:04:38.030> know<00:04:38.300> what

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480

that wasn't like that was actually the

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.920 
that wasn't like that was actually the
this<00:04:40.490> is<00:04:40.610> actually<00:04:40.700> a<00:04:40.880> bad<00:04:41.090> video<00:04:41.360> to<00:04:41.570> demo

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
dumb or not you can see it's plain as

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.880 
dumb or not you can see it's plain as
they<00:04:48.530> pause<00:04:48.770> it<00:04:49.010> but<00:04:49.760> so<00:04:50.510> anyways<00:04:50.870> so<00:04:51.770> the

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
they pause it but so anyways so the

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.080 
they pause it but so anyways so the
answer<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:52.190> question<00:04:52.490> is<00:04:52.640> it<00:04:52.850> works

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090
