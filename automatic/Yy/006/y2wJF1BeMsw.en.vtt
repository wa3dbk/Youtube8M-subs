00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
the first season of Dexter is one of the

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.020 
the first season of Dexter is one of the
best<00:02:04.450> seasons<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:05.079> television<00:02:05.590> that<00:02:06.219> exists

best seasons of television that exists

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.499 
best seasons of television that exists
and<00:02:07.289> I<00:02:08.289> mean<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.649> was<00:02:08.799> so<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:09.850> good<00:02:10.119> I<00:02:10.149> think

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
that I think the first two seasons were

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.910 
that I think the first two seasons were
based<00:02:12.760> on<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.450> books<00:02:13.720> I'm<00:02:14.049> not<00:02:14.350> entirely<00:02:14.709> sure

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
this show was fantastic everything with

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.280 
this show was fantastic everything with
his<00:02:42.890> brother<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.610> his<00:02:43.820> dad<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.450> really<00:02:44.840> loved

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
his brother and his dad I really loved

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.760

the<00:02:45.890> backstory<00:02:46.490> that<00:02:46.660> existed<00:02:47.660> in<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.530> first

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
the backstory that existed in the first

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.370 
the backstory that existed in the first
I<00:02:49.100> guess<00:02:49.370> two<00:02:49.820> seasons<00:02:50.240> of<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.390> show<00:02:50.480> now<00:02:51.170> it's

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
I guess two seasons of the show now it's

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.200 
I guess two seasons of the show now it's
kind<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.680> you've<00:02:52.490> learned<00:02:52.850> everything<00:02:53.060> about

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.390 
Dexter so the first two seasons are my

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
really disturbing and really good

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.910

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.460 
I just loved all of his backstory the
plot<00:03:04.130> of<00:03:04.310> those<00:03:04.490> seasons<00:03:05.080> was<00:03:06.080> really

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
plot of those seasons was really

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.690 
plot of those seasons was really
interesting<00:03:06.950> good<00:03:07.130> especially<00:03:07.400> with<00:03:07.580> the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
interesting good especially with the

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.660 
interesting good especially with the
brother<00:03:07.940> but<00:03:08.450> I<00:03:08.870> loved<00:03:09.740> the<00:03:09.890> backstory<00:03:10.430> more

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
brother but I loved the backstory more

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.490 
brother but I loved the backstory more
than<00:03:10.880> any<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.840> battery<00:03:12.260> was

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
than any of that the battery was

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.040 
than any of that the battery was
incredibly<00:03:13.220> interesting<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:13.970> I<00:03:14.360> loved<00:03:14.930> that

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
incredibly interesting and I loved that

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.840 
incredibly interesting and I loved that
I<00:03:15.440> kind<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.070> talked<00:03:16.250> about<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.520> first<00:03:16.700> and

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
I kind of talked about the first and

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.390 
I kind of talked about the first and
second<00:03:17.270> season<00:03:17.540> in<00:03:17.780> one<00:03:18.140> there<00:03:18.440> but<00:03:18.710> the<00:03:18.740> the

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
second season in one there but the the

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.160 
second season in one there but the the
second<00:03:19.670> season<00:03:19.940> is<00:03:20.000> really<00:03:20.330> good<00:03:20.510> as<00:03:20.630> well<00:03:20.660> I

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
second season is really good as well I

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.810 
second season is really good as well I
think<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.680> first<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.070> second<00:03:22.310> season<00:03:22.550> are

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
think the first and second season are

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.780 
think the first and second season are
the<00:03:23.060> best<00:03:23.300> of<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.840> show<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:25.250> third<00:03:25.400> seasons

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
the best of the show the third seasons

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.910 
the best of the show the third seasons
weaker<00:03:26.630> but<00:03:26.870> I<00:03:27.020> don't<00:03:27.170> hate<00:03:27.350> it<00:03:27.380> as<00:03:27.620> much<00:03:27.650> as

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
weaker but I don't hate it as much as

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.230 
weaker but I don't hate it as much as
some<00:03:28.100> people<00:03:28.130> did<00:03:28.490> I<00:03:28.520> hear<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:28.820> people

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
some people did I hear that people

I<00:03:31.970> didn't<00:03:32.810> have<00:03:32.930> a<00:03:32.960> problem<00:03:33.170> with<00:03:33.320> it<00:03:33.440> but<00:03:33.530> I

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
I didn't have a problem with it but I

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.500 
I didn't have a problem with it but I
was<00:03:33.740> also<00:03:33.980> watching<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.510> back-to-back

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
was also watching it back-to-back

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.690 
was also watching it back-to-back
because<00:03:36.440> I<00:03:36.650> watched<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.010> first<00:03:37.220> two<00:03:37.310> seasons

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
because I watched the first two seasons

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.980 
because I watched the first two seasons
on<00:03:37.820> Netflix<00:03:38.300> because<00:03:38.450> they<00:03:38.690> had<00:03:38.840> them<00:03:38.930> on

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
on Netflix because they had them on

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.990 
on Netflix because they had them on
Netflix<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:39.500> that's<00:03:40.460> how<00:03:40.610> I<00:03:40.640> found<00:03:40.790> out<00:03:40.940> about

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
Netflix and that's how I found out about

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.970 
Netflix and that's how I found out about
the<00:03:41.210> show<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:42.200> then<00:03:42.350> they<00:03:42.440> didn't<00:03:42.710> have<00:03:42.740> the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
the show and then they didn't have the

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.980 
the show and then they didn't have the
third<00:03:43.220> or<00:03:43.520> fourth<00:03:44.030> or<00:03:44.270> I<00:03:44.420> think<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.780> fourth

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
third or fourth or I think the fourth

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.600 
the first the second and the fourth
season<00:04:38.270> are<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.990> best<00:04:39.470> in<00:04:39.770> my<00:04:40.100> opinion<00:04:40.490> even

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
season are the best in my opinion even

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.820 
season are the best in my opinion even
at<00:04:40.880> this<00:04:40.940> point<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:42.020> fifth<00:04:42.290> season<00:04:42.500> was<00:04:42.800> the

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
at this point the fifth season was the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.310 
at this point the fifth season was the
weakest<00:04:43.370> of<00:04:43.520> them<00:04:43.669> all<00:04:43.850> in<00:04:44.090> my<00:04:44.120> opinion<00:04:44.330> even

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
weakest of them all in my opinion even

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.159 
weakest of them all in my opinion even
to<00:04:45.440> this<00:04:45.530> point<00:04:45.800> I<00:04:46.040> think

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
to this point I think

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.510 
to this point I think
this<00:04:47.319> season<00:04:47.620> was<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.770> first<00:04:48.069> season<00:04:48.249> that<00:04:48.460> I

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
this season was the first season that I

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.850 
this season was the first season that I
had<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:48.759> watch<00:04:48.909> week<00:04:49.210> to<00:04:49.360> week<00:04:49.509> and<00:04:49.749> I<00:04:50.590> didn't

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
had to watch week to week and I didn't

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.439 
had to watch week to week and I didn't
enjoy<00:04:50.979> it<00:04:51.249> as<00:04:51.370> much<00:04:51.550> because<00:04:51.699> I<00:04:52.029> don't<00:04:52.180> like

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
enjoy it as much because I don't like

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:53.820 
enjoy it as much because I don't like
watching<00:04:52.689> shows<00:04:53.080> week<00:04:53.259> to<00:04:53.379> week<00:04:53.469> I'd<00:04:53.620> prefer

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
watching shows week to week I'd prefer

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.010 
watching shows week to week I'd prefer
to<00:04:54.009> just<00:04:54.189> watch<00:04:54.430> them<00:04:54.460> all<00:04:54.759> once<00:04:55.060> but<00:04:55.689> so<00:04:55.900> this

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
to just watch them all once but so this

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.570 
to just watch them all once but so this
is<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:56.259> first<00:04:56.469> time<00:04:56.710> I<00:04:56.740> was<00:04:56.949> watching<00:04:57.099> the

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
sixth season when Dexter gets caught

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.040 
sixth season when Dexter gets caught
that's<00:05:51.159> what<00:05:51.490> I<00:05:51.520> wanted<00:05:52.089> I<00:05:52.330> think<00:05:52.509> they<00:05:52.899> should

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
that's what I wanted I think they should

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.589 
that's what I wanted I think they should
have<00:05:53.080> done<00:05:53.199> that<00:05:53.500> in<00:05:53.680> the<00:05:53.860> fifth<00:05:54.099> season

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
have done that in the fifth season

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.200 
have done that in the fifth season
I<00:05:55.659> hated<00:05:56.199> the<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:57.009> kind<00:05:57.189> of<00:05:57.250> cop-out<00:05:57.729> ending

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
I hated the the kind of cop-out ending

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.600 
I hated the the kind of cop-out ending
where<00:05:58.719> you<00:05:59.680> know<00:05:59.740> they<00:06:00.009> were<00:06:00.069> hidden<00:06:00.399> behind

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
where you know they were hidden behind

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.839 
where you know they were hidden behind
the<00:06:01.089> the<00:06:01.539> screen<00:06:01.930> and<00:06:02.289> so<00:06:02.439> when<00:06:03.009> when<00:06:03.580> Deb

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
the the screen and so when when Deb

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.570

comes<00:06:04.180> down<00:06:04.860> into<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:05.949> basement

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
comes down into the basement

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.850

way<00:07:05.289> I<00:07:05.319> viewed<00:07:05.589> television<00:07:06.309> and<00:07:06.539> now<00:07:07.539> because

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:07.689 
way I viewed television and now because

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:09.749 
way I viewed television and now because
it<00:07:07.839> was<00:07:07.899> the<00:07:08.019> best<00:07:08.259> show<00:07:08.439> ever<00:07:08.889> or<00:07:09.579> anything

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 
it was the best show ever or anything

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:12.299 
it was the best show ever or anything
but<00:07:10.209> I<00:07:10.449> was<00:07:10.809> you<00:07:10.989> know<00:07:11.110> 14<00:07:11.409> or<00:07:11.619> something<00:07:12.009> when

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:12.309 
but I was you know 14 or something when

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:13.979 
but I was you know 14 or something when
when<00:07:12.610> I<00:07:12.639> watched<00:07:12.999> the<00:07:13.149> first<00:07:13.269> season<00:07:13.419> but<00:07:13.869> I

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:13.989 
when I watched the first season but I

00:07:13.989 --> 00:07:15.959 
when I watched the first season but I
hadn't<00:07:14.289> seen<00:07:14.439> good<00:07:14.739> television<00:07:15.519> until<00:07:15.909> I

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:15.969 
hadn't seen good television until I

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.389 
hadn't seen good television until I
watched<00:07:16.209> Dexter<00:07:16.659> so<00:07:17.139> it<00:07:17.829> changed<00:07:18.189> the<00:07:18.279> way<00:07:18.369> I

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:18.399 
watched Dexter so it changed the way I

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:21.209 
watched Dexter so it changed the way I
viewed<00:07:18.699> television<00:07:19.239> and<00:07:19.619> I've<00:07:20.619> named<00:07:20.919> Dexter

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:26.019 
the whole series I mean it's it's

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:28.289 
the whole series I mean it's it's
fantastic<00:07:26.289> all<00:07:26.949> around<00:07:27.279> it's<00:07:27.819> had<00:07:27.969> its<00:07:28.119> weak

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:28.299 
fantastic all around it's had its weak

00:07:28.299 --> 00:07:29.999 
fantastic all around it's had its weak
points<00:07:28.689> but<00:07:28.989> those<00:07:29.289> weak<00:07:29.439> points<00:07:29.709> were<00:07:29.799> still

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:30.009 
points but those weak points were still

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:31.229 
points but those weak points were still
better<00:07:30.219> than<00:07:30.429> a<00:07:30.489> lot<00:07:30.669> of<00:07:30.699> other<00:07:30.879> things<00:07:31.179> that

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:31.239 
better than a lot of other things that

00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:33.239 
better than a lot of other things that
were<00:07:31.419> on<00:07:31.539> television<00:07:32.050> so<00:07:32.529> I<00:07:32.559> mean<00:07:32.919> they<00:07:33.009> always

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:33.249 
were on television so I mean they always

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:35.879 
were on television so I mean they always
kept<00:07:33.519> me<00:07:33.669> watching<00:07:34.059> I've<00:07:34.599> been<00:07:34.929> thoroughly

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:35.889 
kept me watching I've been thoroughly

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:38.790 
kept me watching I've been thoroughly
entertained<00:07:36.339> with<00:07:36.489> Dexter<00:07:36.879> and<00:07:37.059> I<00:07:37.899> love<00:07:38.619> the

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 
entertained with Dexter and I love the

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.319 
entertained with Dexter and I love the
show<00:07:38.979> I<00:07:39.219> think<00:07:39.369> that's<00:07:39.639> the<00:07:39.759> end<00:07:39.909> for<00:07:40.149> this

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:40.329 
show I think that's the end for this

00:07:40.329 --> 00:07:42.329 
show I think that's the end for this
video<00:07:40.749> but<00:07:41.259> I'm<00:07:41.499> gonna<00:07:41.649> do<00:07:41.829> a<00:07:41.860> review<00:07:42.069> on
