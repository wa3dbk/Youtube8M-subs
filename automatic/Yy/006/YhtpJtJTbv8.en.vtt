00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.280
 in my second anime leadership would like 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.679
 I as a word has to introduce online 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.820
 sport has online includes 25 follow motive 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:20.630
 24 minutes run in the story 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.970
 around the young tomcat tariq ali alias kiri 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.179
 An online role-playing game called Word 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.679
 online plays smart has online is not 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.230
 ordinary roleplaying 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.039
 it is a so-called on Murphy 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.420
 and comes straight into the game world 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.219
 however, there is no possibility 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.840
 auszuloggen from the game again without 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.230
 the spout button is located in the menu 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.510
 is as kean etro noticed that 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.559
 it has just disappeared 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.210
 already too late 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:52.219
 a game of life and death begins 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.190
 Anime I really liked until the 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.219
 follow 15 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.449
 then not anymore 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.960
 I do not want to spoil that for you now 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.449
 That's why I'm not saying why now 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.689
 the anime sequence 15 no longer liked 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:14.479
 has only one says the tension leaves 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:16.759
 Norm after all, I still hope 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.530
 a continuation of the series since me 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.310
 just that good impression of the 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.200
 could forget the first 15 follow the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.600
 sign that was first class and the 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.549
 music as well as the character design has me 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.409
 also very good though klitschko 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.200
 a bit into the clichÃ© of a 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.649
 typical hero field and a little 08 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.689
 15 about it comes in consideration that 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.439
 the anime up to the half really great 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.180
