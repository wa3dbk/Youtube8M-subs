00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.639
 the power of prayer 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.750
 Have you ever felt the management 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.969
 live with someone and you just 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.810
 put in a list and spoke 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:23.130
 I prayed for him later or someone ever 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:28.650
 called me and told me you are can pray 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:32.550
 for one pays attention to this story 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.850
 the missionary told this story with 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.700
 a lot of emotion when passing through your 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:45.600
 church in the state of michigan in the states 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:49.230
 united while I was serving a small 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.350
 hospital in africa every two weeks 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.770
 I was going to bike in the middle of the jungle. 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.780
 to a nearby town to buy 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:05.040
 was a two-day journey and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.030
 it was necessary to camp at night in half 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.090
 of the way 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.200
 in one of these days I arrived in the city 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.619
 where he planned to withdraw the money in the bank 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.650
 I also needed to buy there 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:23.130
 medicines and some other provisions 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.340
 After the shopping I needed 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.310
 started two days of 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.820
 I'm going back to the hospital. 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.869
 when I arrived in the city I observed two 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.690
 men and one of them had been 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.000
 seriously happy 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.060
 I tried to deal with his injuries 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.380
 and at the same time I spoke of the love of 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.180
 jesus christ 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:55.440
 I traveled then both tiring and long 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:59.910
 days camping at night I just arrived 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:03.000
 my house without incident 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.900
 two weeks later I had to repeat 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.320
 the same journey when I arrived in the city 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.330
 was aborted by that young man 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.000
 whose wounds 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.820
 I had treated him he told me that he knew 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.940
 that I took money and food 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:25.290
 He further said that he and some friends 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:28.770
 they went to the jungle knowing I was going to 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:33.000
 kampar somewhere at night said that 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.690
 planned to kill me and take the money and 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.750
 other provisions I was carrying 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:43.980
 but he told me that just when 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:48.980
 were going to attack my camp saw that 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.420
 I was protected by 26 quarters 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.930
 heavily armed 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.760
 Then I started to laugh and he said that 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.190
 He was definitely alone in the 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.070
 camp in the middle of that jungle 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.700
 young man pointed towards me and 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:09.300
 You told me no, sir, not you. 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:13.230
 I was alone because I saw the saved ones. 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.600
 there and gave five friends also saw them 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.600
 we hired you 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.260
 on behalf of these guards taught us 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.100
 frightened and let go we were 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.970
 though 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.030
 when the missionary 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.180
 returned to the United States and one of 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.960
 his sermons he told this fact one of the 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.060
 men of the church stood up 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.970
 interrupted the message and asked if the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.610
 missionary could be exactly in 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.340
 What day did this happen? 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.430
 the missionary told the congregation the day 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.090
 and then the man he 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:57.640
 interrupted began counting the following 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:02.470
 fact of the night of his 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.110
 It was here in the morning and I was 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.450
 preparing for a given 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:11.830
 commitment was leaving home when 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:15.400
 I felt the need to pray for you to 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.190
 fact the urgency the touch of the Lord was 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.030
 so strong in me that they call several 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.000
 church men to meet 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.160
 exactly in the sanctuary so that 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.240
 intercede for you and know of 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.990
 one thing 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.419
 I wanted to ask at the moment and all the 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.260
 men who will meet with me in that 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:41.800
 day when we pray for you if 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.820
 standing at that moment then all 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.979
 men who will gather that day 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.260
 started to stand up and one 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:55.630
 missionary who was surprised when 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:05:04.350
 that man started counting them or 23 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:04.350
 Act 5 at last was 26 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.990
 this story is an incredible example of 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:16.070
 how God's spirit can move 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:20.750
 is a great lesson in how much our 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:23.810
 prayers can have a great effect on 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:27.889
 any times and places 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:31.610
 do not forget, prayer is not the only one 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:36.110
 thing you can do but it's the biggest 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.100
 thing you should do when the man 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.660
 works 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:49.600
 He works but when the time man is 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:49.600
 God who works on one knee
