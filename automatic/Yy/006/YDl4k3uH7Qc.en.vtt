00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.630
 and 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.100
 hello to all guys I'm south english let's go 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.320
 with a new combat 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.150
 this time chosen that is sixth combat 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.759
 because you see clearly all different 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.820
 of team one that uses a strategy 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.070
 based on booster in turning and mine 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.779
 that I just have a pokémon that 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.460
 it's anti booster is a little common that 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.470
 cancel those pokemon that start at you 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.750
 I would do it to you because I would make you post 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.880
 there are beings that are spear sword agility 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.850
 all that is worth everything was pushed all that 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.460
 makes it look for the pokemon to get better 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.949
 his stats not good lately 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.260
 you are going to see many type pokemon 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.929
 sinister type ghost type poison in 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.059
 my team because I have chosen to play with 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:49.089
 my favorites and my three favorite types 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.679
 are those sinister phantom poison by 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.329
 what are you going to see different pokemon from 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:56.409
 those guys at rally I also like 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.989
 specialize in those three pokemon and 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.789
 I want to be let's say very good that 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.589
 we can whatever it is that does not go 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.870
 to lose I have never told you a thousand times 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.729
 that you have to waste some time 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.770
 Perfect does not exist in pokémon for here 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.390
 it's normal to miss but yes I 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.720
 like to lose with my favorites or 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.300
 win 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.560
 as favorites however I'm not going to 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.120
 always have the same ones do not vet 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.010
 always the 6 type pokemon without this 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.720
 ghost poison the same on my team 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.400
 although there are two that I love them so much that they are 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.780
 of the pgje nor have but the others 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.060
 four can be varying better I have 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.650
 water dance changes to the fart at best 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.060
 web theme findep between change other pokemon 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.760
 and charisma type wifi function 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.810
 sinister etcetera vale guys I hope 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.510
 that you like enjoy with me every 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.010
 combat and now we go with the combat 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.710
 it touched me against such a ricky was 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.000
 trying just trying the team 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.980
 sinister and proving that in functions 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.750
 can I do with each pokemon or what 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.790
 strategy to make one with each other 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.990
 not the day to try you know guys 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.760
 that in time without this ghost poison 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.290
 there's a lot of pokemon you should catch them to 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.810
 all but if to my favorite those that more 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.690
 I like them and here I started 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.640
 cheating again with with zero garc 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.350
 thinking that the wifi because use used 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.840
 a pokémon that affects the psychic and 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.160
 I said in the above video is because 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.320
 inform us the affects the psychic 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.640
 then they would hit him a type attack 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.110
 fight a little more defensively than you 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.720
 supposed to be wifi then I take advantage 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.860
 to deceive him to put machination is what 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.300
 what it does is get on the skill of 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.430
 momentum and now we know the whole world 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.870
 know ninjas because you know that 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.400
 use the relay this 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.440
 how do you know it's only worth it for this 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.019
 to get dances to make impulse 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.370
 protection to start swelling to 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.560
 then the next pokemon to come out 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.569
 I blow all the equipment but for 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.310
 that you have to have a defensive for that 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.349
 always when we can join the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.909
 and gmb we only do the pokemon in a 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.069
 time you do not ask me always 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.959
 I put functions from the function that 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.849
 given aguaciles the defensive the stop 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.280
 to this case of pokemon for those who go 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.200
 to try to go out and kill you all 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.390
 team but I was calm in 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.810
 again do substitute huelva yo yo 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.370
 I follow flamethrower with zoroark and me 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.599
 because I let steal because I had 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.010
 flamethrower in all this and I was going to 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.720
 remove the substitute all the time here 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.640
 is the substitute until I even 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.470
 as yet not expected climbs 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.090
 defenses only about the speed and 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.590
 the attack even expected me 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.940
 did the relay because when doing 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.459
 I was going to hit him at least one 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.349
 blow is what I wanted to do the relay 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.390
 with substitute tucked but I do not 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.209
 he left he wanted to leave a substitute 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.709
 planted everything and take over 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.480
 but I did not let him treat me and 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.890
 removed a substitute like that at least and 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.959
 he does the relay and the next one comes out 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.880
 pokemon I have it easy is not a good one 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.319
 pulse night a flamethrower would have 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.480
 eaten safe 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.489
 as you see again the same thing is the only thing 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.530
 that makes that impulse impulse impulse I 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.840
 I'm calm , nothing happens, I still have 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.280
 five the camera and says now that it's 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.930
 already planted with machination in the field 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.819
 do not get nervous about him 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.499
 follow me a motive that ends 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.209
 wrong and change instead of using relay 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.379
 I do not know how we got to kill 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.760
 obviously the balls also because 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.849
 I thought he was going to stay in the country 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.069
 ninjas the only thing that gets almost not what 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.139
 he gets hit a hit with 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.879
 flamethrower and it does not take away so much life me 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.379
 I had wrong he has to use 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.389
 relay what it does is change pokemon 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.980
 that camera noticing I do not know what I do not know what 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.409
 So I was pretending the truth but good to me 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.760
 It's great for me, not that it's wrong 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:03.219
 element a paranormal and took me away 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.109
 killing over for me and I told 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.669
 a thousand times I had only fulfilled when a 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.199
 pokémon is loaded to another for me has already 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.569
 fulfilled I will not fulfill its function be 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.459
 ninjas again and I will do protection 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.500
 to upload their at least speed 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.560
 for one with momentum 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.370
 and I was 750 boy reaches already greater been 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.490
 I was stubborn and my failures were before 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.590
 that did not let my pokemon die or 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.480
 will weaken and change pokemon 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.520
 lately I do not do it simply the 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.380
 pokemon that goes out to the field 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.320
 directly to die I do not say it like that 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.910
 I prefer is I never prefer to kill him 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.770
 that does not change pokemon to change 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.320
 to see if it works for me this strategy 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.550
 and give him a turn to have step if 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.020
 I'm with flamethrowers and I'm going 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.750
 well I have loaded a little monkey with 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.520
 ninja is almost dead I'm still in pain 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.770
 is going well with the strategy for 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.360
 what to change if the thing is going well not 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.550
 others have to do the same thing for sure 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.780
 protect not matter what order is 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.730
 doing is getting up to speed all 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.560
 all the while in suspension of the 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.690
 speed and attack good now yes that 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.220
 He makes over and will take out a little 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.470
 I did not know I was going to do this 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.020
 principle of combat and I did not know no 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.370
 nothing happens here we wait for pokemons 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.370
 of this because we are going very 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.600
 fashionable that we can sinister water and not 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.070
 I know if they catch me in my heart I think 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.120
 that not for the very famous thing that is 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.400
 doing now because it has breaks 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.330
 obviously I do not know if he pulled out 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.340
 nothing and look guys here psychic 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.620
 yes while wifi is drying because it's going to 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.569
 start making physical attacks and wifi 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.810
 They looked set what just hold 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:33.270
 with dances panda got into the rival and 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.430
 there he returns to make another spear sword he 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.530
 up the attack by four guys within 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.180
 is for this to observe will-o'-the-wisp 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.580
 we lower physical attack to half of 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.250
 entry to create the burning already I have 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.039
 removed remains i do not care i have / what 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.889
 burning is burned by one logically he 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.120
 will again strike a disarm that I no longer know 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.129
 what use do you have to use attack 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.400
 stronger because here is the object and 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:58.080
 level level clarifies this attack comes out very 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.729
 few with very few times and the 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.659
 characteristics move to your state 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.370
 original 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.409
 all that agility that has gone up that 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.509
 speed and uploaded with Indian all 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.520
 attacks has come up with Indians and now 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:10.500
 they climbed two for again it has returned 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.990
 to zero is not worth it at all clear fog 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.240
 is to annoy the pokemon booster 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.370
 it's object you use very little object weights 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.949
 it's attacks use very few times but 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.560
 when it is used, it saves us, it does not save and here 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.000
 he just saved me that end has come out 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.279
 removed all the bostero that has been thrown 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.480
 the rival and just loaded charged like 

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:29.520
 hit physics 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.560
 and now he has quill ninjas 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.790
 One touch makes a relay because it does not have 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.400
 they do not know what to do because neither 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.830
 is for that is your sacrifice pokemon 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.150
 let's say to bet all the equipment and 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.360
 What he does is die, he has nothing left 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.190
 with girls fear and this fight what 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.630
 taught more than anything guys so that 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.180
 You see the difference between a team 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.520
 the difference of other equipment the use of 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.930
 sacrifice to ninjas to bet on their 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.700
 another two pokemon one is light physics 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.170
 but all kind of flu has a 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.690
 very big mistake that we do not use 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.340
 relay with the first pokemon but I think 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.530
 that he did not care because the only thing that 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.020
 got up has been getting on the attack 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.210
 physical then if you use the relay as 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.610
 Such dances are not worth anything to him 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.780
 tecos to the relay and camera that now as 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.750
 he has done it in the second in the second 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.920
 turn not the second time with girls in the 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.990
 different equipment so you can see that 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.480
 you can spend in many strategies in 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.890
 pokémon the like above uses vale 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.330
 use that they do but of course there was not the 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.490
 use for nothing is beginning to be done 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.890
 seen now the same guy that by the way 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.570
 I just saw a lot of westin 2 already a lot 

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.670
 well three or four before you could not see 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.500
 you are never seeing three or four 

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.289
 like to see variety of pokemon 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.729
 OK 

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:36.520
 so you see the equipment difference 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:39.219
 guys or we like friend santi busters 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.869
 and that's why he managed to win guys 

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:42.219
 I hope you liked the battle or 

00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:44.710

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:47.469
