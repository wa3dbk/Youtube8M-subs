00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.150
 make up the two big titles 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.179
 favorites tus koblenz against harmony 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.379

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.300
 but also for cash 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.520
 The winner of the Rhineland Cup starts 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.020
 in the dfb cup a home game against the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.480
 bavaria or against dortmund would be one 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.039
 warm monetary blessing trier inside one before 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.480
 the concord is currently cup winner 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.580
 wants to defend the title 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.650
 the tus the year before in round two 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.540
 in upper winter failed mid-march 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.649
 Both teams met at the same place 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.260
 the league to each other 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.760
 At that time, Koblenz won with 1 0 views 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.410
 We start with the start formation 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.940
 The teams in the gate with factory 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.440
 Vollborn and one in comparison to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.780
 four-chain with bartsch softic marx and

 captain gentner on the solo 6 michael 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.430

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.649
 Scherer salto hadzic and lan only 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.239
 Storm peak patrick stump concord 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.649
 Trier had the defeat in 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.449
 koblenz changed the coach 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.760
 the new jens jaw on the sideline 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.680
 played with the following lineup 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.470
 lengsfeld in the gate before in the 4 2 3 1 system 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.439
 the ex-koblenz bender hollmann buchner 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.689
 and bridge before 26 with green and art 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.880
 in the middle field "scalla anton and 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.030
 Abelski the ball possession to the second 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.830
 striker was next to com marius as it 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.689
 then it should go first 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.979
 too colorful for the impartial of the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.869
 Waited until the thigh fans themselves 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.270
 had abated passion yes 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.159
 bengalos and smoke bombs one the old one 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.960
 song then finally played football 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.119
 it was already rewarded by the tus 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.680
 after 21 minutes kevin lahn with the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.110
 go for it solo and also with the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.180
 perfect conclusion flat in the corner the 1 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.790
 0 went according to plan for the shackles 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.280
 in front of around 200 fans from trier many of 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.079
 They arrived a good 20 minutes late and 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.630
 so punctually to zero 2 1 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.090
 a total of 1978 spectators on the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.850
 oberwerth koblenz in half one clear 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.049
 better still completely absent 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.030
 Defensive left the harmony to the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.549
 but not hits from the penalty area 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.920
 it was not too offensive 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.969
 unless you invited them 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.439
 misunderstanding at the tus then that 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.969
 foul maybe over one 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.759
 standard danger radiate 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.420
 alon abelski that would be more dangerous 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.580
 when it actually was in the end 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.680
 Halftime Koblenz had everything under control 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.599
 Trier needed another wake up call and 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.860
 there was probably of trainer pine because 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.440
 the half acted the harmony 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.150
 much more pleasing in a game in 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.980
 It never got any hotter 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.260
 really unfair but you could feel it here 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.970
 What are the odds now? 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.980
 both sides the best but the bag 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.690
 Patrick had blunt mistakes 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.190
 at the guests in the game structure and then 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.900
 goes blunt alone on keeper lars field 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.690
 to flip whatever 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.849
 main thing purely no a few centimeters 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.160
 Missing right past looked for goal 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.930
 but was not bitter on the 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.459
 opposite side battery now offensively not 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.730
 only more pleasant on the way but also 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.799
 successful steven kröner full dry 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.440
 not undeserved one to one in 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.269
 minute 71 at the latest now it was a 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.670
 open pokalfight with best chances 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.660
 on both sides but no further 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.150
 gates to the end of the regular 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.920
 playing time so half an hour on top 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.930
 get everything out again 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.580
 for exactly these extra minutes had it 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.690
 at the tus last weekend 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.310
 some players spared 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.870
 now they wanted one for themselves 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.030
 reward courageous performance 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.950
 but also in two times 15 minutes should 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.810
 no further gates fall though it 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.400
 gave chances on both sides more than 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.230
 actually in the 90 minutes before 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.940
 Coblenz should have made a goal 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.700
 Trier should have made a goal 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.370
 but remained until the final whistle after 120 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.049
 minutes at 1 1 a look at the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.540
 honorary tribune tus president werner hecker 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.920
 breathe hope it would be so 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.959
 important in the race for the cup too 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.450
 stay in the race for a place in the dfb 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.910
 cupped penalty shoot trier met 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.590
 the tus also until andré marx the constant 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.900
 lottery from the point against andreas 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.489
 Lengsfeld lost bitterly it was the 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.390
 preliminary decision for the concord 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.390
 kept his nerves 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.620
 alon abelski 5 3 in penalty shoot-out in 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.820
 the sum 6 to 4 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.260
 the guests made the jump into the 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.390
 semi-final in a match at eye level 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.459
 the pendulum would have the same in the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.380
 other direction can rejoice 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.780
 bitter tears at the tus 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.519
 Michael stole about the exemplary fighter 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.850
 here on the oberwerth against the 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.709
 hertha aus berlin 2010 from 61 meters the 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.389
 Tor of the year scored the dream of 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.910
 a repeat burst on 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.290
 Wednesday night game think where both 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.510
 Teams have invested everything 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.090
 were pokal we celebrated that we all 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.820
 required 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.320
 and just so bitter that we do not 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.720
 have been rewarded for our great 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.070
 fight for our time and now have to 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.199
 We are looking for the drive market there 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.370
 upright 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.250
 unfortunately one must be the one then 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.060
 shoots and there you can not 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.320
 make accusation 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.120
 I think I can only be proud of 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.440
 what we achieved and performance 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.360
 Use of the tour is only 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.900
 just the result no longer vote 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.720
 to the game 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.449
 that was advertising for tus koblenz that was 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.760
 a great football game with the 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.760
 Lucky winner in the end, we 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.740
 had in the first 90 minutes the 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.510
 opportunities to decide the game 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.620
 We also had worked out 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.050
 more passion more readiness to run 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.970
 Presented to the day we are proud of the 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.780
 team 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.830
 the title will be played without us but 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.820
 life goes on and now you have to 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.830
 we see that we are in the regionalliga 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.990
 earn points after we get the first 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.400
 half time completely stood next to us 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.870
 I have to say we have the 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.639
 second half finally started 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.260
 to play then we have into play 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.550
 Bite eat properly football 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.710
 played earned the compensation made 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.880
 and after the compensation, I think so 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.080
 a completely open game 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.180
 that could have been in both directions 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.889
 go out and we stop in the 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.200
 penalty shoot out the happier end 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.490
 and have to join my team 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.539
 Compliments make after the weak 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.310
 first half like you then 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.050
 Trier rejoices in 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.880
 koblenz and will soon be completely in the 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.280
 close again cheer the cup semi-final 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.169
 on the 23rd of april , sg mülheim kärlich 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.240
 a game that is pretty accurate 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.220
 a year in the quarterfinals gave at that time 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.740
 won the concord with 60 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.070
 Trier is now the big favorite 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.070
 the cup victory
