00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:29.320
 You drank and rays knocked out of information to 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:31.540

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.410
 good rally is unlikely to fall out principle 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.800
 we were limited to anyone not light but 86 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.120
 which is worth nothing and inform of 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.060

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.340
 Bovary emblems show that you are them 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.560
 rem to which we adjust it they 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.960
