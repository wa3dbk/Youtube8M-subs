00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:11.940
 Hello everyone, specially for the participants 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.190
 site drive2.ru my followers who 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.390
 asked a question about the quality of light 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.520
 after installing bi-xenon lenses 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.730
 shooting this video because I think that some 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.420
 video can be shown more than 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:30.000
 the whole is simply not and scribbling means 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.450
 the light of these bi-xenon lenses 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.540
 that's how far we see from the left side 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.890
 there is an even light on the right side 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.520
 light and in front there a little bit of 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.020
 distorted 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.829
 distorted the regiment which is there in the very 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.710
 there is 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.449
 because i'm shining 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.059
 put the right lens a little higher 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.809
 left and accordingly there is a shelf 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.800
 with a step I will leave the car now 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.800
 be a little better to be seen 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.119
 this color is not through the windshield 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.130
 the color is just awesome 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.170
 near forward shine about twenty meters 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.930
 five at least 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.770
 probably even 30 when I traveled with 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.930
 halogen komi 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.259
 the maximum that I saw before myself is 10 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:33.130
 meters, respectively , the reaction time 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:36.360
 there was almost no color left 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.360
 of these lenses 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.720
 I don't know why for some reason now when 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.570
 shooting video right headlight at all somehow 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.320
 the color is really green 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.320
 snow white 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.780
 such 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.140
 such 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.140
 shine 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:16.030
 like this bi-xenon lamps and beating on 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.210
 neighbor so those who have not yet decided on 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.570
 install bi - xenon advise you not to delay 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.150
 because because the difference is so much 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.750
 colossal after halogenok what words 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.570
 it's just not to convey that's probably all 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.110
 if you have questions write to lichku write 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.650
 in the comments answer all questions 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.650
 thank you all bye
