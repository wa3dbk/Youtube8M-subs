00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.799 

very

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.270 

so<00:00:10.809> my<00:00:10.960> theory<00:00:11.260> with<00:00:11.469> this<00:00:11.590> shovel<00:00:11.740> tail

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
so my theory with this shovel tail

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.470 
so my theory with this shovel tail
I<00:00:12.309> believe<00:00:12.850> they<00:00:12.969> float<00:00:13.209> because<00:00:13.299> they're

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
I believe they float because they're

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.940 
I believe they float because they're
always<00:00:13.600> on<00:00:13.809> the<00:00:13.900> surface<00:00:14.260> I<00:00:14.440> think<00:00:14.830> they<00:00:14.920> just

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
always on the surface I think they just

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.850 
always on the surface I think they just
float<00:00:15.340> along<00:00:15.960> like<00:00:16.960> a<00:00:16.990> like<00:00:17.290> a<00:00:17.320> piece<00:00:17.560> of<00:00:17.590> wood

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
float along like a like a piece of wood

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.440 
float along like a like a piece of wood

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
crabs looking for a place to hide they

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.519
