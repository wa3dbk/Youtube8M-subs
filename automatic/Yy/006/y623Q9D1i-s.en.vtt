00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:12.950
 because I do because I do not have the no 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.470
 He had lately because my sister me 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:25.289
 from the camera and now I'm great that yes 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:28.279
 who had many jobs and curiously 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.279
 so much work 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:42.120
 but he's doing well because this one 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.480
 he said which is the first because we are 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.690
 in school does not fit the good of the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.690
 boxes 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.070
 web because although there are people who 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.960
 I could play 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.280
 heller they turn that upset is so 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.140
 bad good rod is so good are 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.550
 cared if you do not understand I know that you 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.030
 I'm talking about Uruguay is so 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.330
 good time 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.770
 before this bad situation of English and 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.570
 again like English like shit 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.850
 but more than seven waters ago I want to 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:29.840
 this so they are bad but it is awaited 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:29.840
 when I kind of like to look for why you 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:44.610
 seems the biggest long wanted 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:47.180
 to say is that in addition to trying to look 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.180
 Basque 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:01.740
 but good 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.200
 but come back always say subscribe 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.200
 because he will do when he sees the videos 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:29.209
 although not good although only when I say 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:29.209
 who understands
