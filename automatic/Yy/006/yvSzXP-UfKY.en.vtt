00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.140
 today we are going to make a drink basket 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.240
 software 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.950
 The materials we need are 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.130
 diapers gift ribbon scissors gums 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:22.550
 Elastic tissue paper of different 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.550
 colors and transparent gift paper 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.130
 first we take the diapers 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.199
 and we wrap them 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.199
 we hold them with an elastic band 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.880
 well until we have all those that 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.880
 we need 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.460
 once we have rolled all the 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.020
 diapers we take measurements on paper 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.090
 of silk 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.090
 and we cut a piece 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.970
 once the working conveyor 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.310
 we put half 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.310
 and then I have a candy 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.450
 we talked a little about the edges 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.189
 and we put an elastic pump 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.690
 and we already have the determined path 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.780
 once we have the Spaniards dead 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.780
 we put them in a basket 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.930
 once we have put you do everything 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.750
 we need to wrap it with paper 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.910
 transparent engrave and we decorate in 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.590
