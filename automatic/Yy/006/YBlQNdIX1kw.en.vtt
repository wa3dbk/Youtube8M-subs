they slide in to where I said they're

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.220 
they slide in to where I said they're
basically<00:05:27.890> idiot-proof

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
basically idiot-proof

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:37.420 
basically idiot-proof
just<00:05:30.230> slide<00:05:30.440> back<00:05:30.650> in<00:05:30.860> perfectly<00:05:31.780> and<00:05:36.430> you'll

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
just slide back in perfectly and you'll

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.210 
just slide back in perfectly and you'll
stick<00:05:37.670> the<00:05:37.790> back<00:05:38.000> on<00:05:38.240> over<00:05:39.050> them<00:05:39.170> over<00:05:40.130> the

stick the back on over them over the

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.800 
stick the back on over them over the

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
triggers and underneath the springs for

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:54.130 
triggers and underneath the springs for
the<00:05:44.840> battery<00:05:52.480> snap<00:05:53.480> it<00:05:53.630> all<00:05:53.750> back<00:05:53.960> together

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
the battery snap it all back together

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.660 
the battery snap it all back together
and<00:05:56.140> you've<00:05:57.140> got<00:05:57.320> a<00:05:57.350> working<00:05:57.620> Xbox<00:05:58.190> controller

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
and you've got a working Xbox controller

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.750 
and you've got a working Xbox controller
with<00:05:58.850> no<00:05:58.970> sticky<00:05:59.330> buttons<00:05:59.630> anymore<00:06:00.110> and<00:06:00.760> of

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
with no sticky buttons anymore and of

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.160 
with no sticky buttons anymore and of
course<00:06:02.060> you'll<00:06:02.270> have<00:06:02.360> to<00:06:02.450> screw<00:06:02.780> in<00:06:02.900> all<00:06:03.050> the

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170 
course you'll have to screw in all the

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.890 
course you'll have to screw in all the
screws<00:06:03.530> but<00:06:03.890> I<00:06:03.920> think<00:06:04.430> I'll<00:06:04.670> I'm<00:06:05.390> safe<00:06:05.720> to

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
screws but I think I'll I'm safe to

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.800 
screws but I think I'll I'm safe to
leave<00:06:06.020> that<00:06:06.230> to<00:06:06.410> you<00:06:06.590> and<00:06:07.630> hopefully<00:06:08.630> again
