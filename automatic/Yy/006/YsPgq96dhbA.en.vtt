SMG in this category I know lots people
will<00:01:51.600> disagree<00:01:51.780> with<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.439> because<00:01:52.920> they

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
will disagree with this because they

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.429 
will disagree with this because they
think<00:01:53.850> they're<00:01:54.210> not<00:01:54.390> good<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.229> can

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
think they're not good but if you can

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.149 
think they're not good but if you can
use<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.890> SMGs<00:01:56.750> correctly<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:57.960> my<00:01:58.159> opinion

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
use the SMGs correctly in my opinion

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.600 
use the SMGs correctly in my opinion
this

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
this

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.360 
this
there's<00:02:00.730> lots<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:01.540> can<00:02:01.810> be<00:02:01.900> better<00:02:02.170> than<00:02:02.410> 47

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
there's lots that can be better than 47

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.300 
there's lots that can be better than 47
you<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.730> guess<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.510> can<00:02:04.660> just<00:02:04.690> say<00:02:05.050> that<00:02:05.380> if<00:02:05.590> you

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
you I guess you can just say that if you

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.520 
you I guess you can just say that if you
don't<00:02:06.490> know<00:02:06.640> how<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:06.880> use<00:02:07.060> them<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.690> 47<00:02:08.289> you<00:02:08.410> is

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
don't know how to use them the 47 you is

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.790 
don't know how to use them the 47 you is
the<00:02:08.649> best<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:09.340> can<00:02:09.490> just<00:02:09.700> go<00:02:10.330> out<00:02:10.620> don't<00:02:11.620> have

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
the best you can just go out don't have

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.440 
the best you can just go out don't have
to<00:02:11.920> worry<00:02:12.070> about<00:02:12.190> perks<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.640> attachments<00:02:12.730> and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
to worry about perks and attachments and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.810 
to worry about perks and attachments and
you<00:02:13.750> can<00:02:13.900> pretty<00:02:14.080> much<00:02:14.200> own<00:02:14.560> with<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:15.610> if

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
you can pretty much own with it but if

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.180 
you can pretty much own with it but if
you<00:02:15.850> can<00:02:16.300> use<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:17.020> right<00:02:17.170> person<00:02:17.560> attachments

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
you can use the right person attachments

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.920 
you can use the right person attachments
on<00:02:18.280> certain<00:02:18.700> sm<00:02:19.060> cheese<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.570> can<00:02:19.720> just

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
on certain sm cheese you can just

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.280 
on certain sm cheese you can just
completely<00:02:20.440> dominate<00:02:21.280> with<00:02:21.460> them<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.570> that's

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
completely dominate with them so that's

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.080 
completely dominate with them so that's
basically<00:02:23.500> why<00:02:23.980> i<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.250> want<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.520> say<00:02:24.760> i<00:02:25.030> don't

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
basically why i just want to say i don't

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.050 
basically why i just want to say i don't
think<00:02:25.510> it's<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.960> best<00:02:26.200> SMG<00:02:26.740> i<00:02:27.100> think<00:02:27.700> it's<00:02:27.820> one

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
think it's the best SMG i think it's one

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.690 
think it's the best SMG i think it's one
of<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.300> better<00:02:28.450> but<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.260> think<00:02:29.680> there's<00:02:30.310> quite

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
of the better but I think there's quite

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.720 
of the better but I think there's quite
a<00:02:30.730> few<00:02:30.790> SMGs<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.959> assault<00:02:32.320> rifles<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.070> light

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
a few SMGs and assault rifles and light

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.050 
a few SMGs and assault rifles and light
machine<00:02:34.090> guns<00:02:34.330> that<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:34.810> outclass<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:36.370> 47

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
machine guns that can outclass the 47

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.050 
machine guns that can outclass the 47
you<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.360> many<00:02:37.510> different<00:02:37.900> things<00:02:38.790> but<00:02:39.790> now
