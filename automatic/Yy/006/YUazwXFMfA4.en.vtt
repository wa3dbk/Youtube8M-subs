00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.650
 well friends of hd motor not just on the 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.810
 car but only on fun fair for 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.430
 technomaniaci because the 17 inches of 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.750
 this tesla model s really is 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.630
 fantastic 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.749
 first of all web browsing because 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:25.820
 the infotainment includes a sim 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:27.409
 data that tesla has inserted into 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.249
 car and for seven years guarantees you 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:32.960
 practically free navigation therefore 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.809
 web browsing but not just because with 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.820
 the sim can be used the application 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.609
 tesla that will be in a few months 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.039
 available for ios and for android yes 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:45.829
 can turn on the air conditioner open 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.769
 close the car remotely but always 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.780
 with the sim you can listen to the 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.500
 streaming internet music 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.149
 directly from the tune in database 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.339
 obviously there is no lack of radios 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.820
 traditional fmm and also hence the 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.079
 digital audio broadcasting and then 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.770
 obviously there is the possibility of 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.290
 connect any device via bluetooth 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.979
 with this with this technology now 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.100
 we go to our iphone for 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.159
 listen to the audio quality raise the 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.159
 volume 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.850
 apart from the questionable song really 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.630
 remarkable the quality of this audio 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.000
 of this car and I went to see the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.210
 other functions the navigator navigator 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.280
 is based on google maps look at the maps 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.380
 you can't go so big 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.080
 lose with this tesla of course 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.820
 pincin and pinci out right now 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.680
 see we have a little bit 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.290
 a little bit score provoked so it does 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.630
 a little hard to render the map of 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.160
 where we are but we have all the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.110
 so google maps functionality a lot 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.000
 very comfortable from this point of view 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.130
 very interesting panel is that 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.410
 relative to energy here we can 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.080
 check some energy we have 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.700
 consumed in the last 50 km in the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.430
 last twenty-five as well in the last 10 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.150
 to adjust how many kilometers 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.870
 we could still do with charging 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.340
 remained in the batteries among other things 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.030
 recharge remained a bit like on 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.250
 we see cell phones here and here in a big way 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.739
 which is indicated here by the way 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.830
 charging interesting that 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.440
 we can select how much absorption 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.150
 will have the car then decide based 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.040
 to the installed power on ours 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.959
 counter how much current will absorb the 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.660
 machine to recharge our presence 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.690
 rear camera in very comfortable hd 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.280
 for maneuvers 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.620
 for maneuvers and above all remains 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.420
 also active when we go and then the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.740
 very good blue tooth phone part 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.200
 received the call while I was there 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.420
 doing the test drive and on the other 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.150
 I felt very good and they heard us 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.930
 all calls are very good 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.100
 recent and the dialer for short 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.790
 call who we want 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.380
 interfaces can switch areas with a 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.140
 a very nice graphic effect and then there 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.300
 are the car controls and 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.910
 settings among other things can be 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.680
 add more profiles to be able to 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.450
 then personalize the machine 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.830
 the seats are the positions of the steering wheel 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.250
 of mirrors when he has it in 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.870
 car and salt are not for example 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.350
 andrea brought another person is enough 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.050
 click that the machine will set for 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.420
 the selected profile what really 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.890
 very very very comfortable 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.770
 among other things, a software that can be 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.150
 remotely updated by tesla 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.840
 therefore functions that can also be 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.220
 additions during the life of the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.310
 of the car always with regard to 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.220
 the settings possibility to raise e 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.040
 lower to open close the roof 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.230
 always open with a touch movement 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.570
 ability to turn on or off the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.780
 heating of the various seats 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.709
 here we see the trip computer here 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.200
 selection of the fair display the 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:11.020
 possibility of coal for the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.170
 parking area 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.580
 we close this screen vi 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.980
 I show up here as 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.109
 possibility to also connect a hot 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.609
 wifi spot so if we have a 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.470
 data subscription on our mobile 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.720
 we can using as a hot spot for 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.050
 use all features online 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.820
 of the of the car here the number of 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.530
 tesla series we are driving e 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.120
 here under the control of 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.460
 climate control always touch of course 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.669
 working off reading because the 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.770
 air conditioner compressor is 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:46.840
 electric so truly a paradise 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:49.180
 for those who love the infotainment system the 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.200
 technology and everything is replicated too 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.970
 on the steering wheel with the controls you can 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.400
 be customized let's say a 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.790
 right I can 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.639
 insert in the display a little what I do 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.300
 is interested in viewing the middle part 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.580
 so what I'm listening to 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.500
 rather than the energy part 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.350
 I'm consuming or even the trip 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.870
 computer or even the telephone part for 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.310
 go and call contacts quickly 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.979
 which I am more interested in then I cannot 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.259
 select what to do this 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.810
 wheel in a quick manner in 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:25.169
 in this case we can also decide to 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.030
 open the roof the sunroof o 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.190
 you have also seen all the other options 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.060
 on the left side instead the wheels 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.199
 that regulate the volume of the movement of the 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.449
 tracks or even here we can 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:40.020
 customize the left display 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:41.490
 with what we basically want 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.990
 and that makes us more useful then not 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.940
 could really complex but also 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.220
 very simple to use with 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.440
 an intuitive interface and a touch 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.070
 obviously very capacitive 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.070
 susceptible
