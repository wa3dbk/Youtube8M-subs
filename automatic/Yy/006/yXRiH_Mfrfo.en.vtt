00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.730
 quit so speaks to their customers worldwide in the hands of Hexaglot 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.790
 Dirt on all their points of criticism they will see and if they 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.969
 also honest they are finally refute 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.349
 again the day before yesterday we stopped all full effective protection of 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.960
 Children and adolescents from sexual exploitation 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.109
 and violence 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.410
 the spd group has just recently come up with a comprehensive concept 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:25.579
 concrete measures 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.099
 so we want that law enforcement 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.920
 permanently staffed and technically well equipped 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.740
 and we want that international cooperation and that's urgent 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.710
 necessary 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.550
 is significantly improved 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.100
 In recent years, we have also been producing the 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.780
 Dissemination and possession of child pornography completely under 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.890
 Punishment 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.760
 it's about an important aspect of the problem 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.070
 namely the distribution of child pornography content in the 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.130
 Internet 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.630
 There illegal content can be very fast 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.479
 anonymous and bean of social control 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.110
 be disseminated and consumed 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.130
 This was synonymous since all agree that the Internet is not a law-free area 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.310
 questionable is whether ultimately only with what measures the distribution 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.120
 child pornography content on the Internet 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.470
 reasonable 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.040
 constitutionally clean 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.730
 and search options can actively prevent or at least be hampered and 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.820
 that's exactly what the coalition agreement is for Politzer 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.820
 Actions in their bill 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.000
 the law makes access to child pornography more difficult 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.610
 We are just as aware as it is that a well-versed user can make it 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.060
 technically be able to handle this lock provided 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.970
 but probably only a part of them will do that for one 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.350
 have positive effect anyway 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.509
 it also depends on the inhibition threshold for users clearly 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.790
 and significantly increase 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.870
 in this regard, for example, I refer to the corresponding 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.880
 versions 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.030
 the expert Mrs. Doctor Konan in our hearing 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.530
 The media expert has in her book child pornography on the Internet 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.309
 remarkably differentiated 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:11.929
 The behavior of people portrays a certain pedophilia tendency 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:12.589
 to have 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:16.209
 and about the consumption of child pornography on the internet right now 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.819
 looking through the entry 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.329
 At least some of these people can still be reached 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.799
 and I think it's worth the effort 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.599
 but the spd Bundestag faction has always made it clear that we end up 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.359
 only agree with a law 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.279
 the ZTE fundamental rule of principle 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.339
 really tried 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:37.379
 and that is exactly what we have achieved 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.260
 With the numerous changes, we all rely on our reasons 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.129
 Criticisms from the Bundestag election hear because of one it also brings 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.679
 of the Federal Council and forth 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:50.909
 Mr. Kohl "El Doctor" Stadler the Federal Council has just not complained that 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.869
 the federal government has no legislative competence 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:57.950
 and we have picked up an important argument from the internet community 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.590
 it is right and necessary that the BKA initially other measures 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.869
 are allowed to delete child pornographic pages seizes 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:10.599
 because erasing is much more effective than locking and exactly this principle 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.749
 BÃ¼rschen quarter increase 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:17.369
 Legally anchored to 9 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:20.410
 Of course you have to take into account that the BKA in Germany 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.939
 act as a sovereign authority differently than abroad 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.819
 but we expect and I mean that very seriously 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.110
 that the BKA makes everything meaningful 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.870
 possible and permissible is consistently implemented yesterday is allowed to cook 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.569
 says 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.179
 in connection with the bka list, we even resort to investing the 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:43.899
 e-petition on the yes can now be more than 100000 130000 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:45.839
 People have connected 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:48.659
 that is because it is explicitly read now 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.430
 as the most important point of criticism called the so far missing control and 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.609
 Transparency of the bka list 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.629
 and that is exactly what we take on and are now creating an independent body 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.340
 from five experts 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.960
 whose members are in control at all times 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.930
 on this list and can correct them completely and 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.829
 I emphasize that at any time 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.829
 every day every day 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.519
 Incidentally, we have also thought carefully about who Polier Doctor Starter is 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.180
 should call such a topic and West 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.100
 it's about preventing pages from being unjustified on the slopes 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.889
 arrive because they have a different content than child pornography 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.069
 So it's about freedom of information 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.059
 at the same time it is about the protection of sensitive data 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:37.819
 because the list may indeed be public when it does not become public 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.649
 so you do not have to grab Peter on the internet 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.419
 here colleague the man stood is the interrogation of the colleague Monday 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.409
 Owner a question to her 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:58.409
 after I 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.460
 her last pleasure has heard the argument 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.389
 they just said 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.470
 the percent of the Federal Data Protection Commissioner 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.349
 to be entrusted with a specific task 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.509
 and they have named these from this work order also content 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:16.950
 they said it's about the question 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.050
 so decided 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.910
 if a 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.639
 Photo on turns 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.479
 a philipp if the video sequence 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.479
 child pornography content or not 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.729
 Agree to me 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.759
 that this is not a criminal issue and a criminal offense 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.580
 Relevant answer is either he is a representation of an offense 

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:45.549
 that children represent or is abused it and that represents child pornography 

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:48.069
 this is not a punishable offense 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:53.940
 and I ask her what competence has the Federal Data Protection Commissioner 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.750
 whether to make such a decision
