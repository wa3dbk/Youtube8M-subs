00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
the case I do like the protection it

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.930 
the case I do like the protection it
gives<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.680> my<00:03:06.830> device<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.430> think<00:03:07.640> this<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:07.790> a

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
gives to my device and I think this is a

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.930
