learning how to ride out together this
first<00:00:26.820> horse<00:00:27.119> was<00:00:27.360> not<00:00:27.539> very<00:00:27.750> confident<00:00:28.320> about

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
first horse was not very confident about

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.490 
first horse was not very confident about
streams<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:30.000> his<00:00:30.239> previous<00:00:30.570> ride<00:00:31.020> he<00:00:31.320> was

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
streams on his previous ride he was

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.620 
streams on his previous ride he was
jumping<00:00:31.890> even<00:00:32.189> very<00:00:32.369> tiny<00:00:32.430> stream<00:00:33.120> crossings

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
jumping even very tiny stream crossings

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.770 
jumping even very tiny stream crossings
so<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.770> ride<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.940> were<00:00:36.180> going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.570> click

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
so on this ride we were going to click

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.139 
so on this ride we were going to click
and<00:00:37.110> reinforce<00:00:37.620> him<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.250> showing<00:00:38.850> interest

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149

and reinforce him for showing interest
in<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> water<00:00:39.920> and<00:00:40.920> when<00:00:41.070> he<00:00:41.160> takes<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.550> step

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
in the water and when he takes a step

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.270 
in the water and when he takes a step
forward<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:42.570> him<00:00:42.750> click<00:00:43.079> he<00:00:43.920> got<00:00:44.100> rewarded

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
forward like him click he got rewarded

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.349 
forward like him click he got rewarded
for<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.379> what<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.559> does<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.940> creates<00:00:48.089> a

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
for that what this does is it creates a

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.569 
for that what this does is it creates a
lot<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.960> confidence<00:00:49.589> in<00:00:49.800> stream<00:00:50.070> crossings

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
lot of confidence in stream crossings

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.509 
lot of confidence in stream crossings
and<00:00:51.239> other<00:00:51.629> obstacles<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.620> he's<00:00:52.949> likely<00:00:53.219> to

orienting<00:01:40.790> to<00:01:40.939> it<00:01:48.460> let<00:01:49.460> him<00:01:49.549> touch<00:01:49.729> it<00:01:49.789> a

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
orienting to it let him touch it a

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.580 
orienting to it let him touch it a
couple<00:01:50.149> more<00:01:50.360> times<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:53.110> then<00:01:54.110> rather<00:01:54.320> than

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
couple more times and then rather than

couple more times and then rather than
turning<00:01:55.039> around<00:01:55.250> how<00:01:55.549> about<00:01:55.580> going<00:01:55.909> over<00:01:56.240> to

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
turning around how about going over to

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.820 
turning around how about going over to
the<00:01:56.539> stump<00:01:56.950> or<00:01:57.950> go<00:01:58.159> back<00:01:58.399> to<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.670> stone<00:01:59.830> the

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
the stump or go back to the stone the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:13.510 
the stump or go back to the stone the
one<00:02:00.979> back<00:02:01.429> to<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.610> rock

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:32.809 

that'll<00:02:14.520> do

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:41.290 

now<00:02:33.819> I<00:02:33.850> think<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.209> I<00:02:34.420> think<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.990> looks<00:02:35.200> good

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:59.619 

so<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.260> can<00:02:42.380> let<00:02:42.470> them<00:02:42.620> touch<00:02:42.770> that

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:08.930 

off<00:03:00.629> we<00:03:00.900> go<00:03:07.040> another<00:03:08.040> challenge<00:03:08.640> for<00:03:08.700> this

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
off we go another challenge for this

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.449 
off we go another challenge for this
horse<00:03:09.239> was<00:03:09.900> keeping<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.560> steady<00:03:10.830> pace<00:03:11.159> going

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
horse was keeping a steady pace going

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.210 
horse was keeping a steady pace going
down<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.819> hill<00:03:12.260> he<00:03:13.260> tended<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.799> lose<00:03:13.950> his

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
down a hill he tended to lose his

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.390 
down a hill he tended to lose his
balance<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.450> rush<00:03:15.659> a<00:03:15.690> little<00:03:16.019> bit<00:03:16.400> so

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
balance and it rush a little bit so

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.250 
balance and it rush a little bit so
we're<00:03:17.760> using<00:03:18.150> one<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.599> skills<00:03:18.930> we've

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
we're using one of the skills we've

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.069 
we're using one of the skills we've
taught<00:03:19.620> him<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.159> ring<00:03:20.340> which<00:03:21.239> is<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.930> move

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
taught him in the ring which is to move

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.319 
taught him in the ring which is to move
away<00:03:22.230> from<00:03:22.349> leg<00:03:22.799> in<00:03:23.159> these<00:03:23.640> nice<00:03:23.849> lateral

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
away from leg in these nice lateral

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.710 
away from leg in these nice lateral
flexions<00:03:25.129> the<00:03:26.129> lateral<00:03:26.549> flexions<00:03:27.120> help<00:03:27.510> him

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
flexions the lateral flexions help him

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.350 
flexions the lateral flexions help him
to<00:03:27.870> catch<00:03:28.079> his<00:03:28.290> balance<00:03:28.610> so<00:03:29.610> he<00:03:29.760> can<00:03:29.940> go<00:03:30.090> down

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
to catch his balance so he can go down

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.020 
to catch his balance so he can go down
the<00:03:30.599> hill<00:03:30.870> without<00:03:31.620> losing<00:03:32.220> his<00:03:32.370> balance<00:03:32.579> and

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
the hill without losing his balance and
