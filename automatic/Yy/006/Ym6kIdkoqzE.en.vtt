together here Oh pop that in the middle
all<00:02:01.110> right<00:02:01.320> here<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:02.009> go<00:02:02.299> then<00:02:03.299> what<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:03.479> do

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
all right here we go then what we do

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.880 
all right here we go then what we do
we'll<00:02:03.780> grab<00:02:03.899> our<00:02:04.020> other<00:02:04.079> second<00:02:04.560> piece<00:02:04.680> of

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
we'll grab our other second piece of

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.169 
we'll grab our other second piece of
puff<00:02:05.070> pastry<00:02:05.149> pop<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.390> top<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:08.030> then<00:02:09.030> we

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
puff pastry pop that on top and then we

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.190 
puff pastry pop that on top and then we
bung<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.690> away<00:02:09.840> we<00:02:10.020> go

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
bung it in and away we go

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.820 
bung it in and away we go
so<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.530> guess<00:02:10.800> when<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.129> sort<00:02:11.459> of

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
so I guess when it sort of

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.340 
so I guess when it sort of
the<00:02:12.430> mixture<00:02:13.210> will<00:02:13.390> obviously<00:02:13.630> spread<00:02:14.200> out

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
the mixture will obviously spread out

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.350 
the mixture will obviously spread out
and<00:02:14.950> make<00:02:15.130> it<00:02:15.280> perfect<00:02:15.460> if<00:02:15.850> you<00:02:15.910> had<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.150> all

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
and make it perfect if you had it all

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.850 
and make it perfect if you had it all
around<00:02:16.630> that's<00:02:17.170> what<00:02:17.380> happens<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.710> know<00:02:17.770> with

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
around that's what happens you know with

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.470 
around that's what happens you know with
the<00:02:17.920> cheese<00:02:18.190> it's<00:02:18.610> like<00:02:18.790> go<00:02:19.060> out<00:02:19.210> from<00:02:19.390> the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
the cheese it's like go out from the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.360 
the cheese it's like go out from the
side<00:02:19.690> yeah<00:02:20.020> exactly<00:02:20.320> right<00:02:20.650> all<00:02:21.040> right<00:02:21.190> well

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
side yeah exactly right all right well

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.580 
side yeah exactly right all right well
let's<00:02:21.550> make<00:02:21.670> another<00:02:21.970> one<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.390> Talyn<00:02:23.380> does<00:02:23.500> it
