00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
Touches stuff like that so that's really

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.660 
Touches stuff like that so that's really
awesome<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.869> also<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.649> how<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.070> sort<00:01:50.579> of

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
awesome I also like how it's not sort of

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.160 
awesome I also like how it's not sort of
a<00:01:51.290> you<00:01:52.290> know<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.590> an<00:01:52.710> angle<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.340> stereo<00:01:54.180> input

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
a you know on an angle the stereo input

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.080 
a you know on an angle the stereo input
it's<00:01:55.799> not<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> right-footed<00:01:56.640> sort<00:01:57.000> of

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
it's not like a right-footed sort of

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.770 
it's not like a right-footed sort of
angle<00:01:58.070> input<00:01:59.070> which<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.460> nice<00:01:59.780> also

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
angle input which is really nice also

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.240 
angle input which is really nice also
another<00:02:01.229> really<00:02:01.500> cool<00:02:01.649> thing<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.950> thought<00:02:02.130> I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
another really cool thing I thought I

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.310 
another really cool thing I thought I

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
one end but that really doesn't bother

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.050 
one end but that really doesn't bother
me<00:05:23.840> it's<00:05:24.139> great<00:05:24.729> another<00:05:25.729> great<00:05:26.000> feature

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
me it's great another great feature

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.140 
me it's great another great feature
though<00:05:26.660> which<00:05:27.199> J's<00:05:27.530> has<00:05:27.919> included<00:05:28.400> in<00:05:28.729> their

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
though which J's has included in their

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.020 
though which J's has included in their
headphones<00:05:29.360> is<00:05:29.780> that<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:31.070> cable<00:05:31.490> is<00:05:31.520> actually

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
headphones is that the cable is actually

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.940 
headphones is that the cable is actually
quite<00:05:32.750> short<00:05:33.110> when<00:05:33.380> you<00:05:33.470> take<00:05:33.680> it<00:05:33.830> straight

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
quite short when you take it straight

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.379 
quite short when you take it straight
out<00:05:34.070> of<00:05:34.190> the<00:05:34.310> box<00:05:34.490> as<00:05:34.729> you<00:05:34.849> can<00:05:34.970> see<00:05:35.120> it's<00:05:35.240> quite

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
out of the box as you can see it's quite

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.870 
out of the box as you can see it's quite
short<00:05:35.780> just<00:05:36.440> like<00:05:36.620> that<00:05:36.800> maybe<00:05:37.010> about<00:05:37.310> only

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
short just like that maybe about only

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.330 
short just like that maybe about only
about<00:05:38.060> 30<00:05:38.450> just<00:05:38.930> over<00:05:39.169> 30<00:05:39.410> centimeters<00:05:40.070> and

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
about 30 just over 30 centimeters and

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.680 
about 30 just over 30 centimeters and
that's<00:05:40.669> quite<00:05:40.910> short<00:05:41.240> something<00:05:41.479> you<00:05:41.570> might

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
that's quite short something you might

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.839 
that's quite short something you might
be<00:05:41.810> thinking<00:05:42.169> but<00:05:42.590> this<00:05:42.710> is<00:05:42.860> actually<00:05:43.310> great

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
be thinking but this is actually great

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.480 
be thinking but this is actually great
