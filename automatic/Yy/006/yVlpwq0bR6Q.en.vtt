00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.350
 ayano 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.350
 at 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.800
 I think half 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.970
 I'm trying to be here in France 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.780
 despite a not so good year 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.970
 it's the worst year I've had since 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.900
 since I'm on the tour since I 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.090
 am even from my career 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.400
 so I think that being in France is 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.130
 motivation plus that motivates to do 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.930
 better to really get into the water they 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.100
 can be better focused and just 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.000
 really positive thoughts think about 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.570
 all the people who support me 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.610
 throughout the year 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.330
 despite my bad year and that's it 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.300
 I try to do my best for them 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.560
 make a little on this beautiful support 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.560
 that I have throughout the year 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.790
 we can more 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.400
 but I feel good there are good 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.830
 waves the boards work well my 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.850
 coach is here and that 's my family 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.530
 was here not so long ago so 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.090
 personally I feel good 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.920
 physically and mentally so 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.840
 I expect just as conditions 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.840
 come in and and let it be the party believes 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.009
 no 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.930
