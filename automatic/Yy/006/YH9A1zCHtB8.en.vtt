00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
I don't know that guess it's that

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.260 
I don't know that guess it's that
metallic<00:00:58.440> colors<00:00:58.980> which<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.640> what's<00:01:00.000> making

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
metallic colors which is what's making

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.959 
metallic colors which is what's making
it<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.399> doesn't<00:01:02.730> bother<00:01:02.850> me

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it it do that but that doesn't bother me

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.179 
it it do that but that doesn't bother me
at<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.300> they're<00:01:04.080> gonna<00:01:04.199> crease<00:01:04.500> regardless<00:01:05.070> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
at all they're gonna crease regardless I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.830 
at all they're gonna crease regardless I
