00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
some electrical tape on it and anybody

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.570 
some electrical tape on it and anybody
asks<00:00:10.590> when<00:00:10.679> i<00:00:10.710> get<00:00:10.889> tutorial<00:00:11.250> on<00:00:11.309> how<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.460> make

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
find on youtube and so this one here is

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.830 
find on youtube and so this one here is
smaller<00:00:20.580> i<00:00:20.730> put<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.090> electrical<00:00:21.510> tape<00:00:21.660> on

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
smaller i put this electrical tape on

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.330 
smaller i put this electrical tape on
here<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.380> like<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.529> thickness<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.279> a

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
here so you have like a thickness and a

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.429 
here so you have like a thickness and a
grip<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.779> these<00:00:24.779> ends<00:00:24.990> right<00:00:25.050> here<00:00:25.109> i<00:00:25.260> made

about 25 of these last night this is the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.480 
about 25 of these last night this is the
only<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.359> survived<00:00:27.720> because<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.490> throw

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
only one that survived because I throw

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.560 
only one that survived because I throw
them<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.670> three<00:00:29.880> or<00:00:29.970> four<00:00:30.029> times<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.480> they

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
them like three or four times and they

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.170 
them like three or four times and they
just<00:00:30.779> break<00:00:31.050> into<00:00:31.260> 100<00:00:31.590> pieces<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.399> just

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
just break into 100 pieces so I just

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.370 
just break into 100 pieces so I just
decided<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.570> put<00:00:33.690> electrical<00:00:34.050> tape<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.350> it

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
decided to put electrical tape on it

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.049 
decided to put electrical tape on it
works<00:00:34.620> great<00:00:34.800> now<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.309> haven't<00:00:35.820> had<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.940> problem
