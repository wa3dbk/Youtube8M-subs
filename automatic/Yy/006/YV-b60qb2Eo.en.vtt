season like later which I go and move it
around<00:04:25.170> and<00:04:26.170> the<00:04:26.380> game<00:04:26.560> will<00:04:26.740> recognize<00:04:27.220> and

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
around and the game will recognize and

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.610 
around and the game will recognize and
like<00:04:27.670> can<00:04:27.880> be<00:04:28.060> right<00:04:28.360> there<00:04:28.570> so<00:04:28.840> they'll<00:04:29.410> never

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
like can be right there so they'll never

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.760

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.920 

why<00:04:34.580> because<00:04:35.240> you<00:04:35.660> basically<00:04:37.330> move<00:04:38.330> them<00:04:38.630> into

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
why because you basically move them into

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.800 
why because you basically move them into
a<00:04:39.590> winter<00:04:39.979> object<00:04:40.460> as<00:04:41.419> you<00:04:41.599> saw<00:04:41.810> these<00:04:41.990> work
