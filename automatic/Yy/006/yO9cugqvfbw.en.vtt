00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
and then put it on the cube and it'll

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.330 
and then put it on the cube and it'll
try<00:03:20.449> to<00:03:20.569> get<00:03:20.900> its<00:03:21.049> try<00:03:21.349> get<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.650> transferred<00:03:22.040> I

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
try to get its try get it transferred I

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.770 
try to get its try get it transferred I
don't<00:03:22.729> know<00:03:22.819> if<00:03:22.909> it's<00:03:23.030> because<00:03:23.180> 10a<00:03:23.509> it's

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
don't know if it's because 10a it's

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.860 
don't know if it's because 10a it's
1080p<00:03:24.470> video<00:03:24.799> or<00:03:25.189> whatnot<00:03:25.430> here<00:03:26.269> starting<00:03:26.780> to

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
1080p video or whatnot here starting to

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.939 
1080p video or whatnot here starting to
play<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.379> it<00:03:27.530> froze<00:03:27.769> as<00:03:28.099> you<00:03:28.310> can<00:03:28.459> see<00:03:29.169> I<00:03:30.169> just

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:30.949 
play and it froze as you can see I just

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:32.140 
play and it froze as you can see I just
thought<00:03:31.189> it<00:03:31.280> was<00:03:31.370> pretty<00:03:31.430> interesting<00:03:32.000> that

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
thought it was pretty interesting that

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.080 
thought it was pretty interesting that
it<00:03:32.239> actually<00:03:32.389> comes<00:03:32.930> with<00:03:34.090> airplay

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
it actually comes with airplay

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.039 
it actually comes with airplay
functionality<00:03:35.269> out<00:03:35.840> of<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.109> box<00:03:37.389> you<00:03:38.389> I<00:03:38.780> guess

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
functionality out of the box you I guess

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.990 
functionality out of the box you I guess
you<00:03:39.079> might<00:03:39.470> not<00:03:39.680> need<00:03:39.889> to<00:03:40.069> buy<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.370> Apple<00:03:40.729> TV

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
you might not need to buy that Apple TV

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.729 
you might not need to buy that Apple TV
after<00:03:41.329> all<00:03:41.449> it<00:03:41.659> doesn't<00:03:41.900> work<00:03:42.259> with<00:03:42.470> Mac

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
after all it doesn't work with Mac

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.830 
after all it doesn't work with Mac
that's<00:03:43.669> the<00:03:43.879> thing<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.180> only<00:03:44.239> works<00:03:44.599> with<00:03:44.780> the

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
that's the thing it only works with the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.050 
that's the thing it only works with the
iPad<00:03:45.379> and<00:03:45.680> with<00:03:45.829> the<00:03:45.949> iPod<00:03:46.310> touch<00:03:46.549> maybe<00:03:46.819> with

iPad and with the iPod touch maybe with
an<00:03:47.120> iPhone<00:03:47.449> but<00:03:48.019> I<00:03:48.079> wasn't<00:03:48.439> able<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.620> test<00:03:48.889> that

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
an iPhone but I wasn't able to test that

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.179 
an iPhone but I wasn't able to test that
when<00:03:50.239> I<00:03:50.269> try<00:03:50.599> to<00:03:50.629> airplay<00:03:51.139> from<00:03:51.199> my<00:03:51.560> computer
