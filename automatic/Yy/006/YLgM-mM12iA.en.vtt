is done like it's lined up perfectly and
the<00:01:09.299> left<00:01:09.570> side<00:01:09.979> needs<00:01:10.979> work<00:01:11.420> see<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:14.400> that's

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the left side needs work see so that's

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.320

what<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.790> forces<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.479> there<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:15.780> um<00:01:17.330> I've

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
what the forces are there for um I've

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.120 
what the forces are there for um I've
had<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.049> forces<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:21.830> approximately<00:01:22.830> four

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
had the forces for approximately four

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.130 
had the forces for approximately four
weeks<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.790> hopefully<00:01:24.720> they<00:01:24.869> will<00:01:24.900> take

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
weeks now and hopefully they will take

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.179

it out tomorrow if not then I'll have it
some<00:01:29.729> more<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.659> don't<00:01:30.750> think<00:01:30.869> is

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
some more but I really don't think is

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.469 
some more but I really don't think is
done<00:01:31.350> much<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.250> hopefully<00:01:33.000> they'll<00:01:33.210> take<00:01:33.360> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
done much so hopefully they'll take it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.210 
done much so hopefully they'll take it
out<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.840> try<00:01:33.960> something<00:01:34.200> different<00:01:34.439> because
