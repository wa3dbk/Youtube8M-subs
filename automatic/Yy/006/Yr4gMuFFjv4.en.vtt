always check the newspapers to find more
information<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:34.959> because<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.890> game<00:03:36.010> builds

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
information and because the game builds

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.070 
information and because the game builds
on<00:03:36.520> itself<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.910> newspapers<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:37.750> find

on itself the newspapers that you find

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.110 
on itself the newspapers that you find
in<00:03:38.260> earlier<00:03:38.590> cases<00:03:38.830> are<00:03:39.100> still<00:03:39.220> irrelevant<00:03:40.000> in

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
in earlier cases are still irrelevant in

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.449 
in earlier cases are still irrelevant in
later<00:03:40.540> cases<00:03:40.810> this<00:03:41.500> game<00:03:41.680> is<00:03:41.830> really<00:03:42.070> smart

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
later cases this game is really smart

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.520 
later cases this game is really smart
and<00:03:42.670> builds<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.360> builds<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:43.959> builds<00:03:44.050> and
