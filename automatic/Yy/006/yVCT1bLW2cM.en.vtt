now<00:01:13.470> my<00:01:13.740> advice<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.909> never<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
now my advice to you is you never do a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.810 
now my advice to you is you never do a
relationship<00:01:16.080> reading<00:01:16.500> when<00:01:17.310> you're<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
relationship reading when you're in the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.200 
relationship reading when you're in the
middle<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.920> lovely<00:01:19.920> happy<00:01:20.250> relationship

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
middle of a lovely happy relationship

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.999 
middle of a lovely happy relationship
because<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> doesn't<00:01:22.020> make<00:01:22.110> sense<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.650> hear

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
because it doesn't make sense to hear

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.460 
because it doesn't make sense to hear
that<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> relationship<00:01:24.720> isn't<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
that the relationship isn't going to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.580 
that the relationship isn't going to
work<00:01:25.650> out<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.009> do<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> relationship<00:01:26.970> reading

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
work out you do a relationship reading

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.280 
work out you do a relationship reading
when<00:01:28.590> you're<00:01:28.920> really<00:01:29.640> at<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.630> beginning<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.170> a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
when you're really at the beginning of a

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.210 
when you're really at the beginning of a
relationship<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:32.009> would<00:01:32.189> say<00:01:32.400> um<00:01:33.079> or<00:01:34.220> when

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
relationship I would say um or when

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.749 
relationship I would say um or when
you're<00:01:35.430> really<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.909> doubt<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:37.759> especially

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
you're able to accept what the reading

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.310 
you're able to accept what the reading
is<00:01:44.549> telling<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.840> know<00:01:45.960> you're<00:01:46.200> in

is telling you you know you're in
