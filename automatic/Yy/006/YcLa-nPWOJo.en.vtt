00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.450
 in the second league over micro 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.129
 Improvements tell you how to 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.140
 all with improvements of his 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.640
 panzers save on various due 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.980
 can 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.850
 the first and the simplest one has it 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.740
 just leave 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.660
 with the micro improvements have the 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.120
 Developers joyfully slaughtered 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.310
 where not going but also without 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.649
 improvement can be adjusted 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.809
 Unfortunately, this method is only for the 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.460
 higher ranks suitable than in the 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.790
 you have to come in for each butchery 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.560
 an abo buy price for it is unfortunately 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.180
 pretty snappy for the smaller races 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.220
 the second variant is almost the same 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.100
 smart as the first round but for 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.110
 Begin in a purely theoretical way 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.670
 later one or the other modification 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.420
 of the tank or the weapon free 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.430
 the better is the switched 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.469
 let's say you play with nokia at 1 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.640
 from the rank sergeant 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.030
 is unlocked 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.799
 which is the ninth-ranking us therefore 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.939
 the moca mainz the best weapon on the 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.369
 ninth place instead of an improvement 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.249
 for smoke can do that in the rank 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.729
 sergeant record m1 buy the the 

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:25.249
 Best choice for being in eleventh place 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.840
 and then as an upper change in the ice pick 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:31.369
 which is the best weapon of the 13 brand 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.990
 he understands instead of in micro 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.939
 one can play improvements 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.240
 just the better modifications of the 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.159
 buy weapons or underride and if 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.459
 It's never enough so you can do it 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.499
 improve a little 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:47.299
 the third method only the parameter to 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:49.249
 improve the most benefits in 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.409
 bring the slaughter enough 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:54.219
 for example, and we take under two sets 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.509
 mammoth and bass 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:02:00.590
 the mammoth's fundamental advantage is the 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.840
 Armor if you both mammoth only 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.409
 Banks can improve that way the most 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.539
 save up 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.520
 Of course, all parameters are important 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.789
 but some are more important than that 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.789
 rest 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.730
 when improving the water it will 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.860
 should not be possible to save without 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.930
 improvement of the armor and and maximum 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.930
 speed picture matthias not out 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.019
 can cause problems 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.239
 the most important parameter is here 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:33.860
 harm the remaining parameters are in 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.750
 reason not necessary but if you 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.760
 advantages in fighting against others 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.860
 so it is 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.610
 the more advantageous to load through 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.769
 improve 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.989
 so a little older can shoot that 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.700
 I also advise the breakthrough 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.950
 to improve performance then it is 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.819
 much funnier several bronze armor can 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.860
 not as he appreciates your financial 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.319
 options and improved 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.730
 those parameters of toys the 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.920
 bring you noticeable benefits fourth 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.380
 Method does not improve the items 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.359
 completely heeded that the first 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.500
 bring the most benefits and steps 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.109
 cost me so much 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.579
 It is more profitable to do it all the same 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:17.600
 her the weapon or the pedestal 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:19.579
 knightly goods improve the world 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.920
 final steps give little 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.480
 Advantages cost a lot and blocking 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.720
 improved items 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.709
 when should you stop there then 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.090
 but decide for yourself but 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.620
 notice that if you have the one or the other 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.139
 other parameters do not end 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.910
 you will not get any better 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.280
 discount on the next modification of the 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.739
 weapon or banzers for the improvement 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.630
 of the parameter to the end can one 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.470
 Allow 70 percent discount 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.359
 general advice for the 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.390
 Improvements of weapons and minors 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:55.250
 are like that 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.000
 does not use a stable option or 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.560
 only if you have your own oil platform 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.579
 the smaller hands would rather buy the 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.650
 better weapons and subdue the 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.040
 then you have purchased items for 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.359
 always 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.920
 but improving them does not hurt either 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.049
 if you already put ours weapons 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.419
 m3 modifications have since been about it 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.269
 after a tour to buy at the 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.560
 suggestion to attend 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.509
 not always are all improvements 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.759
 parameter nevertheless gives if you 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:28.400
 save crystals volt now improves the 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.289
 parameter the right team moves though 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.300
 keep in mind that the first steps always 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:37.460
 I am very happy with you what that was 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.560
 actually wish you a good micro 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.990
 Improvements forget the video too 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.370
 like and write as a comment what you 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.800
 obtained from the micro-improvements 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.300
 and how do you think your best 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.300
 the objects improved
