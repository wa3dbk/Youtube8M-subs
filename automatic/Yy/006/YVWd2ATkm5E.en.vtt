steel rod so it won't break and what
that<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.309> starts<00:00:44.940> up<00:00:45.030> fires<00:00:45.329> whether

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
that is is it starts up fires whether

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.110 
that is is it starts up fires whether
it's<00:00:45.809> cold<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.170> dry<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.879> kind<00:00:48.090> of

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
it's cold or dry and it just kind of

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.420 
it's cold or dry and it just kind of
works<00:00:48.329> simply<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:49.829> take<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
works simply like this you just take a

works simply like this you just take a
cutting<00:00:50.879> object<00:00:51.360> or<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:51.899> use<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.460> belt

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
tip here the metal belt tip and just

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.229 
tip here the metal belt tip and just
scrape<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.820> down<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:58.340> fire<00:00:59.340> starter<00:00:59.760> stick<00:01:00.000> at

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
scrape it down the fire starter stick at

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.260 
scrape it down the fire starter stick at
a<00:01:00.620> 45-degree<00:01:01.620> angle<00:01:01.920> or<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.640> quickly<00:01:02.910> and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
a 45-degree angle or so it's quickly and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.450 
a 45-degree angle or so it's quickly and
you<00:01:03.480> get<00:01:03.660> tons<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.409> sparks<00:01:04.860> coming<00:01:05.070> off<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
you get tons of sparks coming off the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.490 
you get tons of sparks coming off the
end<00:01:05.580> here<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.630> quite<00:01:06.960> enough<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
end here and that is quite enough to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.050 
end here and that is quite enough to
start<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.010> good<00:01:08.250> fire<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:08.850> some<00:01:09.030> good

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.060 
is the first that is a woven belt and
it's<00:01:21.900> something<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:22.439> make<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.830> large

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
it's something that we make on large

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.240 
it's something that we make on large
looms<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.990> what<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.530> great<00:01:25.740> about<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.040> is

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
looms and what is so great about that is

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.920 
looms and what is so great about that is
one<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:26.939> nice<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.330> thin<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.840> not

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
one it is nice and thin so it's not

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.960 
one it is nice and thin so it's not
something<00:01:28.170> you're<00:01:28.530> going<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.920> too<00:01:29.759> thick

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
something you're going to be too thick

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.120 
something you're going to be too thick
to<00:01:30.000> put<00:01:30.210> through<00:01:30.390> your<00:01:30.509> belt<00:01:30.689> belt<00:01:31.170> loops<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
to put through your belt belt loops the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.340 
to put through your belt belt loops the
other<00:01:32.280> thing<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.509> rapid<00:01:34.020> deploy

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
other thing is that it is rapid deploy

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.230 
other thing is that it is rapid deploy
so<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.829> actually<00:01:35.189> cut<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.610> top<00:01:35.850> right

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
so you can actually cut the top right

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.510 
so you can actually cut the top right
here<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.689> all<00:01:37.290> sudden<00:01:37.619> whip<00:01:37.829> out<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> bunch<00:01:38.430> of

here and all sudden whip out a bunch of

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.060 
here and all sudden whip out a bunch of
cord<00:01:38.790> ready<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.270> go<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.960> very<00:01:40.740> fast

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
