00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.640 

once<00:02:04.180> that<00:02:04.360> is<00:02:04.510> completed<00:02:04.900> you're<00:02:05.410> just<00:02:05.530> going

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
once that is completed you're just going

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.240 
once that is completed you're just going
to<00:02:05.740> go<00:02:05.830> ahead<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.070> put<00:02:06.190> it<00:02:06.280> back<00:02:06.460> on<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.820> real

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
to go ahead and put it back on the real

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.900 
to go ahead and put it back on the real
amount<00:02:09.250> there<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:10.149> now<00:02:11.580> whichever<00:02:12.580> way<00:02:12.850> you

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
amount there and now whichever way you

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.710 
amount there and now whichever way you
reel<00:02:13.270> it<00:02:14.310> now<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.760> right<00:02:15.910> direction<00:02:16.120> if

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
reel it now it is the right direction if

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.580 
reel it now it is the right direction if
your<00:02:16.960> left<00:02:17.140> hand<00:02:17.380> retreating<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:23.230> there's<00:02:23.440> a

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
your left hand retreating and there's a

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.590 
your left hand retreating and there's a
clicking<00:02:23.980> noise<00:02:24.010> clicks<00:02:24.880> on<00:02:25.090> which<00:02:25.480> is

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
clicking noise clicks on which is

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.200 
clicking noise clicks on which is
reverse<00:02:25.960> for<00:02:26.260> how<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:26.380> have<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.770> now<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:28.000> that's

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
reverse for how I have it now so that's

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.880 
reverse for how I have it now so that's
really<00:02:28.570> all<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:28.959> have<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.230> do<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.500> switch<00:02:29.680> from

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
really all you have to do to switch from

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.699 
really all you have to do to switch from
left<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.220> right<00:02:30.459> handed<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:31.780> cannot<00:02:32.170> do<00:02:32.440> this

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
left to right handed you cannot do this

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.830 
left to right handed you cannot do this
when<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.490> reel<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.790> filled<00:02:34.060> up<00:02:34.240> or<00:02:34.480> your<00:02:34.630> lines

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
when the reel is filled up or your lines

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.300 
when the reel is filled up or your lines
need<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.110> put<00:02:35.290> on<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.650> wrong<00:02:35.770> direction

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
need to put on the wrong direction

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.850 
need to put on the wrong direction
so<00:02:36.910> when<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:37.720> do<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:38.020> do<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.380> before<00:02:38.709> you

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
so when you do this do this before you

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.040 
so when you do this do this before you
fill<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.220> reel<00:02:39.430> up<00:02:39.670> then<00:02:40.150> put<00:02:40.480> your<00:02:40.630> line<00:02:40.810> on

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
fill the reel up then put your line on

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.110 
fill the reel up then put your line on
what<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.650> do<00:02:41.770> with<00:02:42.010> mine<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.489> actually<00:02:42.700> gets

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
what I do with mine is I actually gets

what I do with mine is I actually gets

cheap 20-pound fly back and fill it up
all<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.510> way<00:02:46.570> up<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.900> top<00:02:47.110> of<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.350> holes

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
all the way up to the top of the holes

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.040 
all the way up to the top of the holes
and<00:02:47.860> then<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.430> got<00:02:48.610> 50<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.120> 75<00:02:49.630> yards<00:02:49.930> of

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.670 
epoxy so there's your tip on how to
switch<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.750> spool<00:03:04.750> around<00:03:05.020> so<00:03:05.410> it's<00:03:05.560> the
