00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
frustrating I don't remember saying that

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.410 
frustrating I don't remember saying that
exactly<00:02:31.890> while<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.790> were<00:02:32.880> washing<00:02:33.060> out<00:02:33.300> the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
guess nothing that would get frustrating

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.980 
guess nothing that would get frustrating
about<00:02:47.520> it<00:02:47.730> sometimes<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:50.300> it's<00:02:51.300> hard<00:02:51.660> to

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
about it sometimes is it's hard to

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.750 
about it sometimes is it's hard to
really<00:02:52.530> get<00:02:52.770> in<00:02:52.920> there<00:02:53.040> at<00:02:53.220> first<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:53.640> real

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
really get in there at first it's real

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.010 
really get in there at first it's real
hard<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.000> get<00:02:54.210> somebody<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.600> give<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.870> a

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
hard to get somebody to give you a

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.590 
hard to get somebody to give you a
chance<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.830> know<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:57.360> still

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
chance you know and that that still

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.750 
chance you know and that that still
happens<00:02:58.020> sometimes<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.740> there's<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.520> feeling

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
happens sometimes you there's a feeling

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.150 
happens sometimes you there's a feeling
that<00:03:00.110> once<00:03:01.110> people<00:03:01.320> see<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.740> in<00:03:01.770> something

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
that once people see you in something

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.620 
that once people see you in something
that<00:03:02.340> they<00:03:02.520> want<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.940> continually<00:03:03.390> do<00:03:03.540> the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
that they want you to continually do the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.270 
that they want you to continually do the
same<00:03:03.840> thing<00:03:04.110> over<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.470> over<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:04.920> feel

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
same thing over and over and you feel

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.880 
same thing over and over and you feel
like<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:06.180> know<00:03:06.300> no<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.690> can<00:03:07.020> do<00:03:07.110> more<00:03:07.440> than<00:03:07.650> this

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
like you know no I can do more than this

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.290 
like you know no I can do more than this
so<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.280> can<00:03:08.400> be<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.520> little<00:03:08.610> frustrating<00:03:08.850> that

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
so that can be a little frustrating that

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.420 
so that can be a little frustrating that
and<00:03:10.140> indeed<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.500> went<00:03:10.680> through<00:03:10.860> auditions

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
and indeed you went through auditions

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.310 
and indeed you went through auditions
for<00:03:11.610> this<00:03:11.790> role<00:03:12.030> she<00:03:12.420> had<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.320> win<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:15.140> is<00:03:16.140> that

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
for this role she had to win it is that

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.870 
for this role she had to win it is that
unusual<00:03:16.910> no<00:03:17.910> not<00:03:18.180> for<00:03:18.390> me<00:03:18.420> Ivan<00:03:19.640> I've<00:03:20.640> had

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
unusual no not for me Ivan I've had

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.210 
unusual no not for me Ivan I've had
Edition<00:03:21.210> for<00:03:21.510> quite<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.320> few<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.650> them<00:03:22.890> okay<00:03:23.190> so

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
Edition for quite a few of them okay so

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.550 
Edition for quite a few of them okay so
dive<00:03:23.460> in<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:24.720> probably<00:03:24.810> feels<00:03:25.140> like<00:03:25.230> more<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.470> a

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
dive in it probably feels like more of a

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.170 
dive in it probably feels like more of a
triumph<00:03:25.980> if<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.370> have<00:03:26.490> to<00:03:26.610> win<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.790> than<00:03:27.060> if

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.120 
make a film yeah I like the auditioning
part<00:03:31.800> I've<00:03:32.460> always<00:03:32.700> really<00:03:32.880> enjoyed<00:03:33.300> it<00:03:33.540> and

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
part I've always really enjoyed it and

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.280 
part I've always really enjoyed it and
it's<00:03:35.130> just<00:03:35.250> fun<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.550> try<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.090> see<00:03:36.290> what

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
it's just fun to try that and see what

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.070 
it's just fun to try that and see what
you<00:03:37.410> do<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.830> feels<00:03:38.070> good<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.550> guess<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.960> it's

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
you do it feels good I guess so it's

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.830 
you do it feels good I guess so it's
there's<00:03:40.740> a<00:03:40.830> kind<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.820> joy<00:03:42.030> part<00:03:42.360> of<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.570> and

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
there's a kind of a joy part of it and

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.930 
there's a kind of a joy part of it and
but<00:03:43.290> it's<00:03:43.440> also<00:03:43.590> nice<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.010> somebody<00:03:44.370> he<00:03:44.760> says

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
but it's also nice and somebody he says

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.310 
but it's also nice and somebody he says
