00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
but in truth there is something

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.899 
but in truth there is something
interesting<00:01:44.409> going<00:01:44.530> on<00:01:44.799> with<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.010> scale<00:01:45.400> it

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
interesting going on with a scale it

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.060 
interesting going on with a scale it
seems<00:01:46.180> like<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.600> bigger<00:01:46.780> your<00:01:46.960> toy<00:01:47.200> gets<00:01:47.530> the

seems like the bigger your toy gets the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.820 
seems like the bigger your toy gets the
less<00:01:48.250> detailed<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:48.940> interesting<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.510> becomes

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
less detailed and interesting it becomes

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.140 
less detailed and interesting it becomes
he-man<00:01:50.830> was<00:01:51.040> a<00:01:51.070> lot<00:01:51.280> more<00:01:51.430> detailed<00:01:51.820> than<00:01:51.880> this

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150

this<00:03:28.400> doesn't<00:03:28.820> have<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.720> guess<00:03:30.260> if

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
this doesn't have that so I guess if

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.320 
this doesn't have that so I guess if

mirrors<00:04:30.509> another<00:04:31.439> thing<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:31.830> bothers<00:04:32.189> me<00:04:32.220> is

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
mirrors another thing that bothers me is

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.850 
mirrors another thing that bothers me is
that<00:04:32.819> there<00:04:33.150> are<00:04:33.240> no<00:04:33.389> access<00:04:33.990> doors<00:04:34.289> to<00:04:34.740> the

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
that there are no access doors to the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.279 
that there are no access doors to the
driver's<00:04:35.400> seat<00:04:35.639> so<00:04:35.909> the<00:04:36.569> turtles<00:04:36.960> have<00:04:37.169> to

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
driver's seat so the turtles have to

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.020 
driver's seat so the turtles have to
lift<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.800> roof<00:04:37.979> and<00:04:38.250> then<00:04:38.639> you<00:04:38.729> kind<00:04:38.909> of<00:04:38.969> have

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
lift the roof and then you kind of have

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.050 
lift the roof and then you kind of have
to<00:04:39.210> jam<00:04:39.900> them<00:04:40.110> in<00:04:40.259> at<00:04:40.379> an<00:04:40.439> angle<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:41.669> get<00:04:41.879> them

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
to jam them in at an angle to get them

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.059 
to jam them in at an angle to get them
to<00:04:42.180> fit<00:04:42.360> in<00:04:42.509> the<00:04:42.599> front<00:04:42.810> seat<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.439> vehicle

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
to fit in the front seat the vehicle

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.679 
to fit in the front seat the vehicle
doesn't<00:04:44.370> even<00:04:44.490> have<00:04:44.699> a<00:04:44.729> dashboard<00:04:45.449> or<00:04:45.659> a

doesn't even have a dashboard or a
steering<00:04:46.169> wheel<00:04:46.199> so<00:04:46.560> I<00:04:46.590> don't<00:04:46.830> understand<00:04:47.310> how

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
steering wheel so I don't understand how

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.100 
steering wheel so I don't understand how
the<00:04:47.550> turtles<00:04:47.909> are<00:04:48.000> even<00:04:48.330> driving<00:04:48.750> this<00:04:49.050> thing

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
the turtles are even driving this thing

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.159 
the turtles are even driving this thing
it's<00:04:49.889> just<00:04:50.009> a<00:04:50.370> big<00:04:50.639> plastic<00:04:50.969> terrarium<00:04:51.960> for
