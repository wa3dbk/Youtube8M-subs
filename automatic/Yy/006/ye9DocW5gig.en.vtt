00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 we are in a video in a new video of 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.429
 gameplay about this game I'm 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.080
 playing several days ago of 92 although 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.080
 issued before but 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.040
 but but what happens that the program with 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.750
 the one who recorded is now caught 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.200
 it turns out that I'm recording and when he left 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.750
 the thin recording I see that it is caught me 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.970
 Well, it's worth repeating it to repeat 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.279
 the whole process and I 'm very sorry 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.290
 but you have seen how I have put here 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.590
 the workers as I paid a 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.760
 fire but good in these next six 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.760
 minutes that this will last 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.240
 my head has gone in this gameplay 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.920
 looks and is taking a little shine the 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.390
 city ​​out there go the cars so that 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.360
 people go 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.270
 and the car for them helping this 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.430
 another one with the source to come out with the 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.050
 source well what I was counting 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.200
 in the other one 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.040
 gameplay that has not been recorded 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.790
 and the next thing to see I've built this 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.540
 new area that is here all this 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.880
 square apartment all 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.540
 all this part at this time I had is 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.340
 be here all this here 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.620
 and I have built this house that makes me 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.020
 missing but I need 17 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.640
 wood units I need other 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.010
 three wooden units to be able 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.870
 build this new apartment that 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.110
 put in both students 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.970
 students do not make points of 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.590
 Production not at the point of production 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.850
 points 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.979
 training point and say that then that 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.590
 for example if a fireman a policeman or 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.479
 someone needs form needs 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.090
 points then the students last 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.759
 points for living in the city for the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.759
 athlete age and apart they give us points 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.850
 and the capitalists because that the great 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.780
 money as I said in another video and the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.709
 workers 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:15.000
 they give us money and production points 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.800
 that with that we will have to produce 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.750
 labor let's look look for example here 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.910
 we already have some tomatoes that we have 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.760
 11,427 civil risks good we go here in 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.350
 the market and we can sell if we want 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.989
 sell we can sell tomatoes for 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.960
 example we have four 127 tomatoes put 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.120
 to move let's sell 100 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.620
 we put 100 here we put the price we go 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.620
 to put it to two insurances are 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:47.230
 well let's put 270 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.280
 it's little I'm going to put it just so that what 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.280
 you see is someone buys 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.030
 and wood to sell we are going to sell wood 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.030
 when we have 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.810
 16 units are few because you can 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.670
 then we need to 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:11.160
 to build the houses what was 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.730
 saying also in another video that I'm going to 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.830
 wait to have 15 thousand pesos to 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.590
 build here I'm going to start building 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.170
 here and because it's very easy because here 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.280
 we have a secret surprise building like this 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.680
 that will hide this land I do not know what 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.250
 we will see in the next 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.500
 gameplay there 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.510
 Well I hope that we are liked the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.890
 game although it's like that a little 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.510
 two 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.510
 but to pass the time it comes well 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.380
 to see kids and girls would like 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.680
 let's leave there on a program to 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.680
 Record 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.610
 well that's the gameplays 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.640
 that the one who used 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.260
 things would seem a little long 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.879
 to see to see come I want to put 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:20.630
 install the game that I bought a 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:22.550
 game for three euros of second-hand 395 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.930
 in a store where they buy and sell 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.290
 games so for three turkeys is not 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.290

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:21.400
 has not advanced much 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.390
 since I could not play then these 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.330
