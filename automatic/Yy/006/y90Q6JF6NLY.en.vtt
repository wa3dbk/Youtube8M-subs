what you do is basically if you're

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.490 
what you do is basically if you're
recording<00:00:17.130> or<00:00:17.490> if<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.910> want<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.150> monitor<00:00:18.500> with

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
more than one set of headphones have

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.640 
more than one set of headphones have
four<00:00:23.300> well<00:00:24.300> these<00:00:24.750> four<00:00:26.119> outputs<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:28.500> can

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
four well these four outputs so you can

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.700 
four well these four outputs so you can
run<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.039> line<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.580> from<00:00:30.119> say<00:00:30.330> stereo<00:00:31.109> mix

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
run it a line in from say stereo mix

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.830 
run it a line in from say stereo mix
into<00:00:32.430> here<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.000> then<00:00:33.239> listen<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.510> four

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
into here and then listen to four

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.290 
into here and then listen to four
headphones<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.950> also<00:00:35.100> then<00:00:35.340> daisy<00:00:35.610> chain<00:00:35.969> one

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
headphones can also then daisy chain one

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.680 
headphones can also then daisy chain one
of<00:00:36.420> these<00:00:36.570> out<00:00:37.340> into<00:00:38.340> here<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:39.390> exactly

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
of these out into here and do exactly

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.350 
of these out into here and do exactly
the<00:00:39.989> same<00:00:40.020> thing<00:00:40.670> these<00:00:41.670> are<00:00:41.730> pretty

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the same thing these are pretty

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.979 
the same thing these are pretty
inexpensive<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.640> i<00:00:44.640> bought<00:00:45.420> one<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
inexpensive and i bought one just to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.299 
inexpensive and i bought one just to
sort<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.230> throw<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> floor<00:00:46.860> when<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.160> do

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
sort of throw on the floor when we do

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.190 
sort of throw on the floor when we do
record<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.390> ever<00:00:48.570> i<00:00:48.660> could<00:00:48.870> run<00:00:48.989> their

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
record so ever i could run their

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.090 
record so ever i could run their
extension<00:00:49.710> cables<00:00:50.489> into<00:00:51.500> one<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:52.739> jacks

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
extension cables into one of these jacks

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250 
extension cables into one of these jacks
and<00:00:53.399> i<00:00:53.670> found<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.210> these<00:00:54.570> things<00:00:54.780> were<00:00:54.960> great

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and i found that these things were great

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.900 
and i found that these things were great
i<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.219> liked<00:00:56.460> them<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.670> think<00:00:56.850> I

of<00:01:28.110> their<00:01:28.200> mixes<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.829> they've<00:01:29.009> done<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> great

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
of their mixes so they've done a great

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.730 
of their mixes so they've done a great
job<00:01:29.460> up<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.790> ISM<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.960> their<00:01:31.079> price<00:01:31.290> they

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
job up in ISM and for their price they

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.670 
job up in ISM and for their price they
do<00:01:31.799> exactly<00:01:32.759> what<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.240> want<00:01:33.450> them<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> do<00:01:33.840> but

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
do exactly what you want them to do but

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.109 
do exactly what you want them to do but
the<00:01:34.770> main<00:01:34.920> question<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.430> how<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.729> they<00:01:35.820> sound

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the main question is how do they sound

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.719 
the main question is how do they sound
well<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:37.470> you've<00:01:37.619> got<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> good<00:01:38.040> signal<00:01:38.549> going

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
well if you've got a good signal going

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.380 
well if you've got a good signal going
into<00:01:38.880> these<00:01:39.180> these<00:01:39.479> things<00:01:39.659> are<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.170> loud<00:01:40.409> like

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
into these these things are so loud like

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.480 
into these these things are so loud like
even<00:01:42.390> drummers<00:01:42.810> won't<00:01:43.049> max<00:01:43.350> these<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:43.829> when

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
even drummers won't max these out when

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.660 
even drummers won't max these out when
we're<00:01:44.759> recording<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.840> they<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:46.710> push<00:01:47.130> some

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
we're recording so they do push some

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.440 
we're recording so they do push some
serious<00:01:48.270> volume

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
serious volume

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.390 
serious volume
the<00:01:49.930> quality<00:01:50.500> volume<00:01:50.799> that<00:01:50.920> doesn't<00:01:51.220> do

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
the quality volume that doesn't do

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.370 
the quality volume that doesn't do
anything<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.000> sound<00:01:52.270> other<00:01:52.479> than<00:01:52.689> amplify

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
anything to the sound other than amplify

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.139 
anything to the sound other than amplify
it<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.670> extend<00:01:55.540> it<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.960> more<00:01:56.590> than<00:01:56.710> one

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
it and extend it to more than one

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.700 
it and extend it to more than one
listening<00:01:58.149> source<00:01:58.420> which<00:01:58.720> is<00:01:58.899> exactly<00:01:59.409> what<00:01:59.680> I

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
listening source which is exactly what I

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.980 
listening source which is exactly what I
wanted<00:02:00.009> so<00:02:00.070> I<00:02:00.820> ended<00:02:01.299> up<00:02:01.360> with<00:02:01.540> two<00:02:01.720> of<00:02:01.840> these

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
wanted so I ended up with two of these

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.039 
wanted so I ended up with two of these
and<00:02:02.409> they're<00:02:03.070> sitting<00:02:03.399> on<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.759> box<00:02:03.970> AC<00:02:04.330> 15

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
and they're sitting on the box AC 15

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.320 
and they're sitting on the box AC 15
because<00:02:05.710> it<00:02:05.830> makes<00:02:06.039> them<00:02:06.190> that<00:02:07.090> much<00:02:07.299> more

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
because it makes them that much more

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.780 
because it makes them that much more
awesome<00:02:07.539> so<00:02:08.319> they<00:02:09.009> are<00:02:09.780> very<00:02:10.780> very<00:02:11.080> cool
