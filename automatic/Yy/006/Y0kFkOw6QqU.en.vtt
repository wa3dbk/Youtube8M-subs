00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
it stop sign so uh I think we know what

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.959 
it stop sign so uh I think we know what
what<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.779> expect<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.460> clearly<00:00:32.460> Peppermill<00:00:32.850> is

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
what to expect and clearly Peppermill is
