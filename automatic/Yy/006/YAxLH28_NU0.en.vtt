00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.100
 game comes out on February 10 because done 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.160
 this video you know I like it 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.900
 a lot of tennis I like to play tennis 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.879
 like to play tennis video games 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.440
 I especially like the topspin I do not like 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.660
 much the virtua tennis that is the truth 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.399
 for tastes the colors and then good 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.080
 I've done some top spin 4 videos in 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.440
 my channel and now as a new one comes out 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.240
 game grand slam tennis 2 the truth is 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.160
 that the one I could not prove what this is 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.320
 electronic arts, I decided to 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.560
 try it to see how it is to see if I 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.830
 like and nothing I do a little review 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.180
 a small some small impressions of 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.280
 what appeared to me with this demo that 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.930
 I do not give much for things I do not 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.729
 you like realism, you are seeing it here 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.009
 the players are very realistic about 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.899
 they all have the rights to be able to 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.610
 put the four big slams that's why there 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.770
 you see that these wimbledon and it looks like 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.990
 wimbledon and put wimbledon 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.200
 the top spin 4 that do not have the rights 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.369
 of the tournaments and therefore not so 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.619
 less of the big ones therefore not 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.210
 you can put the name then that's 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.189
 the good part the realism of the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.469
 scenarios the players have to 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:01.219
 nadal to djokovic to federer has also 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:04.159
 legends in the style of nba 2k have a 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.450
 mcenroe have edberg have the 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.450
 truth is that I do not remember I think that 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.280
 it's fine because there are the two williams 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.830
 well there's a lot of pete 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.750
 sampras there are a lot of players come out 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.799
 in the marathon trailers and you see it out there 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.410
 it is better that those are the parts 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.090
 the part good part and I think that 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.560
 you can create players also clear in 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.329
 the demo is not seen much either because only 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.790
 you can play this game at the best of 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.739
 three sets in wimbledon between nadal and 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.510
 djokovic the truth that neither gives for 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.610
 more the demo but good they have their 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.459
 repetitions and so on those are the things 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.069
 that I like, I 'd say it's a mixture 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.140
 between the realism of topspin and the arcade 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.940
 of virtua tennis as I say try to be 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.250
 faithful with the details but and you see how to 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.600
 Sometimes the little balls of colors 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.130
 function of the effect you have given him and 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.290
 good has a little bit of 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.420
 of arcade that is the part that I do not 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.070
 like of virtua tennis the movements and 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.080
 all are very arcade the displacement 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.490
 down the track all that if you like 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.290
 virtual tennis probably also os 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.500
 will like this game if you like the top 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.510
 spin 4 I do not know if you will like this so much 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.680
 it would have to see everything the whole game 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.000
 no yes when I go out to see if I get it and 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.050
 I make some video for avon for whom 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.120
 have interest as I said at the beginning 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.470
 if you do not like tennis videos 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.880
 rest assured that the next video my 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.550
 channel will be something completely 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.110
 different but I wanted to do this 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.420
 elsa that as you can see I'm having 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.240
 some problems with rafa nadal the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.670
 service method is a bit complicated the 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.470
 true 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.200
 he has not been able to practice much but 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.260
 as you can see the shot out more messages than 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.569
 inside everything is also practice to the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.940
 time to choose the type of shot if such 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.620
 board everything is getting used the truth is 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.930
 which is a little different from the top spin 4 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.970
 but but hey it's okay try 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.260
 try to look like what tennis is 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.780
 good has has I believe good ideas 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.970
 this played it in easy mode sorry in 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.120
 amateur mode I think it's called the mode 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.829
 pro that is the I think there are three levels 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.450
 and the one that I am how many in the middle and 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.120
 pro mode is the hard one to do it and good 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.700
 in pro win mode win the game but 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.230
 it lasted me like 15 minutes and I said man 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.090
 I'm going to raise better a beating that 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.530
 djokovic goals because in reality 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.930
 you always win djokovic and lose nadal 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.239
 well, at least those who at least 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.329
 As I go with nadal, do not look at it 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.320
 you take it then we feel like at least 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.510
 win the video games 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.090
 Finally, as you can see there are some 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.530
 repetitions does not have much more to download 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.199
 the demo if you are interested if you like the 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.120
 try it do not lose anything occupies a 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:34.229
 guide anything you try it and even the game 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.510
 as I say it goes out on February 10 to 10 and 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.010
 Well now we have to try it you know 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.680
 that I like video games 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.840
 sports both basketball and in this 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.760
 tennis case the fifa i also like 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.060
 although I just play and well I'm glad 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.699
 what electronic arts s goal to do tennis 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.960
 because the truth is that you who know 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.310
 what I like I like what they do 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.020
 basketball I like what they do 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.710
 tennis but I like it a lot more than 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.290
 competition 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.450
 and since electronic I stop doing the 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.180
 nba games in mnba live 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.970
 disappeared because it seems good to me that 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.960
 always take out new games and also 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.910
 well with the fifa he does it very well 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.680
 to see if with tennis also 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.090
 get a game that hooks not 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.900
 hooks a little to those who want 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.320
 arcade and also to those who want 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.479
 how it's actually called more simulation 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.210
 I'm finally here beating the beating 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.820
 of the century to my friend not 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.750
 you have noticed how it gets well in the 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.729
 underpants 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.340
 nadal this is good starting point 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.860
 we go rafa you can to another thing that 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:38.570
 it's very well hoped that he won there is 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.669
 in celebrating well another thing that is fine 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.440
 of this game are the comments 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.330
 fifa style you're john mcenroe and 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.340
 podcast at least in this version of 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.139
 demo I do not know if in the Spanish will be 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.760
 comments in Spanish I'm sorry it's not going to 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.320
 that the next one will be and that's fine 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.669
 there are also tennis comments no no 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.440
 it's just the environment I think 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.460
 this is an interesting addition in order 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.260
 I hope you liked this video 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.330
 that you have endured until the end and if 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.180
 we like it calm that the next one will be 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.460
 different a little kiss for all up 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.060
 then 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.060
 goodbye
