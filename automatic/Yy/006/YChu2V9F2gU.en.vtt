00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.010
 Panasonic has a new with the nx100 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.380
 highend compact camera model presented 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.090
 the short lx reminds a bit 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.990
 the lx 7 is also correct is the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.790
 same series 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.830
 that is so that the nx100 not 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.330
 about the following model of lx 7 is 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.580
 this one stays in the program 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.140
 the nx100 is going up all the way up now 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.550
 that really means that 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.180
 absolute high end model of this series 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.699
 his 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.090
 the design reminds the nx100 of the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.040
 For example, lc1 from 2004 can be seen here 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.450
 At the top of the line we have 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.329
 a time advice that he already from the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.500
 Scan lc and one of the highlights 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.750
 this camera we have one 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.370
 electronic viewfinder had the lc1 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.770
 but already it is now 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.719
 of course higher resolution and up-to-date 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.870
 offers more features so many 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.610
 details will be displayed 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.469
 The camera comes first and foremost 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.670
 photographers benefit from their camera 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.930
 set manually 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.719
 As I said we have one up here 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.090
 times advice we also have a wheel 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.859
 For the exposure discount we all have 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.140
 a separate dazzle ring here in front 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.280
 objectively, by the way, a very bright 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.439
 objective with 24 75 millimeters maximum 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.689
 Aperture is really great at 17 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.119
 very bright directly behind it is a 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.500
 advice for the manual focus 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.680
 means I can really comfortable here 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.360
 if I want to do that manually 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.860
 turn and switch as I would like and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.630
 directly behind it another switch 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.100
 we actually already from the lx 7 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.630
 know here can be namely the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.079
 different recording formats 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.280
 adjust as for example 3 216 911 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.840
 or 43 we come to the outside 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.780
 impress to the actual highlight 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.600
 the x100 is different from the lx 7 which is still 1 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.670
 1 by 1.7 inch sensor could have the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.530
 100 lx with a big four thirds 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.060
 sensor come up with the four thirds sensor 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.610
 we actually know from panasonics 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.049
 Mirrorless system cameras like a gag 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.909
 7 or one gh 4 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.829
 the difference is that here in the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.560
 x100 not the whole sensor area 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.240
 is used but only from the 16 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.490
 available megapixels 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.229
 only 12 8 are used be it 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.240
 Overall, a bit smaller area but 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.789
 still much bigger than the 1 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.009
 inch sensors in for example a fz 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.260
 1000 from panasonic also very 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.090
 good in the picture results 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.379
 has cut the new larger one 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.180
 Of course sensor surface also brings 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.459
 advantages in image quality with it 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.019
 the first practical recordings are effective 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.030
 the pictures very sharp and detailed 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.060
 Of course we will continue 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.530
 advantages in the image design by us 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.090
 for example, very nice motives 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.430
 Blurred background crop 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.650
 we can get there very much in the case 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.590
 wide open aperture with 11 17 very 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.109
 another highlight of the new 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.829
 sensors is video recording in 4k 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.560
 resolution 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.870
 so that's the nx100 after the gh 4 and 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.879
 the fz 1000 the third panasonic 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.650
 digital camera with video recordings 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.980
 high hd high resolution 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.530
 is filmed with 25 full frames in 4k 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.810
 mode or with 50 frames if we 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.239
 in full hd record the crew in 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.250
 This camera has a 4K photo 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.709
 mode is on then can 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.319
 the camera all 25 recorded 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.480
 full frames as single photos play 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.280
 say we have photos in eight megapixels 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.239
 resolution so they do not miss any 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.129
 moment are still enough 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.769
 Resolutions if for example in din 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.930
 still want to print a3 format 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.669
 say that of course the nx100 with 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.239
 equipped with an internal wlan module 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.310
 is 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.169
 means we can both pictures to the 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.329
 transferred as well as the smartphone 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.609
 remote control camera via smartphone 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.549
 The connection is made either 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.049
 about nfc that means if you have a nfc 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.519
 suitable mobile phone has you can 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.010
 the connection will be easy 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.590
 automatically built or you will have 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.090
 for smartphones the no nfc 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.489
 support such as the example 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.440
 iphone then you have the possibility over 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.310
 to show the camera a QR code 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.959
 you can do that with the smartphone 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.480
 Scan and then the connection 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.400
 also built 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.780
 our conclusion panasonic succeeds with the 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.940
 nx100 a really exciting 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.340
 compact camera with big sensor 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.040
 good picture quality of a great 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.329
 manual operation and 4k videos 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.349
 especially the experienced photographer 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.349
 fallen
