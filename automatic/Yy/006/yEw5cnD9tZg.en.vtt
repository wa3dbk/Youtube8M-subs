 I'm talking about kim kardashian a lot 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.489
 important for this he is the basis

 in fact in kim kardashian it has a base 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.940
 perfect 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.399
 I have already treated my skin and therefore 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.410
 start by applying a light primer 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.480
 function to better prepare the skin 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.270
 to the foundation but at the same time the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.739
 levity and minimizes the resulting holes 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.449
 African when you want a base 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.699

 in fact the primer to the function also to 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.989
 increase the hold of the TV bottom one 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.699
 once applied we wait a few 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.920
 according to product dry but from 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.920
 minimizing heap and applying a 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.650
 corrector field the product without 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.990
 serious charlot otherwise I'll pull of the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.880
 table color until the product 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.590
 I am not completely uniform 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.360
 foundation I start from the center of mine 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.640
 notice as the area you usually 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.560
 needs more coverage starts 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.190
 spreading foundation and without depriving 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.660
 I know another product 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:34.090
 neck and old ones at least reproduce 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.310
 kim's contouring make-up can't 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.500
 lack but television so dimensions 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.090
 of light to all the lightest corrector 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.640
 under my eyes 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.980
 in the center of the nose of the forehead and chin 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.170
 and to optically render the lips 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.230
 voluminous I applied them on the arc of 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.500
 puppets realizable for the shadow areas instead d 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.010
 under my bunting under the chin of 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.930
 jaw and the art of my step source 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.630
 very important and blend a good 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.890
 rather buffered the product up to 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.310
 when it is not completely 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.810
 homogeneous that we are in all that in 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.060
 that of figures in the areas of light and 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.070
 so colorful shadow curse 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.360
 doing we will go to emphasize our own 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.880
 consumption let's move on to make-up eyes open 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.920
 with primer the primer which one for the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.660
 face to the function of increasing the 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.880
 eye shadow and at the same time 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.560
 time to avoid the same care ante 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.360
 product that is formed on the eyelid 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.250
 especially when a lot of roses a 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.180
 buffer in products with fingers up to 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.790
 its total absorption must be achieved 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.459
 my start at the canon the corner 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.470
 inside a very bright eye shadow and mi 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.590
 stop just before my goal of 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.040
 own mobile on the remaining eyelid 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.870
 mobile 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.160
 I apply a brown eye shadow that I do 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.150
 spumone the first to anticipate dear enemy 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.549
 apply 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.769
 an exterior a black eyeshadow let's try to 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:01.480
 fade outwards to the waist 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:03.340
 to lengthen the gaze must be faded 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.680
 to the eye shadow previously applied 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.819
 with an intermediate perfume organ 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.379
 developing the nuance upwards 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.010
 I apply a pencil in the internal rhyme 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.180
 brown I'll tell you a little trick 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.459
 place the mine in the pencil in the 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.709
 your outer corner close your eye 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.290
 and move the other peter's pencil as well 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.379
 by applying the pencil in blood 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.629
 and rim jim loves very much to fade the rhyme 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.299
 lower then with a very small brush 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.989
 small than a brown object mark way 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.159
 to intensify the lower mary 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.470
 like all light under the arch 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:41.859
 eyebrow opens with a very cat 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.129
 similar to my keane incarnate I am already 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:47.260
 a very intense black liner with 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.989
 laner rears going to draw a line 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.420
 starts from eternal corner damage by thickening 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:57.400
 the outward that creating one 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.290
 small final queues very important 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.510
 for the look of kim kardashian only the 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.430
 fake eyelashes indeed neither usually of the 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.230
 taste always two pairs then ad 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.560
 apply before the fake exile 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.670
 the inter e 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.920
 then false eyelashes 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.440
 whole but different lengths of the la 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.880
 glue and just 30 seconds I stick 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.680
 first the central part e 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.060
 later as laterals 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.680
 don't worry if that still 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.549
 white because once dried 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.549
 will become transparent 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.850
 I apply abundant mascara on my eyelashes 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.139
 higher than on the lower ones 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.300
 effect of zigzag movements 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:36.350
 asking for the bra part in this way 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:39.530
 we will avoid forming clones a 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.270
 I apply a duplicate caught blush 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.350
 center of my cheeks that implement 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.450

 nothing lips when the eyes are 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.550
