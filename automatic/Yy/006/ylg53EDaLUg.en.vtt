each one gives a different thing it has
got<00:05:07.510> errors<00:05:07.750> but<00:05:07.930> doesn't<00:05:08.140> seem<00:05:08.260> that<00:05:08.290> you<00:05:08.410> can

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
got errors but doesn't seem that you can

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.920 
got errors but doesn't seem that you can
change<00:05:08.830> it<00:05:09.040> so<00:05:09.940> if<00:05:10.000> i<00:05:10.090> give<00:05:10.270> him<00:05:10.360> 14<00:05:10.750> raw

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
not sure if it's specific to what type

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.380 
not sure if it's specific to what type
of<00:05:18.010> villager<00:05:18.460> enris<00:05:18.790> but<00:05:18.970> at<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.090> moment<00:05:19.210> it

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
of villager enris but at the moment it

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.230 
of villager enris but at the moment it
just<00:05:19.419> needs<00:05:19.720> to<00:05:19.750> be<00:05:19.810> random<00:05:20.260> and<00:05:20.970> if<00:05:21.970> i<00:05:22.060> give

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
just needs to be random and if i give

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.180 
just needs to be random and if i give
him<00:05:22.330> one<00:05:22.570> and<00:05:23.470> then<00:05:23.650> we'll<00:05:23.680> give<00:05:23.919> me<00:05:23.980> five

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190

apples
so<00:05:27.379> that's<00:05:27.500> cool<00:05:27.970> does<00:05:28.970> seem<00:05:29.150> to<00:05:29.180> be<00:05:29.300> a<00:05:29.389> few

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:29.629 
so that's cool does seem to be a few

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:34.179 
so that's cool does seem to be a few
bugs<00:05:29.840> like<00:05:30.020> well<00:05:30.889> generating<00:05:33.189> especially

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:34.189 
bugs like well generating especially

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.670 
bugs like well generating especially
under<00:05:34.340> flat<00:05:34.610> maps<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:35.870> village<00:05:36.319> is<00:05:36.439> just

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
under flat maps the village is just

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.290 
under flat maps the village is just
seemed<00:05:36.830> to<00:05:36.919> be<00:05:37.009> like<00:05:37.099> half<00:05:37.400> cut<00:05:37.699> off<00:05:37.879> and<00:05:38.270> the

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
seemed to be like half cut off and the

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.830 
seemed to be like half cut off and the
blocks<00:05:38.840> are<00:05:38.990> there<00:05:39.169> you<00:05:39.319> just<00:05:39.439> can't<00:05:39.680> see<00:05:39.889> them

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
blocks are there you just can't see them

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.839 
blocks are there you just can't see them
so<00:05:41.840> hopefully<00:05:42.289> that's<00:05:42.469> fixed<00:05:42.860> soon<00:05:43.039> you'll

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
so hopefully that's fixed soon you'll

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.240 
so hopefully that's fixed soon you'll
give<00:05:44.000> me<00:05:44.030> six<00:05:44.659> of<00:05:44.840> them<00:05:44.990> six<00:05:45.500> apples<00:05:45.889> for<00:05:46.129> one

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
emerald that's pretty cool as a set of

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.159 
emerald that's pretty cool as a set of
down<00:05:51.139> if<00:05:51.259> it's<00:05:52.150> like<00:05:53.150> I<00:05:53.479> don't<00:05:53.870> if<00:05:53.960> you<00:05:54.020> get

a<00:06:07.009> that's<00:06:07.250> pretty<00:06:07.580> much<00:06:07.669> it<00:06:07.729> there<00:06:08.389> is<00:06:08.509> a<00:06:08.539> few

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
a that's pretty much it there is a few

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.600 
a that's pretty much it there is a few
bugs<00:06:08.990> so<00:06:09.229> it<00:06:09.379> just<00:06:09.620> expect<00:06:09.979> the<00:06:10.039> man<00:06:10.219> is<00:06:10.580> a

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
bugs so it just expect the man is a

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.200 
bugs so it just expect the man is a
