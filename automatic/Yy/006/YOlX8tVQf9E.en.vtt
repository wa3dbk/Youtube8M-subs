 final are more to know than it is 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.849
 it is not the role that the stone treasure that 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.050
 I play this little game, his name. 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:37.500
 it will be called multiple scissors 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.410

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.550
 were in the stone because tite of 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.280
 neodi paper epa scissors such easy 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.329
 to really decorate you will make three 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.829
 finishes as well as on paper stone scissors 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.180
 only what are the rules of this game? 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.489
 which is different 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.469
 first the stone scissors paper or 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.559
 stone scissors paper 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.180
 his name is carol and raul shrink raul 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.250
 They tell me ipo 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.020
 so to play the motive is the first 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.770
 starts with neighborhood raul 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.330
 You see you're going to start attacking example. 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.850
 since I do not have someone who 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.939
 Participate to help me, you know, I will. 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.960
 make myself a player player 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.570
 two let's make the car go calm flight and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.150
 raul in coconut for example the player 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.460
 won from player 2 but it is not here that 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.710
 end the game the player has broken 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.350
 To attack by doing what ? 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.689
 switching the signal or keeping the signal only 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.380
 that you're going to have to shout you have to 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.899
 talk in the end you will change or keep 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.810
 for example I'm here in the nations 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.880
 playing together is attacking as for example 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.340
 She'll tell you why she'll change the 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.350
 Team Sign Player 2 is going 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.560
 do and will defend himself he is here 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.500
 with the duck crouch the player in a 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.780
 oven and made grit and at the same time 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.300
 at the same time he said you will 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.670
 change the end or even 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.900
 then for example the second player to keep 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.850
 the pa 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.760
 he will have an advantage he will also 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:17.000
 able to change or maintain the signal 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:21.870
 now player 2 will talk about a 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.440
 player a feast also missed understand 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.140
 The game is difficult to understand so now. 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.560
 which is but briefly so, so the 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.890
 first agent hat quadrants oura and 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.870
 who wins will have cover day advantage 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.720
 the house she does even she will 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.940
 change or keep shouting was not 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.520
 a signal name and if the opponent is the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.740
 same sign and loses and for him to be able 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.200
 to gain the book of avoiding 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.880
 put on the same sign as the other 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.590
 try to guess 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.820
 I think watching the game, you'll be able to 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.440
 understand better 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.450
 so let's go and ask for help for my 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:05.250
 friend ok she will not want to appear 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:10.320
 but her daughter is going to be a movie 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:14.670
 that we are going to teach how it is done 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:22.890
 a lot where we start with anger 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:24.450
 first or not she escaped and she 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.880
 changed sign 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.800
 now it is at the advantage to involve 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.270
 What if she's going to attack me? 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.980
 managed to escape but I continue to 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.390
 disadvantage because she is going to choose 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.390
 one again at the end 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:56.620
 okay I'll then I missed that crap 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.150
 but let's go for another round 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:53.310
 for those who have not yet understood 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:53.310
 Can you understand what's good? 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:26.429

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:31.929
