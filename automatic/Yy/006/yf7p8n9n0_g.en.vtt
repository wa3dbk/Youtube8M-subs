and<00:01:49.829> they<00:01:50.579> read<00:01:50.729> some<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> noise<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:52.110> the

and they read some of the noise on the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.510 
and they read some of the noise on the
internet<00:01:52.799> well<00:01:53.280> which<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:55.520> everyone

internet well which is it for everyone
who's<00:01:56.850> making<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.240> difference<00:01:57.770> there<00:01:58.770> will<00:01:58.979> be

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
who's making a difference there will be

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.280 
who's making a difference there will be
a<00:01:59.399> handful<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.939> critics<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.540> there's<00:02:01.110> an

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
a handful of critics and there's an

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.410 
a handful of critics and there's an
amazing<00:02:01.770> study<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.430> says<00:02:02.640> those<00:02:02.939> who<00:02:02.969> approach

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
amazing study it says those who approach

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.569 
amazing study it says those who approach
the<00:02:03.689> world<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> skeptical<00:02:04.890> view<00:02:05.100> have

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
the world with a skeptical view have

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.639 
the world with a skeptical view have
three<00:02:06.180> times<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.810> level<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.290> senile

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
three times the level of senile

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.850 
three times the level of senile
cognitive<00:02:08.220> dementia<00:02:08.670> later<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.119> life<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.860> you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
cognitive dementia later in life so you

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.800 
cognitive dementia later in life so you
need<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.220> look<00:02:11.400> at<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.879> source<00:02:12.150> where<00:02:12.690> it's

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
need to look at the source where it's

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.430 
need to look at the source where it's
coming<00:02:12.989> from

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
coming from

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.020 
coming from
and<00:02:13.530> what<00:02:13.800> conflicts<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.370> interest<00:02:14.700> there<00:02:14.910> are

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
and what conflicts of interest there are

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.270 
and what conflicts of interest there are
because<00:02:15.810> when<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.200> look<00:02:16.470> at<00:02:16.620> critics<00:02:16.950> online

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
because when I look at critics online

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.430 
because when I look at critics online
there<00:02:17.790> are<00:02:18.210> very<00:02:18.540> angry<00:02:18.780> people<00:02:19.110> who

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
there are very angry people who

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.610 
there are very angry people who
obviously<00:02:19.740> need<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.250> most<00:02:20.430> brain<00:02:20.670> scans<00:02:21.000> and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
obviously need the most brain scans and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.840 
obviously need the most brain scans and
there<00:02:22.620> are<00:02:22.770> people<00:02:22.890> with<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.280> conflict<00:02:23.760> of

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
there are people with the conflict of

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.940 
there are people with the conflict of
interest<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.480> those<00:02:25.110> are<00:02:25.290> pretty<00:02:25.530> much<00:02:25.710> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
interest and those are pretty much the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.530 
interest and those are pretty much the
only<00:02:25.980> two<00:02:26.370> kinds<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.000> sometimes<00:02:27.360> they're

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
only two kinds and sometimes they're

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.940 
only two kinds and sometimes they're
even<00:02:27.570> connections<00:02:28.200> between<00:02:28.350> those<00:02:28.560> people

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
even connections between those people

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.550 
even connections between those people
but<00:02:29.790> when<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.360> published<00:02:30.750> as<00:02:30.870> much<00:02:31.050> science

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
but when you published as much science

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.380 
but when you published as much science
as<00:02:31.740> you<00:02:31.800> have<00:02:32.190> when<00:02:32.790> you've<00:02:32.910> written<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.150> dozen

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
as you have when you've written a dozen

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.050 
as you have when you've written a dozen
books<00:02:33.840> when<00:02:34.680> you've<00:02:34.800> got<00:02:35.010> thousands<00:02:35.910> and

your<00:03:37.050> skin<00:03:37.430> what<00:03:38.430> did<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.820> do<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.840> your

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
your skin what did it do to your

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.550 
your skin what did it do to your
relationship<00:03:42.840> with<00:03:43.080> your<00:03:43.260> blood<00:03:45.560> my

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
relationship with your blood my

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.290 
relationship with your blood my
relationship<00:03:47.220> with<00:03:47.250> my<00:03:47.489> brain<00:03:47.700> changed<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.150> lot

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
relationship with my brain changed a lot

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.340 
relationship with my brain changed a lot
because<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:49.430> don't<00:03:50.430> identify<00:03:51.030> myself<00:03:51.780> as<00:03:52.110> being

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
because I don't identify myself as being

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.670 
because I don't identify myself as being
my<00:03:52.470> brain<00:03:52.709> and<00:03:52.980> when<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:54.600> this<00:03:54.750> day<00:03:54.959> something

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
my brain and when to this day something

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.620 
my brain and when to this day something
happens<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.430> don't<00:03:56.760> like<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.000> isn't

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
happens that I don't like that isn't

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.880 
happens that I don't like that isn't
like<00:03:57.840> me<00:03:58.790> what<00:03:59.790> am<00:03:59.910> i<00:04:00.030> bring<00:04:00.330> do<00:04:00.540> not<00:04:01.380> what<00:04:01.739> did

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
like me what am i bring do not what did

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.830 
like me what am i bring do not what did
I<00:04:01.980> do<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.970> difference<00:04:03.390> there<00:04:03.480> is

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
I do and the difference there is

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.140 
I do and the difference there is
profound<00:04:04.320> because<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:05.220> can<00:04:05.430> control<00:04:05.580> what<00:04:06.030> my

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
profound because I can control what my

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.390 
profound because I can control what my
brain<00:04:06.330> does<00:04:06.390> but<00:04:07.320> I<00:04:07.350> am<00:04:07.500> NOT<00:04:07.709> my<00:04:07.890> brain<00:04:08.130> and

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
brain does but I am NOT my brain and

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.140 
brain does but I am NOT my brain and
that<00:04:08.730> for<00:04:09.150> me<00:04:09.330> was<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.690> huge<00:04:09.959> thing<00:04:10.530> because<00:04:11.150> it

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
that for me was a huge thing because it

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.180 
that for me was a huge thing because it
allowed<00:04:12.660> me<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.870> be<00:04:13.080> more<00:04:13.290> forgiving<00:04:13.890> for

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
allowed me to be more forgiving for

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.159 
allowed me to be more forgiving for
myself<00:04:14.550> and<00:04:14.760> also<00:04:15.330> when<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:15.540> look<00:04:15.930> at<00:04:16.049> other

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
myself and also when I look at other

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.729 
myself and also when I look at other
people<00:04:16.620> wow<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:18.720> that<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:19.169> person<00:04:19.530> actually

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
people wow is that that person actually

people wow is that that person actually
an<00:04:20.070> evil<00:04:20.370> person<00:04:20.549> or<00:04:21.090> is<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.359> person<00:04:21.690> who's

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
they're acting that way without their

they're acting that way without their
own<00:04:30.370> knowledge<00:04:30.850> without<00:04:31.510> their<00:04:31.660> own<00:04:31.690> consent
