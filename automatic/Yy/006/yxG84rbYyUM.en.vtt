one arm which is this arm candy Bend is
elbow<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.359> he<00:01:27.450> can't<00:01:28.280> obviously<00:01:29.280> now

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
elbow on this one he can't obviously now

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.999 
elbow on this one he can't obviously now
if<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.569> wondering<00:01:30.869> how<00:01:30.960> he<00:01:31.049> broke<00:01:31.259> he<00:01:31.859> just

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
if you wondering how he broke he just

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.749 
if you wondering how he broke he just
broke<00:01:33.560> we<00:01:34.560> got<00:01:34.709> him<00:01:34.860> out<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.100> box<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.579> day

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
broke we got him out of the box one day

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.279 
broke we got him out of the box one day
and<00:01:36.259> then<00:01:37.259> his<00:01:37.979> arm<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.219> broke<00:01:38.579> off<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.990> they

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
and then his arm just broke off so they

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.219 
and then his arm just broke off so they
didn't<00:01:40.799> make<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.950> very<00:01:41.100> sturdy<00:01:41.990> for<00:01:42.990> some

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
didn't make it very sturdy for some

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.109 
didn't make it very sturdy for some
reason<00:01:43.590> super<00:01:43.979> glue<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.459> soft<00:01:44.729> figure

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
reason super glue on this soft figure

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.240 
reason super glue on this soft figure
worked<00:01:45.780> out<00:01:45.959> but<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.469> 1i<00:01:46.679> dent<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.130> my

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
worked out but on this 1i dent so my

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.300 
worked out but on this 1i dent so my
guess<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.459> the<00:01:47.789> paint<00:01:48.030> had<00:01:48.209> a<00:01:48.240> reaction<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.869> it

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
guess is the paint had a reaction to it

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.609 
guess is the paint had a reaction to it
so<00:01:50.310> that's<00:01:50.849> why<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.030> super<00:01:51.810> glue<00:01:51.959> on<00:01:52.110> him<00:01:52.409> is

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
so that's why this super glue on him is

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.330 
so that's why this super glue on him is
more<00:01:52.799> obvious<00:01:52.920> been<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.549> one<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:55.340> he's

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
more obvious been on this one and he's

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.289 
more obvious been on this one and he's
pretty<00:01:56.610> accurate<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.390> i<00:01:57.599> mean<00:01:58.259> solid<00:01:58.860> ice

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
pretty accurate really i mean solid ice

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.609 
pretty accurate really i mean solid ice
you<00:02:00.299> can<00:02:00.329> actually<00:02:00.539> tell<00:02:00.899> talking<00:02:01.349> as<00:02:01.469> he

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
you can actually tell talking as he

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.850 
you can actually tell talking as he
stands<00:02:03.319> approximately<00:02:06.049> six<00:02:07.049> inches<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.619> little
