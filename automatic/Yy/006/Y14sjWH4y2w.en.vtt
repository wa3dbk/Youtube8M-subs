00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 I 'm errika, I'm here to give 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.770
 One more relationship tip 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.030
 specifically photographs on websites of 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.280
 relationships 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.200
 I'll answer daniela's question 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.480
 moreira do rio de janeiro she sent me 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.090
 and email saying the following 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.270
 Esrika I'm meeting some people. 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.519
 on the relationships site 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.890
 how do not put photos on the profile because it 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.070
 a very important position and would not 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.869
 that my subordinates saw me on the site 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.949
 I have great difficulty following 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.770
 forward 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.710
 the names just want to talk to me 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.500
 after seeing the photo what should I do good 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.370
 Daniela to your case is very simple 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.649
 solve 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.020
 What happens if you talk to 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.610
 someone but I think they at least you 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.230
 Is not that person seeing me? 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.250
 I have a certain curiosity to know 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.610
 how is she 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.559
 after all whether or not we want 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.250
 we take very into account the appearance of the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.140
 others and what happens is natural that the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.539
 man wants to see your photo as well as 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.489
 Would you like to see his too? 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.560
 then you can not exchange a 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.850
 message to the people there on the site are 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.860
 very up to date 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.210
 They want to see a photo if you do not show it. 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.869
 Photos do not think there's anything 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.330
 wrong and for sure and jump out then 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.540
 what you should do 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.390
 changed some messages the person seems 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.880
 being cool seems interesting for a 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.590
 talk on skype speak look do not want 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.729
 show my photos here on the site of 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.829
 relationships 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.450
 but we can go through skype there myself 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.040
 I have several photos I change in my 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.400
 profile for you take a look 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.009
 we get to know each other better and stay 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.790
 much easier to solve and thus 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.600
 something very important to be 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.090
 remembered is on skype create an account 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.540
 will not place an account with the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.340
 your name with your last name and then it's obvious 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.579
 a safety tip I always give 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.680
 Good, today was this, stop wasting time. 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.250
 and show your photo on skype 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.250
 to the next
