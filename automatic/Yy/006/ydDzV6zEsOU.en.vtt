00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.589 
point out I feel like no although this
is<00:05:19.130> not<00:05:19.159> directly<00:05:19.699> correlated<00:05:20.150> to<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.300> movie

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
is not directly correlated to the movie

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.170 
is not directly correlated to the movie
I<00:05:20.720> feel<00:05:21.020> like<00:05:21.110> Toriyama<00:05:21.650> himself<00:05:22.130> was<00:05:22.849> someone

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
I feel like Toriyama himself was someone

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.149 
I feel like Toriyama himself was someone
inspired<00:05:23.509> his<00:05:23.930> new<00:05:24.050> movie<00:05:24.259> I<00:05:24.409> feel<00:05:24.620> like<00:05:24.710> no

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
inspired his new movie I feel like no

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.390 
inspired his new movie I feel like no
he's<00:05:25.909> gonna<00:05:26.590> autonomous<00:05:27.590> a<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:27.860> cross<00:05:28.039> over

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
he's gonna autonomous a the cross over

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.300 
he's gonna autonomous a the cross over
but<00:05:28.580> I<00:05:28.639> feel<00:05:28.880> like<00:05:29.060> this<00:05:29.630> game<00:05:30.310> inspired

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
but I feel like this game inspired

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.040 
but I feel like this game inspired
toriyama<00:05:31.969> to<00:05:32.150> create<00:05:32.419> the<00:05:32.509> movie<00:05:32.690> and<00:05:32.810> he<00:05:32.870> did

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
toriyama to create the movie and he did

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.390 
toriyama to create the movie and he did
now<00:05:33.259> I<00:05:33.289> can't<00:05:33.349> confirm<00:05:33.680> that's<00:05:33.919> come<00:05:34.159> back<00:05:34.280> my

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
now I can't confirm that's come back my

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.100 
now I can't confirm that's come back my

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
theory so don't say mom saw is confirmed

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.570

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.580 
mean I don't know much about the movie I
just<00:05:43.909> stopped<00:05:44.330> I<00:05:44.419> have<00:05:44.570> this<00:05:44.659> hunch<00:05:44.960> I<00:05:45.289> have

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
just stopped I have this hunch I have

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.439 
just stopped I have this hunch I have
this<00:05:45.680> big<00:05:46.009> hunch<00:05:46.310> that<00:05:46.400> this<00:05:46.610> movie<00:05:47.000> is<00:05:47.180> so

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449 
this big hunch that this movie is so

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.469 
this big hunch that this movie is so
inspired<00:05:48.229> by<00:05:48.530> the<00:05:49.000> extended<00:05:50.000> universe<00:05:50.150> I

guess we go we're gonna cause external

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.890 
guess we go we're gonna cause external
universe<00:05:51.830> the<00:05:52.219> extended<00:05:52.669> universe<00:05:52.900> action
