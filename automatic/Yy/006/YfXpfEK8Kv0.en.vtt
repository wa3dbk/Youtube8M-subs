00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:29.569

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:15.720
 tree stick this artem jumpy turned out to be 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:17.880
 nothing else nothing backing back mountains 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:26.640
 back back back back 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:29.370
 Suddenly Yasu will have time I stayed 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.830
 last flag Artem torn battle artyom 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.640
 but do not waste a hole we win by the way 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.370
 my friends 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.610
 I ran whatsoever I have never in this 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.140
 the game did not see hunger do not even know where 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.140
 falls on deck 5 then in the middle 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.930
 so what do we pull pull fall 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.960
 rubber or still take away the flag here 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.550
 artem boron atom 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:04.130
 But finish her, finish him, but finish him 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.700
 down Do down Do so at all so well, it's there 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.700
 3 st went 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.860
 tree sticks 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:26.670
 so here so my friends from the game 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.879
 which which actually should 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.640
 was being 5-minute because we logged in 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.129
 here it is again as usual 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.920
 jumps at the team the score was 60 in my opinion 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.709
 we went behind the mountains just well just 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.519
 there is just like you say 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.980
 pump tank and just 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:52.410
 shoot and I still come look at 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.569
 me friends add friends but 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.750
 it turned out how it happened you see 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.370
 this situation is a completely different game has become 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.120
 more interesting and exciting and but also 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.819
 we had to finish the game here until the end 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.319
 I'll tell you what the game should be 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.379
 was to end very and very and very 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.910
 quickly if you were for the opposing team 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.549
 Artem did not go fresh 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.139
 these two tanks in general 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.150
 played a fatal role 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.570
 see how artem through you head 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:29.260
 jumps played a fatal role and 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:31.390
 exactly 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.470
 it distracts me 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.470
 what happens 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.760
 so generally we are waiting 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.440
 waiting for the gold to fall 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.480
 it would be interesting of course to capture 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.480
 is merabh 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.480
 event 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.590
 I don't specifically pour in order to 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.950
 tighten rubber and maybe maybe 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.100
 take her 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:12.530
 the goal to shoot at least due not to the 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.880
 take it, at least at least I say it 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.880
 at least shoot it 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.080
 So 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.770
 Well, you see how they became terrible 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.360
 defensive hard and lower hard 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.300
 although she looks we look we look 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.009
 on the left side my lech's friends 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:38.800
 Lesha don't you feel sorry for my friend 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:43.380
 Now, let's just face the agora you 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.380
 finish off as you are this option 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.680
 I 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:54.729
 so we can see how there is no well I 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:06:03.249
 I think that with this we will understand a little 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:05.129
 later go-go go-go artemka took lech too 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:09.430
 need to freeze 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:12.580
 Well, you see that the frieze has managed to drag off 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.189
 and nobody is against him 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:24.569
 has time but you see the sea I dare if 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:25.689
 finish and beauty among the runners well, all 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:29.620
 Oh oh oh 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:32.319
 Faster Faster Faster 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.379

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:36.819
