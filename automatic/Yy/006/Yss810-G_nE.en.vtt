00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.929
 and more 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.920
 and good good 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:21.730
 hello welcome to today's turn today 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.670
 let's review a little drawing 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.910
 how to make a tape 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.630
 I brought them a weak sheet they will dictate 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.210
 which is to draw so I went into a 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.290
 leaf blog 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.430
 a pencil 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.430
 and some surfaces of the farms or 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.430
 I will occupy 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.219
 smarter exposition 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.910
 what will you like 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.910
 this type 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.370
 as in the blog sheet 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.370
 two 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.760
 also or I stay also for 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.600
 its origin was very beautiful 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.600
 something like that 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.679
 I had a week creating energy so that 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.679
 note rather 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.780
 we leave the circle if you are going to convert 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.780
 It is preferable 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.280
 after we draw we are free to fly 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.280
 from here 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.760
 this fails 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.190
 in the head that is left out 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.280
 we make a triangle in the part of 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.280
 above 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:03.790
 and there 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.790
 and there we will do as arrows 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.140
 and we are going to paint the sheet 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.750
 without replenishing the ink ready 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.920
 after 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.920
 with the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.710
 we draw 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.330
 a curve here 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:42.590
 and we say a small crystal 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.590
 as if it were a unicorn 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.620
 and at the end of this semicircle that we have 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.620
 done here let's make a long spike 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.900
 and another semicircle more 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.690
 of the crest and we wanted you here 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.630
 but giving them the basic we did 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.470
 above we are going to unfold 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.470
 we are going to unfold 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:18.150
 some wings that are going to touch there 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.150
 and below we're going to do this too 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.220
 and we are going to throw a little bit there we go 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.090
 to get something out of shape because I throw it out 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.860
 fast 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.050
 it is said that if you do it with 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.510
 dedication as it should be and not at night 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.300
 in a hurry because they are bored 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.290
 should look good then we're going to 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.290
 fill the center 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.540
 Take a little donkey and I do not have 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.540
 good camera so I have 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.520
 I'm staying too 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.680
 and well this is how to continue with mockingjay 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.190
 but do it well as the one who 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.190
 I did on the wrist 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.510
 this is grace and thank you very much for 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.960
 see my video and if you liked it too 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.780
 thumb up and if you did not like it do not do 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.510
 nothing lowers my self-esteem but if 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.249
 you liked many subscribe your videos 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:50.699
 when I come back 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:50.699
 and thanks for watching your video chao
