 tata will allow us to work on 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.550
 notions in particular 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.430
 for example noooon evans thor who is 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.930
 our first goal allows you to 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.670
 work on a volley of forehand 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:24.139
 very simple and on the first agreements 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.139
 [Music] 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.310

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.450
 about a quarter of an hour will you see 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.760
 can achieve this first goal 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.500
 ie playing in a north ems in 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.709
 twenty days 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.709

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.070
 1 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.220
 each piece each more to reach 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.780
 shelled in every detail 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 with close-ups of the illustrations 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.390
 even playbacks on which you 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.680

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.390

 audio and video 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.819
 but with the claim for example that it me 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.450
 will comment and judge the 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:07.489
 progression

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.230

 in summary these courses will allow for 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.360
 progress in a very way to acquire a 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.650
 very good level 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.970
 while having fun and that's it 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:50.580
