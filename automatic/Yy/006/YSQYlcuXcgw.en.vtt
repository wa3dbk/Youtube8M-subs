00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.650 
thought I pick the scope with the black
don't<00:02:18.430> all<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:19.120> think<00:02:19.209> that's<00:02:19.450> just

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
don't all that is I think that's just

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.890 
don't all that is I think that's just
like<00:02:19.810> an<00:02:20.080> over<00:02:20.560> look<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.420> making<00:02:22.420> dagger<00:02:22.780> a

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
like an over look of it making dagger a

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.080 
like an over look of it making dagger a
liar<00:02:23.110> no<00:02:23.709> hand<00:02:23.980> grip<00:02:24.220> although<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.790> probably

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
liar no hand grip although you probably

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.120 
liar no hand grip although you probably
would<00:02:25.360> always<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.720> hand<00:02:26.020> grip<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.470> sniper<00:02:26.830> and

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
would always a hand grip on a sniper and

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.220 
would always a hand grip on a sniper and
a<00:02:27.670> silencer<00:02:28.330> on<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.540> end<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.840> that's<00:02:28.959> how

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
a silencer on the end and that's how

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.750 
a silencer on the end and that's how
that's<00:02:29.650> how<00:02:29.800> detail<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.310> can<00:02:30.459> get<00:02:30.610> on<00:02:30.700> the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
that's how detail you can get on the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.870 
that's how detail you can get on the
models<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.270> I<00:02:31.330> really<00:02:31.600> like<00:02:31.780> that<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.230> worm

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
models and I really like that so worm

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.520

model<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.120> very<00:02:34.480> very<00:02:34.570> good<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.350> if<00:02:35.410> you

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
model that is very very good so if you

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.190 
model that is very very good so if you
like<00:02:35.709> if<00:02:36.040> you'd<00:02:36.220> like<00:02:36.340> a.m.<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.510> mod<00:02:37.660> pack<00:02:37.930> and

see on the wall there custom hand grip
with<00:03:13.390> no<00:03:13.630> silencer<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:14.739> when

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
with no silencer so when

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.170 
with no silencer so when
it<00:03:16.390> would<00:03:16.690> be<00:03:16.900> nice<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:17.980> know<00:03:18.220> very<00:03:18.670> like

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
it would be nice I know very like

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.540 
it would be nice I know very like
possibly<00:03:19.810> frustrating<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.560> complicated<00:03:21.190> but

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
possibly frustrating and complicated but

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.920 
possibly frustrating and complicated but
it<00:03:21.640> would<00:03:21.760> be<00:03:21.850> nicer<00:03:22.270> since<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.750> get<00:03:22.900> a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
it would be nicer since you get a

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.080 
it would be nicer since you get a
silencer<00:03:23.710> it<00:03:24.340> would<00:03:24.460> actually<00:03:24.580> have<00:03:24.910> like

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
silencer it would actually have like

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.500 
silencer it would actually have like
silence<00:03:25.690> term<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:27.250> know<00:03:27.280> sounds<00:03:27.760> custom

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
silence term you know sounds custom

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.330 
silence term you know sounds custom
sounds<00:03:28.990> just<00:03:29.200> like<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:30.040> would<00:03:30.160> be

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
sounds just like that that would be

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.910 
sounds just like that that would be
amazing<00:03:30.750> customization<00:03:31.750> but<00:03:31.930> model<00:03:32.650> twice

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
amazing customization but model twice

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.370

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
space so this is the sybian armory so

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.940 
space so this is the sybian armory so
it's<00:04:22.930> like<00:04:23.169> quite<00:04:23.530> old-fashioned<00:04:24.460> my<00:04:24.550> guess

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
it's like quite old-fashioned my guess

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.350 
it's like quite old-fashioned my guess
this<00:04:26.950> is<00:04:27.100> a<00:04:27.130> spade<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.610> do<00:04:27.669> quite<00:04:28.030> like<00:04:28.060> the
