00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
can see I have all these set to five and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.090 
can see I have all these set to five and
the<00:01:09.090> ones<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.420> are<00:01:09.540> set<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.900> one<00:01:10.170> if<00:01:10.500> you

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the ones that are set to one if you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.340 
the ones that are set to one if you
don't<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.430> know<00:01:11.700> which<00:01:12.479> ones<00:01:12.869> need<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.260> be

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
don't really know which ones need to be

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.960 
don't really know which ones need to be
set<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:14.159> set<00:01:14.310> them<00:01:14.400> all<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.760> fly

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
set to one just set them all to fly

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.810 
set to one just set them all to fly
because<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> game<00:01:15.869> will<00:01:16.049> automatically

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
because the game will automatically

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.090 
because the game will automatically
detect<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.330> only<00:01:19.020> one<00:01:19.560> skill<00:01:19.860> point

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
detect that it's only one skill point

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.830 
detect that it's only one skill point
it's<00:01:20.310> needed<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.150> it'll<00:01:21.330> reset<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
it's needed for that and it'll reset it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.530 
it's needed for that and it'll reset it
to<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.740> all<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.820> ones<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.240> can

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
to one so all the ones that you can

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.100 
to one so all the ones that you can
modify<00:01:24.960> will<00:01:25.740> stay<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.900> basically<00:01:27.900> all<00:01:27.990> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
modify will stay so basically all you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.230 
modify will stay so basically all you
need<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:28.799> through<00:01:28.829> each<00:01:29.369> skill<00:01:29.820> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
need to do is go through each skill and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.330 
need to do is go through each skill and
change<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.930> five<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.799> cannot<00:01:32.070> add

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
change it to five you cannot add

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.380 
change it to five you cannot add
anything<00:01:33.150> higher<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.750> 5<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.850> that's<00:01:35.850> not<00:01:36.150> going

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
anything higher to 5 so that's not going

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.280 
anything higher to 5 so that's not going
to<00:01:36.479> work<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.770> maximum<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.939> 5

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
to work so the maximum you can do is 5

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.460 
to work so the maximum you can do is 5
so<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.470> go<00:01:40.619> through<00:01:40.920> all<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.220> these<00:01:41.610> skills

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
so just go through all of these skills

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.200 
so just go through all of these skills
down<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.250> want<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.460> max<00:01:44.700> your<00:01:44.820> entire

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
down here if you want to max your entire

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.600 
down here if you want to max your entire
skill<00:01:45.840> tree<00:01:46.110> without<00:01:46.530> having<00:01:46.829> any<00:01:47.070> left<00:01:47.310> over

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
skill tree without having any left over

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.749 
skill tree without having any left over
skill<00:01:47.880> points<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.619> quick<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.100> most
