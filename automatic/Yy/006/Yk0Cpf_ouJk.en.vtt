corn<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.550> think<00:00:42.420> its<00:00:42.570> best<00:00:42.870> feature<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
corn I think its best feature is the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.350 
corn I think its best feature is the
DVDs<00:00:43.860> based<00:00:44.190> navigation<00:00:44.399> system<00:00:45.180> that's

DVDs based navigation system that's
voice<00:00:45.510> enabled<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.980> say<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.340> that's

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
voice enabled I have to say that that's

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.279 
voice enabled I have to say that that's
really<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.820> great<00:00:48.090> system<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:48.719> not<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.110> much

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
really a great system it's not so much

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.560 
really a great system it's not so much
what<00:00:49.620> each<00:00:49.890> system<00:00:50.460> does<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.329> way<00:00:51.449> that

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
what each system does it's the way that

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.389 
what each system does it's the way that
all<00:00:51.690> works<00:00:51.960> together<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.530> how<00:00:52.590> easy<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.370> can

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
all works together and how easy you can

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.950 
all works together and how easy you can
acclimate<00:00:53.760> yourself<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:54.840> you're

at<00:01:02.969> first<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.390> what<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.049> say<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.350> how

at first but what I have to say is how

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.130 
at first but what I have to say is how

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
Honda has made it so intuitive for the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.260 
Honda has made it so intuitive for the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and the previous you got it the previous

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.630 
and the previous you got it the previous
year's<00:01:49.200> Accord<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.649> previously<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.430> know

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
year's Accord and the previously I know

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.880 
year's Accord and the previously I know
where<00:01:50.909> you're<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.240> with<00:01:51.329> your<00:01:51.570> old<00:01:52.079> it's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
where you're going with your old it's

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.800 
where you're going with your old it's
unfair<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.490> judge<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.509> fact<00:01:54.720> that

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
unfair to judge it on just the fact that

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.959 
unfair to judge it on just the fact that
it's<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> older<00:01:55.470> design<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> two<00:01:56.280> hybrids

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
it's the older design of the two hybrids

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.670 
it's the older design of the two hybrids
were<00:01:57.090> looking<00:01:57.420> at<00:01:57.540> today<00:01:57.719> now<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.320> know<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
were looking at today now I know the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.080 
were looking at today now I know the
Accords<00:01:59.070> been<00:01:59.189> around<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.490> little<00:01:59.610> longer<00:01:59.729> than

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
Accords been around a little longer than

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.240

the current brand-new Toyota Camry body

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.520 
the current brand-new Toyota Camry body
but<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.060> unfair<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.780> judge<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.320> way

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
but it's unfair to judge it that way

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.830 
but it's unfair to judge it that way

to<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.269> four-cylinder<00:03:23.840> models<00:03:24.170> that<00:03:24.530> would

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
to the four-cylinder models that would

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.920 
to the four-cylinder models that would
be<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.920> only<00:03:25.070> thing<00:03:25.340> that<00:03:25.730> I<00:03:25.910> dislike<00:03:26.630> about

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
be the only thing that I dislike about

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.599 
be the only thing that I dislike about
performance<00:03:27.769> is<00:03:27.859> the<00:03:27.890> fact<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.310> when<00:03:28.489> you're

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
performance is the fact that when you're

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:29.920 
performance is the fact that when you're
sitting<00:03:28.940> there<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.150> stop<00:03:29.390> light<00:03:29.600> it<00:03:29.720> kind<00:03:29.900> of

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
sitting there to stop light it kind of

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.780 
sitting there to stop light it kind of
wants<00:03:30.049> to<00:03:30.200> shut<00:03:30.500> off<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:30.980> come<00:03:31.220> back<00:03:31.250> on<00:03:31.489> shut

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
off and come back on it for a guy who

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.800 
off and come back on it for a guy who
kind<00:03:33.739> of<00:03:33.829> does<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.670> little<00:03:34.940> two<00:03:35.209> step<00:03:35.269> on<00:03:35.720> the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
it's something I can get over yeah but

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.559 
it's something I can get over yeah but
it<00:03:39.530> is<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.799> most<00:03:39.950> smoking<00:03:40.670> hybrid<00:03:41.209> car<00:03:41.389> on<00:03:41.480> the

a little bit of age to it I think that's

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.009 
a little bit of age to it I think that's

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
lacking but it's something that has to

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.680 
lacking but it's something that has to

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
quality is definitely at strength just

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.490 
quality is definitely at strength just
for<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.240> alone<00:04:41.510> we've<00:04:41.780> got<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.110> give<00:04:42.320> it<00:04:42.440> a

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
for that alone we've got to give it a

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.120 
for that alone we've got to give it a
high<00:04:42.650> score<00:04:42.950> 4.25<00:04:43.940> for<00:04:44.180> fit<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.480> finish

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.900 
finally drivability for the accord
hybrid<00:04:50.600> v6<00:04:51.230> and<00:04:51.470> I<00:04:51.590> think<00:04:51.980> it's<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.190> interior

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
hybrid v6 and I think it's the interior

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.670 
hybrid v6 and I think it's the interior
and<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.360> power<00:04:53.570> system<00:04:54.110> that<00:04:54.139> are<00:04:54.350> its<00:04:54.440> strong

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
and the power system that are its strong

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.380 
and the power system that are its strong
points<00:04:55.070> well<00:04:55.490> I<00:04:55.520> think<00:04:55.669> it's<00:04:55.940> got<00:04:56.060> a<00:04:56.090> lot<00:04:56.360> of

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
points well I think it's got a lot of

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.210 
points well I think it's got a lot of
strong<00:04:56.690> points<00:04:56.990> you<00:04:57.230> got<00:04:57.350> to<00:04:57.470> realize<00:04:57.620> that

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
strong points you got to realize that
