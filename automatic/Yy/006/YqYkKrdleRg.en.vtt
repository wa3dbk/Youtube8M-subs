take the shot we make it for free but it

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.710 
take the shot we make it for free but it
is<00:02:33.160> way<00:02:33.370> too<00:02:33.400> late<00:02:33.730> we<00:02:33.910> end<00:02:34.120> up<00:02:34.300> losing<00:02:34.690> the

is way too late we end up losing the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.140 
is way too late we end up losing the
game<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:35.320> in<00:02:35.620> hindsight<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:36.280> might<00:02:36.970> have<00:02:37.090> been

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
game and in hindsight I might have been

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.730 
game and in hindsight I might have been
able<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.660> win<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.959> game<00:02:37.990> I<00:02:38.140> think<00:02:38.290> because<00:02:38.709> I

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
able to win the game I think because I

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.040 
able to win the game I think because I
had<00:02:39.040> quite<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.310> few<00:02:39.550> chances<00:02:39.820> where<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.450> may<00:02:40.990> be

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
had quite a few chances where I may be

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.480 
had quite a few chances where I may be
ended<00:02:41.350> up<00:02:41.440> skilling<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:41.950> little<00:02:42.190> bit<00:02:42.310> two

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
ended up skilling a little bit two

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.220 
ended up skilling a little bit two
months<00:02:42.790> when<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:42.940> had<00:02:43.150> two<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.510> one<00:02:43.750> lead<00:02:43.959> and

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
months when I had two to one lead and

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.600 
months when I had two to one lead and
maybe<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.530> could<00:02:44.770> have<00:02:44.860> gotten<00:02:45.070> a<00:02:45.190> third<00:02:45.400> goal

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
maybe I could have gotten a third goal

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.949 
maybe I could have gotten a third goal
at<00:02:45.700> that<00:02:45.790> point<00:02:46.030> in<00:02:46.120> time<00:02:46.150> because<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.570> didn't

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
at that point in time because it didn't

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.020 
at that point in time because it didn't
feel<00:02:47.140> he<00:02:47.770> created<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.250> many<00:02:48.430> chances<00:02:48.730> but

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
feel he created that many chances but

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.210 
feel he created that many chances but
into<00:02:49.300> extra<00:02:49.570> time<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.170> footballs<00:02:50.440> I<00:02:50.800> didn't

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
into extra time the footballs I didn't

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.740 
into extra time the footballs I didn't

it here in the replay he was 10 his keep
out<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:22.810> little<00:04:23.080> bit<00:04:23.200> off<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.410> goal<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.010> that

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
out a little bit off the goal and that

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.070 
out a little bit off the goal and that
was<00:04:24.310> just<00:04:24.610> lucky<00:04:24.910> because<00:04:25.150> I<00:04:25.300> wanted<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.870> try

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
was just lucky because I wanted to try

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.770 
was just lucky because I wanted to try
out<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.320> volume

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
out the volume

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.810 
out the volume
that<00:04:26.930> distance<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:27.590> because<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.580> took<00:04:28.670> his

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
that distance and because it took his

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.670 
that distance and because it took his
keep<00:04:29.030> out<00:04:29.180> I<00:04:29.389> was<00:04:29.540> able<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.960> get<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.470> goal<00:04:30.650> that

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
keep out I was able to get the goal that

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.560 
keep out I was able to get the goal that
I<00:04:30.860> figure<00:04:31.340> if<00:04:31.550> he<00:04:31.730> had<00:04:31.820> stayed<00:04:32.060> on<00:04:32.210> this<00:04:32.330> line

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570
