00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 Hello, I want to show one of my own 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.150
 purchase this time this computer i 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.360
 collected by accessories 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.700
 but the price tag is basically me too 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.840
 liked and look here here 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:23.039
 nvidia geforce gtx 560 ti video card 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.090
 from the company gigabyte to 1 gig 256 bits 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.670
 It cost me 1,300 rubles not to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.830
 cheap for this video card here 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.649
 here is one level of ddr3 RAM 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:41.370
 4 gigabytes of 1333 megahertz cost it 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.090
 I'm 1000 rubles under this cooler 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:51.719
 Intel xeon 5430 processor costs 12 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.579
 megabyte cache l2 2670 clock frequency 4 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.050
 cores 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.210
 motherboard gigabyte but in principle 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.469
 nothing remarkable except 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.300
 she on d3 and on ddr2 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.189
 you can put only one type 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.250
 RAM, therefore, special advantages 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:15.180
 This motherboard is not to do a block 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:20.150
 power pretty and flawed at 450 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:25.439
 watts in my opinion 468 lats 480 even 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:29.630
 sorry so hard drive 250 g fighter 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.070
 so he was with the case like this 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.329
 cupcake case by the way pretty 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.960
 Interesting was with a case with 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.229
 power supply and it all happened to me 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.299
 about 700 probably rubles for a case block 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.060
 power and 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:51.530
 hard, in principle, something like this 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:57.570
 and sell and this whole thing is counting on 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:01.770
 12 Well, in a pinch for 11,000, I think 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:06.860
 This is a worthy purchase. Another question. 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.509
 or here estimates of this configuration of Windows 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.170
 whether that girl of course that respects 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.130
 this moment 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.060
 on got poked can lift 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.440
 the frequency of the RAM so that it is usually but 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.540
 recently there were 3 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:27.140
 there is the same graphics card the patterns and I 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.850
 showed 7 9 here's my question to 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.340
 do I continue to shoot such videos and 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.420
 how not to shoot as you would like to see them 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.670
 that is, not just reviews just a review and 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.650
 for how much i bought what and how or in general 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.390
 some kind of backstory the very story that 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.720
 Generally interesting to hear or even 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.299
 fuck this line of my channel 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.700
 and just shoot some tutorials there 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.549
 interesting videos with which wrong 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.650
 tasks generally not interesting important 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.190
 opinion I ask all concerned 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:03.380
 unsubscribe in the comments and all to 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.380
 meeting until next video bye
