colors when it comes to blushes so but

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.230 
colors when it comes to blushes so but
so<00:05:04.830> like<00:05:05.099> I<00:05:05.190> said<00:05:05.400> these<00:05:05.520> are<00:05:05.580> really<00:05:05.940> finely

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.750 
so like I said these are really finely
milled<00:05:06.599> there's<00:05:07.530> a<00:05:07.650> decent<00:05:08.190> amount<00:05:08.430> of<00:05:08.490> color

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
milled there's a decent amount of color

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.400 
milled there's a decent amount of color
payoff<00:05:09.120> there<00:05:09.599> are<00:05:09.690> several<00:05:09.960> different

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 
colors and the different options the

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.089 
colors and the different options the
warm<00:05:13.620> cool<00:05:13.889> or<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.400> neutral<00:05:15.800> you<00:05:16.800> get<00:05:17.070> a

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
warm cool or the neutral you get a

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.730 
warm cool or the neutral you get a
generous<00:05:17.820> amount<00:05:18.150> of<00:05:18.360> product<00:05:18.900> here<00:05:19.199> so<00:05:19.229> this

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
generous amount of product here so this

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.649 
generous amount of product here so this
is<00:05:21.169> six<00:05:22.169> grams<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.919> blush<00:05:23.190> right<00:05:23.370> here<00:05:23.699> I<00:05:23.880> don't

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
is six grams of blush right here I don't

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.000 
is six grams of blush right here I don't
know<00:05:24.810> how<00:05:24.990> much<00:05:25.110> blush<00:05:25.440> you<00:05:25.590> get<00:05:25.740> with<00:05:25.889> the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
know how much blush you get with the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.010 
know how much blush you get with the
Mack<00:05:28.699> blushes<00:05:29.699> but<00:05:29.940> I'm<00:05:30.210> assuming<00:05:30.539> it's

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
Mack blushes but I'm assuming it's

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.529 
Mack blushes but I'm assuming it's
probably<00:05:31.800> about<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.669> same<00:05:32.849> amount<00:05:33.030> maybe<00:05:33.419> a

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
probably about the same amount maybe a

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.300 
probably about the same amount maybe a
little<00:05:33.690> bit<00:05:33.900> less<00:05:34.080> than<00:05:34.320> this<00:05:34.500> so<00:05:34.770> I<00:05:34.979> don't<00:05:35.099> own

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
little bit less than this so I don't own

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.149 
little bit less than this so I don't own
a<00:05:35.340> lot<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.669> Mac<00:05:36.030> blushes<00:05:38.240> so<00:05:39.440> anyway<00:05:40.440> I<00:05:40.590> really

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
a lot of Mac blushes so anyway I really

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.420 
a lot of Mac blushes so anyway I really
like<00:05:41.310> this<00:05:41.520> these<00:05:41.729> never<00:05:42.030> make<00:05:42.270> me<00:05:42.389> break<00:05:42.659> out

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
like this these never make me break out

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.129 
like this these never make me break out
they<00:05:44.430> go<00:05:44.610> on<00:05:44.760> really<00:05:44.789> really<00:05:45.120> smoothly

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
they go on really really smoothly

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.730 
they go on really really smoothly
they're<00:05:46.590> very<00:05:46.770> buildable<00:05:47.460> so<00:05:48.139> while<00:05:49.139> I<00:05:49.320> prefer

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
they're very buildable so while I prefer

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.580 
they're very buildable so while I prefer
a<00:05:49.770> more<00:05:50.330> natural<00:05:51.330> blush<00:05:51.870> look<00:05:52.199> during<00:05:52.470> the

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
a more natural blush look during the

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.610 
a more natural blush look during the
fall<00:05:53.150> because<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.240> tend<00:05:54.449> to<00:05:54.570> do<00:05:54.780> like<00:05:54.810> a<00:05:55.020> darker

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
fall because I tend to do like a darker

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.390 
fall because I tend to do like a darker
smoky<00:05:56.070> or<00:05:56.190> I

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
smoky or I

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.060 
smoky or I
I<00:05:56.669> like<00:05:57.570> the<00:05:57.750> fact<00:05:57.960> that<00:05:58.199> if<00:05:58.349> I<00:05:58.500> wanted<00:05:58.919> to

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
I like the fact that if I wanted to

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.399 
I like the fact that if I wanted to
build<00:05:59.220> this<00:05:59.460> up<00:05:59.669> I<00:05:59.880> can<00:05:59.909> do<00:06:00.419> that<00:06:00.659> um<00:06:03.409> yeah

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.409 
build this up I can do that um yeah

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:06.740 
build this up I can do that um yeah
they're<00:06:04.950> just<00:06:05.070> really<00:06:05.370> really<00:06:05.490> great<00:06:05.909> washes

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
they're just really really great washes

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.870 
they're just really really great washes
for<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:07.020> price

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
for the price

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.670 
for the price
I'm<00:06:08.480> trying<00:06:08.870> to<00:06:08.930> like<00:06:09.140> make<00:06:09.290> sure<00:06:09.500> that<00:06:09.620> I

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
I'm trying to like make sure that I

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.950 
I'm trying to like make sure that I
don't<00:06:09.800> miss<00:06:10.040> anything<00:06:10.310> so<00:06:10.730> in<00:06:11.300> terms<00:06:11.600> of<00:06:11.750> cost

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
don't miss anything so in terms of cost

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.490 
don't miss anything so in terms of cost
so<00:06:12.230> this<00:06:12.380> is<00:06:12.530> one<00:06:12.740> of<00:06:12.770> the<00:06:12.980> spender<00:06:14.500> blushes

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
so this is one of the spender blushes

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.850 
so this is one of the spender blushes
for<00:06:15.860> a<00:06:15.920> drugstore<00:06:16.400> I<00:06:16.910> think<00:06:17.150> that<00:06:17.300> this<00:06:17.450> was

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
for a drugstore I think that this was

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.510 
for a drugstore I think that this was
$11<00:06:18.940> 1099<00:06:19.940> something<00:06:20.420> like<00:06:20.540> that<00:06:20.780> and<00:06:21.340> so<00:06:22.340> it's

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
$11 1099 something like that and so it's

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.760 
$11 1099 something like that and so it's
kind<00:06:22.790> of<00:06:22.850> nice<00:06:23.000> when<00:06:23.270> you<00:06:23.390> can<00:06:23.600> get<00:06:23.780> a<00:06:23.840> buy<00:06:24.500> one

below<00:06:47.090> it's<00:06:47.720> just<00:06:47.990> a<00:06:48.110> great<00:06:48.460> neutral<00:06:49.480> fall

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
below it's just a great neutral fall

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.340 
below it's just a great neutral fall
blush<00:06:51.230> and<00:06:51.740> I<00:06:52.250> think<00:06:52.940> even<00:06:53.180> if<00:06:53.450> you<00:06:53.630> tend<00:06:53.990> to

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
blush and I think even if you tend to

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.680 
blush and I think even if you tend to
look<00:06:54.620> better<00:06:54.830> in<00:06:55.130> warmer<00:06:55.700> tones<00:06:56.030> this<00:06:56.540> is

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
look better in warmer tones this is

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.240 
look better in warmer tones this is
something<00:06:57.020> that<00:06:57.170> would<00:06:57.290> be<00:06:57.440> flattering<00:06:57.920> cuz

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.250 
something that would be flattering cuz

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.250 
something that would be flattering cuz
it's<00:06:58.430> a<00:06:58.520> to<00:06:59.330> me<00:06:59.450> it<00:06:59.480> seems<00:06:59.780> like<00:06:59.930> a<00:06:59.960> pretty
