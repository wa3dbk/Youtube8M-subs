00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
content are very handy for figuring out

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.260 
content are very handy for figuring out
how<00:01:16.679> to<00:01:16.740> set<00:01:17.189> things<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:17.579> so<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.060> see

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.480 
how to set things up so you can see
we've<00:01:18.420> got<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.780> walk<00:01:19.499> system<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.070> here<00:01:20.310> we've

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
we've got the walk system in here we've

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.340 
we've got the walk system in here we've
got<00:01:20.609> a<00:01:20.670> character<00:01:21.210> system<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:21.929> can<00:01:21.960> start

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
got a character system so we can start

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.989 
got a character system so we can start
investigating<00:01:22.920> those<00:01:23.249> and<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.729> how<00:01:23.939> that

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:23.999 
investigating those and see how that

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.480 
investigating those and see how that
character<00:01:24.570> was<00:01:24.689> raped<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.530> using<00:01:25.979> ourselves

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
character was raped or using ourselves

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.639 
character was raped or using ourselves
now<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.329> lot<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.749> content<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.289> we<00:01:28.409> see

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
now a lot of the content that we see

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.469 
now a lot of the content that we see
I'll<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.920> get<00:01:29.159> rid<00:01:29.249> of<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:33.299> if<00:01:33.390> you

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
I'll just get rid of that one so if you

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.459 
I'll just get rid of that one so if you
go<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.840> likes<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.289> visualize<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.369> example

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
go to the likes of visualize for example

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.779 
go to the likes of visualize for example
and<00:01:37.469> so<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:37.920> go<00:01:38.069> up<00:01:38.219> a<00:01:38.340> folder<00:01:38.640> using

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
and so you just go up a folder using

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.959 
and so you just go up a folder using
this<00:01:39.060> or<00:01:39.270> back<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> folder<00:01:39.929> using<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.609> so<00:01:41.609> I

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
this or back a folder using this so I

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.459 
this or back a folder using this so I
want<00:01:42.149> to<00:01:42.179> go<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> visualize<00:01:42.749> here<00:01:43.079> I'll<00:01:43.409> just

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
want to go to visualize here I'll just

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.590 
want to go to visualize here I'll just
shrink<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:43.950> down<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.189> bit<00:01:44.429> now<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:44.819> we<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.450> see

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
shrink this down a bit now so we can see

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.510 
shrink this down a bit now so we can see
a<00:01:45.630> little<00:01:45.810> bit<00:01:46.020> better

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
a little bit better

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.649 
a little bit better
you've<00:01:47.520> got<00:01:47.639> animations<00:01:48.210> cameras

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
you've got animations cameras

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.709 
you've got animations cameras
environments<00:01:49.289> materials<00:01:50.039> objects<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:51.210> jump

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
environments materials objects just jump

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.300 
environments materials objects just jump
into<00:01:51.899> materials<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.829> see<00:01:53.039> they're<00:01:53.219> all

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
into materials you can see they're all

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.149 
into materials you can see they're all
nicely<00:01:53.520> named<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.659> words<00:01:54.929> walls<00:01:55.229> tiles<00:01:55.740> all

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
nicely named like words walls tiles all

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.319

look at walls different wall wallpapers
we've<00:02:01.229> got<00:02:01.409> bricks<00:02:01.709> in<00:02:01.950> there<00:02:02.100> as<00:02:02.280> well<00:02:02.490> or

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
we've got bricks in there as well or

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.520 
we've got bricks in there as well or
there<00:02:03.359> is<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.659> lovely<00:02:03.899> brick<00:02:04.079> generator

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
there is the lovely brick generator

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.099 
there is the lovely brick generator
which<00:02:04.740> we'll<00:02:04.920> cover<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.219> another<00:02:05.549> tutorial

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
which we'll cover in another tutorial

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.230 
which we'll cover in another tutorial
but<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.130> go<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.580> objects<00:02:08.970> what<00:02:09.180> I'm

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
but if we go to the objects what I'm

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.609 
but if we go to the objects what I'm
going<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.510> is<00:02:09.630> just<00:02:09.810> throw<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> few<00:02:10.229> things

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
going to do is just throw a few things

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.110 
going to do is just throw a few things
in<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> scene<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.640> see<00:02:11.820> how<00:02:12.000> this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
in the scene so you can see how this

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.239 
in the scene so you can see how this
works<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:12.810> really<00:02:13.260> simple<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.770> you

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:14.249 
works and it's really simple to you

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:19.339 
works and it's really simple to you
so<00:02:15.030> we'll<00:02:15.239> go<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:17.629> one<00:02:18.629> of<00:02:18.659> these<00:02:18.810> here<00:02:19.139> so<00:02:19.290> you

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
so we'll go to one of these here so you

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.899 
so we'll go to one of these here so you
can<00:02:19.439> see<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.709> different<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.579> different

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
can see the different the different

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.209 
can see the different the different
areas<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.209> we've<00:02:21.389> got<00:02:21.689> and<00:02:22.530> I'm<00:02:22.889> gonna<00:02:23.040> go

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
areas that we've got and I'm gonna go

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.319 
areas that we've got and I'm gonna go
and<00:02:23.370> look<00:02:23.489> at<00:02:23.939> tables<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:26.060> then<00:02:27.060> you've<00:02:27.180> got<00:02:27.299> a

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
and look at tables and then you've got a

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.759 
and look at tables and then you've got a
variety<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.749> different<00:02:27.900> tables

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
variety of different tables

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.559 
variety of different tables
you're<00:02:29.069> not<00:02:29.189> got<00:02:29.370> hundreds<00:02:29.819> of<00:02:29.939> things<00:02:30.299> but

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
you're not got hundreds of things but

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.910 
you're not got hundreds of things but
overall<00:02:31.019> you've<00:02:31.230> got<00:02:31.379> quite<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.650> lot<00:02:31.829> of

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
overall you've got quite a lot of

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.140 
overall you've got quite a lot of
content<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.370> they're<00:02:32.519> really<00:02:32.639> handy<00:02:32.879> when

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
content and they're really handy when

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.550 
content and they're really handy when
you're<00:02:33.299> starting<00:02:33.569> out<00:02:33.840> or<00:02:34.019> you<00:02:34.139> just<00:02:34.260> want<00:02:34.500> a

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
you're starting out or you just want a

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.509 
you're starting out or you just want a
few<00:02:34.650> seen<00:02:35.549> Phyllis<00:02:36.469> to<00:02:37.469> see<00:02:37.739> which<00:02:37.889> one<00:02:38.129> I<00:02:38.159> want

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
few seen Phyllis to see which one I want

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.220 
few seen Phyllis to see which one I want
to<00:02:38.579> use<00:02:39.650> as<00:02:40.650> well<00:02:40.909> and<00:02:41.909> when<00:02:42.030> they<00:02:42.150> come<00:02:42.389> in<00:02:42.599> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
to use as well and when they come in the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.170 
to use as well and when they come in the
great<00:02:43.409> thing<00:02:43.439> is<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.859> the<00:02:44.219> one<00:02:44.579> letter<00:02:44.790> scale

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
great thing is that the one letter scale

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.839 
great thing is that the one letter scale
so<00:02:45.870> they're<00:02:46.079> nicely<00:02:46.290> scaled<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.340> poly<00:02:47.579> count

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
so they're nicely scaled the poly count

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.490 
so they're nicely scaled the poly count
is<00:02:48.030> very<00:02:48.269> efficient<00:02:48.780> as<00:02:48.870> well<00:02:49.049> you<00:02:49.169> can<00:02:49.319> see

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
is very efficient as well you can see

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.140 
is very efficient as well you can see
not<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.709> lot<00:02:49.889> of<00:02:49.919> polygons<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.639> that<00:02:50.790> particular

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
not a lot of polygons in that particular

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.809 
not a lot of polygons in that particular
table<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:52.260> renders<00:02:52.680> fine<00:02:52.919> so<00:02:53.609> it's<00:02:53.730> all

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
table it renders fine so it's all

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.729 
table it renders fine so it's all
greatly<00:02:54.269> set<00:02:54.540> up<00:02:54.659> material<00:02:55.139> wise<00:02:55.319> down<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
greatly set up material wise down the

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.379 
greatly set up material wise down the
bottom<00:02:55.980> left<00:02:56.189> you<00:02:56.400> can<00:02:56.549> see<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.760> materials

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
bottom left you can see the materials

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.720 
bottom left you can see the materials
are<00:02:57.510> all<00:02:57.629> set<00:02:57.870> up<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:59.280> you're<00:02:59.430> good<00:02:59.579> to<00:02:59.699> go

way<00:03:25.319> when<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.590> start<00:03:26.009> with<00:03:26.280> cinema<00:03:26.609> 4d<00:03:26.909> just

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
way when you start with cinema 4d just

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.929 
way when you start with cinema 4d just
flick<00:03:28.259> into<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.590> bigger<00:03:28.799> view<00:03:29.069> this<00:03:29.400> area<00:03:29.699> a

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
flick into a bigger view this area a

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.080 
flick into a bigger view this area a
bright<00:03:30.720> view<00:03:31.019> just<00:03:31.500> make<00:03:31.650> sure<00:03:31.799> I<00:03:31.909> put<00:03:32.909> that

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
bright view just make sure I put that

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.149 
bright view just make sure I put that
wine<00:03:33.269> glass<00:03:33.389> nicely<00:03:33.810> on<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.199> table<00:03:34.620> there<00:03:35.069> we

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
wine glass nicely on the table there we

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.179 
wine glass nicely on the table there we
go<00:03:35.840> they're<00:03:36.840> not<00:03:36.959> coming<00:03:37.229> back<00:03:37.259> out<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:38.069> I'm

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:38.189 
go they're not coming back out and I'm

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:39.939 
go they're not coming back out and I'm
just<00:03:38.340> gonna<00:03:38.459> change<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:39.180> angle<00:03:39.419> of<00:03:39.479> the<00:03:39.629> front

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:39.949 
just gonna change the angle of the front

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:44.569 
just gonna change the angle of the front
just<00:03:40.949> with<00:03:41.099> this<00:03:41.189> rotate<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:43.290> drag<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:43.769> this

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
just with this rotate and drag in this

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.740 
just with this rotate and drag in this
one<00:03:46.340> just<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.519> we<00:03:47.609> can<00:03:47.699> see<00:03:47.909> this<00:03:48.090> scene<00:03:48.720> a

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
one just so we can see this scene a

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.719 
one just so we can see this scene a
little<00:03:49.079> bit<00:03:49.199> better<00:03:49.349> now<00:03:49.620> look<00:03:50.549> off<00:03:50.699> the

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
little bit better now look off the

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.999 
little bit better now look off the
y-axis<00:03:51.449> by<00:03:51.599> clicking<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.079> one<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.889> then

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:53.009 
y-axis by clicking this one and then

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.159 
y-axis by clicking this one and then
when<00:03:53.129> I<00:03:53.189> drag<00:03:53.519> I'll<00:03:53.699> move<00:03:53.849> the<00:03:54.150> glass<00:03:54.540> just<00:03:54.959> on

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
when I drag I'll move the glass just on

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.129 
when I drag I'll move the glass just on
the<00:03:55.290> table<00:03:55.879> and<00:03:56.879> if<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.150> want<00:03:57.329> to<00:03:57.389> another

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
the table and if you want to another

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.189 
the table and if you want to another
copy<00:03:58.409> of<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.680> what<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:58.919> can<00:03:59.069> do<00:03:59.219> is<00:03:59.780> just<00:04:00.780> go<00:04:01.079> on

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
copy of it what you can do is just go on

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.619 
copy of it what you can do is just go on
the<00:04:01.319> table<00:04:01.739> hold<00:04:01.919> down<00:04:02.099> control<00:04:02.639> and<00:04:03.329> you'll

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
the table hold down control and you'll

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.259 
the table hold down control and you'll
get<00:04:03.719> a<00:04:03.780> copy<00:04:04.049> of<00:04:04.169> it<00:04:04.379> as<00:04:04.979> you<00:04:05.129> drag<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:06.180> then

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
get a copy of it as you drag and then

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.610 
get a copy of it as you drag and then
I'll<00:04:06.389> move<00:04:06.540> this<00:04:06.689> one<00:04:06.930> around<00:04:06.959> in<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.379> scene

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
I'll move this one around in the scene

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.240 
I'll move this one around in the scene
as<00:04:07.799> well<00:04:09.049> and<00:04:10.049> well<00:04:10.289> we'll<00:04:10.620> have<00:04:10.739> a<00:04:10.769> third<00:04:11.009> one

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
as well and well we'll have a third one

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.770 
as well and well we'll have a third one
as<00:04:11.370> well<00:04:12.259> so<00:04:13.259> if<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:13.439> hit<00:04:13.530> render<00:04:13.739> now<00:04:14.780> we've

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
as well so if you hit render now we've

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.689 
as well so if you hit render now we've
got<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.109> basics<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.829> scene<00:04:17.070> already<00:04:17.310> going

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
got the basics of a scene already going

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.670 
got the basics of a scene already going
on<00:04:17.849> now<00:04:18.239> I'm<00:04:18.509> just<00:04:18.780> going<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.019> cover<00:04:19.199> something

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
on now I'm just going to cover something

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.620 
on now I'm just going to cover something
that<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.859> lot<00:04:20.009> of<00:04:20.130> people<00:04:20.400> seem<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:20.609> miss<00:04:20.940> inside

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
that a lot of people seem to miss inside

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.180 
that a lot of people seem to miss inside
cinema4d<00:04:21.959> which<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.889> to<00:04:23.039> do<00:04:23.159> with

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
cinema4d which is to do with

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.450 
cinema4d which is to do with
anti-aliasing<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.300> you'll<00:04:24.990> see<00:04:25.199> if<00:04:25.260> you're

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
anti-aliasing and you'll see if you're

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.830 
anti-aliasing and you'll see if you're
following<00:04:26.460> along<00:04:26.580> in<00:04:26.880> this<00:04:26.969> tutorial<00:04:27.210> that

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
following along in this tutorial that

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.330 
following along in this tutorial that
in<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:28.260> glass<00:04:28.470> you<00:04:28.770> get<00:04:28.889> this<00:04:29.100> horrible

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
in the glass you get this horrible

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.480 
in the glass you get this horrible
jagged<00:04:29.850> edge<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.389> this<00:04:31.110> by<00:04:31.350> default<00:04:31.710> the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
jagged edge and this by default the

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.850 
jagged edge and this by default the
default<00:04:32.940> anti-aliasing<00:04:33.840> for<00:04:34.020> cinema<00:04:34.290> 4d<00:04:34.560> set

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
default anti-aliasing for cinema 4d set

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.040 
default anti-aliasing for cinema 4d set
to<00:04:35.010> geometry<00:04:35.310> which<00:04:36.180> is<00:04:36.210> really<00:04:36.540> really<00:04:36.660> quick

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
to geometry which is really really quick

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.960 
to geometry which is really really quick
but<00:04:37.530> if<00:04:37.620> there's<00:04:37.770> any<00:04:37.889> transparencies<00:04:38.730> in<00:04:38.880> the

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
but if there's any transparencies in the

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.510 
but if there's any transparencies in the
scene<00:04:39.260> anything<00:04:40.260> inside<00:04:40.650> there<00:04:40.889> is<00:04:41.070> an<00:04:41.220> anti

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
scene anything inside there is an anti

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.280 
scene anything inside there is an anti
alias<00:04:41.880> it<00:04:42.090> just<00:04:42.300> looks<00:04:42.450> at<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.720> solid

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
alias it just looks at the the solid

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.050 
alias it just looks at the the solid
objects<00:04:43.770> basically<00:04:44.280> and<00:04:44.400> then<00:04:44.490> -<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:44.820> the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
objects basically and then - and the

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.390 
objects basically and then - and the
alias<00:04:45.330> is<00:04:45.480> that<00:04:45.690> very<00:04:46.350> quick<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.710> fix<00:04:47.010> we<00:04:47.190> just

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
alias is that very quick to fix we just

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.390 
alias is that very quick to fix we just
go<00:04:47.550> into<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.870> render<00:04:49.380> settings<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:50.130> we<00:04:50.190> go<00:04:50.340> to

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
go into the render settings and we go to

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.060 
go into the render settings and we go to
anti-aliasing<00:04:51.180> change<00:04:52.139> geometry<00:04:52.680> to<00:04:52.800> best

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
anti-aliasing change geometry to best

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.310 
anti-aliasing change geometry to best
and<00:04:53.430> then<00:04:54.150> that<00:04:54.330> will<00:04:54.450> calculate<00:04:54.660> there<00:04:55.230> are

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
and then that will calculate there are

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.920 
and then that will calculate there are
different<00:04:55.620> ways<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:55.770> could<00:04:56.070> just<00:04:56.280> put<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.930> tag

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
different ways you could just put a tag

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.170 
different ways you could just put a tag
on<00:04:58.139> that<00:04:58.560> particular<00:04:58.860> object<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.490> say<00:04:59.669> just

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
on that particular object and say just

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.840 
on that particular object and say just
anti-alias<00:05:00.690> all<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:01.050> that<00:05:01.200> particular<00:05:01.440> object

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
anti-alias all of that particular object

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.950 
anti-alias all of that particular object
now<00:05:02.850> you<00:05:02.940> can<00:05:03.060> see<00:05:03.150> at<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.330> minute<00:05:03.570> things<00:05:03.780> are

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
now you can see at the minute things are

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.750 
now you can see at the minute things are
looking<00:05:04.200> pretty<00:05:04.350> rubbish<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:05.160> glass<00:05:05.400> doesn't

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
looking pretty rubbish the glass doesn't

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.260 
looking pretty rubbish the glass doesn't
look<00:05:05.850> very<00:05:05.880> realistic<00:05:06.389> and<00:05:07.550> we've<00:05:08.550> got<00:05:08.760> part

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
look very realistic and we've got part

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.640 
look very realistic and we've got part
of<00:05:09.330> that<00:05:09.510> the<00:05:09.720> problem<00:05:09.840> is<00:05:10.139> that<00:05:10.350> we've<00:05:10.470> got

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
of that the problem is that we've got

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.860 
of that the problem is that we've got
nothing<00:05:10.979> to<00:05:11.010> reflect<00:05:11.490> in<00:05:11.639> the<00:05:11.729> scene<00:05:12.030> so<00:05:12.780> you

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
nothing to reflect in the scene so you

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.390 
nothing to reflect in the scene so you
can<00:05:12.990> also<00:05:13.110> use<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.470> content<00:05:13.860> browser<00:05:14.010> for

can also use the content browser for
that<00:05:14.550> as<00:05:14.700> well<00:05:14.940> so<00:05:15.300> what<00:05:15.479> we<00:05:15.510> could<00:05:15.660> do<00:05:15.870> we

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
that as well so what we could do we

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.060 
that as well so what we could do we

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620

we've<00:05:32.250> got<00:05:32.370> reflections<00:05:32.850> in<00:05:32.970> the<00:05:33.000> scene

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
we've got reflections in the scene

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.360 
we've got reflections in the scene
whenever<00:05:33.570> you're<00:05:33.690> doing<00:05:33.780> reflections<00:05:34.470> that's

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
whenever you're doing reflections that's

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.490 
whenever you're doing reflections that's
one<00:05:35.550> of<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.700> most<00:05:35.789> complicated<00:05:36.780> things<00:05:37.200> to<00:05:37.380> do

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
one of the most complicated things to do

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.360 
one of the most complicated things to do
in<00:05:37.979> the<00:05:38.160> scene<00:05:39.260> but<00:05:40.260> you<00:05:40.740> know<00:05:40.830> you'll<00:05:41.190> get<00:05:41.310> a

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
in the scene but you know you'll get a

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.700 
in the scene but you know you'll get a
nice<00:05:41.550> result<00:05:41.940> with<00:05:42.180> it<00:05:42.300> so<00:05:43.289> the<00:05:43.410> other<00:05:43.530> thing

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
nice result with it so the other thing

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.080 
nice result with it so the other thing
you<00:05:43.830> can<00:05:43.950> do<00:05:44.100> with<00:05:44.220> the<00:05:44.280> content<00:05:44.700> browser<00:05:44.880> is

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
you can do with the content browser is

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.180 
you can do with the content browser is
you're<00:05:45.240> not<00:05:45.360> just<00:05:45.840> stuck<00:05:46.140> with<00:05:46.169> this<00:05:46.560> content

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
you're not just stuck with this content

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.670 
you're not just stuck with this content
you<00:05:47.580> can<00:05:47.789> mix<00:05:48.360> and<00:05:48.539> match<00:05:48.600> content<00:05:49.200> as<00:05:49.320> you<00:05:49.440> see

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
you can mix and match content as you see

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.590 
you can mix and match content as you see
fit<00:05:49.950> these<00:05:50.160> are<00:05:50.280> full<00:05:50.490> 3d<00:05:50.880> objects<00:05:51.360> you<00:05:51.450> can

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
fit these are full 3d objects you can

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.840 
fit these are full 3d objects you can
change<00:05:51.900> the<00:05:52.050> actual<00:05:52.410> objects<00:05:53.039> themselves<00:05:53.220> so

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
change the actual objects themselves so

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.310 
change the actual objects themselves so
you<00:05:53.910> could<00:05:54.090> go<00:05:54.210> in<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:54.419> change<00:05:54.660> the<00:05:54.750> polygons

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
you could go in and change the polygons

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.110 
you could go in and change the polygons
if<00:05:55.530> you<00:05:55.620> want<00:05:55.800> to<00:05:55.890> that's<00:05:56.070> a<00:05:56.160> little<00:05:56.310> heavy<00:05:56.490> but

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
if you want to that's a little heavy but

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.490 
if you want to that's a little heavy but
one<00:05:57.210> of<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.389> easier<00:05:57.660> things<00:05:57.900> to<00:05:58.080> do<00:05:58.229> is<00:05:58.470> to

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
one of the easier things to do is to

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.560 
one of the easier things to do is to
change<00:05:58.770> the<00:05:58.950> materials<00:05:59.430> themselves<00:05:59.550> so<00:06:00.450> that

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
change the materials themselves so that

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.409 
change the materials themselves so that
glass<00:06:00.810> is<00:06:01.050> okay<00:06:01.470> it's<00:06:01.680> not<00:06:01.800> too<00:06:02.010> bad<00:06:02.250> it's<00:06:03.030> a

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
glass is okay it's not too bad it's a

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.540 
glass is okay it's not too bad it's a
little<00:06:03.810> bit<00:06:03.930> white<00:06:04.139> for<00:06:04.350> my<00:06:04.470> liking<00:06:04.710> though<00:06:05.039> we

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
little bit white for my liking though we

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.190 
little bit white for my liking though we
could<00:06:05.760> try<00:06:05.940> a<00:06:05.970> different<00:06:06.300> glass<00:06:06.450> on<00:06:06.750> there<00:06:06.900> so

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
could try a different glass on there so

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.230 
could try a different glass on there so
you<00:06:07.710> can<00:06:07.860> see<00:06:08.070> we've<00:06:08.700> got<00:06:08.820> the<00:06:08.940> various

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
you can see we've got the various

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.879 
you can see we've got the various
different<00:06:09.570> materials<00:06:10.020> here<00:06:10.289> if<00:06:10.410> we<00:06:10.590> go<00:06:10.740> and

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
different materials here if we go and

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:13.909 
different materials here if we go and
have<00:06:10.979> a<00:06:11.039> look<00:06:11.160> at<00:06:11.310> the<00:06:11.370> objects<00:06:11.760> themselves<00:06:12.919> we

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
have a look at the objects themselves we

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.180 
have a look at the objects themselves we
can<00:06:13.950> see<00:06:14.310> it's<00:06:14.490> like<00:06:14.639> this<00:06:14.820> blue<00:06:15.620> blue<00:06:16.620> tinted

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
can see it's like this blue blue tinted

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.980 
can see it's like this blue blue tinted
material<00:06:17.940> here<00:06:18.210> which<00:06:18.419> is<00:06:18.570> probably<00:06:18.870> while

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
material here which is probably while

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.930 
material here which is probably while
we're<00:06:19.139> getting<00:06:19.289> these<00:06:19.350> funny<00:06:19.590> colors<00:06:20.010> so<00:06:20.789> what

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
we're getting these funny colors so what

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.460 
we're getting these funny colors so what
you<00:06:21.030> could<00:06:21.210> do<00:06:21.360> is<00:06:21.539> go<00:06:21.720> and<00:06:21.810> have<00:06:21.870> a<00:06:21.990> look<00:06:22.260> at

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
you could do is go and have a look at

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.050 
you could do is go and have a look at
your<00:06:22.650> materials<00:06:23.220> and<00:06:24.000> bring<00:06:24.870> in<00:06:25.430> a<00:06:26.430> different

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
your materials and bring in a different

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.120 
your materials and bring in a different
glass<00:06:27.240> material<00:06:28.200> so<00:06:28.560> you<00:06:28.650> see<00:06:28.800> lots<00:06:29.010> of

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
glass material so you see lots of

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.029 
glass material so you see lots of
different<00:06:29.190> ones<00:06:29.520> in<00:06:29.760> here<00:06:30.470> and<00:06:31.470> we<00:06:31.590> could<00:06:31.740> try

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
different ones in here and we could try

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.950 
different ones in here and we could try
I<00:06:32.340> think<00:06:33.090> that<00:06:33.539> one<00:06:33.750> that's<00:06:33.900> quite<00:06:34.110> nice<00:06:35.030> so<00:06:36.030> we

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
I think that one that's quite nice so we

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.830 
I think that one that's quite nice so we
could<00:06:37.140> just<00:06:37.289> replace<00:06:37.560> that<00:06:38.190> material<00:06:38.760> and<00:06:39.060> now

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
could just replace that material and now

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.080 
could just replace that material and now
as<00:06:40.020> we<00:06:40.169> render

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
as we render

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.150 
as we render
that<00:06:41.690> will<00:06:41.870> be<00:06:42.020> the<00:06:42.380> material<00:06:42.800> that's<00:06:42.889> used

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
that will be the material that's used

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.530 
that will be the material that's used
instead<00:06:43.580> and<00:06:43.730> we<00:06:43.790> should<00:06:44.000> see<00:06:44.150> that<00:06:44.330> glass

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
instead and we should see that glass

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.270 
instead and we should see that glass
starts<00:06:44.990> to<00:06:45.110> look<00:06:45.230> quite<00:06:45.470> a<00:06:45.500> bit<00:06:45.680> nicer<00:06:45.889> in<00:06:46.100> the

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
starts to look quite a bit nicer in the

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.620 
starts to look quite a bit nicer in the
scene<00:06:47.410> so<00:06:48.410> that's<00:06:49.010> a<00:06:49.160> little<00:06:49.520> example<00:06:49.850> of<00:06:50.150> some

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
scene so that's a little example of some

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.850 
scene so that's a little example of some
of<00:06:50.660> the<00:06:50.810> content<00:06:51.229> you<00:06:51.260> can<00:06:51.470> use<00:06:51.620> in<00:06:51.770> the

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
of the content you can use in the

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.560 
of the content you can use in the
content<00:06:52.250> browser<00:06:52.400> so<00:06:52.880> it's<00:06:53.000> all<00:06:53.090> to<00:06:53.270> scale

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:53.570 
content browser so it's all to scale

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.969 
content browser so it's all to scale
we've<00:06:53.780> got<00:06:53.930> everything<00:06:54.110> rendering<00:06:54.590> up<00:06:54.740> now

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:54.979 
we've got everything rendering up now

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:56.620 
we've got everything rendering up now
and<00:06:55.520> of<00:06:55.639> course<00:06:55.820> we<00:06:55.940> can<00:06:56.090> take<00:06:56.270> this<00:06:56.389> further

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
and of course we can take this further

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.879 
and of course we can take this further
and<00:06:56.930> further<00:06:57.110> now<00:06:57.380> we<00:06:57.560> could<00:06:57.710> change

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:57.889 
and further now we could change

00:06:57.889 --> 00:06:59.890 
and further now we could change
different<00:06:58.669> render<00:06:58.940> settings<00:06:59.360> we<00:06:59.540> could<00:06:59.690> turn

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
different render settings we could turn

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.050 
different render settings we could turn
on<00:07:00.050> a<00:07:00.080> bit<00:07:00.260> of<00:07:00.320> global<00:07:00.860> illumination<00:07:01.010> and<00:07:01.699> all

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.060 
on a bit of global illumination and all

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.430 
on a bit of global illumination and all
sorts<00:07:02.419> of<00:07:02.510> stuff<00:07:02.720> to<00:07:02.870> make<00:07:02.990> it<00:07:03.050> a<00:07:03.169> lot<00:07:03.260> more

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 
sorts of stuff to make it a lot more

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.320 
sorts of stuff to make it a lot more
realistic<00:07:03.910> but<00:07:04.910> we're<00:07:05.060> already<00:07:05.180> getting

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
realistic but we're already getting

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.820 
realistic but we're already getting
there<00:07:05.570> so<00:07:05.690> you<00:07:05.750> can<00:07:05.870> see<00:07:06.050> like<00:07:06.199> the<00:07:06.320> glass<00:07:06.560> now

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
there so you can see like the glass now

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.030 
there so you can see like the glass now
looks<00:07:07.040> a<00:07:07.250> lot<00:07:07.580> nicer<00:07:08.560> in<00:07:09.560> this<00:07:09.740> particular

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.040 
looks a lot nicer in this particular

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.900 
looks a lot nicer in this particular
scene<00:07:10.900> than<00:07:11.900> we<00:07:11.960> had<00:07:12.110> before

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:12.910 
scene than we had before

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.740 
scene than we had before
kind<00:07:13.910> of<00:07:13.940> gets<00:07:14.120> you<00:07:14.180> up<00:07:14.300> and<00:07:14.389> running<00:07:14.660> the

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:14.750 
kind of gets you up and running the

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.969 
kind of gets you up and running the
course<00:07:14.960> in<00:07:15.110> this<00:07:15.229> scene<00:07:15.440> we<00:07:15.560> could<00:07:15.740> do<00:07:15.830> with<00:07:15.950> a

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:15.979 
course in this scene we could do with a

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:18.670 
course in this scene we could do with a
bit<00:07:16.160> of<00:07:16.190> shadows<00:07:17.090> you<00:07:17.660> know<00:07:17.780> so<00:07:18.050> we<00:07:18.169> turn<00:07:18.560> on

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 
bit of shadows you know so we turn on

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.890 
bit of shadows you know so we turn on
the<00:07:18.770> GI<00:07:18.950> and<00:07:19.280> we'd<00:07:19.610> get<00:07:19.790> that<00:07:19.940> a<00:07:20.180> very<00:07:20.690> small

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:20.900 
the GI and we'd get that a very small

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.510 
the GI and we'd get that a very small
tweet<00:07:21.139> you<00:07:21.260> could<00:07:21.410> do<00:07:21.530> is<00:07:21.650> to<00:07:21.919> try<00:07:22.130> the<00:07:22.190> likes

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 
tweet you could do is to try the likes

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.310 
tweet you could do is to try the likes
of<00:07:22.669> ambient<00:07:23.030> occlusion<00:07:23.240> which<00:07:23.720> will<00:07:23.870> help<00:07:23.990> get

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:24.320 
of ambient occlusion which will help get

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.170 
of ambient occlusion which will help get
those<00:07:24.500> little<00:07:24.770> shadows<00:07:25.250> I'll<00:07:25.669> just<00:07:25.850> turn<00:07:26.030> it

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:26.180 
those little shadows I'll just turn it

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.120 
those little shadows I'll just turn it
on<00:07:26.270> just<00:07:26.300> so<00:07:26.540> you<00:07:26.660> can<00:07:26.750> see<00:07:26.960> quickly<00:07:27.229> but<00:07:28.100> you

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.130 
on just so you can see quickly but you

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.740 
on just so you can see quickly but you
can<00:07:28.250> see<00:07:28.430> we're<00:07:28.850> already<00:07:28.970> getting<00:07:29.150> there<00:07:29.450> so

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.750 
can see we're already getting there so

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.300 
can see we're already getting there so
just<00:07:30.650> jump<00:07:30.950> in<00:07:31.160> then<00:07:31.850> go<00:07:32.560> down<00:07:33.560> here<00:07:33.919> effects

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:34.310 
just jump in then go down here effects

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.029 
just jump in then go down here effects
ambient<00:07:35.120> occlusion<00:07:35.740> apply<00:07:36.740> it<00:07:36.800> to<00:07:36.950> the

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 
ambient occlusion apply it to the

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:39.100 
ambient occlusion apply it to the
projects<00:07:37.639> and<00:07:38.180> I<00:07:38.270> just<00:07:38.450> render<00:07:38.690> a<00:07:38.720> little<00:07:38.960> bit

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.110 
projects and I just render a little bit

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.310 
projects and I just render a little bit
it's<00:07:39.590> down<00:07:39.770> here<00:07:40.539> and<00:07:41.539> we'll<00:07:41.660> probably<00:07:41.870> find

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:42.320 
it's down here and we'll probably find

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.020 
it's down here and we'll probably find
that<00:07:42.440> that<00:07:42.710> yeah<00:07:43.340> there<00:07:43.550> you<00:07:43.610> go<00:07:43.729> you<00:07:43.789> get<00:07:43.940> in

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.030 
that that yeah there you go you get in

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.690 
that that yeah there you go you get in
that<00:07:44.150> darkness<00:07:44.680> where<00:07:45.680> the<00:07:45.770> table<00:07:46.190> and<00:07:46.340> the

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:46.700 
that darkness where the table and the

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.120 
that darkness where the table and the
glass<00:07:46.970> joint<00:07:47.360> which<00:07:47.690> really<00:07:47.930> helps<00:07:48.229> bring<00:07:49.039> out

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.130 
glass joint which really helps bring out

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.150 
glass joint which really helps bring out
the<00:07:49.280> realism<00:07:49.610> at<00:07:49.820> the<00:07:49.940> scene<00:07:50.180> of<00:07:50.979> course<00:07:51.979> you

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 
the realism at the scene of course you

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.219 
the realism at the scene of course you
can<00:07:52.340> start<00:07:52.970> messing<00:07:53.090> around<00:07:53.240> with<00:07:53.450> physical

00:07:54.219 --> 00:07:54.229 
can start messing around with physical

can start messing around with physical
