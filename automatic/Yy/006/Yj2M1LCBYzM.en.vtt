00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
the moment so I would imagine that

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.000 
the moment so I would imagine that
something<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:44.760> always<00:04:44.940> want<00:04:45.480> but<00:04:45.870> but<00:04:46.350> is

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
something you always want but but is

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.370 
something you always want but but is
there<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.340> lot<00:04:47.580> of<00:04:47.610> kind<00:04:48.090> of<00:04:48.240> you<00:04:48.840> know<00:04:48.870> does

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
there a lot of kind of you know does

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.380 
there a lot of kind of you know does
everybody<00:04:49.860> want<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:50.490> every<00:04:50.730> year<00:04:50.910> do<00:04:51.180> you<00:04:51.240> all

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
everybody want it every year do you all

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.780 
everybody want it every year do you all
fight<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:52.110> be<00:04:52.260> which<00:04:52.410> I<00:04:52.560> think<00:04:53.340> so<00:04:53.610> yeah<00:04:53.760> I

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
fight to be which I think so yeah I

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.190 
fight to be which I think so yeah I
think<00:04:53.970> because<00:04:54.540> we're<00:04:54.750> all<00:04:54.900> from<00:04:55.080> a

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
think because we're all from a

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.050 
think because we're all from a
competitive<00:04:55.530> background<00:04:56.190> we've<00:04:56.370> pretty<00:04:56.970> much

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
competitive background we've pretty much

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.640 
competitive background we've pretty much
all<00:04:57.330> been<00:04:57.450> competing<00:04:57.750> since<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:58.350> very<00:04:58.380> young

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
all been competing since a very young

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.980 
all been competing since a very young
age<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:59.460> know<00:04:59.730> since<00:04:59.940> we<00:05:00.060> were<00:05:00.180> I<00:05:00.390> mean<00:05:00.780> some

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
age you know since we were I mean some

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.560 
age you know since we were I mean some
you<00:05:01.320> know<00:05:01.410> since<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.740> age<00:05:01.830> of<00:05:01.920> 10<00:05:02.190> 11<00:05:02.580> 12<00:05:02.880> so<00:05:03.330> I

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
you know since the age of 10 11 12 so I

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.280 
you know since the age of 10 11 12 so I
think<00:05:04.170> the<00:05:04.410> competition<00:05:04.980> is<00:05:05.070> just<00:05:05.370> in<00:05:05.610> US<00:05:05.850> but

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
think the competition is just in US but

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.090 
think the competition is just in US but
obviously<00:05:07.290> we<00:05:07.410> strictly<00:05:07.590> it's<00:05:07.830> different

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
obviously we strictly it's different

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.440 
obviously we strictly it's different
because<00:05:08.190> you've<00:05:08.430> got<00:05:08.550> people<00:05:08.790> of<00:05:09.060> different

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
because you've got people of different

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.970 
because you've got people of different
ages<00:05:09.540> different<00:05:09.840> abilities<00:05:10.560> different

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
ages different abilities different

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.550 
ages different abilities different
backgrounds<00:05:11.669> so<00:05:11.850> it's<00:05:12.000> not<00:05:12.120> really<00:05:12.180> a<00:05:12.570> fair

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
backgrounds so it's not really a fair

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.310 
backgrounds so it's not really a fair
competition<00:05:14.400> so<00:05:14.940> you<00:05:15.240> see<00:05:15.570> who's<00:05:15.870> gonna<00:05:16.080> win

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
competition so you see who's gonna win

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.710 
competition so you see who's gonna win
and<00:05:17.250> you<00:05:17.310> can<00:05:17.760> predict<00:05:18.150> definitely<00:05:18.510> who's

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
and you can predict definitely who's

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.300 
and you can predict definitely who's
gonna<00:05:18.900> be<00:05:19.140> really<00:05:19.590> good<00:05:19.830> but<00:05:19.950> then<00:05:20.100> there's

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
gonna be really good but then there's

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.520 
gonna be really good but then there's
always<00:05:20.550> somebody<00:05:20.760> who<00:05:21.120> really<00:05:21.720> surprises<00:05:22.380> you

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
and starts off quite bad and then really

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.140 
and starts off quite bad and then really
improves<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.740> winning<00:05:26.040> bit<00:05:26.370> for<00:05:26.610> me<00:05:26.790> was<00:05:27.120> when
