00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.730
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.429
 tutorial let's talk about canes 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.210
 about how we should transport them in the 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:30.179
 backpacks already start to see backpacks that 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.189
 They have specific straps for 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.739
 transport them but not all of them 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.960
 they have this kind of systems so 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.320
 we will see so much how we can 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.470
 adapt the traditional webbing to 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.940
 the transport of them the canes are 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.790
 very generalized tools like 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.379
 help during hiking gears 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.000
 essential alpine approaches 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.159
 for mountain skiing activities or 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.170
 snowshoes its effectiveness in the 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.269
 impulse as well as discharge of the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.920
 joints and help in balance 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.439
 during the progression it is no longer 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.210
 doubt but it will not always be the safest 

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:05.850
 take them in your hands because 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.799
 we will need hands-free to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.869
 other tools or simply because 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.570
 comes a climb and they become a 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.119
 hindrance and at that moment it is an element 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.009
 that decreases security in principle 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.780
 in the transport of the canes there are 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.500
 try to make it stand out as little as possible 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.020
 this 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.850
 it's only going to be possible in terms of 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.760
 length they have for the different 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.550
 backpacks in this case is how it is in 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.320
 Regarding the proportion of cane backpack 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.930
 but it is true that there are canes 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.460
 short enough to 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.770
 be able to transport them in the part of 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.020
 inside 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.149
 from here the first system of 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.399
 transport but let's explain is the 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.610
 specific to carry to carry 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.130
 Canes 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.370
 it's something a little more sophisticated and what 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.770
 we carry not all the backpacks we will see in 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.510
 some backpacks that we have two gummies 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.980
 in the bottom part as you see one at 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.410
 side of the other and a closure system 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.070
 also that normally elastic in the 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.750
 top in this case the cane in 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.520
 its tip would go 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.070
 on the part of the rubber band of the part of 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.440
 up and as you can see it is elastic and the 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.980
 close of the top 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.040
 I would take it and have the tightening system 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.470
 in this way, the cane is left 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.150
 tucked in the bottom important 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.270
 of this is that this tip never 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.270
 protrude through the bottom of the 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.920
 culera of the backpack in this case we see 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.420
 also another backpack that carries the same 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.940
 system and we have placed both the 2 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.030
 sticks closed equally by the 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.070
 part of above this would be the system 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.380
 more modern and that do not have all the 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.120
 models let's see now how can we 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.660
 place the canes in the backpack 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.040
 using that hook system that 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.800
 they traditionally have backpacks 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.080
 we go there the first resource to use 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.140
 the tapes that are usually 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.480
 placed to carry the ice axes 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.480
 example over here 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.920
 for transportation in this case 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.280
 using the same file as queue per 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.019
 the bottom part we would place the cane 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.970
 with the tip down the same 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.209
 way and then with the closing part of 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.090
 up so we closed the problem that 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.220
 you can find with this type of 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.409
 system is that the rosette is thin and 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.359
 place the part though doing it 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.129
 force gets stuck can in a 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.290
 moment of movement sneak in and by 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.420
 so we can get to lose it or that 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.370
 just let go and do not take it 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.159
 comfortably therefore in these 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.040
 situations there is a system that we can 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:45.280
 use that would be to close the tape and 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.340
 turn it into two gaps with this what 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.730
 we can do with a cinch that 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.730
 we will pass 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.060
 we will press 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.130
 we'll cut it down here and now it's 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.910
 when we could place 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.910
 a cane 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.800
 the other cane 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.030
 As you can see it is impossible to be able to 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:15.330
 strain and finally the straps of 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.549
 compression for transport of those of 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.850
 walking sticks in this case would be advisable 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.440
 that they will always wear the dragonera now 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.199
 the tip will go up because 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.320
 because we need to use the cinch 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:32.380
 down to pass it through 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.170
 of the dragonera we closed and this 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.770
 way we will never be able to 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.540
 falling the cane is very important with 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.380
 security that you can never fall 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.240
 Once we have placed it, it is closed 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.010
 and it remains for transport when the 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.740
 tips are up and above all 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.720
 when we go with a group always in everything 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.210
 moment we will use plugs that 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.640
 protect the spikes since this in a 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.490
 turn if they stick out excessively they can 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.380
 cause damage to our colleagues if 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.600
 he will not take the dragonera and let him 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.520
 blocked the bottom part and with the 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.110
 tip of malaysia down the tip 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.450
 exit downwards can cause 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.220
 problems in walking because we are shocked 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.320
 against the heels gets hooked in a 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.910
 branch or simply in a small 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.740
 streep that if you do not download it if you hook us 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.860
 and let's shoot forward 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.840
 therefore it is very important that 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.520
 when we use the webbing 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.249
 transport of compression tapes 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:31.189
 side can not the cane fall 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:33.019
 for example another backpack resource too 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:34.309
 with the compression line but only 

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:37.729
 take a tape to the top 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:41.990
 but down with a pocket we put 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:43.970
 exactly the same we close and 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.720
 compressed you can not stay for 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:51.700
 down which is the most important thing for not 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.860
 have problems and the tip we cover 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.620
 You have to know tours canes and you 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.350
 backpack and automate the gesture to 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.200
 put them and remove them this will make 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.570
 When you need it, do not go 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.220
 think and get it out quickly and it 's 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.750
 exactly the opposite as long as the 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.670
 have to use to put them and 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.600
 transport them properly the backpack 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:16.710
 this is security help us to do the 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.710
 safer mountains
