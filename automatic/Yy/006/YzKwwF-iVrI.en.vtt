00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
to since then we've basically just been

polishing<00:01:18.190> and<00:01:18.790> refining<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.869> game<00:01:20.080> I<00:01:20.110> mean

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
polishing and refining the game I mean

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.109

being an open-world game there's there's

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.150 
being an open-world game there's there's
quite<00:01:22.660> a<00:01:22.690> lot<00:01:22.810> of<00:01:22.959> ground<00:01:23.170> to<00:01:23.259> cover<00:01:23.350> so<00:01:23.649> we've

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
quite a lot of ground to cover so we've

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.790 
quite a lot of ground to cover so we've
just<00:01:24.369> been<00:01:25.020> putting<00:01:26.020> as<00:01:26.170> much<00:01:26.319> work<00:01:26.590> as<00:01:26.679> we

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
just been putting as much work as we

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.230 
just been putting as much work as we
possibly<00:01:26.979> can<00:01:27.399> it<00:01:27.610> just<00:01:27.729> tightening<00:01:28.060> up<00:01:28.209> the

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
possibly can it just tightening up the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.330 
possibly can it just tightening up the
experience<00:01:28.869> and<00:01:29.080> just<00:01:29.289> refining<00:01:29.679> it<00:01:29.890> based<00:01:30.130> on

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
experience and just refining it based on

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.520 
experience and just refining it based on
user<00:01:30.550> testing<00:01:31.119> and<00:01:31.420> even<00:01:32.050> watching<00:01:32.440> a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
multiple people play the game so we're

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.090 
multiple people play the game so we're
always<00:01:34.750> taking<00:01:35.020> down<00:01:35.319> notes<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:35.770> trying<00:01:35.979> to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100

what's<00:02:10.599> been<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.840> feedback<00:02:11.200> other<00:02:11.560> feedback

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
what's been the feedback other feedback

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.460 
what's been the feedback other feedback
has<00:02:12.160> been<00:02:12.190> very<00:02:12.760> very<00:02:13.000> very<00:02:13.450> strong<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.140> I

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
has been very very very strong and I

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.309 
has been very very very strong and I
think<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.950> fact<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.280> we're<00:02:15.459> showing

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
think the fact that we're showing

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.839 
think the fact that we're showing
multiple<00:02:17.319> demos<00:02:17.980> has<00:02:18.220> really<00:02:18.550> helped<00:02:18.760> because

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
multiple demos has really helped because

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.240 
multiple demos has really helped because
a<00:02:19.360> lot<00:02:19.690> of<00:02:19.720> times<00:02:20.050> when<00:02:20.200> people<00:02:20.260> just<00:02:20.709> play<00:02:20.950> you

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
a lot of times when people just play you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.730 
a lot of times when people just play you
know<00:02:21.540> one<00:02:22.540> mission<00:02:22.989> or<00:02:23.200> one

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
know one mission or one

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.650 
know one mission or one
segment<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.370> game<00:02:24.550> they're<00:02:24.910> like<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.510> it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
segment of the game they're like is it

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.510 
segment of the game they're like is it
an<00:02:25.750> open-world<00:02:26.110> game<00:02:26.380> doesn't<00:02:26.920> have<00:02:27.010> guns<00:02:27.250> and

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
an open-world game doesn't have guns and

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.310 
an open-world game doesn't have guns and
it<00:02:27.610> doesn't<00:02:28.030> have<00:02:28.150> free<00:02:28.330> running<00:02:28.570> so<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:29.110> think

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
it doesn't have free running so I think

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.780 
it doesn't have free running so I think
the<00:02:29.560> fact<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:29.890> we've<00:02:30.070> been<00:02:30.250> able<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.520> show<00:02:30.760> a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
the fact that we've been able to show a

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.510 
the fact that we've been able to show a
wider<00:02:31.150> array<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:32.140> gameplay<00:02:32.800> here<00:02:33.010> has<00:02:33.190> really

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
wider array of gameplay here has really

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.640 
wider array of gameplay here has really
helped<00:02:33.730> just<00:02:34.060> educate<00:02:34.840> people<00:02:35.020> on<00:02:35.320> all<00:02:35.530> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
helped just educate people on all the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.780 
helped just educate people on all the
kinds<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:35.950> things<00:02:36.010> that<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.340> player<00:02:36.520> can<00:02:36.550> do

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
kinds of things that the player can do

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.220 
kinds of things that the player can do
in<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:36.970> game<00:02:37.150> because<00:02:37.390> with<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.750> open<00:02:37.960> world

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
in the game because with the open world

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.320 
in the game because with the open world
games<00:02:38.440> yeah<00:02:38.710> there's<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.190> much<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.820> do<00:02:39.970> X

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
games yeah there's so much to do X

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.940 
games yeah there's so much to do X
incredibly<00:02:40.750> hard<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:40.960> crime<00:02:41.260> not<00:02:41.440> get<00:02:41.830> that

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
incredibly hard to crime not get that

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.500 
incredibly hard to crime not get that
crossing<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.460> little<00:02:42.670> five-minute<00:02:43.120> game<00:02:43.300> oh

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
crossing a little five-minute game oh

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.690 
crossing a little five-minute game oh
definitely<00:02:44.110> definitely<00:02:44.770> there's<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.370> lot<00:02:45.520> to

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
definitely definitely there's a lot to

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.240 
definitely definitely there's a lot to
do<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.480> think<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.170> fact<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.920> game<00:02:48.070> is

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
do and I think the fact that the game is

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.730 
do and I think the fact that the game is
very<00:02:48.460> action<00:02:49.030> focus<00:02:49.450> really<00:02:49.660> helps<00:02:50.050> on<00:02:50.260> that

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
very action focus really helps on that

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.770 
very action focus really helps on that
end<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.130> while<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:52.150> know<00:02:52.240> there<00:02:52.450> are<00:02:52.540> dozens
