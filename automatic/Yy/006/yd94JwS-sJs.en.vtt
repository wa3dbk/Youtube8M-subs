00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.759
 by the situation in the wave position that we have here in reference to the level 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:06.060
 from sea 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.229
 well in a cyclone 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:12.659
 will pass us all the all that is the sea discharge to the estuary 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.070
 you have to return a corral of information 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.640
 it is also another technique of the strip 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.810
 for a matter of space 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.900
 and because of the question of the level that he commented on, we are very 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.999
 vulnerable to tidal waves 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.999
 we try to use here 30 to 40% 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.400
 in the corral incubation technique 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.650
 and the rest we do it in nyse boxes 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.970
 the corral in Cuba zones cite a similar hole that the mother makes when those 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.910
 units 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.950
 the one with a depth of about 45 centimeters in the form of 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.430
 sing or because it's a neck and a camera 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.750
 round to the bottom 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.380
 where the complete clutch is deposited 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.280
 here the achievements 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.560
 we are watching them now 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.090
 with him it increased in the number of nests that we are 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.670
 receiving already here on this beach 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.200
 the acceptance by the communities 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.430
 they want to support they want to put their grain of sand 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.540
 percent when I got here 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.540
 by the way that was the master centuries 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.130
 the undesirable because we came and put rules and we said this is not 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.100
 can do 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.640
 we lick the task of the storm that does not spawn there is not much 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.170
 activity on the beach 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 go to visit the schools of the nearby communities 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.090
 where are we going and what are we going to talk about? 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.310
 which is the whole marina 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.310
 what is the program the importance of all this 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.400
 year with year 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.790
 2 have seen the 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.310
 perfect 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.680
 negative 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.830
 on the downside there are more people interested in participating in supporting us 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.640
 We are water now we can of the film I do not feel useless since 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.860
 see how those children who know each other and talked 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.949
 8 10 years 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:09.799
 now they are 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.279
 young people who come and participate here in the program we visit 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.979
 zelaya in honduras 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:20.969
 also from a tradition of grand opening final goal 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.119
 observing 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:26.559
 it's my social service 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:29.679
 the career of agricultural technician 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.679
 if it was already reserved for men 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.169
 for the communes of the region 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.459
 better than man 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.829
 people be close by wants to know 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.829
 I want to learn, want to participate 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.639
 unicef 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.749
 I am a biologist by profession 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:53.219
 p lina pohl made for medical conviction the conservation of animals and the management 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.109
 of natural resources from boston 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.529
 those in the controls 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:00.399
 more company wrong 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:04.239
 percent when coming here I realized the torture is in danger of extinction 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.909
 in toilet 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.019
 take note 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.829
 being outdoors is working 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.289
 the turtle 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.459
 they feel bad that is threatened 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.299
 in the sixth ecosystem because it is important because everyone is part of it 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:18.499
 if you do not take care crazy 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:20.059
 I do not know either but the rest 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:23.059
 remembered marin is a pretty noble animal 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.609
 totally vulnerable to any type of predator 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.329
 included the clear man is 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.589
 the more careful 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:32.169
 endowed with up to 2 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.759
 result 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:36.979
 because it protects the toco wood is not only to protect a species itself is 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.179
 protect the entire marine ecosystem 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:40.219
 basic 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:45.009
 because not only is it an animal that arrives opposed and goes away contributing to 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:48.329
 many trophic chains including regulation of organisms 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.689
 our fauna and flora 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:50.879
 the apedem oporto 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.639
 it's all of the heritage 12 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.109
 apart it is a fishing resource 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.229
 heavily exploited and it's important to get it back 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:02.039
 fignon if to a camp 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:05.729
 when he found out he was with Ram, he reported it 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:07.799
 what to support 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:08.790
 not encourage 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.939
 this kind of illegal egg consumption the consumption of meat 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.349
 this all hour 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.349
 encourage the trafficking of species that are in danger 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.050
 with everything 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.469
 to patrol 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:41.990
 I have a lot of ideas 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.990
 these efforts 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.990
 he was acclaimed 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.659
 about 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:57.840
 works of taking 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.020
 hi everyone for that reason 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.590
 people can
