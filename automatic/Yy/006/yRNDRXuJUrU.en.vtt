hi guys this is a video on my pac-man
frog<00:00:05.640> Rex<00:00:05.940> his<00:00:06.299> setup<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:07.259> how<00:00:07.859> we<00:00:07.919> did<00:00:08.340> it

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
frog Rex his setup and how we did it

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.390 
frog Rex his setup and how we did it
it's<00:00:09.570> pretty<00:00:09.870> simple<00:00:10.410> it's<00:00:10.710> nothing<00:00:11.160> too

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
it's pretty simple it's nothing too

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.580 
it's pretty simple it's nothing too
fancy<00:00:11.610> because<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.599> like<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.230> keep<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.559> simple

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
fancy because I like to keep it simple

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.430 
fancy because I like to keep it simple
it's<00:00:14.190> easier<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.670> clean<00:00:14.880> out<00:00:15.000> his<00:00:15.120> tank<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:16.049> I

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
it's easier to clean out his tank and I

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.109 
it's easier to clean out his tank and I
have<00:00:16.619> lots<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.920> other<00:00:17.039> reptiles<00:00:17.880> and

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
have lots of other reptiles and

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.689 
have lots of other reptiles and
amphibians<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.740> easier<00:00:20.039> are<00:00:20.189> they<00:00:20.580> are

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
amphibians so the easier are they are

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.529 
amphibians so the easier are they are
they<00:00:20.880> clean<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.449> better<00:00:21.660> for<00:00:21.930> us<00:00:22.100> but<00:00:23.330> as<00:00:24.330> you

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
they clean the better for us but as you

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.720 
they clean the better for us but as you
can<00:00:24.689> tell<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.500> have<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.070> water<00:00:26.340> bowl<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
can tell I have the water bowl on the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.500 
can tell I have the water bowl on the
right<00:00:27.410> Rex<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.859> left<00:00:29.240> the<00:00:30.240> middle<00:00:30.359> I

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
right Rex is on the left the middle I

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.269 
right Rex is on the left the middle I
have<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> big<00:00:30.960> old<00:00:31.050> plant<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.590> got<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.040> at

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
have a big old plant I got that at

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.000 
have a big old plant I got that at
Petsmart<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.600> was<00:00:33.780> like<00:00:33.960> about<00:00:34.620> 10

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
Petsmart I think it was like about 10

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.729 
Petsmart I think it was like about 10
bucks<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.670> got<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:36.510> sell<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.380> liked<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
bucks I got it on sell but I liked the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.799 
bucks I got it on sell but I liked the
way<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.860> looked<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.370> kind<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.820> spruces<00:00:39.690> out

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
way it looked it kind of spruces out

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.020 
way it looked it kind of spruces out
everywhere<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.890> really<00:00:41.250> liked<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.760> Rex

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
everywhere so I really liked it and Rex

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.950 
everywhere so I really liked it and Rex
seems<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:42.510> like<00:00:42.750> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
seems to really like it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.610 
seems to really like it
he's<00:00:43.410> always<00:00:43.739> underneath<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:45.350> then<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.590> have

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
he's always underneath it then we have

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.479 
he's always underneath it then we have
his<00:00:47.039> tank<00:00:47.340> which<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.420> believe<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.840> little

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
his tank which is I believe a little

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.360 
his tank which is I believe a little
smaller<00:00:50.489> than<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.910> 10<00:00:51.149> gal<00:00:51.770> because<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> way

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
smaller than a 10 gal because of the way

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.350 
smaller than a 10 gal because of the way
it<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:54.030> one<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.360> those<00:00:54.449> open<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.379> glass

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
it is it's one of those open up glass

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.470 
it is it's one of those open up glass
cages<00:00:57.360> from<00:00:57.600> EXO<00:00:58.109> Terra<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.399> does<00:00:59.699> have<00:01:00.090> a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
cages from EXO Terra but it does have a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.630 
cages from EXO Terra but it does have a
screen<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.050> each<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> left<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.489> right

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
screen on each of the left and the right

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.240 
screen on each of the left and the right
side<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:04.049> hot<00:01:04.350> where<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> light<00:01:05.010> bulb

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
side and it's hot where the light bulb

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.940 
side and it's hot where the light bulb
sits<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.930> order<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.320> maintain<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
sits but in order to maintain the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.740 
sits but in order to maintain the
humidity<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.549> tank<00:01:08.820> what<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.270> did<00:01:09.479> was<00:01:09.720> we

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
humidity in the tank what we did was we

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.980 
humidity in the tank what we did was we
actually<00:01:10.460> got<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.820> black<00:01:12.060> kitchen<00:01:12.540> towel<00:01:12.720> we

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
actually got a black kitchen towel we

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.820 
actually got a black kitchen towel we
cut<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> size<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:15.150> actual<00:01:15.830> screen

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
cut it to the size of the actual screen

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.649 
cut it to the size of the actual screen
right<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> outside<00:01:18.509> we

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
right here and on the outside we

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.499 
right here and on the outside we
velcroed<00:01:19.170> each<00:01:19.380> corner<00:01:19.830> down<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.400> both<00:01:21.240> sides

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
velcroed each corner down on both sides

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.289 
velcroed each corner down on both sides
of<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.259> screens<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.890> that's<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.909> maintain

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
of the screens and that's to maintain

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.780 
of the screens and that's to maintain
the<00:01:24.420> humidity<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:25.290> not<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:26.070> most

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the humidity it's not the most

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.910 
the humidity it's not the most
attractive<00:01:26.939> thing<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.259> black<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.799> it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
attractive thing but it is black so it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.730 
attractive thing but it is black so it
does<00:01:29.070> match<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.490> cage<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.500> nobody<00:01:31.500> really

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
does match the cage and nobody really

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.469 
does match the cage and nobody really
sees<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> sides<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.490> cages<00:01:32.909> because<00:01:33.000> we

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
sees the sides of the cages because we

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.249 
sees the sides of the cages because we
kind<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:33.990> them<00:01:34.320> side<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.710> side<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.259> it's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
kind of have them side to side so it's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.399 
kind of have them side to side so it's
really<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:38.009> worked<00:01:38.490> pretty<00:01:38.610> good<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.150> us<00:01:39.409> we

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
really it's worked pretty good for us we

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.460 
really it's worked pretty good for us we
use<00:01:41.220> coconut<00:01:41.490> fibers<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.390> substrate<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.170> do

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
use coconut fibers the substrate I do

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.600 
use coconut fibers the substrate I do
that<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.610> ingested<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.630> little<00:01:45.869> bit<00:01:46.049> it

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
that because if ingested a little bit it

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
that because if ingested a little bit it
should<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.790> able<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.000> pass<00:01:48.210> through<00:01:48.479> their

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
should be able to pass through their

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.249 
should be able to pass through their
system<00:01:49.049> clearly<00:01:49.729> I'm<00:01:50.729> not<00:01:51.090> really<00:01:51.540> sure<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.110> it

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
system clearly I'm not really sure if it

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.620 
system clearly I'm not really sure if it
would<00:01:52.409> completely<00:01:52.790> impact<00:01:53.790> them<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> know

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
would completely impact them but I know

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.109 
would completely impact them but I know
that<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.020> try<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.380> keep<00:01:55.619> rex<00:01:55.890> from<00:01:56.189> ingesting

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
that I try to keep rex from ingesting

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.209 
that I try to keep rex from ingesting
anything<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.079> which<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.590> why<00:01:58.710> I've<00:01:58.860> removed

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
anything so which is why I've removed

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.490 
anything so which is why I've removed
the<00:01:59.310> moss<00:01:59.490> from<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> cages<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:00.450> well<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.869> used

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
the moss from the cages as well I used

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.749 
the moss from the cages as well I used
to<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.920> because<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.219> looks<00:02:02.369> really<00:02:02.610> nice

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
to have it because it looks really nice

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.139 
to have it because it looks really nice
but<00:02:03.829> you<00:02:04.829> know<00:02:04.860> always<00:02:05.369> want<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:05.700> safe<00:02:05.939> with

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
but you know always want to be safe with

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.410 
but you know always want to be safe with
right<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.259> removed<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.179> just

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
right so I removed it and now we just

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.809 
right so I removed it and now we just
have<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.840> plain<00:02:10.140> old<00:02:10.170> coconut<00:02:10.619> fiber<00:02:10.920> which

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
have the plain old coconut fiber which

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.600 
have the plain old coconut fiber which
of

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
of

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.250 
of
I<00:02:12.640> missed<00:02:13.000> every<00:02:13.360> day<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:13.810> make<00:02:13.930> sure<00:02:14.080> it's

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
I missed every day and make sure it's

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.750 
I missed every day and make sure it's
nice<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.440> wet<00:02:14.740> on<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.070> left-hand<00:02:15.520> side

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
nice and wet on the left-hand side

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.820 
nice and wet on the left-hand side
because<00:02:16.210> that's<00:02:16.720> his<00:02:16.900> favorite<00:02:17.230> place<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.650> be

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
because that's his favorite place to be

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.220 
because that's his favorite place to be
and<00:02:18.160> on<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.880> right-hand<00:02:19.030> side<00:02:19.480> you'll<00:02:19.690> see<00:02:19.870> I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
and on the right-hand side you'll see I

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.510 
and on the right-hand side you'll see I
think<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.590> can<00:02:20.710> kind<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:20.950> tell<00:02:21.130> in<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.280> video

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
think you can kind of tell in the video

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.810 
think you can kind of tell in the video
it's<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.790> little<00:02:21.820> bit<00:02:22.180> more<00:02:22.390> drier<00:02:23.430> he<00:02:24.430> likes<00:02:24.640> it

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
it's a little bit more drier he likes it

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.140 
it's a little bit more drier he likes it
both<00:02:25.000> ways<00:02:25.210> I<00:02:25.680> really<00:02:26.680> haven't<00:02:26.860> seen<00:02:27.040> him<00:02:27.430> you

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
both ways I really haven't seen him you

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.800 
both ways I really haven't seen him you
know<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:29.170> any<00:02:29.770> diet<00:02:30.310> changes<00:02:30.940> because<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.660> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
know and any diet changes because of the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.420 
know and any diet changes because of the
way<00:02:31.900> I've<00:02:32.020> kept<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:32.770> I'm<00:02:33.250> hoping

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
way I've kept it so I'm hoping

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.670 
way I've kept it so I'm hoping
everything<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.090> ok<00:02:34.360> for<00:02:34.390> him

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
everything is ok for him

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.230 
everything is ok for him
I<00:02:35.740> saw<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.160> background<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:36.850> put<00:02:37.060> in<00:02:37.150> the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
I saw a background that I put in the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.630 
I saw a background that I put in the
back<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.870> like<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.650> weight<00:02:38.800> look<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.280> bought

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
back I like the weight look so I bought

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.199 
back I like the weight look so I bought
it<00:02:40.410> his<00:02:41.410> light<00:02:41.680> bulb<00:02:41.890> is<00:02:42.190> one<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:42.730> those<00:02:42.910> dome

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
it his light bulb is one of those dome

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.630 
it his light bulb is one of those dome
bulbs<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.840> believe<00:02:44.380> it's<00:02:44.560> made<00:02:44.830> by<00:02:45.040> pflueger's

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
bulbs I believe it's made by pflueger's

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.449 
bulbs I believe it's made by pflueger's
and<00:02:46.570> it's<00:02:46.720> got<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.700> ceramic<00:02:48.700> up<00:02:48.880> here<00:02:49.240> so<00:02:49.540> that

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
and it's got the ceramic up here so that

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.790 
and it's got the ceramic up here so that
it<00:02:51.459> doesn't<00:02:51.570> overheat<00:02:52.570> you<00:02:53.470> can<00:02:53.650> actually

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
it doesn't overheat you can actually

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.220 
it doesn't overheat you can actually
touch<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:54.700> even<00:02:55.540> though<00:02:55.630> it's<00:02:55.780> pretty<00:02:55.930> hot

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
touch it so even though it's pretty hot

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.800 
touch it so even though it's pretty hot
but<00:02:57.040> it's<00:02:57.220> definitely<00:02:57.520> touchable<00:02:58.390> which<00:02:58.660> is

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
but it's definitely touchable which is

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.510 
but it's definitely touchable which is
why<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.170> comes<00:02:59.320> in<00:02:59.530> handy<00:02:59.680> rather<00:03:00.100> than<00:03:00.370> the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
why that comes in handy rather than the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.470 
why that comes in handy rather than the
old<00:03:00.820> ones<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.239> didn't<00:03:01.450> have<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:03.480> that

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
old ones that didn't have that and that

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.880 
old ones that didn't have that and that
I<00:03:04.810> believe<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.410> bulb<00:03:05.650> inside<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:07.140> zoo<00:03:08.140> Med<00:03:08.440> I

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
I believe the bulb inside is a zoo Med I

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.670 
I believe the bulb inside is a zoo Med I
think<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.760> does<00:03:09.880> need<00:03:10.030> zoo<00:03:10.209> Med<00:03:10.450> it's<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.900> 50

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
think it does need zoo Med it's a 50

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.750 
think it does need zoo Med it's a 50
watt<00:03:11.860> so<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.700> used<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.239> for<00:03:13.300> his<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:15.340> imitate

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
watt so I used that for his to imitate

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.539 
watt so I used that for his to imitate
the<00:03:16.000> daily<00:03:16.540> cycle<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.920> turn<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.190> off<00:03:18.340> at

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
the daily cycle and I turn it off at

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.400 
the daily cycle and I turn it off at
night<00:03:18.730> sometimes<00:03:19.180> just<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.810> then<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.019> will<00:03:20.170> put

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
night sometimes just and then I will put

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.009 
night sometimes just and then I will put
a<00:03:20.530> blue<00:03:20.739> bulb<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:21.430> he<00:03:22.420> can<00:03:22.600> have<00:03:22.660> his<00:03:22.720> nighttime

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
a blue bulb so he can have his nighttime

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.840 
a blue bulb so he can have his nighttime
cycle<00:03:23.650> which<00:03:23.769> looks<00:03:24.100> really<00:03:24.430> pretty<00:03:24.640> at<00:03:24.820> night

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
cycle which looks really pretty at night

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.840 
cycle which looks really pretty at night
but<00:03:25.810> other<00:03:26.080> times<00:03:26.350> we<00:03:26.530> just<00:03:26.560> turn<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.010> off<00:03:27.070> this

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
but other times we just turn it off this

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.850 
but other times we just turn it off this
this<00:03:28.420> light<00:03:28.690> bulb<00:03:28.870> actually<00:03:29.110> does<00:03:29.560> really

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
this light bulb actually does really

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.690 
this light bulb actually does really
well<00:03:30.730> for<00:03:31.180> his<00:03:31.330> temperatures<00:03:31.870> in<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.709> tank<00:03:32.980> it

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
well for his temperatures in the tank it

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.699 
well for his temperatures in the tank it
maintains<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.299> nice<00:03:34.480> warm<00:03:34.810> temperature<00:03:35.380> and

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
maintains a nice warm temperature and

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.710 
maintains a nice warm temperature and
I've<00:03:36.130> noted<00:03:36.459> you<00:03:36.730> know<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:37.030> more<00:03:37.360> I<00:03:37.390> leave<00:03:37.600> it

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
I've noted you know the more I leave it

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.410 
I've noted you know the more I leave it
on<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:37.959> course<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:39.160> drier<00:03:39.400> his<00:03:39.670> coconuts<00:03:40.209> of

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
on of course the drier his coconuts of

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.900 
on of course the drier his coconuts of
shape<00:03:40.630> will<00:03:40.810> get<00:03:41.019> so<00:03:41.640> that's<00:03:42.640> why<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:42.790> only

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
shape will get so that's why I only

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.370 
shape will get so that's why I only
leave<00:03:43.090> all<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.390> light<00:03:43.510> bulbs<00:03:43.660> on<00:03:43.900> for<00:03:44.110> half<00:03:44.290> of

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
leave all the light bulbs on for half of

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.100 
leave all the light bulbs on for half of
the<00:03:44.440> day<00:03:44.530> and<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:46.299> know<00:03:46.390> I<00:03:46.420> constantly<00:03:46.750> check

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
the day and you know I constantly check

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.750 
the day and you know I constantly check
it<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.440> make<00:03:47.470> sure<00:03:47.620> he's<00:03:47.950> nice<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:48.190> moist<00:03:48.549> so

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
it to make sure he's nice and moist so
