I want<00:02:13.550> them<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:14.000> fly<00:02:14.300> in<00:02:14.600> from<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:16.430> now<00:02:16.550> as<00:02:16.730> I

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
I want them to fly in from and now as I

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.960 
I want them to fly in from and now as I
play<00:02:17.180> I've<00:02:18.080> got<00:02:18.350> my<00:02:18.560> animation<00:02:19.250> now<00:02:19.819> I<00:02:19.850> don't

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
play I've got my animation now I don't

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.330 
play I've got my animation now I don't
have<00:02:20.240> caching<00:02:20.810> turned<00:02:21.050> on<00:02:21.260> just<00:02:21.620> yet<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.069> my

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
have caching turned on just yet so my

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.100 
have caching turned on just yet so my
performance<00:02:22.910> isn't<00:02:23.090> great<00:02:23.300> but<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.810> can<00:02:23.930> see

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
performance isn't great but you can see

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.559 
performance isn't great but you can see
I've<00:02:24.290> got<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:25.250> animation<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.959> want<00:02:28.569> now

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
I've got the animation that I want now

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.809 
I've got the animation that I want now
by<00:02:29.930> default<00:02:30.200> this<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.130> simple<00:02:31.640> linear

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
by default this is a simple linear

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.420 
by default this is a simple linear
animation<00:02:32.569> so<00:02:32.780> if<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.989> want<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.410> jazz<00:02:33.800> this<00:02:34.069> up<00:02:34.310> a

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
animation so if I want to jazz this up a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.050 
animation so if I want to jazz this up a
little<00:02:34.610> bit

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
little bit

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.900

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
I can click these little handles on the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.510 
I can click these little handles on the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.460 
video tracks I'll shrink the video
tracks<00:02:40.910> down<00:02:41.300> just<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:41.989> little<00:02:42.020> bit<00:02:42.350> I<00:02:42.380> don't

and<00:03:20.180> now<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:21.440> can<00:03:21.620> see<00:03:21.829> I<00:03:21.860> have<00:03:22.190> some<00:03:22.459> nice

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
and now you can see I have some nice

and now you can see I have some nice
eased<00:03:23.090> motion

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.350 

I<00:03:27.810> want<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.290> make<00:03:28.380> sure<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.310> get<00:03:29.910> both

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
I want to make sure that I get both

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.890 
I want to make sure that I get both
keyframes<00:03:31.350> eased<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.520> to<00:03:32.670> do<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.420> have<00:03:33.840> a

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
keyframes eased and to do that I have a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.600 
keyframes eased and to do that I have a
little<00:03:34.020> pop-out<00:03:34.440> menu<00:03:34.860> up<00:03:35.010> there<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.430> lets

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
little pop-out menu up there that lets

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.320 
little pop-out menu up there that lets
me<00:03:35.790> choose<00:03:36.180> which<00:03:36.840> curve<00:03:37.230> I'm<00:03:37.470> looking<00:03:37.890> at<00:03:38.330> and

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
me choose which curve I'm looking at and

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.550 
me choose which curve I'm looking at and
I<00:03:39.420> want<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.660> do<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.900> same<00:03:40.110> thing<00:03:40.440> up<00:03:40.620> here<00:03:41.450> just

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
I want to do the same thing up here just

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.520 
I want to do the same thing up here just
toggle<00:03:43.560> those<00:03:43.710> off<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.370> on<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:45.840> can<00:03:46.110> see<00:03:46.350> the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
toggle those off and on so I can see the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.460 
toggle those off and on so I can see the
other<00:03:46.560> curve<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:48.330> once<00:03:48.480> I've<00:03:48.630> added<00:03:48.660> handles

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
other curve so once I've added handles

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.960 
other curve so once I've added handles
to<00:03:49.680> both<00:03:49.860> X&amp;Y<00:03:50.520> I<00:03:51.230> can<00:03:52.230> see<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.710> I've<00:03:52.830> got<00:03:53.040> my

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
to both X&amp;Y I can see that I've got my

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.890 
to both X&amp;Y I can see that I've got my
sequence<00:03:54.510> just<00:03:55.500> easing<00:03:56.040> into<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.490> stop<00:03:56.910> at<00:03:57.810> this

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
sequence just easing into a stop at this

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.680 
sequence just easing into a stop at this
point<00:03:57.990> I<00:03:58.200> can<00:03:58.380> close<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.800> editors<00:03:59.390> if<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:00.480> hold

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
point I can close the editors if I hold

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.870 
point I can close the editors if I hold
the<00:04:00.870> shift<00:04:00.900> key<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.770> can<00:04:02.160> drag<00:04:02.400> these<00:04:02.670> up

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
the shift key I can drag these up

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.840 
the shift key I can drag these up
without<00:04:03.210> moving<00:04:03.630> them<00:04:04.160> then<00:04:05.160> I<00:04:05.340> can<00:04:05.370> go<00:04:05.670> in

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
without moving them then I can go in

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.200 
without moving them then I can go in
here<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.540> try<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.140> find<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:08.040> nice<00:04:08.520> opening

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
here and try and find a nice opening

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.030 
here and try and find a nice opening
shot<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.840> I<00:04:09.870> had<00:04:10.170> before

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
shot that I had before

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.520 
shot that I had before
grab<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.180> car<00:04:14.390> coming<00:04:15.390> in<00:04:15.600> underneath<00:04:15.960> and

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
grab that car coming in underneath and

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.640 
grab that car coming in underneath and
you<00:04:17.220> can<00:04:17.400> see<00:04:17.609> how<00:04:17.790> those<00:04:18.090> titles<00:04:18.650> integrate

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
you can see how those titles integrate

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:28.880 
you can see how those titles integrate
with<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.160> rest<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.670> scene

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.280 

now<00:04:29.890> at<00:04:30.040> this<00:04:30.190> point<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:30.850> want<00:04:31.420> those<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.990> fade

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
now at this point I want those to fade

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.370 
now at this point I want those to fade
away<00:04:32.770> I<00:04:33.160> can<00:04:33.490> cheese<00:04:34.030> out<00:04:34.300> just<00:04:34.810> add<00:04:35.020> a<00:04:35.050> couple
