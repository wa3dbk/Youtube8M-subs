more than look at m16 about it note the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.280 
more than look at m16 about it note the

video this one the 27 inch semi fluted

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.130 
video this one the 27 inch semi fluted
barrel<00:01:37.320> at<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.130> front<00:01:38.520> end<00:01:38.930> we<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:40.110> a

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
barrel at the front end we have a

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.100 
barrel at the front end we have a
purpose-designed<00:01:40.710> muzzle<00:01:41.670> break<00:01:42.110> Barrett's

purpose-designed muzzle break Barrett's
say<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.829> will<00:01:44.009> reduce<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.490> recoil<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.119> that

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
say this will reduce the recoil to that

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.420 
say this will reduce the recoil to that
of<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.420> 20-gauge<00:01:45.899> shotgun<00:01:46.070> we'll<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.399> that

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
of a 20-gauge shotgun we'll see if that

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.210 
of a 20-gauge shotgun we'll see if that
works<00:01:47.729> or<00:01:47.970> not<00:01:48.380> there's<00:01:49.380> no<00:01:49.590> other<00:01:49.770> recoil
