00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.750
 a video commented in live that means nothing since said twice in 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.769
 live so you understand that it is a video commented live 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.550
 especially at the act 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.510
 in team death match 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.900
 with the pm 63 so fast m19 silent house 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.150
 the rest the rest does not follow going after he has scored as dry 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.690
 the games watched their flight 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.270
 and here we go so it's a drinking sport and a very gameplay 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.850
 interesting 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.680
 with 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.290
 i'm not going to m didier lopez very constructive will not be a dialogue 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.390
 monologue earlier since I speak alone to my TV 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.380
 the first magnificent elimination 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.380
 so when in strict kit that would be that I do not know 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.710
 thank you kind mass 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.399
 g too many jammers napalm eble of berne samake too 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.660
 ordered by the class generator site and still its mass 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.440
 I feel like I'm going to have fun 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.610
 I did a little warm-up unfairly I'm 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.610
 stumbled upon a team of campers 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.150
 there I fell asleep in celebration 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.660
 since I had pirates and actually playing lenient everywhere so I 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.710
 tell me 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.680
 well I'm going to do like I'm not going forward piola did not want to advance the 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.950
 part 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.360
 so I did not get very hot in the party 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.820
 so euros will try to find the enemy eads has a it's him who's got me 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.460
 find 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.740
 but it's so annoying but if you like it are you in 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.370
 the same case as me because there 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.370
 I already played this weekend it was the same 1 8% 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.680
 and I even passed the cut 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.570
 % 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.570
 these are the ones who support him this exact same wind 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.690
 and there I am fed up 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.470
 so i had the luxury got black ops these cursed modern reinforcement of 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.649
 besides cliffs 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:14.649
 winnie 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.109
 what's going on tell me 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.190
 then starting from industrial processes 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.709
 coutu moves not to move 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:21.849
 continent 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.849
 they can we will take that others will follow on August 1 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.389
 or maybe not 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:28.769
 yes I also have to see it 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.769
 so that greet the most mundane 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.889
 in may moretz kick a pool 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.700
 no actually a great he's preparing a r 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.619
 10h41 forgiveness 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:45.200
 so a little drone that's good it was very very well 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.119
 thank you for killing him 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:49.379
 I took a very long 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.419
 once lit in his lies for the time otherwise 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:53.260
 I am 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.629
 few new bases 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.319
 you know how to make you special no I gladly remember that we are not 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.189
 disagree 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.679
 I lived neither lenient 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:04.009
 it's okay 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:08.059
 dumay I changed configuration we make a new pc that I will go up 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.919
 myself 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:15.069
 in europe chooses the components with the help of sperm 740 of quercia him 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.069
 a man that's how they would have done 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:21.419
 going 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:22.779
 everything else I mean 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:23.630
 It is special 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.069
 ah yes chemical 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.499
 and I'll take a Minitel 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:32.149
 so that's for sure it's unfortunate to them I still hesitate on which version 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:34.379
 take what I have a really tight budget 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.379
 this moment then it's an age I do not work 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.709
 I can not work in presale principle 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.379
 and percent I'm scared 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.969
 money in the pocket the former manager of a genre for the promoters people 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:46.879
 that's all 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.199
 so that nicky to tell you this is 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.199
 well not easy to pay for something like that 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.529
 and then that's what so percent I'm going to try to do a drinking trick 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.079
 saving maximum on components 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.049
 martin mckee 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.269
 and then ball 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.379
 in this site gilardo is useless 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.349
 ballmer who will celebrate his 30 years and who comes on him 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.409
 but it was true in fact 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.720
 I'm doing 10 5 2 ratio with a Kulen weapon I have almost never 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.809
 played its costs 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:21.900
 cool 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.970
 but listen there she this time I had to play that theme 103 6 goals per 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.389
 match and manufacturers 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.960
 what a way end March 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.419
 their match to paris when bost and mandatory standards com 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.490
 we will put a foot in the account groupings jorion all remember 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.050
 object more than to lie down 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.699
 no kidding 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.699
 in a mine 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.770
 I'm too much trouble adjusting today what do you want 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.289
 in e 3 days of break already knew that I want and that's it 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.480
 enraged at being able to run I pulled thanks to ibisevic demented 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.210
 we also like the angry costs 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.210
 a little stealthy dagger for them for the road 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.930
 we do not believe it we win it's great by cons my teammates I think who 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.009
 are as good as the enemies since they ask nothing either 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.210
 but what can with his 10 years 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.039
 this is a small he has a strong aim 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.039
 German ammunition but ah the la 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.520
 I do not know why they created us end they put their teeth in 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.889
 black ops what some are really 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.319
 not terrible when finally I mean regarding cold did it 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.389
 lmp five sets and 90 or 120 were good machine gun the year 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.639
 on black ops it seems that 114 tell him not much 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.639
 why in a very small series 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.610
 I need to find ammunition to complete the postponements 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.020
 g bulletproof vest fortunately for me 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.160
 but here I am, with a knife, a mortal who agrees with me 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.599
 still 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.599
 we hold back while we have a spy plane is crazy about that 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
 in the second it is the municipalities and especially a building 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.659
 we will put this 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:17.180
 why is it going to give 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.180
 five years to place a napalm shot all I can say 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:22.910
 he did to me 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.159
 for the moment since we never know 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.689
 go we'll set the time to attract them g and look at all the points 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:29.699
 red which is in front 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.699
 it's just awesome 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.629
 3 step by step 3 so what? 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:40.360
 I unlocked alliot-marie in this paris where he is serene 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.749
 a black beur of 

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:43.589
 with a class like that 

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:44.440
 frankly 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.440
 I'm not progressing to say no 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.460
 at the very end this patch progress is that they are null phase one 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.460
 it's a good discussion thing 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:58.330
 being under x switch week 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.819
 did one have to accept 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:03.129
 buy to pack me for nothing 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:06.229
 knowing that there are more and more people that I actually know who 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:09.830
 watch the videos so here I have no more freedom of expression 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.650
 and sees the super workaround completely effective triple fides 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.449
 worth 63 I can do my people I believe 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:18.499
 Why 

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:20.710
 non nantes field series 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.710
 in when I think I'm 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.990
 missing more than five points of the set at 6-5 finished this part anyway 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.819
 I see nothing at all I'm a little drunk that are a lot are 

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:39.129
 asks a big naze who does nothing like the other 

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:42.129
 on the lookout for a sprint 

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:44.869
 where it is question of final 

00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:47.869
 with a small 23 9 of 56 the ratio 

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:50.889
 thurman very happy with this part 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:54.210
 I hope in any case that you have liked it do not hesitate to put posters 

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.840
 comments it's so much fun 2009 without giving thanks to all 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.139
 next step the 3000 encrypted to a day I will talk about it again 

00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:04.809
 2 at the opel lobby key and then I do not know what 

00:08:04.809 --> 00:08:07.949
 everything is very soon for a next video commented on Saturday for the 

00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:12.439
 weight of the 1000 episode eleven trains is already played with episode we get 

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:13.449
 believes places 

00:08:13.449 --> 00:08:14.090
 those and all
