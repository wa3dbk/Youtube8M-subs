went like 37 and one or 37 and to

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.740 
went like 37 and one or 37 and to
something<00:00:19.070> like<00:00:19.160> that<00:00:19.400> but<00:00:20.270> a<00:00:20.330> really<00:00:20.600> good

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
something like that but a really good

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.680 
something like that but a really good
start<00:00:21.080> a<00:00:21.580> gameplay<00:00:22.580> actually<00:00:23.060> turned<00:00:23.360> out<00:00:23.480> to

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
start a gameplay actually turned out to

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.500 
start a gameplay actually turned out to
be<00:00:23.950> kind<00:00:24.950> of<00:00:25.070> a<00:00:25.190> shitty<00:00:25.490> gameplay<00:00:25.940> I<00:00:25.970> ended<00:00:26.420> up
