00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:07.490
 But after crossing 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:10.010
 Is made to what the wind because You're that top players of the unit organization of the world today 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.450
 I wonder if I am 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.500
 that 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:22.360
 I was asked to talk about your favorite unit formation now 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.470
 Hey No say if they were unique transition what wind is after all it pop player 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.400
 Also the Tteyuu know little 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:34.029
 I think that it would be nice to be that study this time 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.029
 I think that top player I want to see unit formation 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:44.760
 I I it is first this is I'd opponent and towards the day of the world's husband is the player I first place 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.800
 It is surprising, but orthodox 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.140
 Eve and Zuka are you 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.600
 Yup 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.690
 This is Chiba 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.700
 It may be a safe unit formation 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:04.720
 Though it may be happened by any chance 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:07.600
 I think that I want to look at the way of the world's second place in the next a little 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.560
 In ne This is more of a brother 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.409
 that 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.890
 It is together 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.260
 that 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.620
 Connie also 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.240
 Zuka and Evy- 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.240
 Let's also see the third person 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.630
 This is the third place but it is still together 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.360
 In that currency and Ebi 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:37.340
 After all this may be easy to use 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:40.570
 On the contrary, if it comes to here, the brain of a Japanese pot player a little 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.500
 I'm just wondering about unit formation 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.090
 Which I think would like to see Monechotto 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.090
 This is the top of Japan 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:57.980
 I'm the first place but I still make it heavy 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.740
 This is my brother in Japan, but finally here 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.490
 It yen radioactive came out 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.890
 at last 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.490
 Not ever 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.429
 To say that unit organized 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:14.640
 This is quite certainly 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.640
 You will see that it 's such has put a force to attack 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:26.110
 This is the one of the range, but after all the old one is that tank type day 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:32.050
 Unit organization of the world's top players of it is I feel it 's has formed a unit Yoza 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:39.130
 I saw that but there were a lot of unit formations of that currency and heavy 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:45.480
 Ebel say I is Do's quite valid unit of you even when high Why that 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:49.310
 It is a feeling that it becomes like it is necessary to master how you sing 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:54.040
 It is a handle and a heavy degree about how to use before 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:58.810
 I'm also collecting videos, so I hope you can refer to them by all means 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.049
 It seems this time is to on Subscribe and high evaluation was also wish you in the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.049
 Good 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.710
 [musics] 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.710
 Hmm 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.710
 me
