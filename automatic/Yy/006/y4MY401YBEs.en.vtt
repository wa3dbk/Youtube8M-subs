 hello in this video tutorial i will show you 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.469
 how to braid a 5 strand braid 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.410
 I will try to you very clearly and 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.920
 clearly explain how such a spit 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.920
 trudging 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.119
 dividing hair into five equal strands 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.610
 fix them with hair ties 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.340
 it will make weaving much easier 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.989
 strand they will stumble and you yourself don't 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.960
 you will get confused 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.160
 such colored rezinochki not only 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.110
 facilitate weaving 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.110
 well and also decorate our braid 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:51.890
 we have 5 strands extreme right 5 2 strand 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:57.640
 rightmost left strand 2 strands left 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.640
 as well as the middle strand 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:07.000
 put the leftmost strand on the second 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.220
 spin the left and wind up and immediately under 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.110
 middle strand 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.200
 the leftmost strand is now ours 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.830
 middle strand take the most extreme 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.090
 right strand put it on the second strand 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.130
 and on the right and get it under the middle strand 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.790
 now the extreme right shoulder has become ours 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.790
 middle strand 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.150
 put the leftmost strand again on 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.990
 the second strand on the left and wind it under 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.970
 middle strand 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:42.400
 she is now our middle strand 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.360
 now put the rightmost strand on 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.500
 2 before the right and start it right under 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.920
 middle strand 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.580
 now strand to the right from the edge of our table 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.580
 middle strand 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.490
 put the leftmost strand again on 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.640
 second strand on the left and wind up and under 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.119
 middle strand now it has become our 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.429
 middle strand 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.670
 put extremely mustard gas on the right for the second 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.860
 strand on the right and wind it under the middle 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.200
 strand now strand on the right 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:23.319
 has become our middle strand extreme strand 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:28.750
 we get on the second strand on the left and under 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:32.890
 middle strand extreme strand 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.069
 we get on 2 strands on the right and under the middle 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.069
 strand 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:43.470
 left strand on the second strand on the left and under 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.470
 middle strand 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.720
 the rightmost strand is 2 5 on the right and under 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.720
 middle strand 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.430
 the leftmost strand always lies down 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:03.600
 first 2 strands on the left and start up under 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.630
 middle strand right extreme strand 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.970
 lays down first on 2 strand on the right and 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.970
 wind up under the middle strand 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.640
 if the principle of weaving is clear, the braid 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.430
 trudging pretty easy extreme strand 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.040
 always falls first on the second strand with 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.500
 edges and start up always under the middle 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.500
 strand and so we weave on 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:45.379
 having finished weaving we will fix cash desk 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:48.069
 rubber our braid from 5 locks 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.069
 ready 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.520
 let's correct now rezinochki and also 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.520
 tim volume on the spit 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.670
 I hope that now you understand how 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.460
 braid 5 strand braid thanks for 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.180
 view and until next time 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.180
