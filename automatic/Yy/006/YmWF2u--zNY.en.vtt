00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 the commission made up of advisers 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.779
 members of the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.890
 child and adolescent 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.540
 aldermen and the federal deputy 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.610
 member of the state council of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.960
 human rights reached the foundation house 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.880
 of limeira in the late afternoon of this 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.250
 Thursday they came to the place 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.100
 investigate complaints against the institution 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.010
 we already have denunciations including 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.890
 documented violence 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.750
 against adolescents who are 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.340
 here under hospitalization 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.020
 We're going to look for these teens. 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.390
 verity or not 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.090
 complaints and immediately ask the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.700
 proceedings before the judiciary 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.860
 to stop the violence being given to 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.840
 protection of these adolescents 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.070
 the letter of the complaint cites the director of 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.440
 unit and a penitentiary 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.300
 suspected of abuse 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.820
 the complaints were obtained through the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.800
 dial 100 and describe situations of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.829
 ill-treatment assaults and beatings 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.600
 which would have been committed by the director 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.100
 of the first unit and also a 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.660
 penitentiary agent 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.460
 according to the federal deputy renato 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.320
 which is part of the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.450
 human rights of the state of sÃ£o paulo 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.280
 What is striking in this case is that the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.930
 director of the home foundation of limeira 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.049
 he would have been involved in situations 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.710
 similar in other units of the state 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.880
 we already have a past from the director of this 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.790
 unit in other units also with 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.560
 suspected and reported beatings 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.360
 so it's serious we need 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.170
 check if it is indeed 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.790
 happening 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.070
 according to the complainant 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.860
 are serious but common in the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.470
 home foundation we had a change of 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.829
 name of feb for foundation house 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.500
 a change in the aesthetics of the most 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.540
 this has not penetrated the institution yet 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.610
 What we want is the fulfillment of the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.009
 the status of the child and adolescent 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.530
 their socio-educational measures the process 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.170
 re-socialization and unfortunately the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.259
 violence bar all this and turned 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.840
 the old feb in a worsened replica of the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.640
 adult prison system. 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.719
 times controlled by factions 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.610
 criminals 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.410
 so it's important that that same thing 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.870
 do not happen and we can bar 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.880
 as early as possible at any time 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.740
 type of violence that could degenerate 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.080
 in this type of situation 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.210
 evidence of 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.140
 maltreatment the unit's direction may 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.210
 be punished 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.980
 under these conditions it is necessary to 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.620
 dismissal of employees 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.220
 both an 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.560
 administrative burden on the part of the 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.750
 of the executive as a criminal inquiry 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.940
 by the judiciary of the 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.030
 public ministry so that they 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.850
 responsive to the law can both 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.610
 in the criminal area are sentenced to 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.010
 penalties for the assault to perform as 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.870
 also possibly until clearance 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.870
 expulsion of the foundation's staff
