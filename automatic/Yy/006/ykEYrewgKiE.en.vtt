that and rebooted the machine let's
unplug<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.910> can<00:04:29.060> show<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.270> what's<00:04:29.990> inside

here I flipped this unlocks which

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.040 
here I flipped this unlocks which
inadvertently<00:04:33.620> so<00:04:34.250> now<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:34.760> can<00:04:35.690> just<00:04:35.720> lift

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:48.999 
that I believe that's the hard drive

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:52.139 
that I believe that's the hard drive
this<00:04:49.479> is<00:04:49.689> the<00:04:49.869> the<00:04:50.289> RAM<00:04:50.499> on<00:04:50.879> standard<00:04:51.879> sticks

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:52.149 
this is the the RAM on standard sticks

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:54.389 
this is the the RAM on standard sticks
there<00:04:52.419> and<00:04:52.599> the<00:04:53.110> connectors<00:04:53.559> the<00:04:54.009> reason

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:54.399 
there and the connectors the reason

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:55.799 
there and the connectors the reason
there's<00:04:54.519> so<00:04:54.639> many<00:04:54.699> connectors<00:04:55.239> well<00:04:55.539> there's

00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:55.809 
there's so many connectors well there's

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:57.419 
there's so many connectors well there's
really<00:04:55.989> very<00:04:56.110> little<00:04:56.439> you<00:04:56.769> can<00:04:56.829> upgrade<00:04:57.069> in

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:57.429 
really very little you can upgrade in

00:04:57.429 --> 00:04:59.279 
really very little you can upgrade in
here<00:04:57.639> you're<00:04:58.029> absolutely<00:04:58.509> going<00:04:58.839> to<00:04:58.989> want<00:04:59.169> to

to drive you're going to want to get a

00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:05.789 
to drive you're going to want to get a
4k<00:05:04.389> monitor<00:05:04.749> it's<00:05:04.899> fast<00:05:05.139> enough<00:05:05.259> to<00:05:05.469> support

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:05.799 
4k monitor it's fast enough to support

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:07.679 
4k monitor it's fast enough to support
that<00:05:05.889> but<00:05:06.610> here's<00:05:06.849> the<00:05:06.909> problem<00:05:07.149> if<00:05:07.449> you<00:05:07.539> buy

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
highly functional I have to say it

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.610 
highly functional I have to say it
really<00:07:03.460> does<00:07:03.880> the<00:07:04.030> job<00:07:04.380> it's<00:07:05.380> also

benchmarks on the SSD I saw speeds that

you're<00:07:29.920> going<00:07:30.010> to<00:07:30.070> need<00:07:30.160> some<00:07:30.370> very<00:07:30.700> expensive

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:30.850 
you're going to need some very expensive

you're going to need some very expensive
peripherals<00:07:31.840> in<00:07:31.930> fact<00:07:32.110> the<00:07:32.200> whole<00:07:32.320> thing<00:07:32.620> is

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:32.830 
peripherals in fact the whole thing is

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.940 
peripherals in fact the whole thing is
just<00:07:33.340> ridiculously<00:07:34.090> expensive<00:07:34.620> however<00:07:35.620> I've

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:35.950 
just ridiculously expensive however I've

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.770 
just ridiculously expensive however I've
got<00:07:36.430> to<00:07:36.610> say<00:07:36.790> if<00:07:37.000> you're<00:07:37.210> the<00:07:37.330> person<00:07:37.570> who

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:37.780 
got to say if you're the person who

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.020 
got to say if you're the person who
needs<00:07:38.110> this<00:07:38.380> kind<00:07:38.440> of<00:07:38.710> speed<00:07:39.040> or<00:07:39.250> you've<00:07:39.820> got

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.030 
needs this kind of speed or you've got

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.610 
needs this kind of speed or you've got
enough<00:07:40.240> money<00:07:40.420> and<00:07:40.750> you<00:07:40.840> can<00:07:41.020> you<00:07:41.230> really<00:07:41.440> have

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:41.620 
enough money and you can you really have

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.770 
enough money and you can you really have
an<00:07:41.710> appreciation<00:07:42.100> for<00:07:42.340> design<00:07:42.790> there's<00:07:43.600> no

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:43.780 
an appreciation for design there's no

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.480 
an appreciation for design there's no
question<00:07:44.110> in<00:07:44.140> my<00:07:44.230> mind<00:07:44.290> this<00:07:44.590> is<00:07:44.650> a<00:07:44.800> buy<00:07:45.040> I<00:07:45.070> like

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:45.490 
question in my mind this is a buy I like

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.280 
question in my mind this is a buy I like
this<00:07:45.640> better<00:07:45.880> than<00:07:46.060> I<00:07:46.180> thought<00:07:46.390> this<00:07:46.960> is<00:07:47.170> the

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.290 
this better than I thought this is the
