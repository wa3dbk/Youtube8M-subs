black<00:00:51.570> clusters<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.070> got<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> also

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
black clusters but you got to also

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.799 
black clusters but you got to also
remember<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:54.059> cereal<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> you're<00:00:54.690> going

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
remember with cereal that you're going

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.110 
remember with cereal that you're going
to<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.929> adding<00:00:55.199> skim<00:00:55.800> milk<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.999> that's

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
to be adding skim milk and so that's

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.689 
to be adding skim milk and so that's
also<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> add<00:00:57.899> more<00:00:58.140> calories<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.890> so

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
also going to add more calories and so

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.680 
also going to add more calories and so
that<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.800> used<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.339> half<00:01:02.850> cup<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.269> skim

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that if you just used a half cup of skim

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.350 
that if you just used a half cup of skim
milk<00:01:03.719> that'll<00:01:04.530> add<00:01:04.739> another<00:01:05.250> 40<00:01:05.700> calories<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
milk that'll add another 40 calories to

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.270 
milk that'll add another 40 calories to
it<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:07.620> pretty<00:01:07.800> sure<00:01:07.890> we'll<00:01:08.010> add<00:01:08.130> another

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
it and I'm pretty sure we'll add another

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.200 
it and I'm pretty sure we'll add another
40<00:01:08.790> calories<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.660> this<00:01:09.870> too<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:11.310> then<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.760> you

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
40 calories to this too and then so you

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
40 calories to this too and then so you
also<00:01:12.480> want<00:01:12.660> to<00:01:12.690> try<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.870> go<00:01:13.140> with<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
also want to try to go with like the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.390 
also want to try to go with like the
low-fat<00:01:14.370> milk<00:01:14.730> or<00:01:15.090> nonfat<00:01:15.270> milk<00:01:16.100> because<00:01:17.100> full

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
low-fat milk or nonfat milk because full

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.100 
low-fat milk or nonfat milk because full
fat<00:01:17.610> milk<00:01:17.790> will<00:01:18.030> probably<00:01:18.420> add<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.840> lot<00:01:18.990> of

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
fat milk will probably add a lot of

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.340 
fat milk will probably add a lot of
calories<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.270> then<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.540> when<00:01:22.230> you're

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
calories to it and then so when you're

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.740 
calories to it and then so when you're
looking<00:01:22.740> at<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.980> labels<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.970> want<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.240> look

five<00:02:06.930> grams<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.380> fat<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.700> there's<00:02:09.030> no

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
five grams of fat and then there's no

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.590 
five grams of fat and then there's no
saturated<00:02:09.929> fat<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.709> soy<00:02:10.860> blocks<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.940> then

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
saturated fat in the soy blocks and then

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.930 
saturated fat in the soy blocks and then
this<00:02:13.320> area<00:02:13.800> right<00:02:14.130> here

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
this area right here

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.580 
this area right here
there<00:02:15.060> are<00:02:16.050> 0<00:02:16.980> well<00:02:17.250> not<00:02:17.490> well<00:02:17.850> ok<00:02:18.440> what's<00:02:19.440> up

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
there are 0 well not well ok what's up

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.230 
there are 0 well not well ok what's up
you<00:02:19.740> want<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.010> get<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.610> want<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.820> look<00:02:21.120> at

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
you want to get that you want to look at

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.230 
you want to get that you want to look at
the<00:02:21.360> fiber<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.500> protein<00:02:23.100> because<00:02:24.030> those

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
the fiber and the protein because those

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.660 
the fiber and the protein because those
are<00:02:24.480> stuff<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.830> want<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.280> your<00:02:26.310> food

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
are stuff that you you want in your food

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
are stuff that you you want in your food
and<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:28.700> with<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.820> fiber<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.390> can<00:02:30.510> see<00:02:30.660> that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
and so with the fiber you can see that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.780 
and so with the fiber you can see that
there's<00:02:30.990> one<00:02:31.230> gram<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:31.770> cinemas<00:02:32.160> toast<00:02:32.430> crunch

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
there's one gram in cinemas toast crunch

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.720 
there's one gram in cinemas toast crunch
and<00:02:33.030> six<00:02:33.300> grams<00:02:33.570> in<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.590> soy<00:02:34.740> flask<00:02:35.160> clusters

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
and six grams in the soy flask clusters

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.000 
and six grams in the soy flask clusters
and<00:02:35.940> then<00:02:36.210> one<00:02:36.420> gram<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.660> protein<00:02:36.960> in<00:02:37.650> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
and then one gram of protein in the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.860 
and then one gram of protein in the
cinnamon<00:02:38.370> toast<00:02:38.640> crunch<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.030> seven<00:02:39.360> grams<00:02:39.600> in

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
cinnamon toast crunch and seven grams in

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.010 
cinnamon toast crunch and seven grams in
the<00:02:40.050> soy<00:02:40.230> wax<00:02:40.470> clusters<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:42.750> obviously

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
the soy wax clusters so that obviously

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.790 
the soy wax clusters so that obviously
shows<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.070> soy<00:02:44.190> wax<00:02:45.290> clusters<00:02:46.290> are<00:02:46.560> a

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
shows that the soy wax clusters are a

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.260 
shows that the soy wax clusters are a
little<00:02:47.010> bit<00:02:47.250> healthier<00:02:47.430> than<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.880> cinnamon

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
little bit healthier than the cinnamon

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.670 
little bit healthier than the cinnamon
toast<00:02:48.540> crunch<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:50.220> then<00:02:51.230> you<00:02:52.230> look<00:02:52.380> at<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
toast crunch and then you look at the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.310 
toast crunch and then you look at the
sugars<00:02:52.980> also<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:54.630> can<00:02:54.750> see<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:54.960> there's
