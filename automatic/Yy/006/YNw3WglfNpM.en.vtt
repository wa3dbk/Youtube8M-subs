00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.080

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.210
 genre singer has matured 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.850

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.160

 morange queen dancehall queen wine 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.160
 crm of dancehall 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.730
 after reindeer I think in the sense that 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.649
 in end with dancing by illuminating it 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.430
 shade here I think it's the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.290
 sense of dream reigns the dancehall then 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.770
 the order my competition it was 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.590
 the 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.989
 audience like a dance battle where the 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.760
 public chooses who is the winner 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.710
 when I'm on ten feel a lot 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:14.260
 of confident pleasure and sharing 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.940
 I like in dancehall but the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.010
 beats and I find that this is the 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.860
 pace that suits me in fact how 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.430
 I'm training it's initially it's been 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.710
 in front of my mirror and then in the bathroom 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.110
 training with assault friends 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.060
 associations in a dance hall 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.070
 so the fact of single queen eden that's me 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.520
 allowed to have some way contacts 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.640
 for clips or and for myself 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.160
 especially that convinced me that ben 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.250
 dance dancehall it was my way 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.520

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.229
