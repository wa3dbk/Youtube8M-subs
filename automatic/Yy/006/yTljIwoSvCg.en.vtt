with one hand let me see if i can
transform<00:02:06.119> them<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.479> one<00:02:06.689> hand<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.439> so

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
transform them with one hand but it's so

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.710 
transform them with one hand but it's so
pretty<00:02:07.829> easy<00:02:08.099> since<00:02:08.910> with<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.179> other<00:02:09.330> hand

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
that see how easy he is to transform let

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.720 
that see how easy he is to transform let
me<00:02:14.670> see<00:02:14.820> if<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:14.940> can't<00:02:15.150> get<00:02:15.270> focus<00:02:15.840> right<00:02:16.050> here
