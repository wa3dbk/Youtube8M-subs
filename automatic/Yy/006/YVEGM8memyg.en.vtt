next up is a ruler that's also a stick a
needle<00:01:23.200> gauge<00:01:23.619> checker<00:01:24.100> tell<00:01:24.460> me<00:01:24.549> what<00:01:24.700> size

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
needle gauge checker tell me what size

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.090 
needle gauge checker tell me what size
needles<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:25.420> I'm<00:01:25.540> using<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:26.439> ruler<00:01:27.040> is

needles that I'm using the ruler is

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.160 
needles that I'm using the ruler is
important<00:01:27.700> because<00:01:27.939> you<00:01:28.299> want<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.630> be<00:01:28.810> able<00:01:29.020> to

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
you're checking stitch gauge if you see

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:34.830 
you're checking stitch gauge if you see
if<00:01:33.640> you're<00:01:33.759> getting<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.090> correct<00:01:34.210> tension<00:01:34.570> on

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
if you're getting the correct tension on

if you're getting the correct tension on
a<00:01:34.869> pattern<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.470> then<00:01:35.799> of<00:01:35.890> course<00:01:35.920> it's<00:01:36.310> an

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
a pattern and then of course it's an

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.179 
a pattern and then of course it's an
added<00:01:36.729> bonus<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.060> have<00:01:37.329> the<00:01:37.630> needle<00:01:38.439> gauge<00:01:38.770> the

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
added bonus to have the needle gauge the

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.300 
added bonus to have the needle gauge the
needle<00:01:39.490> size<00:01:39.700> thing<00:01:40.090> here<00:01:40.390> as<00:01:40.570> well<00:01:41.250> now<00:01:42.250> the
