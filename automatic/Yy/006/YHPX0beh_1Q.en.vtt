wildly once you actually get to 10th

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
wildly once you actually get to 10th
prestige<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.240> get<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.540> 10th<00:01:12.720> prestige<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
your first like 55 levels and then once

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.640 
your first like 55 levels and then once
you<00:01:24.090> get<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> your<00:01:24.479> 10th<00:01:24.720> prestige<00:01:24.990> at<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> end

little<00:01:37.890> bit<00:01:38.100> before<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> pre-release<00:01:38.759> video

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
little bit before in a pre-release video

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.080 
little bit before in a pre-release video
or<00:01:39.630> pretty<00:01:39.960> good<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.979> only<00:01:41.220> two<00:01:41.400> maps<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.820> still

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
or pretty good the only two maps I still

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.560 
or pretty good the only two maps I still
have<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.540> real<00:01:42.930> real<00:01:43.140> real<00:01:43.320> big<00:01:43.649> issue<00:01:43.890> with<00:01:44.189> are

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
have a real real real big issue with are

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.060 
have a real real real big issue with are
the<00:01:45.570> Metro<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.500> forget<00:01:46.740> what<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.009> called

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the Metro like I forget what it's called

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.850 
the Metro like I forget what it's called
the<00:01:47.310> railway<00:01:47.759> map<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.380> mall<00:01:49.590> map

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the railway map and the the mall map

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.880 
the railway map and the the mall map
Plaza<00:01:50.280> both<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.210> these<00:01:51.329> maps<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.780> do<00:01:52.350> well<00:01:52.649> on

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
Plaza both of these maps I do well on

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.010 
Plaza both of these maps I do well on
but<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.640> don't<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.299> them<00:01:54.479> very<00:01:54.509> much<00:01:54.750> I

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
but I just I don't like them very much I

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.120 
but I just I don't like them very much I
think<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> fact<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.710> they're<00:01:55.860> mostly

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
think it's the fact that they're mostly

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.730 
think it's the fact that they're mostly
indoors<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.240> killstreaks<00:01:58.020> don't<00:01:58.380> work<00:01:58.500> very

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
indoors and killstreaks don't work very

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.230 
indoors and killstreaks don't work very
well<00:01:58.799> there's<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> lot<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.340> corners<00:01:59.759> indoors

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
well there's a lot of corners indoors

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.440 
well there's a lot of corners indoors
and<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.799> B<00:02:02.009> point<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.520> both<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.909> these<00:02:03.000> maps<00:02:03.270> is

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
and the B point on both of these maps is

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.660 
and the B point on both of these maps is
like<00:02:03.630> whiteout<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> F<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.649> open<00:02:05.040> it's

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
like whiteout in the F and open it's

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.940 
like whiteout in the F and open it's
it's<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.689> crazy<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.290> really<00:02:07.439> hard<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.829> try

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
it's really crazy and really hard to try

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.260 
it's really crazy and really hard to try
to<00:02:07.979> can't<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:08.610> there's<00:02:08.759> hardly<00:02:09.000> any

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
to can't because there's hardly any

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.420 
to can't because there's hardly any
cover<00:02:09.569> at<00:02:09.780> all<00:02:09.899> especially<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:10.979> domination

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
cover at all especially in domination

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.650 
cover at all especially in domination
game<00:02:11.550> types<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.000> for<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.180> most<00:02:12.330> part<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.629> think

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
game types but for the most part I think

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.730 
game types but for the most part I think
a<00:02:12.870> lot<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.140> maps<00:02:13.319> are

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
a lot of the maps are

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.370 
a lot of the maps are
pretty<00:02:14.220> damn<00:02:14.550> good<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.180> think<00:02:15.660> Yemen<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.230> might

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
pretty damn good I think Yemen it might

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.380 
pretty damn good I think Yemen it might
be<00:02:16.500> my<00:02:16.680> favorite<00:02:16.920> map<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.790> game<00:02:18.030> but

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
be my favorite map in the game but

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.750 
be my favorite map in the game but
beside<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.170> it's<00:02:19.890> it's<00:02:20.280> looking<00:02:20.580> pretty

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
beside that it's it's looking pretty

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.030 
beside that it's it's looking pretty
good<00:02:20.970> now<00:02:21.030> let's<00:02:21.360> talk<00:02:21.480> about<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.840> guns<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
good now let's talk about the guns the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.800 
good now let's talk about the guns the
guns<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.490> black<00:02:23.640> ops<00:02:23.850> 2<00:02:24.060> definitely<00:02:24.570> feel

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
guns and black ops 2 definitely feel

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.620 
guns and black ops 2 definitely feel
much<00:02:25.380> different<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.190> was<00:02:26.670> having<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.120> lot<00:02:27.390> of

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
much different I was having a lot of

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.170 
much different I was having a lot of
situations<00:02:28.290> where<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:29.190> get<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.520> first<00:02:29.790> hit

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
situations where you get the first hit

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.090 
situations where you get the first hit
on<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.450> guy<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.170> got<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.560> first<00:02:31.860> hit

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
on a guy like you got the first hit

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.710 
on a guy like you got the first hit
absolutely<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.790> then<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.030> dude<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.360> able<00:02:33.600> to

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
absolutely and then the dude is able to

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.170 
absolutely and then the dude is able to
pick<00:02:34.050> up<00:02:34.170> his<00:02:34.320> gun<00:02:34.470> aim<00:02:35.160> directly<00:02:35.550> at<00:02:35.850> your

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
pick up his gun aim directly at your

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.030 
pick up his gun aim directly at your
head<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.480> get<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.900> head<00:02:37.170> shot<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.650> couple<00:02:37.860> of

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
head and get a head shot and a couple of

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.950 
head and get a head shot and a couple of
body<00:02:38.190> shots<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.790> are<00:02:38.910> dead<00:02:39.240> in<00:02:39.420> a

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
body shots and you are dead in a

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.800 
body shots and you are dead in a
heartbeat<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.800> happens<00:02:41.430> an<00:02:41.610> awful<00:02:42.360> lot<00:02:42.570> I

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
heartbeat that happens an awful lot I

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.060 
heartbeat that happens an awful lot I
don't<00:02:43.260> know<00:02:43.350> if<00:02:43.410> that's<00:02:43.560> something<00:02:43.860> new<00:02:43.950> with

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
don't know if that's something new with

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.830 
don't know if that's something new with
the<00:02:44.160> connection<00:02:44.700> but<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.090> definitely<00:02:45.570> seems

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
the connection but it definitely seems

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.050 
the connection but it definitely seems
that<00:02:46.050> keeping<00:02:46.860> your<00:02:46.980> target<00:02:47.430> at<00:02:47.550> first<00:02:47.820> is

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
that keeping your target at first is

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.150 
that keeping your target at first is
really<00:02:48.540> important<00:02:48.990> in<00:02:49.080> black<00:02:49.260> ops<00:02:49.500> 2<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.980> even

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
really important in black ops 2 and even

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160 
really important in black ops 2 and even
though<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.280> get<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.610> first<00:02:50.880> shot<00:02:51.210> which<00:02:51.900> was

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
though you get the first shot which was

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.260 
though you get the first shot which was
the<00:02:52.380> epitome<00:02:52.740> of<00:02:52.980> modern<00:02:53.610> warfare<00:02:53.790> 3<00:02:54.000> in

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
the epitome of modern warfare 3 in

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.490 
the epitome of modern warfare 3 in
modern<00:02:54.510> warfare<00:02:54.660> 3<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.050> had<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.290> get<00:02:55.470> the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
modern warfare 3 you had to get the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.740 
modern warfare 3 you had to get the
first<00:02:55.800> shot<00:02:55.860> that's<00:02:56.220> all<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:56.640> had<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.090> do<00:02:57.270> and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
first shot that's all you had to do and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.850 
first shot that's all you had to do and
for<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:57.960> majority<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.410> time<00:02:58.650> you're<00:02:58.740> gonna

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
for the majority of time you're gonna

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.650 
for the majority of time you're gonna
win<00:02:59.040> those<00:02:59.160> two<00:02:59.340> those<00:02:59.460> gun<00:02:59.700> battles<00:03:00.060> but<00:03:00.570> in

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
win those two those gun battles but in

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.210 
win those two those gun battles but in
black<00:03:00.810> ops<00:03:01.050> so<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.260> have<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.530> keep<00:03:01.740> your<00:03:01.920> shot

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
black ops so you have to keep your shot

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.920 
black ops so you have to keep your shot
that<00:03:02.550> seems<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.910> be<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.090> most<00:03:03.240> important<00:03:03.720> part

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
that seems to be the most important part

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.600 
that seems to be the most important part
that<00:03:03.960> I've<00:03:04.200> realized<00:03:04.440> while<00:03:05.220> playing<00:03:05.460> this

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
that I've realized while playing this

little<00:04:56.270> bit<00:04:56.509> I<00:04:56.600> like<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.410> KSG<00:04:57.740> because<00:04:58.250> the

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
little bit I like the KSG because the

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.520 
little bit I like the KSG because the
KSG<00:04:58.639> is<00:04:58.789> hard<00:04:59.180> it's<00:04:59.570> really<00:04:59.900> hard<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.169> use<00:05:00.320> but

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
KSG is hard it's really hard to use but

once<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:00.740> start<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:00.979> get<00:05:01.100> good<00:05:01.400> with<00:05:01.430> it<00:05:01.699> it's

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
once you start to get good with it it's

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.939 
once you start to get good with it it's
so<00:05:02.210> satisfying<00:05:02.960> it's<00:05:03.500> one<00:05:03.680> of<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.830> most

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
so satisfying it's one of the most

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.189 
so satisfying it's one of the most
satisfying<00:05:04.130> shotguns<00:05:04.910> in<00:05:05.060> my<00:05:05.300> opinion<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:05.960> like

what<00:06:46.670> I<00:06:46.700> mean<00:06:46.940> even<00:06:47.570> though<00:06:47.660> I<00:06:47.690> like<00:06:47.900> black<00:06:48.170> ops

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380 
what I mean even though I like black ops

what I mean even though I like black ops
2<00:06:48.590> a<00:06:48.620> lot<00:06:48.860> more<00:06:49.070> in<00:06:49.160> the<00:06:49.280> long<00:06:49.490> run<00:06:49.700> but<00:06:49.850> the

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
2 a lot more in the long run but the

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.730 
2 a lot more in the long run but the
actual<00:06:50.270> presentation<00:06:50.630> and<00:06:50.990> the<00:06:51.050> way<00:06:51.080> the<00:06:51.620> game

actual presentation and the way the game

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.040 
actual presentation and the way the game
felt<00:06:52.100> felt<00:06:52.730> like<00:06:52.850> it<00:06:52.970> was<00:06:53.060> the<00:06:53.180> precursor<00:06:54.020> to

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
felt felt like it was the precursor to

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.680 
felt felt like it was the precursor to
modern<00:06:54.530> warfare<00:06:54.740> 2<00:06:55.090> it<00:06:56.090> was<00:06:56.210> kind<00:06:56.390> of<00:06:56.480> the<00:06:56.540> same

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
modern warfare 2 it was kind of the same

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.240 
modern warfare 2 it was kind of the same
thing<00:06:56.870> with<00:06:56.990> world<00:06:57.200> at<00:06:57.320> war<00:06:57.500> world<00:06:57.950> at<00:06:58.070> war

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.250 
thing with world at war world at war

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.000 
thing with world at war world at war
felt<00:06:58.520> like<00:06:58.670> it<00:06:58.820> was<00:06:58.940> the<00:06:59.060> game<00:06:59.240> before<00:06:59.980> Call<00:07:00.980> of

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.010 
felt like it was the game before Call of

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.010 
felt like it was the game before Call of
Duty<00:07:01.340> 4<00:07:01.580> and<00:07:01.850> then<00:07:01.940> but<00:07:02.120> it<00:07:02.210> came<00:07:02.330> out<00:07:02.480> after<00:07:02.810> I

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
Duty 4 and then but it came out after I

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.440 
Duty 4 and then but it came out after I
feel<00:07:03.560> like<00:07:03.770> properly<00:07:04.490> that<00:07:04.670> black<00:07:04.970> ops<00:07:05.240> 2

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450 
feel like properly that black ops 2

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.900 
feel like properly that black ops 2
feels<00:07:06.200> that<00:07:06.380> it's<00:07:06.590> ass<00:07:06.770> it<00:07:07.040> sits<00:07:07.640> comfortably

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910 
feels that it's ass it sits comfortably

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.300 
feels that it's ass it sits comfortably
as<00:07:08.450> like<00:07:08.630> the<00:07:08.810> new<00:07:09.080> Call<00:07:09.440> of<00:07:09.470> Duty<00:07:09.890> the<00:07:10.010> new

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
as like the new Call of Duty the new

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.010 
as like the new Call of Duty the new
modern<00:07:11.060> shooter<00:07:11.540> and<00:07:11.630> I<00:07:11.660> think<00:07:11.870> that's

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 
modern shooter and I think that's

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.840 
modern shooter and I think that's
because<00:07:12.230> they<00:07:12.380> finally<00:07:12.710> went<00:07:12.800> into<00:07:12.980> modern<00:07:13.670> or

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:13.850 
because they finally went into modern or

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.240 
because they finally went into modern or
future<00:07:14.540> warfare<00:07:14.840> with<00:07:15.290> this<00:07:15.470> one<00:07:15.680> it<00:07:16.220> just

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.250 
future warfare with this one it just

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.460 
future warfare with this one it just
feels<00:07:16.910> right<00:07:17.240> um<00:07:17.570> but<00:07:17.960> for<00:07:18.110> the<00:07:18.200> most<00:07:18.350> part

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470 
feels right um but for the most part

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.770 
feels right um but for the most part
it's<00:07:19.070> it's<00:07:19.430> challenging<00:07:20.030> it's<00:07:20.270> a<00:07:20.360> lot<00:07:20.480> more

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:20.780 
it's it's challenging it's a lot more

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.180 
it's it's challenging it's a lot more
difficult<00:07:21.200> than<00:07:21.230> previous<00:07:21.650> Call<00:07:21.860> of<00:07:21.890> Duty's

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:22.190 
difficult than previous Call of Duty's

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.670 
difficult than previous Call of Duty's
in<00:07:22.430> my<00:07:22.640> opinion<00:07:23.090> but<00:07:23.600> the<00:07:23.810> the<00:07:24.140> big<00:07:24.320> thing<00:07:24.350> is

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 
in my opinion but the the big thing is

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.900 
in my opinion but the the big thing is
that<00:07:24.710> why<00:07:25.040> I<00:07:25.070> think<00:07:25.310> a<00:07:25.370> lot<00:07:25.490> of<00:07:25.520> people<00:07:25.760> might

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:25.910 
that why I think a lot of people might

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.460 
that why I think a lot of people might
not<00:07:26.030> be<00:07:26.180> liking<00:07:26.510> it<00:07:26.570> at<00:07:26.690> first<00:07:26.870> everyone
