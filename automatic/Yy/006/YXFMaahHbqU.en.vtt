here's<00:05:43.990> a<00:05:44.110> clue<00:05:44.320> it's<00:05:44.560> not<00:05:44.740> going<00:05:44.889> to<00:05:44.949> be

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
here's a clue it's not going to be

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.760 
here's a clue it's not going to be
Flareon<00:05:47.610> what<00:05:48.610> else<00:05:48.789> is<00:05:48.970> left

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
Flareon what else is left

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.900 
Flareon what else is left
it's<00:05:50.770> I<00:05:51.400> put<00:05:51.729> my<00:05:51.880> are<00:05:52.210> on<00:05:52.419> our<00:05:52.690> own<00:05:53.729> two<00:05:54.729> days

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
it's I put my are on our own two days

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.779 
it's I put my are on our own two days
ago<00:05:55.530> so<00:05:56.530> hopefully<00:05:56.800> I<00:05:57.039> won't<00:05:57.220> have<00:05:57.430> to<00:05:57.550> prove

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
ago so hopefully I won't have to prove

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.719 
ago so hopefully I won't have to prove
all<00:05:57.940> time<00:05:58.150> is<00:05:58.419> if<00:05:59.020> this<00:05:59.710> also<00:05:59.919> counts<00:06:00.190> for<00:06:00.340> is

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
all time is if this also counts for is

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.360 
all time is if this also counts for is
HC<00:06:01.240> so<00:06:01.570> I<00:06:01.810> think<00:06:02.080> my<00:06:02.380> team<00:06:02.440> is<00:06:02.680> on<00:06:02.830> four<00:06:03.160> points

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
HC so I think my team is on four points

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.460
