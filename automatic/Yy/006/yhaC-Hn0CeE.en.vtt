00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.819
 the legendary Salamanca farmer alipio pérez-tabernero sanchón 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.919
 he tried him closely 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.069
 in this sound document he remembers his experiences with the colossus of cells 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.220
 for putting everything for me 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.470
 a project of the ordinary 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.090
 because I knew all the bullfighting photos 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.470
 beautifully after changing 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.550
 he had a lot of fans talking to us he's going to do everything 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.260
 I wish because when 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.580
 of the tower will make the case to mark came for the pouring of bullfighters different from the 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.070
 that would be the base the boat was pumped 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.160
 to the bullring 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.430
 and the next day we had to go to the field because I wanted to fight for the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.630
 tomorrow because I was fighting bullfighting at the fair 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.829
 I wish he was not going to die 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.940
 ocampo showed the horse has opted for the city 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.370
 the alba tower 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.970
 Slovenia bathed yesterday afternoon to fight and the next day live and for 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.620
 the night we slept in the case of the passage and then we went to the one of 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.620
 the early morning just talking about everything 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.740
 and that is that Joselito was a great man of the field 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.909
 on the back of his jaca pita bread gift of Gordon and urán spider crab in all 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.909
 the sevillanas farms of the marsh and the countryside 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.770
 in these long joselito country days that we are going to see in a 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.720
 tentadero 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.570
 encouraged and advised the ranchers of which he was the favorite bullfighter 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.029
 in search of a new type of bull more harmonious of bravery more 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.139
 prolonged 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.289
 that will adapt to the new tower modes 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.289
 that he and the mountain represented 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.959
 in this sense joselito always preferred the line farms 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.219
 muve ibarra 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.480
 that today dominates 95 percent of the bravo hut 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:46.009
 statistical data show that joselito stole 70% of his career 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:48.259
 of runs of this encaste 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:54.579
 especially of farms like vicente martínez contreras mutai civic gamero 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:55.719
 and santa coloma 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:00.869
 occupied with ibarra as you see jumeal moral rooms and garvey medina 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.779
 friend of miura and contreras also in the field joselito was the one who sent 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.889
 percent 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:17.089
 of the forest he liked 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:20.379
 I decided that the corn coaster joselito dollars face 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.859
 the Sevillian mountain pine farm 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.329
 It was the headquarters of Joselito 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.540
 actually it belonged to rafael the rooster who bought it in his years of 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.009
 splendor but it was joselito who else used his office 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.849
 majidi and control before him the feast of the sea
