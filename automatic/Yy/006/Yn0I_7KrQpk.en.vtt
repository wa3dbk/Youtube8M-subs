00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.430 

the<00:01:27.370> sign

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:02:05.520 

there<00:01:34.440> we<00:01:34.740> go

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.660 

now<00:02:06.530> I'll<00:02:06.619> show<00:02:06.679> the<00:02:06.799> inside<00:02:07.159> shot<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.490> little

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
now I'll show the inside shot a little

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:19.300 
now I'll show the inside shot a little
bit<00:02:07.820> because<00:02:08.269> this<00:02:08.450> does<00:02:08.660> have<00:02:08.810> attack

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.390 

and<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.520> think<00:02:20.580> that's<00:02:20.850> all<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.000> can<00:02:21.240> really<00:02:21.420> do

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
and I think that's all I can really do

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.820 
and I think that's all I can really do
for<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.520> because<00:02:23.850> no<00:02:24.570> I<00:02:24.600> can't<00:02:24.990> really<00:02:25.200> grab

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
for this because no I can't really grab

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.350 
for this because no I can't really grab
it<00:02:25.950> too<00:02:26.100> much<00:02:26.250> without<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.670> stink<00:02:26.970> pipes<00:02:27.150> on

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
it too much without the stink pipes on

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.730 
it too much without the stink pipes on
it<00:02:27.540> but<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.780> do<00:02:27.870> have<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.050> doors<00:02:28.230> open<00:02:28.760> so

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
it but we do have the doors open so

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.000 
it but we do have the doors open so
that's<00:02:31.740> all<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:32.160> this<00:02:32.280> video<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:33.980> hope<00:02:34.980> you
