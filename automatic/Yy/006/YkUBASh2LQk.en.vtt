00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.630
 Your the one and the people there think this is for 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.330
 you 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.340
 plus one commented game play and one video 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.710
 today is again about call of duty 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.510
 black ops two and a mapinha that people 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.720
 will be checking today should be 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.670
 sold is the map rush that there this map 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.990
 What are you guys checking out? 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.990
 It is a piece that goes nothing more 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.310
 less than in a good comb field 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.769
 exactly this map and it happens in a 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.110
 paintball field and he promised 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.059
 the small map of this dlc is a map with 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.059
 11 as a meeting map 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.379
 Quick DSNG shotgun and clear on this 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.000
 map galera always puts a lot of 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.410
 expectancy because wanting or not is 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.719
 these are the maps that make the most 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.730
 success within the multiplayer code 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.890
 or center are not always the maps 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.390
 most preferred of the galera including 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.190
 My favorites, you know too. 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.620
 that I play without much forward always 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.449
 the call forward bursting and has squib 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.350
 here in my city I do not know why but 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.879
 finally 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.620
 and so I was very anxious to 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.110
 This game needed no map 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.580
 That's right, too, and I said that in mine. 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.320
 first video everything that presses 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.299
 initials on the map that impresses me 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.430
 the initial map on that map there was no 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.250
 I was cool, I did not like him very much. 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.500
 is dene start is expensive start 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.150
 so and now play a little better 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.070
 I have played several practices in this format that 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.729
 I played more of them and if the cabbage are the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.500
 maps that fall the most is honestly I 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.570
 I do not have a super good opinion yet 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.030
 on this map I think I should think 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.860
 he it is cool is different is 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.110
 but still I was not very focused 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.290
 he has no doubt of what I like - it is 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.180
 This world tour is because the said I went 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.280
 I went straight away first of all if I 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.810
 I liked him very well first, only that I 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.790
 I can not play on it is the map that the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.320
 menu game well that there that tur and 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.610
 today, on the other hand, an appeal 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.720
 play better and have the best of 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.850
 best games could not these 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.149
 four new maps were in the rush 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.500
 In this mp inclusive is a 28/7 solve 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.060
 with superbem trade has picked up 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.890
 delivering and everything starts in a flowers 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.810
 nice and then I'll say it will not 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.180
 On my way, I'm going to make a mistake. 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.979
 I'm going to start dying a little more 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.079
 this map was able to keep me well 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.149
 cool and I do not know, I do not know if it's 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.120
 because it is a style of maps similar to 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.740
 The ones I like, I do not know, but the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.570
 truth is that I was not very 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.000
 his face at the beginning because 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.790
 I think he is as a small 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.440
 it brings many facets knows very local 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.910
 and it is basically that I 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.810
 I spoke here in the first video about the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.640
 four maps 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.530
 it's that decod style map 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.910
 they have the right-hand side or 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.460
 from the left and the middle 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.680
 it's basically just that the middle of this 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.930
 face map is very confusing it is very 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.690
 full of something very local type the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.210
 cover a lot of sudden turn if in 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.070
 a lot and grid is it's complicated to understand 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.540
 you lose yourself a little there in the middle 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.850
 of so much confusion 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.800
 So it's bad for me and I do not like it. 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.420
 to be a little girl because this to me 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.410
 It's a little inconvenient for me, it has to be 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.430
 uncomplicated 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.250
 I think that's why I did not like it 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.330
 Much of the domino w3 I remember nor a pekena 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.890
 the price will sleep 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.470
 the vast majority liked that map and I 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.880
 I liked him until too but I had 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.500
 too much of a mockery with him at first 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.150
 because I found a very 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.710
 complicated to be the best brand of 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.110
 game I think the best of the game has 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.000
 that being simple to connect one tastes good 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.470
 simple goal with few locations 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.840
 for you to stay hiding and stay 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.390
 taking cover handbeach understood that 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.950
 map and brings a lot of that initially 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.170
 since the maps and smaller than he is 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.720
 natural for what showed in the trailer 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.550
 it looked like it was going to be tiny and not him 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.950
 not great but it's also average 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.410
 age small to medium but he is 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.790
 bigger than I expected and both 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.440
 left and the right are very 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.000
 busy is the medium is also very 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.830
 Busy is the very busy map in 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.240
 all the senses but this side of the 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.800
 left a thousand now mostly 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.050
 recipe I have now my side 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.250
 end of the left yes it is quite good 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.540
 and I think maybe it's the most 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.430
 that is a part has a 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.120
 ramp without a higher part but 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.740
 suspended and it's super tight and I do not 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.570
 I have not been much with the face of this map. 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.000
 especially on that side, right? 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.770
 But anyway, it's a good idea, it's a beautiful 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.780
 I also think that in the matter of art 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.090
 astral maps design had a lot 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.970
 well on all four maps is this 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.610
 them and I even talked on the map in 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.140
 video map of the political mediator 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.180
 I found them and mastered a super 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.950
 well that map was the best those 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.080
 remastered so far was the click of the 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.820
 my opinion on the design issue is 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.100
 this map is very beautiful too 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.570
 also thematized right but not yet 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.890
 I still have something on this map. 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.140
 that they would not drink me anything 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.120
 that does not let me like him 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.790
 how you imagine 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.199
 I was going to like it right and something else 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.310
 also that I realized on this map I 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.050
 I would like to be here for you and that 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.699
 I think he's a little 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.010
 unbalanced face that side highlighted 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.330
 now it is this side there that is born from this 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.910
 side I think it has a bit of 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.550
 disadvantage in relation to the face that is born 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.110
 the other side is true depends on the point 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.970
 It is not on this side that I am 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.830
 now that I am now he is very 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.930
 open back there is an area that 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.460
 responds to the other side of the 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.990
 other side of backup memory 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.639
 This side that I just gave birth to is 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.860
 very open and it has many 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.449
 covers so you hide then the 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.949
 face that is attacking against that 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.080
 side or the guy who sees this 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.240
 That's where I read it, in my opinion, he 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.710
 has an advantage because because he 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.870
 able to pick up the backrest in a 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.610
 much better because the how is more open 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.350
 he can kill a killer if 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.389
 hide waiting to be born and 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.100
 to catch these others is also who is 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.050
 coming from there to here that side that 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.180
 I am now without this advantage because 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.830
 if you respond side here is very closed 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.729
 is small is much lower than what there 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.840
 on the other side 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.139
 so I thought this map a bit 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.729
 unbalanced in that sense, and that is 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.900
 a bad thing to the maps have to be 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.090
 balanced it was one thing I 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.800
 highlighted in the map of the link to 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.630
 calls for a very balanced 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.520
 not only on behalf of those responsible for 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.960
 account of the meetings teaches I think 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.090
 have such good meetings for you to use 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.990
 both short-range weapons and 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.820
 long range 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.570
 already this map is totally short range 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.190
 is basically mg and e in shock 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.169
 Yeah, but I still think this little one 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.060
 difference in the question of those responsible 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.770
 responds much more than the other and 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.570
 this ends up giving the team an advantage and 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.060
 disadvantages to the other in the case is not 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.220
 good but that's it this year 23 on 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.900
 Apache for you have enjoyed it if you 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.650
 liked and wants to leave your home if 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.030
 your favorite 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.650
 in the next days still a video about 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.539
 the other maps that are missing and I go 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:14.050
 staying here a hug to everyone 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:14.050
 stay with God and even be the most
