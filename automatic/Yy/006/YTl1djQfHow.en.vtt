support so yeah let's just start off
with<00:01:53.679> some<00:01:53.920> benchmarks<00:01:54.549> of<00:01:54.729> some<00:01:55.000> games<00:01:55.270> and

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599 
with some benchmarks of some games and

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.389 
with some benchmarks of some games and
tests<00:01:55.929> and<00:01:56.079> whatnot<00:01:56.229> so<00:01:56.649> right<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.099> second

sixties two one seven eighty the 780 is

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.270 
sixties two one seven eighty the 780 is
gonna<00:02:01.659> cost<00:02:01.899> a<00:02:02.140> bit<00:02:02.409> more<00:02:02.439> than<00:02:02.799> one<00:02:02.950> seven

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
gonna cost a bit more than one seven

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.949 
gonna cost a bit more than one seven
sixty<00:02:03.700> all<00:02:04.090> it's<00:02:04.270> gonna<00:02:04.390> be<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.509> bit<00:02:04.750> more

thinking okay if they're gonna be the

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.200 
thinking okay if they're gonna be the
same<00:04:08.740> obviously<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.370> seven<00:04:09.610> sixties<00:04:10.060> are

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
same obviously the seven sixties are

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.060 
same obviously the seven sixties are
better<00:04:10.390> I'm<00:04:10.930> going<00:04:11.170> over<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.380> seven<00:04:11.530> sixties

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
better I'm going over the seven sixties

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.790 
better I'm going over the seven sixties
and<00:04:12.400> that's<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.120> great<00:04:13.300> idea<00:04:13.450> in<00:04:14.020> some<00:04:14.320> aspects

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
and that's a great idea in some aspects

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.979 
and that's a great idea in some aspects
that's<00:04:15.040> definitely<00:04:15.610> what<00:04:15.760> I<00:04:15.910> want<00:04:16.270> to<00:04:16.360> do<00:04:16.510> but

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
that's definitely what I want to do but

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.539 
that's definitely what I want to do but
there's<00:04:17.170> some<00:04:17.320> drawbacks<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:18.340> first

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
there's some drawbacks the first

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.860 
there's some drawbacks the first
drawback<00:04:18.760> is<00:04:19.060> gonna<00:04:19.239> be<00:04:19.390> your<00:04:19.600> motherboard

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
drawback is gonna be your motherboard

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.930 
drawback is gonna be your motherboard
now<00:04:20.260> I'm<00:04:20.650> expecting<00:04:21.220> most<00:04:21.400> people<00:04:21.700> that<00:04:21.850> can

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
now I'm expecting most people that can

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.070 
now I'm expecting most people that can
be<00:04:22.000> upgrading<00:04:22.450> their<00:04:22.540> graphic<00:04:22.870> cards

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
be upgrading their graphic cards

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.720 
be upgrading their graphic cards
probably<00:04:23.530> built<00:04:23.740> their<00:04:23.920> own<00:04:23.950> computer<00:04:24.460> I'm

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
probably built their own computer I'm

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.460 
probably built their own computer I'm
not<00:04:25.030> sure<00:04:25.300> but<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:25.900> need<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.080> look<00:04:26.200> at<00:04:26.350> the

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
not sure but you need to look at the

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.930 
not sure but you need to look at the
motherboard<00:04:26.920> I<00:04:27.100> need<00:04:27.310> to<00:04:27.430> see<00:04:27.610> if<00:04:27.790> your

motherboard great for you you're already
a<00:04:55.030> bit<00:04:55.210> ahead<00:04:55.510> but<00:04:56.050> now<00:04:56.140> I<00:04:56.170> have<00:04:56.260> to<00:04:56.350> take<00:04:56.470> a

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
a bit ahead but now I have to take a

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.280 
a bit ahead but now I have to take a
look<00:04:56.710> at<00:04:56.920> the<00:04:57.130> power<00:04:57.400> supply<00:04:57.820> now<00:04:58.450> this<00:04:58.870> always

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
look at the power supply now this always

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.360 
look at the power supply now this always
depends<00:04:59.740> on<00:04:59.830> your<00:04:59.920> system

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
depends on your system

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.740 
depends on your system

need at minimum a 750 watt power supply
if<00:05:07.000> you<00:05:07.600> don't<00:05:07.810> your<00:05:08.200> might<00:05:08.410> have<00:05:08.500> to<00:05:08.620> upgrade

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
if you don't your might have to upgrade

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.890 
if you don't your might have to upgrade
and<00:05:09.220> with<00:05:09.520> power<00:05:09.790> mention<00:05:10.270> like<00:05:10.420> I<00:05:10.540> said<00:05:10.690> yes

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
and with power mention like I said yes

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.630 
and with power mention like I said yes
you're<00:05:11.050> gonna<00:05:11.140> need<00:05:11.410> a<00:05:11.590> decent<00:05:11.980> power<00:05:12.310> supply

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
you're gonna need a decent power supply

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.940 
you're gonna need a decent power supply
with<00:05:13.090> enough<00:05:13.510> wattage<00:05:13.780> for<00:05:14.170> two<00:05:14.470> graphic

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
cards you're also paying a higher

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.290 
cards you're also paying a higher
electricity<00:05:21.940> bill

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
electricity bill

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.850 
electricity bill
cuz<00:05:22.600> it's<00:05:22.690> gonna<00:05:22.750> cost<00:05:23.020> you<00:05:23.230> more<00:05:23.470> money<00:05:23.530> to

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
cuz it's gonna cost you more money to

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.470 
cuz it's gonna cost you more money to
run<00:05:24.010> your<00:05:24.160> computer<00:05:24.280> I'm<00:05:24.970> not<00:05:25.180> sure<00:05:25.330> if<00:05:25.450> that

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
run your computer I'm not sure if that

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.600 
run your computer I'm not sure if that
really<00:05:25.780> matters<00:05:26.260> to<00:05:26.440> you<00:05:26.560> but<00:05:26.770> just<00:05:26.830> gonna<00:05:27.430> let

really matters to you but just gonna let
you<00:05:27.700> know<00:05:27.880> also<00:05:28.510> you<00:05:28.600> might<00:05:28.720> have<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:28.960> worry

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
you know also you might have to worry

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.830 
you know also you might have to worry
about<00:05:29.260> heat<00:05:29.740> one<00:05:30.280> 760<00:05:31.180> does<00:05:31.300> pretty<00:05:31.600> well<00:05:31.690> with

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
about heat one 760 does pretty well with

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.180 
about heat one 760 does pretty well with
heat<00:05:32.110> management<00:05:32.320> at<00:05:32.770> least<00:05:32.919> in<00:05:33.070> my

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
heat management at least in my

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.760 
heat management at least in my
experiences<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.240> two<00:05:34.870> seven<00:05:35.169> six<00:05:35.350> these<00:05:35.620> are

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
experiences and two seven six these are

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.870 
experiences and two seven six these are
gonna<00:05:35.860> produce<00:05:36.100> a<00:05:36.400> bit<00:05:36.580> more<00:05:36.760> heat<00:05:37.030> I'm<00:05:37.419> not

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
gonna produce a bit more heat I'm not

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.820 
gonna produce a bit more heat I'm not
to<00:05:38.270> go<00:05:38.390> all<00:05:38.570> water-cooling<00:05:39.260> and<00:05:39.470> stuff<00:05:39.650> in

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
to go all water-cooling and stuff in

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.920 
to go all water-cooling and stuff in
your<00:05:39.950> custom<00:05:40.310> PC<00:05:40.730> but<00:05:41.330> just<00:05:41.570> keep<00:05:41.750> that<00:05:41.870> in

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
your custom PC but just keep that in

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.750 
your custom PC but just keep that in
mind<00:05:42.050> maybe<00:05:42.500> have<00:05:42.650> to<00:05:42.770> add<00:05:42.890> an<00:05:43.070> extra<00:05:43.370> fan<00:05:43.580> or

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
mind maybe have to add an extra fan or

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.350 
mind maybe have to add an extra fan or
something

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
something

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.470 
something
so<00:05:44.600> in<00:05:44.870> conclusion<00:05:45.080> our<00:05:45.680> two<00:05:46.220> 760<00:05:46.970> is<00:05:47.030> worth<00:05:47.240> it

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
so in conclusion our two 760 is worth it

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.170 
so in conclusion our two 760 is worth it
in<00:05:48.020> my<00:05:48.050> opinion<00:05:48.290> I<00:05:48.890> would<00:05:49.010> say<00:05:49.310> yes<00:05:49.490> if<00:05:49.790> you<00:05:50.090> can

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
in my opinion I would say yes if you can

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.520 
in my opinion I would say yes if you can
get<00:05:50.330> past<00:05:50.570> the<00:05:50.720> motherboard<00:05:51.230> the<00:05:51.290> power

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
get past the motherboard the power

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.320 
get past the motherboard the power
supply<00:05:51.830> in<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.190> cooling<00:05:52.580> that's<00:05:52.760> needed<00:05:53.180> I

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
supply in the cooling that's needed I

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.150 
supply in the cooling that's needed I
think<00:05:53.540> it's<00:05:53.960> a<00:05:54.080> great<00:05:54.200> way<00:05:54.410> to<00:05:54.440> go<00:05:54.710> I<00:05:54.920> think

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
think it's a great way to go I think

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.560 
think it's a great way to go I think
you'd<00:05:55.280> be<00:05:55.370> saving<00:05:55.640> some<00:05:55.940> money<00:05:55.970> in<00:05:56.270> the<00:05:56.390> long

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
you'd be saving some money in the long

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.280 
you'd be saving some money in the long
run<00:05:56.600> compared<00:05:57.590> to<00:05:57.740> a<00:05:57.770> 780<00:05:58.430> and<00:05:58.580> to<00:05:58.970> 760<00:05:59.450> s<00:05:59.870> yeah

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
run compared to a 780 and to 760 s yeah

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.720 
run compared to a 780 and to 760 s yeah
the<00:06:00.530> rough<00:06:00.710> way<00:06:00.860> around<00:06:01.100> the<00:06:01.220> same<00:06:01.400> amount<00:06:01.640> of

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
the rough way around the same amount of

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.420 
the rough way around the same amount of
money<00:06:01.910> but<00:06:02.180> even<00:06:02.870> compare<00:06:03.140> thee<00:06:03.260> to<00:06:03.290> 760<00:06:03.890> s<00:06:04.220> to

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
money but even compare thee to 760 s to

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.090 
money but even compare thee to 760 s to
a<00:06:04.460> NVIDIA<00:06:05.030> Titan<00:06:05.570> card<00:06:05.810> the<00:06:06.290> numidia<00:06:06.650> Titan

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
a NVIDIA Titan card the numidia Titan

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.940 
a NVIDIA Titan card the numidia Titan
was<00:06:07.480> $1000<00:06:08.480> when<00:06:08.600> it<00:06:08.720> came<00:06:08.870> out<00:06:08.930> not<00:06:09.590> sure<00:06:09.830> what

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
was $1000 when it came out not sure what

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.440 
was $1000 when it came out not sure what
it<00:06:10.040> is<00:06:10.070> right<00:06:10.340> now<00:06:10.580> but<00:06:10.790> it's<00:06:10.940> probably<00:06:11.210> still

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
it is right now but it's probably still

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.320 
it is right now but it's probably still
a<00:06:11.690> decent<00:06:11.990> out<00:06:12.260> of<00:06:12.410> money<00:06:12.560> and<00:06:12.770> need<00:06:13.250> to<00:06:13.520> 760<00:06:14.270> s

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
a decent out of money and need to 760 s

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.540 
a decent out of money and need to 760 s
will<00:06:14.810> actually<00:06:15.350> outperform<00:06:15.980> that<00:06:16.010> I<00:06:16.340> know<00:06:16.400> we

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
will actually outperform that I know we

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.220 
will actually outperform that I know we
didn't<00:06:16.730> talk<00:06:16.880> about<00:06:17.060> it<00:06:17.300> in<00:06:17.390> this<00:06:17.480> video<00:06:17.630> but

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
didn't talk about it in this video but

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.100 
didn't talk about it in this video but
it<00:06:18.380> actually<00:06:18.950> does<00:06:19.190> outperform<00:06:19.910> the<00:06:20.360> Titan<00:06:20.930> in

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
it actually does outperform the Titan in

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.860 
it actually does outperform the Titan in
some<00:06:21.470> aspects<00:06:22.010> and<00:06:22.250> that's<00:06:22.520> just<00:06:22.910> insane<00:06:23.330> so

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
some aspects and that's just insane so

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.180 
some aspects and that's just insane so
