00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.879
 hello everyone welcome to my video 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:11.680
 tutorial on how to use a usb modem 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:15.240
 in our gossiped tablet there 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.240
 good first of all 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.820
 introduce in our usb modem in 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.039
 our card with our rate of 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.519
 data in my case pepephone 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.100
 and connect it to the usb or tg cable that came 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.200
 with the tablet 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.400
 a very important step before connecting 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:39.630
 the usb cable connected to the usb modem in 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.370
 the tablet is to turn off the wifi 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.010
 from our tablet as we can see the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.540
 wifi is disabled good by 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.450
 we proceed to connect 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.450
 the usb or tg cable to our tablet 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.720
 and we wait for the tablet to recognize the 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.930
 modem usb the modem to start 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.360
 blink and we will skip a warning in the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.850
 tablet 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.430
 telling us that the ppp application 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.960
 widgets need to connect with the 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.960
 device we tell you to accept 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.910
 automatically our application 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.960
 superuser will give us privileges to 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.430
 able to connect the modem if it does not 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.700
 we have granted those permits will tell us 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.070
 that if we want to provide only in that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.330
 If we say yes good once 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.800
 already detected already changes the flicker of 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.560
 our model looks a bluish color 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.430
 and therefore already recognizes it 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.369
 the good tablet before we previously have 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.000
 configured the pp parameters in 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.470
 widget 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.080
 what were these 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.400
 can also be configured after 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.970
 having plugged in the usb modem to 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.820
 the tablet 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.880
 and once our certain 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.860
 data from internet distributor that 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.860
 we have click on connect 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.610
 we see how the application starts 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.890
 saying that he is calling tries 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.290
 connect with the usb modem 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.440
 we can see how a 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.860
 connection because we have our usb modem 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.470
 it has lit a read a colored LED 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.830
 green permanently and has been 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.980
 assigned a user right through 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.530
 of the application of the super using good 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.980
 as we can see in the widget it says 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:51.550
 that we are connected and here we can 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.130
 see that we are connected to a wifi 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.250
 and whose name belongs to the same name 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.530
 of the ppp wilder application 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.520
 this generates a bridge between the 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.950
 USB and modem wifi 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.989
 of the tablet 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.670
 good to check the operation 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.819
 simply because we are already 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.859
 connected we open our browser 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.120
 and press the page by google 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.930
 example 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.400
 and we can see how it opens up in 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.549
 this case is a bit slow because now 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.510
 same I am located in an area of 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.510
 where it does not get very good coverage 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.430
 but generally 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.480
 in almost all places a good coverage 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.970
 the same to the best that no longer the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.100
 coverage g if we took a coverage 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.270
 h it would automatically look very fast 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.270
 we wait a little 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.060
 to see what it is and with this one 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.329
 As we can see, the logo of the 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.259
 google name although it takes a 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.259
 little to load 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.460
 but good an excellent performance 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.620
 let's help the tested born or in 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.380
 other places and it's always fast 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.320
 as we can see it is already loading the 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.300
 page a bit slow as I indicated 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.450
 I hope it is in a place where 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:55.040
 coverage is not not very good 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:57.240
 good and with this I finish my tutorial in 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.620
 nothing me from scratch 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:04.860
 your participation and comments to 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.069
 from this video a greeting and even 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.069
 soon
