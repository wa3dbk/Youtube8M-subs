 one more time to the channel and good 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.279
 two notices the first thing is to listen to the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.420
 background noise the neighbor who is 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.850
 moving furniture I do not know why 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.010
 and the second today will bring the guide today 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.020
 of the lion as you had asked me in 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.870
 comments from other guides but 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.770
 It turns out that I've gotten into it 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:48.010
 launched I have started playing started 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.870
 open the game and puts me in line 20 thousand in 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.040
 ranked 20K is not like always 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.750
 you put it 8 hours and I say 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.240
 let's see if I have something around here to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.060
 do sheet and the only thing I have is the 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.680
 quick light guide I know I had it 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.650
 made long and that also has three 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.410
 thousand 203 thousand five hundred visits that a 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.600
 I'm very proud of that day 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.580
 he was the first director of the channel but 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.820
 good so feeling it a lot in the 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.720
 soul is not for me it's not my fault 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.610
 the sun is not going I can not go in and do it 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.290
 copy the others so I'm sorry 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.500
 many drawings you have to put up with 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.500
 fact 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.670
 well let's go there we go with the guide 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.230
 of light we are going to start the first of 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.850
 swims with longsword three portions of 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.760
 lives and the yellow trinquet and we're going to 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.580
 bloodroot us first for 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.990
 have those ships with that main damage 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.420
 initial scenario of the game that 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.250
 it always comes too let's continue 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.260
 with the third boots be as you are 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.670
 do all the cars and 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.590
 let's go with it bacteriophages to 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.460
 open it as quickly as possible to the trinity 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.560
 that you know how you see is to unite that yes or yes 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.230
 you have it or you're not a carrick 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.180
 that by the way after the ugly nerd the 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.040
 it hits a lot a lot a lot really takes off 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.960
 very much not so much but still sticking 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.260
 a lot we are going to do to us next 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.190
 the last words to increase is the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.210
 year and use the passive that has 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.360
 thus reducing the armor of the 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.360
 enemies 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.700
 today we are going to make ourselves like 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.290
 you see here a tecer job if you want 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.510
 It's worth it because I've already done what comes to 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.210
 from here it is to choice 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.190
 you can become an employer and 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:44.560
 then I uploaded the black blade 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.810
 ok or you can make a sheet of the king 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.760
 of ruin that you want me to 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.980
 I think with the blade of the reign 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.980
 You have a logo worth the extra 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.600
 also tell you if for example not 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.430
 you want the reign sheet I do 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.160
 missing a little more tank or something 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.770
 because it's super fedea or are doing 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.510
 a huge course and other the deck of the 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.520
 voice comes in handy because there are 700 of 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.430
 life 30 of damage and that passive of not 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.810
 it escapes them or took for granted in the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.040
 what guards necessary yes or yes always 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.470
 in a scholarship 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.450
 I hope you have entered because I think that 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.450
 I had already made it from the beginning 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.060
 well, if you have not heard, it does not happen 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.480
 nothing you put the comments and 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.480
 I answer 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.160
 we go with the moon very well for now 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.099
 let's go with the theft of life 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.380
 although we know that shortly but 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.250
 good 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.920
 quintÃ¡s 2 of life robbery and one of damage 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.660
 red all of damage and one of 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.860
 critical probability as you know 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.930
 whenever you go with a champion that 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.210
 hit a lot of basic ones a 1 of 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.670
 probability of yellow critic of 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.860
 armor and blue magic resistance 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.069
 now the mastery we will use a 21 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.880
 90 use always maximizing what 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.100
 the damage and critical d 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.050
 of this is a champion since to hit 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.950
 too much too much 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.520
 good what opposite 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.870
 the tips that I can give you already know 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.030
 you throw a skill of the two basic 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.700
 have skill in the basics and come back 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.130
 to have skill and you do not have all the 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.900
 skill right away because there is a 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.830
 basically go to lose damage basically 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.750
 the e removes all loss of movement 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.490
 whenever they are in light for example in the 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.010
 top you play a lot against the ones since 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.630
 nothing replaces strips you see forgiveness 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.000
 read the double vee of what you're welcome to 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.720
 about what you already understand me to balear but 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.710
 also times and plays 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.780
 and if you have your e that is canceled 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.010
 loss of movement, what remains 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.780
 is the animation and demand that they are 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.990
 surrounded by bugs and others but go 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.420
 a normal movement 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.370
 the w also the vision how much 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.460
 exploits vale you can use them in 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.890
 pieces in facer you enter with the w veis 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.680
 what there is and then it goes in and to the set or the 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.150
 it is also crosses walls and finally not 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.460
 be afraid to use the last one to 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.880
 pulsear since basically latifah and not 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.740
 it serves much 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.240
