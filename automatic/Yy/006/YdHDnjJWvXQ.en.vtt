global<00:02:13.540> warming<00:02:13.660> science<00:02:14.310> if<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.459> keeps

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
global warming science if it keeps

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.039 
global warming science if it keeps
treating<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.090> Northwest<00:02:16.510> like<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.900> did<00:02:17.019> last

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
treating the Northwest like it did last

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.550 
treating the Northwest like it did last
year<00:02:17.440> then<00:02:17.709> bring<00:02:18.549> it<00:02:18.670> on<00:02:19.049> I<00:02:20.049> don't<00:02:20.410> know<00:02:20.500> I

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
year then bring it on I don't know I

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.750 
year then bring it on I don't know I
think<00:02:20.830> it's<00:02:20.980> probably<00:02:21.190> just<00:02:21.430> bringing

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
think it's probably just bringing

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.370 
think it's probably just bringing
crazier<00:02:22.180> whether<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.720> different<00:02:23.049> regions<00:02:23.140> of

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
crazier whether to different regions of

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.590 
crazier whether to different regions of
the<00:02:23.440> world<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.860> guess<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.970> know<00:02:25.060> if<00:02:25.299> the<00:02:25.450> crazy

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
the world I guess you know if the crazy

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.289
