00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.730 
support in another area then what we'll
do<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.820> we'll<00:01:50.939> scan<00:01:51.149> your<00:01:51.329> foot<00:01:51.509> again<00:01:51.780> compare

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
do is we'll scan your foot again compare

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.219 
do is we'll scan your foot again compare
it<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.950> your<00:01:53.070> original<00:01:53.399> gates<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:55.200> can

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
it to your original gates can and we can

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.139 
it to your original gates can and we can
see<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.740> changes<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.460> occurred<00:01:56.579> in

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
see the changes that have occurred in

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.569 
see the changes that have occurred in
the<00:01:57.930> past<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.860> probably<00:01:59.159> would<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.430> had

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the past we probably would have had

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.340 
the past we probably would have had
somebody<00:01:59.820> come<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:00.899> would<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.140> said

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
somebody come in and we would have said

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.139 
somebody come in and we would have said
okay<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.009> time<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.280> renew<00:02:02.430> your<00:02:02.700> orthotic

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
okay it's time to renew your orthotic

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.370 
okay it's time to renew your orthotic
let's<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.479> go<00:02:03.600> ahead<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.810> order<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> new

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
let's just go ahead and order you a new

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.319 
let's just go ahead and order you a new
one<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> new<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.670> what<00:02:06.180> we're

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
one we get a new one in what we're

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.210 
one we get a new one in what we're
seeing<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.719> these<00:02:06.930> orthotics<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.950> we<00:02:08.069> do

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
seeing is these orthotics that we do

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.309 
seeing is these orthotics that we do
from<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.520> computer<00:02:08.819> scan<00:02:09.209> are<00:02:09.390> not<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:10.110> simply

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
from a computer scan are not just simply

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.140 
from a computer scan are not just simply
support<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> feet<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.610> for<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
support for the feet and for the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.399 
support for the feet and for the
rest<00:02:12.269> of<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.450> body<00:02:12.629> they're<00:02:13.110> actually

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
rest of the body they're actually

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:14.720 
rest of the body they're actually
retraining<00:02:13.950> tools<00:02:14.159> it's<00:02:14.430> kind<00:02:14.549> of<00:02:14.640> like

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
retraining tools it's kind of like

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.429 
retraining tools it's kind of like
having<00:02:14.939> a<00:02:15.150> yeah<00:02:15.390> it's<00:02:15.900> kind<00:02:16.019> of<00:02:16.049> like<00:02:16.140> having<00:02:16.290> a

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
having a yeah it's kind of like having a

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.649 
having a yeah it's kind of like having a
training<00:02:16.799> wheel<00:02:16.950> where<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:18.030> won't<00:02:18.209> let<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.450> go

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
training wheel where it won't let you go

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.140 
training wheel where it won't let you go
too<00:02:18.720> far<00:02:19.049> this<00:02:19.230> way<00:02:19.290> or<00:02:19.650> too<00:02:19.829> far<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.280> way<00:02:20.340> but

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
too far this way or too far this way but

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.460 
too far this way or too far this way but
it<00:02:21.269> keeps<00:02:21.599> you<00:02:21.780> going<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.230> right

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
it keeps you going in the right

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.229 
it keeps you going in the right
direction<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.310> when<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:23.640> foot<00:02:23.939> hits<00:02:24.150> the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
direction and when that foot hits the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.850 
direction and when that foot hits the
ground<00:02:24.329> if<00:02:24.659> this<00:02:24.810> were<00:02:24.959> your<00:02:25.079> big<00:02:25.290> toe<00:02:25.530> and

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
ground if this were your big toe and

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.589 
ground if this were your big toe and
this<00:02:25.980> where<00:02:26.159> the<00:02:26.250> heel<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:27.000> foot<00:02:27.299> should<00:02:27.329> hit

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
this where the heel that foot should hit

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.229 
this where the heel that foot should hit
the<00:02:27.629> ground<00:02:27.870> out<00:02:28.140> here<00:02:28.560> come<00:02:29.069> across<00:02:29.519> and<00:02:29.909> come

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
the ground out here come across and come

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.420 
the ground out here come across and come
right<00:02:30.510> off<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:30.900> big<00:02:31.140> toe<00:02:31.409> okay<00:02:32.069> so<00:02:32.129> that's

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
right off that big toe okay so that's

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.429 
right off that big toe okay so that's
the<00:02:32.609> motion<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.480> should<00:02:33.720> occur<00:02:33.989> right<00:02:34.200> there

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
the motion that should occur right there

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:35.630 
the motion that should occur right there
we're<00:02:34.680> seeing<00:02:34.829> a<00:02:34.890> lot<00:02:35.069> of<00:02:35.099> people<00:02:35.280> strike

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
we're seeing a lot of people strike

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.220 
we're seeing a lot of people strike
right<00:02:35.879> in<00:02:36.000> their<00:02:36.090> heel<00:02:36.359> and<00:02:36.569> come<00:02:37.019> right<00:02:37.170> to

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
right in their heel and come right to

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.410 
right in their heel and come right to
their<00:02:37.470> four<00:02:37.680> foot<00:02:37.950> but<00:02:38.400> never<00:02:38.730> actually<00:02:38.970> go

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
their four foot but never actually go

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.809 
their four foot but never actually go
from<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.750> outside<00:02:40.290> all<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.650> way<00:02:41.159> across<00:02:41.280> to

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
from the outside all the way across to

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.160 
from the outside all the way across to
the<00:02:41.939> inside<00:02:42.299> this<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.540> part<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.780> your<00:02:42.840> shock

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
the inside this is part of your shock

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.440 
the inside this is part of your shock
absorption<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:44.010> propulsion<00:02:44.879> type<00:02:45.269> mechanism

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
absorption and propulsion type mechanism

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.780 
absorption and propulsion type mechanism
but<00:02:46.409> what<00:02:46.560> we're<00:02:46.739> finding<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.250> when<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.549> have

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
but what we're finding is when you have

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.869 
but what we're finding is when you have
the<00:02:48.030> right<00:02:48.209> shoe<00:02:48.989> on<00:02:49.349> somebody's<00:02:49.920> feet<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.459> the

checked<00:03:07.829> out<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.340> was<00:03:09.209> shocked<00:03:09.450> at<00:03:09.569> my<00:03:09.659> most

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
checked out I was shocked at my most

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.690 
checked out I was shocked at my most
recent<00:03:10.079> scan<00:03:10.590> I'll<00:03:10.739> probably<00:03:10.920> show<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.370> guys

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
recent scan I'll probably show you guys

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.170 
recent scan I'll probably show you guys
kind<00:03:12.239> of<00:03:12.389> a<00:03:12.510> before-and-after<00:03:13.849> so<00:03:14.849> that<00:03:15.030> you

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
kind of a before-and-after so that you

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.300 
kind of a before-and-after so that you
can<00:03:15.329> see<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.599> progression<00:03:15.949> it's<00:03:16.949> one<00:03:17.129> of<00:03:17.250> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
can see the progression it's one of the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.430 
can see the progression it's one of the
best<00:03:17.459> scans<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:17.940> we've<00:03:18.120> seen<00:03:18.449> yet<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.959> fact<00:03:19.199> I

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
best scans that we've seen yet in fact I

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.020 
best scans that we've seen yet in fact I
think<00:03:19.889> I've<00:03:20.220> actually<00:03:20.370> gotten<00:03:20.669> to<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.879> point

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
think I've actually gotten to a point

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.729 
think I've actually gotten to a point
where<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.299> work<00:03:21.510> myself<00:03:21.750> out<00:03:22.109> of<00:03:22.230> our<00:03:22.379> my

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
where of work myself out of our my

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.009 
where of work myself out of our my
orthotics<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.329> ultimate<00:03:24.510> goal

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
orthotics so that is the ultimate goal

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.140 
orthotics so that is the ultimate goal
is<00:03:25.139> not<00:03:25.379> to<00:03:25.590> have<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.799> in<00:03:26.099> orthotics<00:03:26.879> for<00:03:26.940> the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
is not to have you in orthotics for the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.119 
is not to have you in orthotics for the
rest<00:03:27.329> of<00:03:27.449> your<00:03:27.540> life<00:03:27.780> but<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.709> let<00:03:28.829> your<00:03:29.040> body

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
rest of your life but to let your body

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.939 
rest of your life but to let your body
adapt<00:03:29.699> little<00:03:30.540> by<00:03:30.810> little<00:03:30.840> by<00:03:31.440> little<00:03:31.470> and

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
adapt little by little by little and

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.039 
adapt little by little by little and
eventually<00:03:32.909> wean<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.419> off<00:03:33.449> of<00:03:33.659> those

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
eventually wean you off of those

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.129 
eventually wean you off of those
orthotics<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:35.190> come<00:03:35.549> on<00:03:35.699> in<00:03:35.959> get<00:03:36.959> your

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
orthotics so come on in get your

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.979 
orthotics so come on in get your
orthotics<00:03:37.560> checked<00:03:37.919> get<00:03:38.819> your<00:03:38.879> feet<00:03:39.239> scanned

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
orthotics checked get your feet scanned

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.930 
orthotics checked get your feet scanned
again<00:03:40.139> you<00:03:40.799> know<00:03:40.919> let's<00:03:41.159> take<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.400> look<00:03:41.669> and

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
again you know let's take a look and

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.670 
again you know let's take a look and
compare<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.359> based<00:03:42.810> on<00:03:42.989> your<00:03:43.109> other<00:03:43.260> skin

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
compare it based on your other skin

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.009 
compare it based on your other skin
let's<00:03:44.519> also<00:03:44.760> get<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.239> in<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.419> right<00:03:45.569> shoes

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
let's also get you in the right shoes

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.170 
let's also get you in the right shoes
and<00:03:46.440> then<00:03:47.010> let's<00:03:47.220> also<00:03:47.370> start<00:03:47.729> talking<00:03:48.030> about

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
and then let's also start talking about

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.390 
and then let's also start talking about
some<00:03:48.449> appropriate<00:03:49.109> exercises<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:50.069> you<00:03:50.129> need

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
some appropriate exercises that you need

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.580 
some appropriate exercises that you need
to<00:03:50.489> start<00:03:50.699> doing<00:03:50.849> to<00:03:51.449> be<00:03:51.569> able<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.930> wean

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
to start doing to be able to wean

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.740 
to start doing to be able to wean
yourself<00:03:52.769> off<00:03:53.129> of<00:03:53.489> orthotics<00:03:53.970> eventually

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
yourself off of orthotics eventually

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.719 
yourself off of orthotics eventually
it'd<00:03:54.930> be<00:03:55.349> nice<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.620> be<00:03:55.919> able<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.190> just<00:03:56.340> have<00:03:56.609> you

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:56.729 
it'd be nice to be able to just have you

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.149 
it'd be nice to be able to just have you
in<00:03:56.970> shoes<00:03:57.479> that<00:03:58.409> are<00:03:58.530> right<00:03:58.680> for<00:03:58.709> your<00:03:58.919> body

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
in shoes that are right for your body

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.619 
in shoes that are right for your body
and<00:03:59.430> not<00:03:59.579> have<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.909> worry<00:03:59.940> about<00:04:00.329> the

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
and not have to worry about the

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.809 
and not have to worry about the
orthotics<00:04:01.139> I<00:04:01.319> finally<00:04:01.919> arrived<00:04:02.370> there<00:04:02.609> but

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
orthotics I finally arrived there but

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.640 
orthotics I finally arrived there but
it's<00:04:02.970> taking<00:04:03.329> me<00:04:03.419> about<00:04:03.659> you<00:04:03.989> know<00:04:04.109> five<00:04:04.349> years

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
it's taking me about you know five years

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.920 
it's taking me about you know five years
to<00:04:04.799> get<00:04:04.919> to<00:04:05.069> that<00:04:05.159> point<00:04:05.459> of<00:04:05.790> training<00:04:06.599> up<00:04:06.780> to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
to get to that point of training up to

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.180 
to get to that point of training up to
that<00:04:07.049> point<00:04:07.109> I<00:04:07.379> think<00:04:07.560> if<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.739> had<00:04:07.859> done<00:04:07.979> some

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
that point I think if I had done some

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.460 
that point I think if I had done some
exercises<00:04:08.909> in<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.180> meantime<00:04:09.389> I<00:04:09.810> just<00:04:10.260> sped

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
exercises in the meantime I just sped

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.280 
exercises in the meantime I just sped
that<00:04:10.650> process<00:04:11.159> up<00:04:11.569> but<00:04:12.569> we<00:04:12.840> want<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.079> make<00:04:13.139> sure

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
that process up but we want to make sure

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.960 
that process up but we want to make sure
the<00:04:13.620> direction<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:14.159> right<00:04:14.370> shoes<00:04:14.639> right

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
the direction the right shoes right

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.750 
the direction the right shoes right
orthotics<00:04:15.569> doing<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.959> right<00:04:16.260> exercises<00:04:16.949> so

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
orthotics doing the right exercises so

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.339 
orthotics doing the right exercises so
we<00:04:17.880> can<00:04:18.030> eventually<00:04:18.510> get<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:19.169> out<00:04:19.320> of

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
we can eventually get you out of

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.080 
we can eventually get you out of
orthotics<00:04:20.010> orthotics<00:04:20.579> shouldn't<00:04:21.000> be<00:04:21.060> a

lifelong deal should actually just

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.990 
lifelong deal should actually just
something<00:04:23.140> its<00:04:23.260> temporary<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:24.340> help<00:04:24.640> you<00:04:24.820> get

that we were learning here we're
learning<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.510> shoes<00:04:34.900> need<00:04:35.530> to<00:04:35.620> be<00:04:35.740> replaced

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
your mileage probably based it every two

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.890 
your mileage probably based it every two
to<00:04:47.950> three<00:04:48.100> months<00:04:48.310> so<00:04:48.760> once<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.090> quarter<00:04:49.330> we

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
to three months so once a quarter we

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.390 
to three months so once a quarter we
should<00:04:50.110> have<00:04:50.260> new<00:04:50.440> shoes<00:04:50.470> probably<00:04:51.190> four

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
should have new shoes probably four

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.890 
should have new shoes probably four
times<00:04:51.550> here<00:04:51.940> what<00:04:52.180> do<00:04:52.240> you<00:04:52.330> do<00:04:52.450> with<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.690> shoes

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
times here what do you do with the shoes

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.720 
times here what do you do with the shoes
that<00:04:52.930> actually<00:04:53.410> still<00:04:53.890> look<00:04:54.070> good<00:04:54.220> and<00:04:54.460> still

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
that actually still look good and still

its it takes 24 to 48 hours for the

squishiness the gas is inside the actual
shoe<00:05:20.110> material<00:05:20.590> here<00:05:20.800> I'll<00:05:20.890> show<00:05:20.919> you<00:05:21.100> mine<00:05:21.870> so

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
shoe material here I'll show you mine so

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.990 
shoe material here I'll show you mine so
this<00:05:23.080> this<00:05:23.500> white<00:05:23.740> material<00:05:24.010> right<00:05:24.310> here<00:05:24.340> it

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
this this white material right here it

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.900 
this this white material right here it
actually<00:05:25.390> takes<00:05:25.990> 48<00:05:26.380> hours<00:05:26.919> for<00:05:27.460> this<00:05:27.550> white

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
actually takes 48 hours for this white

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.420 
actually takes 48 hours for this white
material<00:05:28.360> to<00:05:28.630> reabsorb<00:05:29.050> their<00:05:29.560> gases<00:05:30.040> this

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
material to reabsorb their gases this

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.980 
material to reabsorb their gases this
actually<00:05:30.669> this<00:05:30.910> one<00:05:31.120> has<00:05:31.270> gel<00:05:31.570> on<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:31.810> back

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
actually this one has gel on the back

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.440 
actually this one has gel on the back
right<00:05:32.200> here<00:05:32.410> so<00:05:32.620> it<00:05:32.680> doesn't<00:05:32.950> have<00:05:33.100> that<00:05:33.450> gas

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
right here so it doesn't have that gas

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.659 
right here so it doesn't have that gas
absorption<00:05:34.930> factor<00:05:35.350> back<00:05:35.710> here<00:05:36.070> but<00:05:36.460> if<00:05:36.550> this

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
absorption factor back here but if this

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.760 
absorption factor back here but if this
VM<00:05:37.210> white<00:05:37.450> material<00:05:37.750> that<00:05:37.990> goes<00:05:38.080> all<00:05:38.290> the<00:05:38.350> way

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
VM white material that goes all the way

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.290 
VM white material that goes all the way
to<00:05:38.830> the<00:05:39.040> back<00:05:39.190> right<00:05:39.430> there<00:05:39.610> it's<00:05:40.090> going<00:05:40.270> to

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
to the back right there it's going to

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.270 
to the back right there it's going to
take<00:05:40.510> 48<00:05:40.870> hours<00:05:41.290> for<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:41.560> gases<00:05:41.890> to<00:05:42.010> fully

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
take 48 hours for the gases to fully

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.520 
take 48 hours for the gases to fully
resort<00:05:42.790> so<00:05:43.030> if<00:05:43.210> you<00:05:43.540> don't<00:05:43.720> actually<00:05:43.870> let<00:05:44.350> your
