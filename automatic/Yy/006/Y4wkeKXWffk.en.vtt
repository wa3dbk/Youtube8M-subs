natural notes there's no sharps or flats

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.910 
natural notes there's no sharps or flats
that<00:00:45.310> means<00:00:45.490> you're<00:00:45.610> in<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.760> key<00:00:45.880> of<00:00:45.910> C<00:00:46.920> so

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
that means you're in the key of C so

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.880 
that means you're in the key of C so
when<00:00:48.160> you<00:00:48.250> see<00:00:48.370> an<00:00:48.430> F<00:00:48.550> major<00:00:48.700> sharp<00:00:49.060> 11<00:00:49.890> you're

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
when you see an F major sharp 11 you're

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.110 
when you see an F major sharp 11 you're
probably<00:00:51.070> going<00:00:51.280> to<00:00:51.340> thank<00:00:51.550> key<00:00:51.790> of<00:00:51.910> C<00:00:52.090> major

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
probably going to thank key of C major

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.710 
probably going to thank key of C major
because<00:00:52.630> the<00:00:52.960> court<00:00:53.850> has<00:00:54.850> that<00:00:55.120> sharp<00:00:55.390> 11

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
because the court has that sharp 11

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.510 
because the court has that sharp 11
which<00:00:55.810> is<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.050> B<00:00:56.230> note<00:00:56.470> so<00:00:57.070> hopefully<00:00:57.370> don't

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
which is the B note so hopefully don't

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.670 
which is the B note so hopefully don't
get<00:00:57.640> too<00:00:57.760> confused<00:00:58.180> with<00:00:58.270> that<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:59.530> only

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
get too confused with that the only

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.320 
get too confused with that the only
thing<00:00:59.800> I<00:00:59.950> changed<00:01:00.280> in<00:01:00.400> one<00:01:00.520> board<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:00.970> next

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
thing I changed in one board to the next

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.580 
thing I changed in one board to the next
is<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:01.720> F<00:01:01.870> sharp<00:01:02.080> go<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.380> em<00:01:03.900> so<00:01:04.900> we're<00:01:05.500> going

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
is the F sharp go to em so we're going

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.780 
is the F sharp go to em so we're going
to<00:01:05.680> play<00:01:05.800> in<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.950> key<00:01:06.070> G<00:01:06.250> major<00:01:06.460> then<00:01:06.670> we're

ideas keep in mind you're just going

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.800 
ideas keep in mind you're just going
from<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.870> f-sharp<00:03:55.990> to<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.530> F<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:57.810> just

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
from the f-sharp to the F and just

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.690 
from the f-sharp to the F and just
practice<00:03:59.200> moving<00:03:59.800> between<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.310> two<00:04:00.460> shape

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
practice moving between the two shape

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.970 
practice moving between the two shape
they'll<00:04:00.910> start<00:04:01.180> with<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:01.630> one<00:04:02.380> shape<00:04:02.620> key<00:04:02.860> of

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
they'll start with the one shape key of

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.640 
they'll start with the one shape key of
G<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.910> closest<00:04:04.270> shaped<00:04:04.480> key<00:04:04.690> of<00:04:04.810> C<00:04:04.990> move

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
G and the closest shaped key of C move

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.380 
G and the closest shaped key of C move
up<00:04:05.770> to<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:05.920> next<00:04:06.010> shape<00:04:06.400> in<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.730> key<00:04:06.880> of<00:04:06.910> G<00:04:07.180> and

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
up to the next shape in the key of G and

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.300 
up to the next shape in the key of G and
then<00:04:08.020> and<00:04:08.230> then<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:08.440> next<00:04:08.560> closer<00:04:08.890> shape<00:04:09.190> in

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
then and then the next closer shape in

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.370 
then and then the next closer shape in
the<00:04:09.400> key<00:04:09.520> of<00:04:09.550> C<00:04:09.670> and<00:04:10.060> do<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:10.870> for<00:04:11.050> each<00:04:11.080> of<00:04:11.320> the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
the key of C and do that for each of the

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.320 
the key of C and do that for each of the
five<00:04:11.560> positions<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.310> you'll<00:04:12.880> get<00:04:13.000> good<00:04:13.180> at

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
five positions and you'll get good at

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.850 
five positions and you'll get good at
shifting<00:04:13.690> between<00:04:14.400> 11<00:04:15.400> key<00:04:15.640> in<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.850> next<00:04:16.180> and

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
shifting between 11 key in the next and

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.420 
shifting between 11 key in the next and
give<00:04:17.860> that<00:04:17.980> a<00:04:18.010> try<00:04:18.100> let<00:04:19.090> me<00:04:19.150> know<00:04:19.270> how<00:04:19.300> it<00:04:19.390> goes
