just<00:01:41.310> run<00:01:41.789> it<00:01:41.910> through<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.149> loop<00:01:42.360> there<00:01:43.520> just

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
just run it through the loop there just

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:53.380 
just run it through the loop there just
tie<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.759> off

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:21.080 

and<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.720> that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.030 

another<00:02:22.090> good<00:02:22.390> stable<00:02:22.900> position<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.800> step

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
another good stable position is to step

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.640 
another good stable position is to step
on<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.340> string<00:02:26.490> place<00:02:27.490> your<00:02:27.520> knee<00:02:27.880> on<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.650> this

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
on the string place your knee on it this

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.930 
on the string place your knee on it this
allows<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.840> nice<00:02:31.840> camera<00:02:32.260> stabilization
