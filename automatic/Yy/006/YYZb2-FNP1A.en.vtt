onto the nitty-gritty of the shoes I
bought<00:01:11.970> these<00:01:12.420> because<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.350> needed<00:01:13.770> something

that<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:14.970> still<00:01:15.810> different<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:17.369> could

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
that was still different but could

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.719 
that was still different but could
withstand<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.020> Australian<00:01:19.680> heat<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.159> guess<00:01:20.460> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
withstand the Australian heat I guess I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.960 
withstand the Australian heat I guess I
mainly<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.540> boots<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.400> boots<00:01:23.400> are<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.729> my

thing<00:01:24.299> but<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.170> decided<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.950> was

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
thing but I just decided that it was

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.310 
thing but I just decided that it was
just<00:01:26.430> way<00:01:26.640> too<00:01:26.700> hot<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.360> moment<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:28.140> wear

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
just way too hot at the moment to wear

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.700 
just way too hot at the moment to wear
boots

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
boots

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.100

hellraisers<00:01:36.869> are<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.500> they're<00:01:38.040> just

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
hellraisers are just they're just

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.270 
hellraisers are just they're just
getting<00:01:38.430> broken<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.479> busted<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.740> can't

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
getting broken and busted up so I can't

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.460 
getting broken and busted up so I can't
really<00:01:41.460> wear<00:01:41.729> them<00:01:41.970> many<00:01:42.180> places<00:01:42.479> anymore<00:01:43.079> so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
really wear them many places anymore so

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.030 
really wear them many places anymore so
that's<00:01:43.710> why<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.920> decided<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.970> these<00:01:45.860> being<00:01:46.860> that

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
that's why I decided on these being that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.249 
that's why I decided on these being that
they<00:01:47.189> are<00:01:47.220> simplistic<00:01:48.060> yet<00:01:48.509> they<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.229> be

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
they are simplistic yet they can be

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.590 
they are simplistic yet they can be
dressed<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.040> dressed<00:01:50.520> down<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
dressed up and dressed down I like the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.319 
dressed up and dressed down I like the
versatility<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.470> them<00:01:52.890> not<00:01:53.729> only<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
versatility of them not only just the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.719 
versatility of them not only just the
style<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.350> color<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:55.860> well<00:01:55.890> there's<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
style but the color as well there's the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.330 
style but the color as well there's the
simple<00:01:57.030> black<00:01:57.869> leather<00:01:58.170> look<00:01:58.500> not<00:01:59.130> real

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
simple black leather look not real

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.520 
simple black leather look not real
leather<00:01:59.579> again<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.180> don't<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.780> demonio<00:02:01.320> make

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
leather again I don't think demonio make

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.500 
leather again I don't think demonio make
real<00:02:01.770> leather<00:02:02.040> shoes

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
real leather shoes

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.780 
real leather shoes
these<00:02:02.810> are<00:02:03.110> extremely<00:02:03.800> comfortable<00:02:04.280> shoes

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
these are extremely comfortable shoes

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.150 
these are extremely comfortable shoes
you<00:02:05.060> can<00:02:05.480> stand<00:02:05.780> in<00:02:05.930> these<00:02:06.110> four<00:02:06.350> vast<00:02:06.680> amounts

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
you can stand in these four vast amounts

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.190 
you can stand in these four vast amounts
of<00:02:07.250> time<00:02:07.460> without<00:02:07.820> even<00:02:08.300> noticing<00:02:08.690> that

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
of time without even noticing that

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.900 
of time without even noticing that
you're<00:02:09.380> technically<00:02:10.010> wearing<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.610> heel<00:02:10.880> I

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
you're technically wearing a heel I

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.900 
you're technically wearing a heel I
guess<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:12.020> think<00:02:12.470> that's<00:02:12.650> because<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.670> fact

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
guess I think that's because of the fact

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.300 
guess I think that's because of the fact
that<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.180> platform<00:02:14.780> nearly<00:02:15.500> actually<00:02:15.920> meets

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
that the platform nearly actually meets

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.940 
that the platform nearly actually meets
the<00:02:16.460> heel<00:02:17.030> level<00:02:17.510> which<00:02:17.990> is<00:02:18.200> what<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.440> like<00:02:18.740> in

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
the heel level which is what I like in

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.040 
the heel level which is what I like in
shoes<00:02:19.190> because<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.760> like<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.210> cheat<00:02:20.540> with<00:02:20.840> my

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
shoes because I like to cheat with my

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.440 
shoes because I like to cheat with my
height<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.500> don't<00:02:21.800> like<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.250> wear<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.640> really

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
height I don't like to wear the really

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.290 
height I don't like to wear the really
high<00:02:23.750> angles<00:02:24.380> but<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:25.070> do<00:02:25.190> like<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.850> look<00:02:26.000> of<00:02:26.150> it

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
high angles but I do like the look of it

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.230 
high angles but I do like the look of it
the<00:02:26.450> only<00:02:26.690> thing<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.830> I'm<00:02:28.310> finding<00:02:29.060> is

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
the only thing that I'm finding is

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.450 
the only thing that I'm finding is
uncomfortable<00:02:29.840> about<00:02:30.200> these<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:31.220> think

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
uncomfortable about these and I think

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.420 
uncomfortable about these and I think
this<00:02:31.580> ties<00:02:31.820> in<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.240> sizing<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.920> fact<00:02:34.220> that

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
this ties in to sizing is the fact that

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.990 
this ties in to sizing is the fact that
my<00:02:34.910> heel<00:02:35.330> is<00:02:36.040> excessively<00:02:37.040> rubbing<00:02:37.550> right

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
my heel is excessively rubbing right

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.070 
my heel is excessively rubbing right
here

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
here

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.080

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
every time my shoe lifts up it lifts up

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.300 
every time my shoe lifts up it lifts up
out<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.630> shoe<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.110> then<00:02:42.230> back<00:02:42.470> in<00:02:42.680> out<00:02:43.040> of

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
out of the shoe and then back in out of

out of the shoe and then back in out of
the<00:02:43.340> shoe<00:02:43.550> back<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:44.090> I've<00:02:44.660> put<00:02:44.990> heel<00:02:45.910> pads<00:02:46.910> in

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.270 
are at least a half size bigger on me I
don't<00:03:28.550> know<00:03:28.940> why<00:03:29.150> also<00:03:29.510> these<00:03:29.959> are<00:03:30.019> much<00:03:30.830> wider

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
don't know why also these are much wider

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.610 
don't know why also these are much wider
than<00:03:31.760> all<00:03:32.239> my<00:03:32.360> other<00:03:32.390> demands<00:03:33.080> and<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.410> think

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
than all my other demands and I think

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.229 
than all my other demands and I think
that's<00:03:33.769> a<00:03:33.860> good<00:03:34.010> thing<00:03:34.310> because<00:03:34.550> it's<00:03:35.030> much

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
that's a good thing because it's much

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.360 
that's a good thing because it's much
harder<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.630> stretch<00:03:36.050> out<00:03:36.260> sandals<00:03:36.739> I've<00:03:37.010> found

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
harder to stretch out sandals I've found

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.150 
harder to stretch out sandals I've found
then<00:03:38.200> boots<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:39.440> stuff<00:03:39.590> like<00:03:39.769> that<00:03:39.980> now<00:03:40.130> I

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
then boots and stuff like that now I

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.940 
then boots and stuff like that now I
have<00:03:40.310> narrow<00:03:40.730> feet<00:03:41.120> so<00:03:41.570> shoes<00:03:42.140> generally<00:03:42.769> fit

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
have narrow feet so shoes generally fit

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.759 
have narrow feet so shoes generally fit
me<00:03:43.100> slightly<00:03:43.670> baggy<00:03:44.320> if<00:03:45.320> they<00:03:45.500> are<00:03:45.560> normal

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
me slightly baggy if they are normal

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.890 
me slightly baggy if they are normal
width<00:03:46.100> but<00:03:46.670> these<00:03:46.850> ones<00:03:47.030> fit<00:03:47.300> me<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.450> little<00:03:47.720> bit

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
width but these ones fit me a little bit

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.900 
width but these ones fit me a little bit
bigger<00:03:48.140> than<00:03:48.350> normal<00:03:48.560> so<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.190> think<00:03:49.519> that

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
bigger than normal so I think that

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.390 
bigger than normal so I think that
people<00:03:50.540> with<00:03:50.780> wide<00:03:51.050> feet<00:03:51.320> will<00:03:51.650> experience<00:03:52.280> a

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
people with wide feet will experience a

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.479 
people with wide feet will experience a
bit<00:03:52.670> more<00:03:52.850> comfort<00:03:53.330> with<00:03:53.870> in<00:03:54.050> these<00:03:54.230> shoes<00:03:54.560> so

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
bit more comfort with in these shoes so

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.610 
bit more comfort with in these shoes so
overall<00:03:56.090> with<00:03:56.390> sizing<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:56.989> would<00:03:57.140> say<00:03:57.350> probably

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
overall with sizing I would say probably

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.979 
overall with sizing I would say probably
stick<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.160> your<00:03:58.340> true<00:03:58.550> sizing<00:03:59.090> because<00:03:59.780> it's

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
stick to your true sizing because it's

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.199 
stick to your true sizing because it's
only<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.440> half<00:04:00.709> size<00:04:00.980> difference<00:04:01.550> unless<00:04:02.030> you

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
only a half size difference unless you

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.760 
only a half size difference unless you
are<00:04:02.360> in<00:04:02.540> between<00:04:02.690> sizes<00:04:02.930> and

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
are in between sizes and

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.470 
are in between sizes and
probably<00:04:05.370> ordered<00:04:05.730> down<00:04:05.880> with<00:04:06.090> these<00:04:06.210> ones

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
probably ordered down with these ones

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.480 
probably ordered down with these ones
because<00:04:06.630> they<00:04:06.870> are<00:04:06.980> substantially<00:04:07.980> bigger<00:04:08.160> if

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
because they are substantially bigger if

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.670 
because they are substantially bigger if
you've<00:04:08.730> got<00:04:08.970> normal<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.690> narrow<00:04:10.140> feet<00:04:10.410> if

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
you've got normal to narrow feet if

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.290 
you've got normal to narrow feet if
you've<00:04:10.860> got<00:04:11.040> way<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.310> feet<00:04:11.580> I<00:04:11.760> would<00:04:11.880> say

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
you've got way to feet I would say

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.150 
you've got way to feet I would say
probably<00:04:12.540> stick<00:04:13.080> with<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.350> on<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.620> size<00:04:13.860> so

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
probably stick with you on the size so

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.680 
probably stick with you on the size so
you<00:04:14.250> can<00:04:14.430> get<00:04:14.580> a<00:04:14.610> feel<00:04:14.820> for<00:04:14.850> these<00:04:15.180> shoes<00:04:15.480> and

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
you can get a feel for these shoes and

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.300 
you can get a feel for these shoes and
what<00:04:15.900> they<00:04:16.019> look<00:04:16.200> like<00:04:16.230> on<00:04:16.590> real<00:04:16.920> legs

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
what they look like on real legs

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.740 
what they look like on real legs
I'll<00:04:17.370> cut<00:04:17.640> away<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:18.000> clip<00:04:18.269> of<00:04:18.360> me<00:04:18.540> wearing

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
I'll cut away to a clip of me wearing

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:42.650 
I'll cut away to a clip of me wearing
them<00:04:18.989> right<00:04:19.230> now

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.090 

overall<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.900> am<00:04:43.930> completely<00:04:44.800> in<00:04:44.950> love<00:04:44.980> with

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
overall I am completely in love with

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.370 
overall I am completely in love with
these<00:04:45.370> shoes<00:04:45.550> I<00:04:45.760> love<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.270> fact<00:04:46.510> that<00:04:46.750> these

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
these shoes I love the fact that these

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.140 
these shoes I love the fact that these
are<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.650> bit<00:04:47.830> more<00:04:47.860> summer<00:04:48.280> appropriate<00:04:48.970> than

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
are a bit more summer appropriate than

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.150 
are a bit more summer appropriate than
most<00:04:49.540> of<00:04:49.750> my<00:04:49.810> other<00:04:49.930> shoes<00:04:50.260> so<00:04:50.830> I<00:04:50.860> think

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
most of my other shoes so I think

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.740 
most of my other shoes so I think
that'll<00:04:51.550> get<00:04:51.670> a<00:04:51.730> lot<00:04:52.030> of<00:04:52.150> wear<00:04:52.300> out<00:04:52.330> of<00:04:52.600> these

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
that'll get a lot of wear out of these

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.020 
that'll get a lot of wear out of these
because<00:04:53.140> also<00:04:53.680> I<00:04:53.950> can<00:04:54.460> just<00:04:54.640> wear<00:04:54.790> stockings

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
because also I can just wear stockings

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.090 
because also I can just wear stockings
with<00:04:55.420> them<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:55.870> winter<00:04:56.200> I<00:04:56.380> also<00:04:56.530> love<00:04:56.950> the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
with them and winter I also love the

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.530 
with them and winter I also love the
fact<00:04:57.250> that<00:04:57.400> these<00:04:57.550> can<00:04:57.790> be<00:04:57.880> dressed<00:04:58.150> up<00:04:58.300> and

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
fact that these can be dressed up and

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.040 
fact that these can be dressed up and
dressed<00:04:58.840> down

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
dressed down

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.960 
dressed down
I<00:04:59.230> love<00:04:59.440> versatility<00:05:00.010> and<00:05:00.400> clothing<00:05:00.670> and

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
I love versatility and clothing and

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.120 
I love versatility and clothing and
shoes<00:05:01.210> if<00:05:01.480> you<00:05:01.780> are<00:05:01.840> thinking<00:05:02.380> about<00:05:02.560> getting

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
shoes if you are thinking about getting

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.070

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
these I personally would highly

recommend<00:05:05.530> them

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
recommend them

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.170 
recommend them
I<00:05:05.860> don't<00:05:06.100> think<00:05:06.310> that<00:05:06.430> they're<00:05:06.550> ridiculously

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
I don't think that they're ridiculously

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.450 
I don't think that they're ridiculously
priced<00:05:07.510> I<00:05:07.870> think<00:05:08.560> that<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:09.040> could<00:05:09.280> probably

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
priced I think that you could probably

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.670 
priced I think that you could probably
get<00:05:09.850> a<00:05:09.970> lot<00:05:10.270> of<00:05:10.390> wear<00:05:10.540> out<00:05:10.570> of<00:05:10.750> these<00:05:10.990> also<00:05:11.350> the

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
get a lot of wear out of these also the

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.130 
get a lot of wear out of these also the
fact<00:05:11.950> that<00:05:12.070> you<00:05:12.910> can<00:05:13.120> probably<00:05:13.540> get<00:05:13.900> away<00:05:13.930> with

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
fact that you can probably get away with

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.780 
fact that you can probably get away with
these<00:05:14.440> in<00:05:14.650> a<00:05:14.770> workplace<00:05:15.220> setting<00:05:15.490> that
