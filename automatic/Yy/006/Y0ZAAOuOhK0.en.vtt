any<00:01:56.250> color<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:57.330> deal<00:01:57.510> 200<00:01:58.050> damage<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.530> target

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
any color to deal 200 damage to target

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.100 
any color to deal 200 damage to target
opponent<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.580> then<00:01:59.760> you<00:01:59.940> gain<00:02:00.210> 200<00:02:00.450> life<00:02:00.870> so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
opponent and then you gain 200 life so

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.740 
opponent and then you gain 200 life so
it's<00:02:01.230> a<00:02:01.320> quick<00:02:01.560> 42<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.640> 400-point<00:02:03.360> swing

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
it's a quick 42 just a 400-point swing

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.560 
it's a quick 42 just a 400-point swing
in<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.620> sense<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.880> can<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.030> kind<00:02:06.300> of<00:02:06.330> keep

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
in a sense so you can just kind of keep

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.600 
in a sense so you can just kind of keep
burning<00:02:06.840> your<00:02:07.050> point<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.620> and<00:02:08.310> then<00:02:08.399> when

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
burning your point to that and then when

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.510 
burning your point to that and then when
she<00:02:08.760> does<00:02:08.940> flip<00:02:09.180> if<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.420> need<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.810> um<00:02:10.520> destroy

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
she does flip if you need to um destroy

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.220 
she does flip if you need to um destroy
target<00:02:11.880> resonator<00:02:12.270> with<00:02:12.480> total<00:02:12.810> cost<00:02:13.020> of

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
target resonator with total cost of

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.020 
target resonator with total cost of
three<00:02:13.500> or<00:02:13.620> less<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.220> then<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.580> gain<00:02:14.790> Life

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
three or less and then you gain Life

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.960 
three or less and then you gain Life
equal<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.480> its<00:02:15.600> defense<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.310> then<00:02:17.310> for<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.640> cost

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
equal to its defense and then for a cost

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.960 
equal to its defense and then for a cost
of<00:02:18.270> three<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.550> managing<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.610> darkness

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
of three and managing a darkness

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.000 
of three and managing a darkness
resonator<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.990> can<00:02:22.140> give<00:02:22.290> her<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.470> perishable

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
resonator you can give her a perishable

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.560 
resonator you can give her a perishable
to<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.400> end<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.670> turn<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.270> have<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.450> way

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
to the end of the turn so you have a way

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.960 
to the end of the turn so you have a way
to<00:02:24.630> kind<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.870> flip<00:02:25.050> her<00:02:25.200> back<00:02:25.410> over<00:02:25.770> in<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.700> sense

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
to kind of flip her back over in a sense

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.199 
to kind of flip her back over in a sense
so<00:02:27.600> primarily<00:02:28.560> use<00:02:29.010> Abdul<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:29.730> with<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.030> tech

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
so primarily use Abdul but with the tech

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.300 
so primarily use Abdul but with the tech
is<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.540> then<00:02:30.740> deck<00:02:31.740> you're<00:02:31.890> fighting<00:02:32.130> against

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
is and then deck you're fighting against

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.980 
is and then deck you're fighting against
then<00:02:32.490> doesn't<00:02:32.820> use<00:02:32.940> enterocytes<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.810> just

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
then doesn't use enterocytes you just

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.660 
then doesn't use enterocytes you just
switch<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.200> vlad<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.950> kind<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.310> control<00:02:35.640> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
switch to vlad and kind of control the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.390 
switch to vlad and kind of control the
game<00:02:35.850> from<00:02:36.030> there<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.500> I'm<00:02:37.650> assuming<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:38.220> a

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
game from there so I'm assuming that a

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.699 
game from there so I'm assuming that a
little<00:02:38.700> bit<00:02:38.790> going<00:02:39.630> into<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.080> stone<00:02:40.320> lineup

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
little bit going into the stone lineup

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.340 
little bit going into the stone lineup
because<00:02:41.580> we<00:02:41.940> have<00:02:42.120> Abdul<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.959> course<00:02:42.990> use

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
because we have Abdul we of course use

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.430 
because we have Abdul we of course use
grew<00:02:43.590> less<00:02:43.860> stuff<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:45.780> little<00:02:46.080> red<00:02:46.290> the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
grew less stuff and a little red the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.680 
grew less stuff and a little red the
pier<00:02:46.650> stone<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.220> then<00:02:47.520> just<00:02:47.820> eight<00:02:48.060> basic

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
pier stone and then just eight basic

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.560 
pier stone and then just eight basic
darkness<00:02:49.620> stones<00:02:49.890> because<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.209> just<00:02:51.450> a

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
darkness stones because it is just a

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.900 
darkness stones because it is just a
mono<00:02:51.780> dark<00:02:52.140> deck<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:53.310> doesn't<00:02:53.580> worry<00:02:53.790> about

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
mono dark deck it doesn't worry about

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.640 
mono dark deck it doesn't worry about
anything<00:02:54.000> else<00:02:54.420> doesn't<00:02:55.320> really<00:02:55.380> need

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
anything else doesn't really need

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.930 
anything else doesn't really need
anything<00:02:55.950> else<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:56.250> it's<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> pretty<00:02:56.519> standard

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
anything else so it's a pretty standard

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.400 
anything else so it's a pretty standard
package

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
going into the resonator lineup we run

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.830 
going into the resonator lineup we run
for<00:03:03.490> rescue<00:03:03.970> t'en<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.830> can<00:03:06.780> kind<00:03:07.780> of

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
for rescue t'en so that you can kind of

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.320 
for rescue t'en so that you can kind of
keep<00:03:08.080> recurring<00:03:08.530> them<00:03:08.890> for<00:03:09.250> incarnate<00:03:09.880> and

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
keep recurring them for incarnate and

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.240 
keep recurring them for incarnate and
