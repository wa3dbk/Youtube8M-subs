differently<00:00:16.250> we're<00:00:17.250> going<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.430> start<00:00:17.670> off

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
differently we're going to start off

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.040 
differently we're going to start off
with<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.150> clean<00:00:18.600> foot<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.650> no<00:00:20.250> lotions<00:00:20.760> and

with a clean foot and no lotions and

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.390 
with a clean foot and no lotions and
we're<00:00:22.050> going<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.260> start<00:00:22.529> making<00:00:22.680> little<00:00:23.160> tiny

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
we're going to start making little tiny

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.820 
we're going to start making little tiny
circles<00:00:23.910> all<00:00:24.090> across<00:00:24.510> our<00:00:24.779> ankle<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.680> is

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
bracelet your circles don't have to be

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.080 
bracelet your circles don't have to be
the<00:00:31.470> same<00:00:31.679> size<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.460> doesn't<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.940> be

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the same size it doesn't have to be

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.770 
the same size it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:00:33.630> um<00:00:34.850> what<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.880> like<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.630> just

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
perfect um what I like to do is just

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.990 
perfect um what I like to do is just
keep<00:00:37.050> switching<00:00:37.320> my<00:00:37.680> position<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.550> my<00:00:38.700> foot

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
keep switching my position of my foot

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.459 
keep switching my position of my foot
just<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.390> make<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.540> easier<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.079> draw<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
just to make it easier to draw the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.729 
just to make it easier to draw the
circles<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.840> just<00:00:42.840> go<00:00:43.140> ahead<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.559> keep

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
circles on and just go ahead and keep

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.670 
circles on and just go ahead and keep
drawing<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.700> then<00:00:45.450> join<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.140> at<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.530> end

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.500

look<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.720> by<00:00:52.110> now<00:00:52.440> now<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.190> lost<00:00:53.490> the<00:00:53.700> footage

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
look like by now now I lost the footage

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.030 
look like by now now I lost the footage
of<00:00:54.300> how<00:00:54.450> to<00:00:54.510> do<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.900> loop<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.470> basically<00:00:55.860> you

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
of how to do the loop but basically you

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.590 
of how to do the loop but basically you
just<00:00:56.220> do<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> loop<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.940> three<00:00:57.180> dots<00:00:57.330> at<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
just do a loop with three dots at the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.030 
just do a loop with three dots at the
ends

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
ends

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.130 
ends
each<00:00:59.220> bigger<00:00:59.550> than<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.880> last<00:01:00.060> now<00:01:00.750> starting

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
each bigger than the last now starting

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.540 
each bigger than the last now starting
with<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.410> feather<00:01:01.620> I'm<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.130> going<00:01:02.310> to<00:01:02.370> make

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
with the feather I'm just going to make

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.170 
with the feather I'm just going to make
a<00:01:02.580> u-shape<00:01:03.450> and<00:01:04.190> then<00:01:05.190> I'm<00:01:05.520> just<00:01:05.730> going<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> do

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
a u-shape and then I'm just going to do

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.600 
a u-shape and then I'm just going to do
some<00:01:06.420> squiggly<00:01:07.050> lines<00:01:07.350> I'm<00:01:07.890> basically<00:01:08.460> just

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
some squiggly lines I'm basically just

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.420 
some squiggly lines I'm basically just
free-handing<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.040> then<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:11.310> just

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
free-handing this and then I'm just

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.520 
free-handing this and then I'm just
going<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> make<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.910> loop<00:01:12.300> at<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.840> end<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
going to make a loop at the end and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.720 
going to make a loop at the end and
that's<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.310> tip<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
that's going to be the tip of the

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.840 
that's going to be the tip of the
feather<00:01:15.860> before<00:01:16.860> finishing<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.580> feather

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
feather before finishing this feather

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.370 
feather before finishing this feather
I'm<00:01:18.120> going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.540> start<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> next<00:01:19.140> one

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
I'm going to start on the next one

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.660 
I'm going to start on the next one
because<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.800> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.980> be<00:01:20.130> overlapping

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
because it's going to be overlapping

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.850 
because it's going to be overlapping
this<00:01:21.060> one<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.510> this<00:01:22.050> one<00:01:22.110> also<00:01:22.410> I'm<00:01:22.619> just

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
this one and this one also I'm just

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.020 
this one and this one also I'm just
going<00:01:23.010> to<00:01:23.040> make<00:01:23.190> some<00:01:23.250> u<00:01:23.640> shapes

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
going to make some u shapes

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.320 
going to make some u shapes
and<00:01:26.229> some<00:01:27.229> squiggly<00:01:27.530> lines<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.280> then<00:01:28.700> loop

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
and some squiggly lines and then loop

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.310 
and some squiggly lines and then loop
the<00:01:29.630> tip<00:01:33.040> just<00:01:34.040> like<00:01:34.159> that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
the tip just like that

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.870 
the tip just like that
I'm<00:01:36.320> going<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.560> go<00:01:36.680> ahead<00:01:36.799> and<00:01:37.280> finish<00:01:37.549> my

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880

first feather just same thing making the

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.060 
first feather just same thing making the
u-shape<00:01:40.790> some<00:01:41.240> squiggly<00:01:41.690> lines<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.440> looping

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
u-shape some squiggly lines and looping

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.999 
u-shape some squiggly lines and looping
the<00:01:43.520> tip<00:01:43.759> and<00:01:44.320> then<00:01:45.320> I'm<00:01:45.500> going<00:01:45.680> to<00:01:45.710> do<00:01:45.860> the

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
center which is just basically two lines

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.010 
center which is just basically two lines
down<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.430> middle<00:01:52.600> we're<00:01:53.600> going<00:01:53.720> to<00:01:53.780> do<00:01:53.930> the
