00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
battlefield 4 is really suffered in that

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.990 
battlefield 4 is really suffered in that
area<00:05:08.810> a<00:05:08.990> team<00:05:09.680> deathmatch<00:05:10.130> i<00:05:10.310> can't<00:05:10.580> even<00:05:10.700> play

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.700 
area a team deathmatch i can't even play
on<00:05:11.060> battlefield<00:05:11.540> 4<00:05:11.780> it's<00:05:11.900> not<00:05:12.140> nearly<00:05:12.410> as<00:05:12.560> it

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
on battlefield 4 it's not nearly as it

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.100 
on battlefield 4 it's not nearly as it
good<00:05:12.860> as<00:05:12.950> it<00:05:13.040> wasn't<00:05:13.190> battlefield<00:05:13.669> 3<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.180> I

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
good as it wasn't battlefield 3 and I

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.930 
good as it wasn't battlefield 3 and I
feel<00:05:15.380> like<00:05:15.410> a<00:05:15.560> lot<00:05:15.800> of<00:05:15.860> maps<00:05:16.130> really<00:05:16.550> do<00:05:16.669> cater

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
feel like a lot of maps really do cater

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.550 
feel like a lot of maps really do cater
to<00:05:17.210> longer<00:05:17.570> range<00:05:17.780> engagements<00:05:17.930> so<00:05:18.320> I<00:05:18.350> would

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
to longer range engagements so I would

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.520 
to longer range engagements so I would
like<00:05:18.680> to<00:05:18.710> see<00:05:18.980> some<00:05:19.220> some<00:05:19.880> cqb<00:05:20.600> stuff<00:05:20.990> come<00:05:21.320> to

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
like to see some some cqb stuff come to

enough<00:05:27.710> we've<00:05:27.860> heard<00:05:28.040> very<00:05:28.310> little<00:05:28.400> about

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
enough we've heard very little about

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.310 
enough we've heard very little about
lately<00:05:29.240> me<00:05:29.510> and<00:05:29.690> I<00:05:29.750> supposed<00:05:30.020> to<00:05:30.080> come<00:05:30.229> out

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
next month no information of all about

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.629 
next month no information of all about
that<00:05:32.930> I'm<00:05:33.110> a<00:05:33.139> little<00:05:33.350> worried<00:05:33.500> on<00:05:33.680> that<00:05:33.860> but

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
that I'm a little worried on that but

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.210 
that I'm a little worried on that but
again<00:05:35.290> graphics<00:05:36.290> is<00:05:36.380> aren't<00:05:36.680> everything<00:05:36.979> but

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
again graphics is aren't everything but

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.370 
again graphics is aren't everything but
I<00:05:37.460> just<00:05:37.910> I<00:05:38.090> feel<00:05:38.419> like<00:05:38.660> that<00:05:38.900> that's<00:05:39.110> my

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
I just I feel like that that's my

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.050 
I just I feel like that that's my
biggest<00:05:39.650> criticism<00:05:40.430> right<00:05:40.610> now<00:05:40.760> in<00:05:40.850> this<00:05:40.940> game

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
biggest criticism right now in this game

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.030 
biggest criticism right now in this game
played<00:05:41.419> just<00:05:41.630> it<00:05:41.900> looks<00:05:42.200> like<00:05:42.470> it's<00:05:42.680> a<00:05:42.770> step

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
played just it looks like it's a step

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.890 
played just it looks like it's a step
backwards<00:05:43.430> to<00:05:43.669> me<00:05:43.820> for<00:05:44.030> some<00:05:44.180> reason<00:05:44.240> it<00:05:44.660> looks

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
backwards to me for some reason it looks

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.170 
backwards to me for some reason it looks
like<00:05:45.140> a<00:05:45.169> counter-strike<00:05:45.890> of<00:05:46.190> type<00:05:47.030> of

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
like a counter-strike of type of

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.150 
like a counter-strike of type of
graphics<00:05:47.600> thing<00:05:47.840> like<00:05:48.590> particularly<00:05:49.070> with

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
graphics thing like particularly with

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.730 
graphics thing like particularly with
the<00:05:49.190> weapon<00:05:49.630> design<00:05:50.630> of<00:05:50.870> how<00:05:51.289> the<00:05:51.350> weapons

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
the weapon design of how the weapons

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.529 
the weapon design of how the weapons
look<00:05:51.890> now<00:05:52.039> they<00:05:52.160> sound<00:05:52.430> good<00:05:52.669> i'll<00:05:53.330> give<00:05:53.510> it

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
look now they sound good i'll give it

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.560 
look now they sound good i'll give it
credit<00:05:53.840> for<00:05:53.870> that<00:05:54.080> but<00:05:54.760> an<00:05:55.760> iron<00:05:56.060> sights<00:05:56.419> oh

these<00:05:58.580> on<00:05:58.880> this<00:05:59.000> game<00:05:59.320> but<00:06:00.320> all<00:06:00.470> in<00:06:00.560> all<00:06:00.650> these

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
these on this game but all in all these

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.700 
these on this game but all in all these
maps<00:06:01.330> interesting<00:06:02.330> layouts<00:06:02.840> on<00:06:03.140> them<00:06:03.289> they

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
maps interesting layouts on them they

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.080 
maps interesting layouts on them they
look<00:06:03.860> about<00:06:04.010> the<00:06:04.280> right<00:06:04.490> size<00:06:04.760> although<00:06:05.000> I

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
look about the right size although I

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.760 
look about the right size although I
think<00:06:05.270> they<00:06:05.539> still<00:06:05.810> seem<00:06:06.020> a<00:06:06.080> little<00:06:06.200> bit<00:06:06.289> big<00:06:06.560> I

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
think they still seem a little bit big I

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.800 
think they still seem a little bit big I
have<00:06:07.340> noticed<00:06:07.729> very<00:06:07.789> little<00:06:08.330> destruction

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
have noticed very little destruction

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.110 
have noticed very little destruction
there<00:06:09.590> are<00:06:09.710> some<00:06:09.890> token<00:06:10.310> l'évolution<00:06:10.850> events

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
there are some token l'évolution events

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.520 
there are some token l'évolution events
like<00:06:11.270> that<00:06:11.300> crane<00:06:11.690> comin<00:06:11.960> down<00:06:12.050> that<00:06:12.200> you<00:06:12.320> saw

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
like that crane comin down that you saw

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.150 
like that crane comin down that you saw
a<00:06:12.770> knife<00:06:13.100> traversing<00:06:14.090> through<00:06:14.919> but<00:06:15.919> although

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
a knife traversing through but although

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.029 
a knife traversing through but although
I<00:06:16.340> just<00:06:16.460> feel<00:06:16.729> like<00:06:16.970> it's<00:06:17.479> not<00:06:17.840> what<00:06:18.350> I'm<00:06:18.979> used
