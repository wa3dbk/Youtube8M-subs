00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.280 
track like the BSC would be about half a
second<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:59.030> it's<00:02:59.209> best<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.540> stick<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.079> and

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
second so it's best to stick to that and

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.319 
second so it's best to stick to that and
let<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.010> gearbox<00:03:01.430> do<00:03:01.609> the<00:03:01.730> work<00:03:01.909> well<00:03:02.120> you

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
let the gearbox do the work well you

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.809 
let the gearbox do the work well you
just<00:03:02.569> focus<00:03:03.019> on<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:03.980> track<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.400> on<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.609> lines

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
just focus on the track and on the lines

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.610 
just focus on the track and on the lines
that<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.150> need<00:03:05.299> to<00:03:05.420> pick<00:03:07.780> after<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:09.349> first

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
that you need to pick after the first

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.920 
that you need to pick after the first
stint<00:03:09.889> I<00:03:10.069> went<00:03:10.459> back<00:03:10.700> into<00:03:10.909> the<00:03:11.060> pits<00:03:11.299> to<00:03:11.750> get

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
stint I went back into the pits to get

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.080 
stint I went back into the pits to get
an<00:03:12.049> insider's<00:03:12.799> view<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.549> laps<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.030> I

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
an insider's view of the laps that I

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.059 
an insider's view of the laps that I
have<00:03:14.269> put<00:03:14.480> in<00:03:14.599> using<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.560> data<00:03:15.590> logger

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
have put in using the data logger

exactly what you have done out on track

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.220 
exactly what you have done out on track
I'll<00:03:22.639> pull<00:03:22.849> up<00:03:22.879> all<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.269> channels<00:03:23.750> that<00:03:23.959> a

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
one half pulled up is great brake

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.140 
one half pulled up is great brake

the<00:03:42.460> machines<00:03:43.200> third<00:03:44.200> gear<00:03:44.430> okay<00:03:45.460> you<00:03:45.880> are

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
the machines third gear okay you are

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.510 
the machines third gear okay you are
into<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.780> corner<00:03:47.110> into<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.470> corner<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:48.040> then

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
into the corner into the corner and then

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.760 
into the corner into the corner and then
again<00:03:48.820> you<00:03:48.940> started<00:03:49.270> turning<00:03:49.510> there<00:03:50.500> again

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
again you started turning there again

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.530 
again you started turning there again
back<00:03:50.980> on<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.250> throttle<00:03:51.610> throttle<00:03:51.880> increasing

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
back on the throttle throttle increasing

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.840 
back on the throttle throttle increasing
throttle<00:03:52.870> increasing<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:53.830> this<00:03:54.520> point

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
throttle increasing so this point

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.370 
throttle increasing so this point
basically<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.510> where<00:03:55.720> if<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:55.930> look<00:03:56.080> at<00:03:56.230> this

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
basically is where if you look at this

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.380 
basically is where if you look at this
the<00:03:56.770> RPMs<00:03:57.160> have<00:03:57.310> gone<00:03:57.520> to<00:03:57.640> three<00:03:57.790> seven<00:03:58.180> where

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
the RPMs have gone to three seven where

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.520 
the RPMs have gone to three seven where
this<00:03:58.630> goes

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
this goes

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.120 
this goes
so<00:03:59.680> that's<00:03:59.860> a<00:03:59.950> 300<00:04:00.610> revs<00:04:00.850> okay<00:04:01.810> 300<00:04:02.440> else<00:04:02.860> and

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
so that's a 300 revs okay 300 else and

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.980 
so that's a 300 revs okay 300 else and
if<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:03.460> look<00:04:03.580> at<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.790> speed<00:04:04.120> are<00:04:04.510> almost<00:04:04.840> the

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
if you look at the speed are almost the

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.590 
if you look at the speed are almost the
same<00:04:05.020> but<00:04:05.440> if<00:04:06.100> you<00:04:06.220> proceed<00:04:06.730> further<00:04:07.090> on<00:04:07.330> see

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
same but if you proceed further on see

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.750 
same but if you proceed further on see
see<00:04:07.810> that<00:04:07.960> there's<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:08.740> five<00:04:09.190> kilometer<00:04:09.400> per

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
see that there's a five kilometer per

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.730 
see that there's a five kilometer per
hour<00:04:09.940> difference<00:04:12.450> so<00:04:13.450> you<00:04:13.510> brake<00:04:13.960> you<00:04:14.320> hold<00:04:14.590> it

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
hour difference so you brake you hold it

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.650 
hour difference so you brake you hold it
you<00:04:15.040> leave<00:04:15.190> it<00:04:15.220> off<00:04:15.460> so<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.209> is<00:04:16.360> the<00:04:16.480> time

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
you leave it off so that is the time

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.410 
you leave it off so that is the time
okay<00:04:17.500> we<00:04:17.920> shot<00:04:18.190> at<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.370> time<00:04:18.609> that<00:04:19.120> will<00:04:19.270> tell

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
okay we shot at the time that will tell

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.120 
okay we shot at the time that will tell
you<00:04:19.570> how<00:04:19.810> long<00:04:20.739> is<00:04:20.890> your<00:04:21.010> braking<00:04:21.340> now<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:23.830> knew

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
you how long is your braking now I knew

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.070 
you how long is your braking now I knew
some<00:04:24.400> areas<00:04:24.760> that<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:25.090> needed<00:04:25.360> to<00:04:25.540> improve<00:04:25.840> on

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
some areas that I needed to improve on

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.440 
some areas that I needed to improve on
and<00:04:26.260> so<00:04:26.800> I<00:04:26.830> headed<00:04:27.190> out<00:04:27.490> on<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:27.880> fast<00:04:28.150> and

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
and so I headed out on the fast and

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.330 
and so I headed out on the fast and
flowing<00:04:28.600> good<00:04:28.960> circuit<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.860> put<00:04:30.040> it<00:04:30.130> all

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
flowing good circuit to put it all

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.580 
flowing good circuit to put it all
together

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.080 

this<00:04:33.590> time<00:04:33.800> I<00:04:33.980> was<00:04:34.190> more<00:04:34.430> at<00:04:34.640> ease<00:04:34.760> with<00:04:34.970> the

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
this time I was more at ease with the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.420 
this time I was more at ease with the
car<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:35.540> able<00:04:36.050> to<00:04:36.080> get<00:04:36.290> more<00:04:36.650> out<00:04:36.950> of<00:04:37.010> it<00:04:37.250> as

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
car and able to get more out of it as

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.240 
car and able to get more out of it as
well

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.400 

nicely<00:04:42.250> first<00:04:42.490> with

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.180 

and<00:04:47.410> then<00:04:47.950> have<00:04:48.700> you<00:04:48.910> light<00:04:49.450> up<00:04:49.480> the<00:04:49.930> dark<00:04:50.290> for

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
and then have you light up the dark for

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.170 
and then have you light up the dark for
the<00:04:51.220> next<00:04:51.610> quarter<00:04:52.410> this<00:04:53.410> is

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
the next quarter this is

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.350 
the next quarter this is
good<00:04:55.110> luck

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.839 

even<00:04:59.659> through<00:04:59.870> the<00:05:00.020> powerful<00:05:00.379> and<00:05:00.919> feeling<00:05:01.340> so

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
even through the powerful and feeling so

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:09.989 
even through the powerful and feeling so
composed<00:05:05.409> the<00:05:06.409> riff<00:05:07.189> that<00:05:07.879> is<00:05:08.060> Rosalee

00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:09.999 
composed the riff that is Rosalee

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:15.870 
composed the riff that is Rosalee
I<00:05:12.599> really<00:05:13.599> like<00:05:13.809> the<00:05:13.959> part<00:05:14.319> birthday<00:05:14.919> it's

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
I really like the part birthday it's

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.680 
I really like the part birthday it's
so<00:05:16.390> good

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.050 

or<00:05:20.170> mittens
