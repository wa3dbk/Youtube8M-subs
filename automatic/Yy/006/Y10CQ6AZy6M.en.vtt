00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
though it's sign Heiser I didn't really

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.249 
though it's sign Heiser I didn't really
have<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.640> lot<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.909> high<00:01:54.240> expectations<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:55.140> this

really<00:01:57.869> cool<00:01:58.140> because<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:59.040> works<00:01:59.430> really<00:01:59.729> well

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
really cool because it works really well

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.649 
really cool because it works really well
like<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.479> am<00:02:00.780> listening<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.820> music<00:02:03.329> or

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
like what I am listening to to music or

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.889 
like what I am listening to to music or
to<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.590> anything<00:02:05.130> off<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.700> my<00:02:05.880> computer<00:02:06.420> it

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
to to anything off of my computer it

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.640 
to to anything off of my computer it
kissed<00:02:07.290> sounds<00:02:09.319> not<00:02:10.319> only<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.770> but

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
kissed sounds not only that but

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.710 
kissed sounds not only that but
Nickolas<00:02:12.189> range<00:02:12.519> on<00:02:12.909> these<00:02:13.060> things<00:02:13.329> I<00:02:13.599> mean

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
Nickolas range on these things I mean

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.839 
Nickolas range on these things I mean
it's<00:02:13.870> like<00:02:14.110> it's<00:02:14.860> something<00:02:15.159> like<00:02:15.310> three<00:02:15.670> or

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
it's like it's something like three or

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.789 
it's like it's something like three or
four<00:02:16.150> hundred<00:02:16.420> feet<00:02:16.989> I<00:02:17.049> forget<00:02:17.409> what<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.650> is

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
four hundred feet I forget what it is

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.530 
four hundred feet I forget what it is
it's<00:02:18.040> like<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.400> tea<00:02:18.519> meet<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.060> think<00:02:19.329> it's<00:02:19.450> like

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
it's like a tea meet I think it's like

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.319 
it's like a tea meet I think it's like
80<00:02:19.750> meters<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.829> so<00:02:21.370> if<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.610> turn<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.269> into

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
80 meters and so if you turn that into

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.920 
80 meters and so if you turn that into
English<00:02:23.230> math<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.860> comes<00:02:24.099> out<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.930> again

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
English math that comes out to again

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.140 
English math that comes out to again
somewhere<00:02:26.230> around<00:02:26.349> like<00:02:26.650> 300<00:02:27.400> feet<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:27.879> even

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
somewhere around like 300 feet so even

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.020 
somewhere around like 300 feet so even
in<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.299> big<00:02:28.480> old<00:02:28.689> house<00:02:28.870> like<00:02:29.079> mine<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:30.700> can

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
let me flip back and so what I can do is

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.129 
let me flip back and so what I can do is
I<00:02:42.250> can<00:02:42.310> take<00:02:42.519> these<00:02:42.670> off<00:02:42.879> my<00:02:43.090> head<00:02:43.359> and<00:02:44.019> then

I can take these off my head and then

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:45.479 
I can take these off my head and then
all<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.290> have<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.470> do<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.889> set<00:02:45.099> them<00:02:45.250> on<00:02:45.340> the

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
all I have to do is set them on the

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
sound to it it has a good range it's

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.899 
sound to it it has a good range it's
comfortable<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.799> know<00:03:09.459> it's<00:03:09.670> like<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.879> just

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
whatever it's really good so a RS sign

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.820

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
house or RS 170 s definitely take a look

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.980 
house or RS 170 s definitely take a look
again<00:05:34.639> as<00:05:34.820> far<00:05:34.970> as<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.090> price<00:05:35.270> goes<00:05:35.300> 200<00:05:35.840> bucks

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
again as far as the price goes 200 bucks

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.050 
again as far as the price goes 200 bucks
I<00:05:36.199> would<00:05:36.800> argue<00:05:36.979> they're<00:05:37.699> worth<00:05:37.909> it

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
I would argue they're worth it

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.520 
I would argue they're worth it
especially<00:05:38.180> when<00:05:38.750> you<00:05:38.870> see<00:05:39.020> the<00:05:39.050> other<00:05:39.229> prices

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
especially when you see the other prices

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.060 
especially when you see the other prices
but<00:05:39.889> that's<00:05:40.220> something<00:05:40.520> for<00:05:40.669> you<00:05:40.729> to<00:05:40.820> decide
