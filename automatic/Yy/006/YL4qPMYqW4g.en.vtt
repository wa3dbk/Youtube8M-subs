00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Good people , I 'm here testing the 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.649
 brand filter inflated was the filter that 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.440
 I got here for my road. 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.590
 inside I really want to see how 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.360
 that will be the power consumption of the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.609
 recording this video further to test the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.140
 power because I put the car high 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.060
 and kombis in alcohol, right? 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.980
 and I'm going to step a lot so it will not 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.619
 to see the right consumption rises and 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.550
 It will improve or worsen for sure. 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.400
 to get worse right? 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.160
 I'll give results here in the panel until 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.140
 to see later on the monster to 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.230
 to see how the consumption with 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.149
 sure to download a lot but not see in the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.980
 that will give right 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.649
 the first impressions I have 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.170
 so this filter is what I need 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.210
 to tread well less per car to walk more I 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.430
 I'm really enjoying it all. 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.129
 feeling this car much lighter 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.870
 I'll catch a line right there. 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.910
 I'm going to make the recording, we'll see. 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.920
 when that car accelerated 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.880
 and good power with respect to noise 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.369
 the sound the engine sound so founded 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.090
 very little practically 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.299
 indiscreet 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.719
 of a very sensitive glass to perceive 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.909
 it was enough to accelerate and listen with the car 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.500
 standing and listening to the outside 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.289
 get out 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.270
 gave a pass on uncle of slight accident 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.630
 a little more but inside the car 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.459
 change is really perceptive. 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.459
 motor engine noise 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.799
 Good, folks, this is not a record. 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.879
 very well the support here was falling 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:19.599
 all very short space but it was the 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:22.330
 It was the best that I could do. 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:26.560
 I really adore this filter I liked 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:34.390
 quite a lot of good walking and how 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:37.209
 promised here is not good consumption will accelerate 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.049
 enough in the annual that even more after 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.730
 next week I'll put petrol 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.910
 in the foot will walk quietly and 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.819
 I'll see if the filter really works better. 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.709
 consumption and I also learned that 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:57.370
 if you put the iridium candles or 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.620
 then that super bosch sail 4 that 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.220
 improvement in fuel burning and 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.599
 other advantages you can also 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.840
 increase the power of this 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.459
 filter and also gain with an increase of 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.160
 fuel neat 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.349
 efficiency in consumption then 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.030
 in the future I also intend to change the 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.989
 candles the candles I have here are 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:23.289
 these common even of $ 15 that you 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.389
 finds there that it does not do very well 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.760
 well as these beautiful burning of the 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.770
 then I want to change 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.400
 to see if it will improve further 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.560
 more and ii next week I record only the 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.570
 consumption of gasoline 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.150
 this car he makes in the most gasoline 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.479
 or less 10 points 2 per liter 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:47.080
 here in the panel we will see if with this 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:50.700
 filter increases something and that's it 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.700
 People are too good.
