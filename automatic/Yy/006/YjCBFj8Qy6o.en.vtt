 help as well as who says in the trash 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.860
 of the classifier 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.690
 I have nine children 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.990
 like daisy it is estimated that every day 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.000
 5000 sorters go through the streets 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.420
 of the urban centers of Uruguay in 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.610
 looking for trash to live sort and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.610
 they sell containers to intermediaries and 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.160
 recycling companies like margarita 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.589
 many inherited this office from their 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.019
 parents inherited work in the 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:49.280
 informality seven days of work 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.870
 weekly without rights or obligations 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.449
 Uruguay has a high informality 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.750
 in managing receipts like most 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.760
 of the Latin American countries those are 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.620
 those of the subjects that most concern us 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.809
 in a management order from 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.700
 the environmental point of view and from a 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.789
 point of view of thinking this as a 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.920
 sustainable development today the 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.320
 informal classifiers are one of the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.600
 most disadvantaged groups of uruguay 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.360
 despite the fact that some wish to continue 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.479
 working informally many 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.610
 They dream to formalize their work 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.979
 have rest days access to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.700
 sanitary treatments and being able to give 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.659
 their children 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.659
 better education 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.230
 almost 10 years ago the government of Uruguay 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.230
 He decided to get to work for 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.380
 dignify the office of classifier in 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.380
 2004 the law of packaging is approved 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.850
 returnable the regulation establishes 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.940
 that the companies that put in 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.250
 circulation non-returnable containers for 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.500
 market their products should 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.920
 take responsibility for its impact 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.720
 environmental are required to have a 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.330
 management plan packaging waste 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.910
 that promotes the protection of the environment 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.459
 environment and the social inclusion of 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.790
 informal classifiers when one 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.080
 works with green policies when one 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.700
 works with inclusion policies 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.620
 social in which what one achieves is 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.230
 Greater improve efficiency 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.150
 in that way the product ends up being 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.549
 more friendly to the environment more 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.019
 friendly with society but above all 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.250
 It also happens more profitable for 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.290
 Business 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.239

 United nations program for 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.879
 development and the program of nations 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.349
 united for the environment pay 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.019
 financed studies that helped 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:44.500
 better understand the classifier collective 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.280
 how many classifiers he knew how they were and 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.480
 where did they live 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.490
 a little the idea of that information 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.459
 then it is to characterize that population 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.130
 characterize that problem to be able to 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:02.000
 have better intervention cannelloni 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.340
 flores maldonado ribera and rocha are the 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.110
 first departments where they were put 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.140
 underway the new management models 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.060
 of urban waste groups were formed 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.860
 of classifiers that started 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.569
 to work 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.120
 accompanied by an organization of the 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.670
 civil society the intendencias 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.670
 departmental chamber of industry 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.120
 the measure and the dynama provide support 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.250
 technical material and financial camera 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.600
 Industry finances salaries and 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.600
 equipment of the classifiers 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.020
 departmental intendancies and the 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.970
 dinama are in charge of logistics and 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.000
 supervise that everything works 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.640
 properly and the mides carries out the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.270
 social accompaniment 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.920
 the organization of civil society 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:54.120
 accompanies the classifiers in their day 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.580
 a day the pei funded a business plan 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.190
 on how to improve the turnover 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.370
 of the groups and how to be sustainable 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.459
 financially in the department of

 flores juan francisco bonilla marÃ­a y 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.470
 clotilde tell us how they improved their 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.870
 lives since it became part 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.489
 of the group of classifiers that work 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:20.120
 in clean circuit 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:26.270
 it changed my life practically for 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.270
 we but for all 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.960
 I for example on the subject of health this 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.569
 I had the opportunity to regulate the 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.240
 mouth you saw 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:44.059
 that is very good and we need 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.449
 go to a doctor and then a change in 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:46.449
 my life 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.190
 we work here there is at least 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.690
 the account of light the water for everything 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.590
 a dentist fixes me here 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.430
 East 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.430
 - well and everything 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.270
 I did not have any teeth before 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:10.960
 when I entered here I settled down now yes I am 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.970
 another person although challenges persist 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.190
 clean circuits have allowed to finish 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.490
 with the classification of waste in the 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.580
 homes child labor dignify 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.010
 classifier work and improve the 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.250
 environmental conditions of the neighborhood and of 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.010
 the localities the work done by 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.260
 Uruguay in public policies that 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.870
 articulate the fight against poverty 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.400
 defense of the environment 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.400
 deserves international attention
