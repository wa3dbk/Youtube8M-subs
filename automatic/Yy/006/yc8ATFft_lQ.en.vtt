00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:14.130
 as occur through technology counselor of 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:18.330
 touchlet 1 9 7 inch tablet pc x10 dual 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.689
 plus that plus is actually that 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.810
 special here to the normal x10 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.420
 must have an external stick if 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.580
 you want internet now and here is one 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.520
 spot installed there I can immediately one 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.559
 Push and sim all 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.540
 Electronics chains are in there, too 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.250
 nothing else and can be mobile in the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.640
 surf Internet 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.539
 everything else very high 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.170
 standard 1 4 ghz clock frequency a quad 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.559
 core graphics processor is in here 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.989
 wireless bluetooth and it can also as 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.460
 Hotspot act for other devices 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.070
 I have the one gigabyte ddr3 memory 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.890
 can be expanded with a memory card 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.140
 be up to 64 gigabytes 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.299
 So that's already powerful what that part 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.420
 can and you see yourself 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.250
 viewing angle is very good too 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.950
 from the side where I look now so 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.020
 wrong or if I have her 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.439
 the pre-installed apps calls and 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.619
 be sure of resolution 1024 x 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.740
 768 has the display and you can 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.520
 realize how beautiful and how it really works 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.960
 So there is nothing left here 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.030
 is browser so it can then 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.549
 about a flatrate maybe 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.369
 have booked on what are they here 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.409
 plug it directly into the internet and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.799
 can be nice and awesome on the go 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.130
 So work out a nice device 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.540
 all things through this through this 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.119
 plus what are they going for then 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.799
 bay is on slots that I can 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.530
 they actually show time is 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.580
 yes obscured also attached it though 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.460
 not for the diver or something 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.500
 but so and if you look at it now 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.850
 so everything has become too small that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.430
 stuff that can not see 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.490
 there we see memory extension 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.190
 then ensures that are then for usb there 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.200
 By the way, there are adapters to it 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.880
 you can also connect normal usb devices 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.220
 can on it and on the other 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.520
 side we come then in the normal usb 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.470
 plug and a hdmi connection with it 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.500
 I on my television or beamer 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.910
 Everything can work and work 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:41.110
 flat and beautiful aluminum housing two cameras 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.100
 0 2 megapixels and 0 3 megapixels and 2 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.959
 megapixel 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.730
 There is nothing to be desired if you 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.709
 ask me what should we still install 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.709
 I would say I do not know and 4
