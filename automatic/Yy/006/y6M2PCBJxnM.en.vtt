little<00:01:44.189> biscuit<00:01:44.670> base<00:01:44.909> layer<00:01:45.320> once<00:01:46.320> your

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
little biscuit base layer once your

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.139 
little biscuit base layer once your
raspberries<00:01:46.979> come<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> boil<00:01:47.880> they're<00:01:48.000> going

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
raspberries come to a boil they're going

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.580 
raspberries come to a boil they're going
to<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.299> quite<00:01:48.570> liquidy<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.350> turn<00:01:49.530> that

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
to be quite liquidy so you can turn that

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.410 
to be quite liquidy so you can turn that
heat<00:01:49.920> down<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.250> they're<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.880> simmering<00:01:51.240> away

heat down so they're just simmering away

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.359 
heat down so they're just simmering away
and<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.200> want<00:01:52.350> them<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.680> reduce<00:01:52.860> down<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
and you want them to reduce down to

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.880 
and you want them to reduce down to
about<00:01:53.670> half<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.450> quantity<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.560> started

about half the quantity that you started
out<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.430> they'll<00:01:56.579> come<00:01:56.729> quite<00:01:57.030> thick<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
out with so they'll come quite thick and

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.270 
out with so they'll come quite thick and
they'll<00:01:58.049> be<00:01:58.140> sort<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.439> really<00:01:58.829> really<00:01:58.860> rich

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
you can eliminate the gelatin but it

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.330 
you can eliminate the gelatin but it

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
mixture you need to take about a

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.120 
mixture you need to take about a
tablespoon<00:04:35.990> or<00:04:36.110> two<00:04:36.289> tablespoons<00:04:36.319> of<00:04:36.979> that

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
gelatin really really vigorously so it's

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.960 
gelatin really really vigorously so it's
completely<00:04:41.569> mixed<00:04:42.410> together<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:42.949> then<00:04:43.639> you

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
completely mixed together and then you

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.180 
completely mixed together and then you
want<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.240> pour<00:04:44.509> that<00:04:44.840> gelatin<00:04:45.470> cheesecake<00:04:45.949> mix

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
back into the main cheesecake mix at

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.689 
back into the main cheesecake mix at
this<00:04:48.800> point<00:04:49.039> you<00:04:49.130> want<00:04:49.280> to<00:04:49.340> make<00:04:49.460> sure<00:04:49.490> that

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
this point you want to make sure that

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.430 
this point you want to make sure that
all<00:04:49.880> of<00:04:49.910> your<00:04:50.090> containers<00:04:50.720> are<00:04:50.840> ready<00:04:50.990> you

piping bag and your cream is sitting

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.290 
piping bag and your cream is sitting
there<00:04:55.340> because<00:04:55.460> you<00:04:55.580> need<00:04:55.699> to<00:04:55.849> work<00:04:55.970> quite

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
there because you need to work quite

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.089 
there because you need to work quite
quickly<00:04:56.539> before<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.020> gelatin<00:04:57.410> starts<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:57.889> set

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
quickly before the gelatin starts to set

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.309 
quickly before the gelatin starts to set
add<00:04:58.400> in<00:04:59.090> all<00:04:59.210> of<00:04:59.300> your<00:04:59.419> semi<00:04:59.720> whipped<00:04:59.960> cream

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:00.319 
add in all of your semi whipped cream

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.499 
add in all of your semi whipped cream
and<00:05:00.530> use<00:05:00.740> your<00:05:00.949> spatula<00:05:01.220> just<00:05:01.759> to<00:05:01.940> fold<00:05:02.300> it

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
and use your spatula just to fold it

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:03.999 
and use your spatula just to fold it
through<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:02.870> mix<00:05:03.080> so<00:05:03.259> that<00:05:03.289> it's<00:05:03.500> really<00:05:03.740> well

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
through the mix so that it's really well

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.040 
through the mix so that it's really well
combined<00:05:04.490> but<00:05:05.000> you<00:05:05.120> definitely<00:05:05.389> don't<00:05:05.630> want

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
combined but you definitely don't want

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.230 
combined but you definitely don't want
to<00:05:06.110> over<00:05:06.680> whip<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:07.009> here<00:05:07.220> the<00:05:07.699> reason<00:05:08.030> that<00:05:08.120> we

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
to over whip it here the reason that we

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.730 
to over whip it here the reason that we
do<00:05:08.389> that<00:05:08.509> little<00:05:08.720> trick<00:05:08.810> with<00:05:09.139> the<00:05:09.229> gelatin<00:05:09.650> is

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
do that little trick with the gelatin is

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.320 
do that little trick with the gelatin is
if<00:05:09.860> you<00:05:09.949> just<00:05:10.159> pour<00:05:10.370> straight<00:05:10.580> gelatin<00:05:11.150> into<00:05:11.240> a

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
if you just pour straight gelatin into a

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.899 
if you just pour straight gelatin into a
mixture<00:05:11.599> like<00:05:11.690> this<00:05:11.930> it<00:05:12.169> sinks<00:05:12.620> to<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:12.800> bottom

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
mixture like this it sinks to the bottom

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:15.159 
mixture like this it sinks to the bottom
separates<00:05:13.909> from<00:05:14.150> the<00:05:14.300> mix<00:05:14.539> and<00:05:14.720> doesn't<00:05:15.080> do

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
separates from the mix and doesn't do

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.290 
separates from the mix and doesn't do
its<00:05:15.319> job<00:05:15.560> now<00:05:16.430> you<00:05:16.490> want<00:05:16.669> to<00:05:16.729> take<00:05:16.849> a<00:05:16.880> ziplock

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
its job now you want to take a ziplock

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.300 
its job now you want to take a ziplock
bag<00:05:17.539> or<00:05:17.840> a<00:05:17.900> piping<00:05:18.560> bag<00:05:18.620> and<00:05:19.039> you're<00:05:19.190> just

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.930 
cups
I<00:05:47.870> found<00:05:48.500> it<00:05:48.650> easiest<00:05:49.070> to<00:05:49.250> actually<00:05:49.699> pop<00:05:49.909> the

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
I found it easiest to actually pop the

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.969 
I found it easiest to actually pop the
cheesecakes<00:05:50.539> as<00:05:50.719> they<00:05:51.050> were<00:05:51.259> in<00:05:51.530> the<00:05:51.680> fridge

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
cheesecakes as they were in the fridge

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.770 
cheesecakes as they were in the fridge
for<00:05:52.009> about<00:05:52.280> 15-20<00:05:52.969> minutes<00:05:53.449> so<00:05:53.509> that<00:05:53.599> they

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
for about 15-20 minutes so that they

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.719 
for about 15-20 minutes so that they
start<00:05:54.110> to<00:05:54.349> firm<00:05:54.590> up<00:05:54.620> and<00:05:55.039> that<00:05:55.430> way<00:05:55.550> you're<00:05:55.699> not

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
start to firm up and that way you're not

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.490 
start to firm up and that way you're not
trying<00:05:56.060> to<00:05:56.120> work<00:05:56.240> with<00:05:56.509> just<00:05:57.080> poured
