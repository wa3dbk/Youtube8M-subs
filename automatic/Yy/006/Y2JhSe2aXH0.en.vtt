 reality but vargas the ones that are used are these that are the third ones to know 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:39.040
 it is probably 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.560
 in the meantime 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.280
 what the idea is not like that 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.840
 and it is understood the soap opera this is the intermediate plant there are some 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.690
 Pills that are for the beep for 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.310

 ap / d ar this means that they are already hot well the first thing they do is 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.760
 be very careful with them they are also hot warm up at a time when 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.479
 warns on a flat surface with care that they are not returned 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.120
 besides the theme 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.630
 The first thing I do is apply a heat protector I will use this 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.520
 a thermal protector voices 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.750
 the iplus 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.730
 and that of majadahonda and what I do is applied haircut 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.680
 in his day I used 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.110
 the day I spent and I will love northeastern systems managed to pulverize sand 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.429
 with a cream maybe a little bit these days for the bad 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.540
 and give them days for their hair 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.580
 gates that I liked a lot to the style using this for relatively 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.200
 little so I can not either 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.770
 decide very well how it goes 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.049
 It is estimated that unused funds 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.790
 and legalist knew nothing more good 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.470
 now what I do sometimes I remove my hair the top part leaving 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.710
 only 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.710
 the bottom of people 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.050
 equal to comment if you have the hair cut to caracas 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.830
 is very important when ironing, let's go by taking different steps 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.799
 say if I have a career for example up here 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.120
 and the next stage that comes up is up to here if I mix the mentions and 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.330
 the plates points 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.240
 I'm going to lose the tents in my hair because it's going to gather in the iron and 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.269
 then we write down feeling 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.909
 then if you have short hair 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.460
 now we have no case 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.340
 uncovering and always denying loose not mixing capabilities in the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.069
 same layout 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.219
 So now what we do is take a little pig 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:52.629
 and the iron 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.179
 we close and we are passing it with care 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:59.179
 these plates the truth is that they treat wonderfully 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:03.849
 the admission term dv 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.089
 but the difference between the rambla in knowing what not 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:10.809
 besides that the hair very the intel 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:15.569
 22 you have also asked many of you because you have seen that the 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.129
 fine perfumes page 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.269
 having these plates and that is very well the reverse of the truth 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.559
 the player will be in the ranking they will compete so far 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.799
 as everything about eta does not speak but to assure me they told me they had 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.380
 dian europe guarantee certificate 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.589
 I would tell you to be no problem 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:35.959
 for those who are 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.399
 a total of 20 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.010
 the match in the third step more 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.120
 cÃ³rdoba see on this page dozens of step wholesalers and that's why they have these 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.169
 practices 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.719
 Well now that the Cordovan interior layer has started 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.379
 I would jump on the court 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:58.230
 undertake trying to mix able then good a way to see it if 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.319
 we are taking 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.649
 mesons of the interior we can go and take things a little midnight if 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:06.339
 the blocks fall 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:08.209
 the next face 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.520
 if some link with the iron is who wants us 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.910
 as their affiliates but they should be given a second pass why fees 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.660
 says or to the iron very fast the template is closed this appointment 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:23.009
 a little bit of space comes out for me to go 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.199
 acting 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.270
 If the iron and if the house is too fast, it is not like a ball. 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.219
 I would like to 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:31.449
 Well, these popular slate 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.159
 they said do not return to the plate immediately after the same month 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.499
 an neglect 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:43.919
 to wait for it to lose temperatures and then we go back over that it made me a 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.759
 theatrical practice expand 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.330
 and then something else although we are looking organized 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.610
 we can always give it a little bit of shape at the end of the hair ie 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.139
 we can do with the hacienda 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.949
 we take a holy faith I do not know if we continue with the iron straight until the end 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.580
 so that the Belgian will remain as you see completely straight 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.670
 or we can catch and what it arrives right at the end of the event will go 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.370
 transform it to put a little bit of the central point 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.530
 provincial out to take some time so he can be with us 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.599
 well now I will continue 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.619
 plan holy mud and I will give a little bit of fast camera to not 

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:29.779
 get bored 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.779
 I come now 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:01.599
 China country that some box as I said 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:03.580
 the displaced 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.189
 the lower house for example says there as we can always now when the 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:11.210
 hair and it's a little bit got 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.219
 the bell 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:17.849
 pending the one that we have started with the other equal of the ironed separately 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:21.819
 table will even stop there was much more movement at speed 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.910
 and now with the bangs the country do what it wants standards we are 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.199
 analyzing the order 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.220
 can you analyze everything well can you 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:35.550
 stop doing them natural we're going to be short neighborhood we're too 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.960
 time will tell if not 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.220
 but good is what ali shah always says 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.880
 try to give it a little bit of shape I perceive it closed 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.280
 I will attend the square a bit so they are well closed 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.199
 as it was between hands that from villa shoots 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:56.650
 well this would be the final result caracas also responds to the 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.369
 words from the sides collapse 

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:03.240
 as you see that harbors hamilton surpassed 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.939
 lies and for you to see it 

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:10.840
 and good nothing else I hope that the four little things presented to be counted have 

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:12.419
 for tools 

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:14.860
 and the jail seven vial Saturday
