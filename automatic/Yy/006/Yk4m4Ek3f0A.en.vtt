that looks like a hump that goes up this

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.719 
that looks like a hump that goes up this
your<00:01:29.220> height<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.880> let's<00:01:30.240> rate<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.659> radius

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
your height and let's rate this radius

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.100 
your height and let's rate this radius
determines<00:01:32.729> how<00:01:32.909> big<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:35.030> sensitivity

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
determines how big and sensitivity

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.420 
determines how big and sensitivity
determines<00:01:37.110> how<00:01:37.200> hot<00:01:37.409> determines<00:01:38.100> how<00:01:38.189> fast

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
determines how hot determines how fast

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.980 
determines how hot determines how fast
it<00:01:38.670> does<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.880> hump<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.570> goes<00:01:42.720> down

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
it does it and this hump that goes down

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.700 
it does it and this hump that goes down
brings<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.680> land<00:01:43.979> down<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:46.560> this

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
goes underground we'll worry about that

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.400 
goes underground we'll worry about that
later<00:04:02.700> but<00:04:03.329> for<00:04:03.480> now<00:04:03.540> we'll<00:04:04.049> just<00:04:04.079> draw<00:04:04.380> a

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
later but for now we'll just draw a

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.849 
later but for now we'll just draw a
track<00:04:05.870> so<00:04:06.870> we're<00:04:07.049> just<00:04:07.079> gonna<00:04:07.410> make<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.799> a

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
track so we're just gonna make it a

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:22.110 
track so we're just gonna make it a
little<00:04:08.040> bit<00:04:08.340> farther<00:04:08.700> around<00:04:09.239> here

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.760 

and<00:04:22.660> we're<00:04:22.810> just<00:04:22.930> gonna<00:04:23.110> ring<00:04:23.350> it<00:04:23.440> around<00:04:23.620> to

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
and we're just gonna ring it around to

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.840 
and we're just gonna ring it around to
the<00:04:23.800> other<00:04:24.010> end<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:26.650> attach<00:04:26.950> it<00:04:27.160> to<00:04:27.250> there

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.980 
right there and that cameras I don't
really<00:05:10.600> work<00:05:10.840> with<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.430> routes<00:05:12.690> these<00:05:13.690> are

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
really work with and routes these are

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.900 
really work with and routes these are
where<00:05:14.169> you<00:05:14.260> can<00:05:14.470> do<00:05:14.800> your<00:05:15.010> layers<00:05:15.280> and<00:05:15.580> session

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
layers now we get to trains select an

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.300 
layers now we get to trains select an
engine<00:05:20.229> like<00:05:20.620> this<00:05:20.830> one<00:05:22.110> go<00:05:23.110> in<00:05:23.290> like<00:05:23.470> this<00:05:23.680> and
