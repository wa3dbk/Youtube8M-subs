00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
all that kind of needs to happen with

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.320 
all that kind of needs to happen with
all<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.770> time<00:01:48.040> so<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.490> know<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:48.970> needs<00:01:49.120> to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
all the time so you know it needs to

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.900 
all the time so you know it needs to
have<00:01:49.480> these<00:01:49.690> kind<00:01:49.960> of<00:01:50.050> low<00:01:50.340> points<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:51.520> don't

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
have these kind of low points I don't

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.120 
have these kind of low points I don't
think<00:01:51.970> necessarily<00:01:52.480> we're<00:01:53.320> in<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.680> low<00:01:53.860> point

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
think necessarily we're in a low point

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.860 
think necessarily we're in a low point
at<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.460> moment<00:01:54.820> but<00:01:55.000> we're<00:01:55.360> in<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.480> time<00:01:55.840> of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
at the moment but we're in a time of

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.570 
at the moment but we're in a time of
kind<00:01:56.290> of<00:01:56.410> change<00:01:56.680> with<00:01:56.980> with<00:01:57.190> some<00:01:57.400> of<00:01:57.520> the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
kind of change with with some of the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.880 
kind of change with with some of the
music<00:01:57.910> i<00:01:58.060> think<00:01:58.300> that<00:01:58.510> electro<00:01:59.380> house<00:01:59.590> has

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
music i think that electro house has

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.430 
music i think that electro house has
kind<00:02:00.160> of<00:02:00.280> been<00:02:00.880> so<00:02:01.150> big<00:02:01.390> for<00:02:01.570> so<00:02:01.720> long<00:02:01.960> i<00:02:02.200> think

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
kind of been so big for so long i think

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.870 
kind of been so big for so long i think
some<00:02:02.620> people<00:02:02.950> getting<00:02:03.160> to<00:02:03.220> be<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.340> board<00:02:03.610> now

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
some people getting to be a board now

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.030 
some people getting to be a board now
lit<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:05.140> know<00:02:05.230> i<00:02:05.260> think<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.590> sound<00:02:05.860> is

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
lit and you know i think the sound is

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.870 
lit and you know i think the sound is
changing<00:02:06.880> again<00:02:07.479> so<00:02:08.080> yeah<00:02:08.920> at<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.280> future<00:02:09.700> I

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
changing again so yeah at the future I

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.030 
changing again so yeah at the future I
don't<00:02:10.119> know<00:02:10.240> it'd<00:02:10.720> be<00:02:11.440> nice<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.650> know<00:02:11.860> but

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
don't know it'd be nice to know but

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.130 
don't know it'd be nice to know but
that's<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:12.910> exciting<00:02:13.330> thing<00:02:13.480> is<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.990> we

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
that's the exciting thing is that we

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.320 
that's the exciting thing is that we
don't<00:02:14.290> know<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.459> know<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:15.850> this

don't know and that you know in this

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.210 
don't know and that you know in this
time<00:02:16.570> next<00:02:16.720> year<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.200> could<00:02:17.350> be<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> totally<00:02:18.010> new
