of<00:01:23.850> inaccuracies<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.750> mean<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.350> what<00:01:25.500> if<00:01:25.619> we

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
of inaccuracies I mean so what if we

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.260 
of inaccuracies I mean so what if we
actually<00:01:25.920> lost<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.520> battle<00:01:26.729> instead<00:01:27.149> of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
winning it but the movie really shows

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.889 
winning it but the movie really shows
patriotism<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.820> mean<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.330> not<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.479> big<00:01:30.690> deal

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899
