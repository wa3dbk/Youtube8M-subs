 undergoing change reforms designed to 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.810
 transform the face of the Russian army 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.369
 found out journalists from Moscow who visited 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.439
 the other day Kunashir island 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.510
 first question interested metropolitan 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.970
 guests is the quality of military power 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.500
 parts than today fed soldiers succeeded

 also compote sugar milk tea with i 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.379
 I think food is good enough by 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.650
 soldiers serving military 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.869
 parts 71 435 new power mode 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.330
 like each not a different diet 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.549
 food every day can be different 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.479
 choose more inside dishes to choose from three 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.060
 two dishes to choose from 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.549
 every day all the best is very tasty 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.920
 very good however buffet 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.570
 quite comparable in taste and selection of dishes 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.700
 in the menu of good Moscow cafes 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.100
 not the only innovation that used to be 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.930
 didn't see the army an afternoon nap not 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.970
 less than sixty five minutes a day 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.040
 is intended to compensate for additional 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.259
 physical and intellectual loads 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.960
 fallen on the shoulders of servicemen after 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.909
 how different side functions 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.799
 washing outfit before cleaning 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.470
 territories were taken over by civilians 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.990
 specialists recently 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.829
 according to the order of the Minister of Defense 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.850
 increased physical education 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.790
 preparing 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.770
 light from this increased load on 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.960
 personnel 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.090
 enhanced nutrition and increase time 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.290
 for recreation after all and not a soldier from 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.390
 daily business concerns 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.149
 only care for the uniform left 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.149
 and weapons by duty on we as it were 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.590
 Now we are engaged in purely military, then we 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.590
 must follow gun cleaning 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.440
 would it follow military equipment in 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.250
 exercises are held in the rest of the army 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.500
 now feeds 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.730
 serves and clothes not the army itself 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.680
 Russia as a whole 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.730
 which is logical if you quote 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.980
 old saying 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.420
 a country that does not feed its army 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.420
 will feed someone else's
