00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.580
 1000ps live and the motorcycle fair in 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.210
 dortmund michael full in berger carbon 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.290
 He will now give us the ducati panigale 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.480
 bring something closer 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.940
 We already have the motorcycle at 1000 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.010
 ps and presented on facebook and the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.180
 Of course people were blown away by that 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.680
 motorcycle is already in series trim 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.580
 Impressive with your carbon there 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.010
 even more 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.720
 Michael like a lot of square feet of carbon 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.149
 you need to make this here 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.350
 First of all, the panigale is more 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.670
 or less of us completely 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.260
 been equipped the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.690
 Side panels completely in carbon 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.379
 to be prophetic 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.329
 there is already a lot i see parts 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.910
 they look a lot like carbon 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.870
 But I think we are not 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.090
 the panigale was in trouble 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.640
 the very special version the ducati 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.140
 here you have that one whole 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.260
 offer special heat protection 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.879
 It is a ceramic composite of on 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.439
 the first look like carbon 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.159
 But looks very high proportion 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.510
 ceramic fibers with built in there 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.040
 it actually manages to completely 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.650
 to create sensible heat dissipation 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.030
 and especially the part is very 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.229
 heat resistant and does not play that way 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.549
 as you might think of one or the other 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.400
 experienced other competitors already 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.200
 how many parts have different parts 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.330
 are there about installed you can do that 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.180
 the others say no matter now 26 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.610
 Pieces of smaller parts like 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.040
 Covers like here up to big ones 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.780
 resume side paneling and the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.970
 Customers look very individual but 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.799
 really could the complete package 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.119
 or euro plus single the practical one 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.400
 part over the back cover two 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.280
 games are mounted and all our part is 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.799
 then in style in the art 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.980
 kept this ducati causa built that 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.510
 means that pasta is nice together 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.070
 how can you price yourself there now 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.050
 orient what costs for example 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.990
 its rear wheel cover that goes with it 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.270
 let's go at 169 euros the extreme 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.070
 the short version is exactly fitting 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.690
 and we have the long-mounted now 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.000
 costa few euros more protects though 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.410
 of course, that hacker more beautiful 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.410
 thanks 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.410
 Thank you very much
