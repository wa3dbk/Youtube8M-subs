actually<00:00:36.780> start<00:00:37.050> writing<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.960> you<00:00:39.960> know

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
actually start writing it so you know

you in the background of this video you
can<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.210> I'm<00:00:42.360> using<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:43.590> website<00:00:43.770> called

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
can see that I'm using a website called

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.119 
can see that I'm using a website called
draw<00:00:44.430> IO<00:00:44.820> which<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.870> free<00:00:46.289> kind<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.010> like

alternative<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.969> Microsoft<00:00:48.420> Visio<00:00:48.600> which<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
alternative to Microsoft Visio which is

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.660 
alternative to Microsoft Visio which is
very<00:00:49.320> popular<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:50.059> normal<00:00:51.059> diagramming<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
very popular for normal diagramming and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.400 
very popular for normal diagramming and
I'd<00:00:53.670> recommend<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.149> check<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.510> out<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.870> don't

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
I'd recommend you check it out I don't

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.930 
I'd recommend you check it out I don't
think<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.829> mandatory<00:00:56.340> part<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
think it's a mandatory part of the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.580 
think it's a mandatory part of the
series<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.539> felt<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.020> was<00:00:58.170> important

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
series but I felt like it was important

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.560 
series but I felt like it was important
enough<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:59.039> some<00:00:59.789> people<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.329> should

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
enough to some people that I should

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.479 
enough to some people that I should
probably<00:01:00.690> touch<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
probably touch on it and in the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.619 
probably touch on it and in the
background<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.059> see<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.510> I'm<00:01:03.600> doing

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
background you can see that I'm doing

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.560 
background you can see that I'm doing
what's<00:01:04.140> called<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.530> class<00:01:04.830> design<00:01:05.549> diagram<00:01:06.119> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
what's called a class design diagram and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.149 
what's called a class design diagram and
at<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> top<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.710> name<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
at the top of it you have a name of a

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.060 
at the top of it you have a name of a
class<00:01:08.369> next<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> fields<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.290> their

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
class next you have the fields and their

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.670 
class next you have the fields and their
data<00:01:11.340> types<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.000> then<00:01:12.810> after<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.650> have

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
data types and then after that you have

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.219 
data types and then after that you have
the<00:01:13.860> methods<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.729> class<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.299> that's<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.080> way

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the methods in a class and that's a way

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.560 
the methods in a class and that's a way
of<00:01:16.409> modeling<00:01:16.770> what<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> class<00:01:17.430> looks<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:17.939> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
of modeling what a class looks like and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.179 
of modeling what a class looks like and
you'll<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.259> pretty<00:01:19.500> soon<00:01:19.740> I'm<00:01:19.920> gonna<00:01:19.979> make

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
you'll see pretty soon I'm gonna make

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.160 
you'll see pretty soon I'm gonna make
another<00:01:20.220> class<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.119> then<00:01:21.689> I'm<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.049> you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
another class and then I'm going to you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.499 
another class and then I'm going to you
have<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> diamond<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.100> my<00:01:23.460> first<00:01:23.820> class<00:01:24.060> point

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
have a diamond on my first class point

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.590 
have a diamond on my first class point
to<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> second<00:01:25.380> class<00:01:25.500> that's<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.700> composition

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
to the second class that's a composition

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.840 
to the second class that's a composition
relationship<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.159> means<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.579> for

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
relationship and that just means the for

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.160 
relationship and that just means the for
the<00:01:30.060> first<00:01:30.299> class<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:31.020> board<00:01:31.290> has<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:33.170> second

the first class the board has a second
class<00:01:34.350> which<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.950> believe<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> J<00:01:35.640> racer

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
object in this particular example so we

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.310 
object in this particular example so we
can<00:01:41.280> also<00:01:41.460> use<00:01:41.790> these<00:01:42.000> diagrams<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.990> model

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
can also use these diagrams to model

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440 
can also use these diagrams to model

tutorial series so question number one

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.520 
tutorial series so question number one
has<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.659> do<00:02:06.719> with<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.930> length<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
has to do with the length of the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.919 
has to do with the length of the
tutorials<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.429> according<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.509> Google

Analytics panel I'm

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.600 
Analytics panel I'm
with<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:12.049> guys<00:02:12.200> like<00:02:12.530> videos<00:02:13.069> that<00:02:13.340> are<00:02:13.430> five

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
with you guys like videos that are five

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.660 
with you guys like videos that are five
minutes<00:02:13.879> or<00:02:14.569> less<00:02:14.629> and<00:02:15.340> actually<00:02:16.340> I've<00:02:16.459> seen

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
minutes or less and actually I've seen

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.309 
minutes or less and actually I've seen
that<00:02:16.849> in<00:02:17.000> my<00:02:17.120> six<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.540> seven<00:02:17.780> minute<00:02:18.019> videos

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
that in my six and seven minute videos

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.170 
that in my six and seven minute videos
most<00:02:18.920> people<00:02:19.189> watch<00:02:19.340> about<00:02:19.640> five<00:02:19.909> minutes

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
most people watch about five minutes

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.000 
most people watch about five minutes
that<00:02:21.049> means<00:02:21.230> they're<00:02:21.409> missing<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:21.860> last

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
that means they're missing the last

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.119 
that means they're missing the last
twenty<00:02:22.459> percent<00:02:22.879> of<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.390> videos<00:02:23.769> so<00:02:24.769> I'm<00:02:24.950> kind

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
twenty percent of the videos so I'm kind

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.949 
twenty percent of the videos so I'm kind
of<00:02:25.189> thinking<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.670> know<00:02:25.819> five<00:02:26.480> minutes<00:02:26.840> is

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
of thinking you know five minutes is

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.839 
of thinking you know five minutes is
really<00:02:27.260> short<00:02:27.620> for<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.920> programming<00:02:28.340> tutorial

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
really short for a programming tutorial

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.580 
really short for a programming tutorial
video<00:02:29.060> I'd<00:02:29.329> have<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.540> split<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:29.930> into<00:02:30.140> like<00:02:30.349> a

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
video I'd have to split this into like a

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.199 
video I'd have to split this into like a
hundred<00:02:31.340> two<00:02:31.459> hundred<00:02:31.489> episodes<00:02:32.090> that's

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
hundred two hundred episodes that's

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.199 
hundred two hundred episodes that's
crazy<00:02:32.799> but<00:02:33.799> I'm<00:02:34.099> willing<00:02:34.609> to<00:02:34.640> do<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.819> and

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
crazy but I'm willing to do that and

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.520 
crazy but I'm willing to do that and
that's<00:02:35.390> perfectly<00:02:35.810> fine<00:02:35.900> with<00:02:36.200> me

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
that's perfectly fine with me

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.679 
that's perfectly fine with me
the<00:02:37.129> next<00:02:37.400> video<00:02:37.670> is<00:02:37.909> ten<00:02:38.150> minutes<00:02:38.299> long

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
the next video is ten minutes long

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.929 
the next video is ten minutes long
that's<00:02:39.409> what<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:39.620> was<00:02:39.739> gonna<00:02:39.890> test<00:02:40.189> next<00:02:40.489> you

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
that's what I was gonna test next you

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.849 
that's what I was gonna test next you
know<00:02:41.120> see<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:42.260> know<00:02:42.379> if<00:02:42.560> I'm<00:02:42.680> actually

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
know see you know if I'm actually

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.520 
know see you know if I'm actually
writing<00:02:43.250> code<00:02:43.400> will<00:02:43.790> people<00:02:43.940> stay<00:02:44.299> and<00:02:44.720> learn

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
writing code will people stay and learn

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.750 
writing code will people stay and learn
what<00:02:45.709> there<00:02:45.829> is<00:02:45.889> to<00:02:45.920> learn<00:02:46.040> from<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.489> video

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
what there is to learn from that video

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.780 
what there is to learn from that video
so<00:02:47.720> if<00:02:48.319> you<00:02:48.680> have<00:02:48.920> an<00:02:48.980> opinion<00:02:49.190> on<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:49.549> if<00:02:49.760> you

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
so if you have an opinion on this if you

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.160 
so if you have an opinion on this if you
think<00:02:49.849> it<00:02:50.090> should<00:02:50.209> be<00:02:50.269> five<00:02:50.510> minutes<00:02:50.780> ten

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
think it should be five minutes ten

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.410 
think it should be five minutes ten
minutes<00:02:51.370> 15<00:02:52.370> minutes<00:02:52.400> or<00:02:52.760> 20<00:02:52.790> minutes<00:02:53.299> I'd

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
minutes 15 minutes or 20 minutes I'd

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.449
