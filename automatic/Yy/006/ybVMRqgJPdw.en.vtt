00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
to do is put the right sides of the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.350 
to do is put the right sides of the
fabric<00:00:10.349> together<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.179> right

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
fabric together and this is the right

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.999 
fabric together and this is the right
side<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.960> side<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.469> want<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.740> see<00:00:13.889> on

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
side the side that you want to see on

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.740 
side the side that you want to see on
the<00:00:14.099> outside<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.610> coin<00:00:14.849> purse<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.420> this

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
the outside of the coin purse and this

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.109 
the outside of the coin purse and this
is<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.080> course<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.440> wrong<00:00:16.619> side<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.400> that's

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
is of course the wrong side and that's

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.210 
is of course the wrong side and that's
the<00:00:18.270> wrong<00:00:18.390> side<00:00:18.690> also<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.320> let's<00:00:19.890> put<00:00:20.039> right

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the wrong side also so let's put right

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.470 
the wrong side also so let's put right
sides<00:00:20.250> together<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.390> means

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
sides together and that just means

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.390 
sides together and that just means
laying<00:00:21.869> them<00:00:22.109> across<00:00:22.260> each<00:00:22.769> other<00:00:22.890> like<00:00:23.160> this

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
laying them across each other like this

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.820 
laying them across each other like this
and<00:00:23.699> if<00:00:24.359> you'll<00:00:24.480> remember<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:25.199> made<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.710> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
and if you'll remember I made it a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.460 
and if you'll remember I made it a
little<00:00:26.160> bit<00:00:26.279> short<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:27.050> little<00:00:28.050> half<00:00:28.170> an<00:00:28.320> inch

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
little bit short a little half an inch

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.960 
little bit short a little half an inch

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
to leave the opening here so let's sew

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.750 
to leave the opening here so let's sew
this<00:00:34.829> one<00:00:35.010> first<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:37.190> all<00:00:38.190> I'm<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.550> do

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
this one first and all I'm going to do

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.310 
this one first and all I'm going to do
is<00:00:39.770> run<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.489> seam<00:00:41.850> along<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.989> side<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
is run this seam along the side of the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.779 
is run this seam along the side of the
zipper<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:44.100> top<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.430> those<00:00:44.520> seem<00:00:44.760> I

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
zipper just on top of those seem I

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.430 
zipper just on top of those seem I
already<00:00:45.300> made<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.719> sew<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> zipper<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.410> the

lining and it doesn't matter if your
thread<00:00:51.480> doesn't<00:00:51.629> match<00:00:51.870> because<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.410> going

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
thread doesn't match because it's going

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.990 
thread doesn't match because it's going
to<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> inside<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.399> no<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:53.730> will<00:00:53.910> ever
