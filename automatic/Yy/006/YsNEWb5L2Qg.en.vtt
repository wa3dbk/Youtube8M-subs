 heading color our all hello to all 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.960
 today's release we will analyze in detail 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.969
 tool cooler by adobe it 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.090
 exists in several interfaces 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.550
 online on site and cooler . adob dot com 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.340
 totally free to register 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.289
 we start an adyd we press sain in 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.109
 enter your e-mail password 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.660
 checkmark Rome army and we find ourselves MGOU 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.300
 Photoshop web-interface 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.370
 windows extension schouler right 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.510
 side interface appears where 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.730
 tool panels 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.700
 there is also the color wheel itself and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.730
 there are those color schemes that came up 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.460
 members of the kuler community. adobe point 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.950
 com cooler is a tool for creating 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.800
 color schemes that will be in the future 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.870
 very help you color correction 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.000
 and toning gradually rubric 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.760
 moves to a new level and analysis 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.370
 colors we will study light theory 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.739
 The rule of combination is huge and 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.229
 Special thanks to Alexander Ambala University 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.990
 motivation highly recommend to follow 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.970
 his activities behind his streams and blues 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.280
 in the video description there will be links to 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.830
 literature that will also help you 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.590
 better navigate color combination 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.810
 today we will study the interface 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.630
 we will practice and learn 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.450
 transfer color schemes cooler to your 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.119
 pictures of the line between the flowers on 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.470
 The color wheel displays relationships by 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.079
 certain rules 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.610
 which you choose from the list on the left 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.450
 side color circle 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.610
 uses the hsb hilton model which 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.950
 sha'n't saturation by brightness 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.850
 moving a point on the color wheel along 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.979
 hourly 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.829
 either counterclockwise 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.920
 the main color we change its tone that is 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.470
 the color position itself is closer or farther from 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.390
 center of the circle is responsible for saturation 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.390
 color wheel slider 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.700
 responsible for the brightness the cooler offers 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.549
 six types of rules for creating color 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.910
 schemes in fact you choose the primary color 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.740
 and then the cooler selects the rest for you 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.380
 using specified 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.200
 you analog rule the very first is 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.660
 adjacent colors are different in tone i.e. mod 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.660
 rotate clockwise either against 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.600
 clock hand then it remains different but 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.590
 Saturation is the same monk romantic 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.140
 monophonic 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.830
 it is not difficult to guess from the translation 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.910
 colors 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.940
 having the same shade but having 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.770
 different saturation and gives way 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.450
 saturation but remains the same 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.060
 my hue is pretty simple 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.120
 the triad is the next rule in the triad 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.090
 used three colors equidistant each 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.700
 from a friend on a color wheel like 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.100
 the scheme gives a strong visual contrast 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.680
 while maintaining balance and color 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.440
 complementary saturation following 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.850
 rule is addition 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.520
 complementary color scheme is created 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.900
 using two colors 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.190
 placed against each other on 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.440
 color wheel 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.530
 when using contrast color 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.590
 schemes it is important to choose the dominant color and 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.080
 use extra for accents 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.880
 for example the primary color for the background and 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.610
 extra light to highlight 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.160
 complementary color important elements 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.740
 the scheme is the most contrasting and all 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.000
 color schemes and most strongly 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.950
 attracts attention 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.710
 but in this scheme it is difficult to achieve balance 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.870
 colors than on chromatic or 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.950
 analog circuits especially when 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.860
 using soft and warm colors 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.800
 compound is compound mix combination 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.010
 interesting colors with different shades 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.990
 This description from google helped more as 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.030
 there to search and determine this 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.280
 color scheme as double 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.550
 complementary this scheme is most 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.270
 saturated with flowers than the rest 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.620
 not used four colors two pairs 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.990
 opposite 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.080
 complementary colors 6 this is from the word 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.790
 shadow adding black to pure color then 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.550
 have chosen color by us 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.980
 that is, here's a Q mixed with black and 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.890
 it gets darker on this build this 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.260
 custom color scheme he special 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.570
 allows us to break the rules a little bit 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.199
 example here we use analogs and 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.250
 now choosing kostum can 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:31.550
 avoiding the rule of moving individual colors 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.680
 the engine as you please 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.449
 right or wrong way 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.479
 the rules that you use they 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.080
 determined by the goal you want 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.320
 to reach 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.050
 using one way or another to create 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.169
 color scheme if you want 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.070
 use less than 5 colors you 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.199
 can you example 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.120
 remove them by clicking remove color from you 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.760
 there will be 4 colors you may even 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.090
 stay two colors is not a problem and 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.100
 it is also possible to add more light than 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.760
 5 unfortunately you can not add but 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.010
 You can use 2 color schemes. 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.500
 together if you want to use 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.240
 some kind of color scheme and create 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.120
 color scheme from the picture 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.580
 you can do it too you upload 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.340
 image or upload your own 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.860
 or look for a photo on the site 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.990
 flickr.com here choose photos and when 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.560
 this image creates a color 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.870
 scheme 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.960
 you can change the type of this scheme 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.410
 let's say more such a colorful more 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.180
 bright less saturated more with deep 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.539
 color and darker 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.760
 This is all the possibilities of the cooler This is the first 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.789
 part of the cooler interface overview 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.099
 There is still video course on site Linda point 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.930
 com i will try you as much as possible 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.910
 present this information and 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.180
 please read again 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.720
 video description + on my blog site 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.520
 there will be an article where again in detail 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.849
 I'll sign each rule of use 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.250
 the colors that we see here on the left 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.330
 as long as this is all you need to know 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.340
 about cooler 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.889
 use exercise leave 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.560
 comments follow Stream Ambala 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.169
 he makes out there too and often uses 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:19.070
 cooler thank you so much for your attention 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.070
 good bye
