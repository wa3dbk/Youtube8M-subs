note<00:03:13.299> that<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.599> navigation<00:03:14.170> bar<00:03:14.349> actions

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
note that the navigation bar actions

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.649 
note that the navigation bar actions
function<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.280> same<00:03:15.519> way<00:03:15.730> as<00:03:15.970> slide<00:03:16.359> groups

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
function the same way as slide groups

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.589 
function the same way as slide groups
and<00:03:16.959> finally<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.769> page<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.519> content<00:03:19.269> container

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
and finally a page a content container

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.080 
and finally a page a content container
capable<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.319> displaying<00:03:20.650> only<00:03:21.280> one<00:03:21.519> document

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
capable of displaying only one document

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.720 
capable of displaying only one document
now<00:03:23.079> let's<00:03:23.349> see<00:03:23.560> how<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:23.799> mix<00:03:24.099> multiple

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
now let's see how to mix multiple

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.940 
now let's see how to mix multiple
content<00:03:25.150> containers<00:03:25.629> and<00:03:25.780> build<00:03:26.230> multi-level

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
content containers and build multi-level

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.729 
content containers and build multi-level
application<00:03:27.549> hierarchy<00:03:28.150> we'll<00:03:28.959> create<00:03:29.230> three

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
application hierarchy we'll create three

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.580 
application hierarchy we'll create three
new<00:03:29.769> documents<00:03:30.670> note<00:03:31.180> do<00:03:31.930> not<00:03:31.959> delete<00:03:32.560> the

new documents note do not delete the

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.589 
new documents note do not delete the
automatically<00:03:33.400> created<00:03:33.519> tile<00:03:34.150> container

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
automatically created tile container

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.259 
automatically created tile container
here<00:03:34.930> let's<00:03:35.650> add<00:03:35.859> one<00:03:35.889> more<00:03:36.220> container<00:03:36.880> for

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
here let's add one more container for

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.360 
here let's add one more container for
example<00:03:37.299> a<00:03:37.780> page<00:03:38.019> group<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.530> go<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.190> the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
example a page group and go to the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.610 
example a page group and go to the
navigation<00:03:40.090> tree<00:03:40.389> section<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:41.049> populate<00:03:41.590> the

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
navigation tree section and populate the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:50.730 
navigation tree section and populate the
page<00:03:41.950> group<00:03:42.160> with<00:03:42.370> documents

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.980 

now<00:03:51.400> drag<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:51.820> drop<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.210> page<00:03:52.510> group<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.900> the

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
now drag and drop the page group to the

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.020 
now drag and drop the page group to the

within<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.630> tile<00:04:04.840> container<00:04:05.260> will<00:04:05.860> display

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
within the tile container will display

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.370 
within the tile container will display
