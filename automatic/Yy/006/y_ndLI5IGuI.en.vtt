of space which turned out to be a whole
lot<00:01:36.940> easier<00:01:37.210> than<00:01:37.870> you<00:01:38.020> think

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.330 
unfortunately the laser and landing mode
buttons<00:02:06.130> look<00:02:06.700> pretty<00:02:07.090> similar<00:02:07.390> I<00:02:08.340> think

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
buttons look pretty similar I think

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.090 
buttons look pretty similar I think
general<00:02:10.000> Skywalker<00:02:10.810> thinks<00:02:11.140> spinning<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:12.040> a

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
general Skywalker thinks spinning is a

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.630 
general Skywalker thinks spinning is a
good<00:02:12.430> trick<00:02:13.530> wonder<00:02:14.530> if<00:02:14.620> he<00:02:14.769> still<00:02:15.070> thinks<00:02:15.459> so

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
good trick wonder if he still thinks so

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.300 
good trick wonder if he still thinks so
now<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.660> was<00:02:16.930> starting<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.560> look<00:02:17.709> like<00:02:17.920> maybe

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
now it was starting to look like maybe

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.240 
now it was starting to look like maybe
he<00:02:18.640> was<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:19.030> over<00:02:19.480> his<00:02:19.660> head<00:02:19.989> but<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.100> know

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
he was in over his head but you know

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.050 
he was in over his head but you know
things<00:02:22.209> have<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.480> way<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.780> working<00:02:23.260> out

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
things have a way of working out

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.020 
things have a way of working out
especially<00:02:25.060> when<00:02:25.570> your<00:02:25.750> Padawan<00:02:26.110> brings<00:02:26.650> back

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
so Anakin's thinking at least obi-wan

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.960 
so Anakin's thinking at least obi-wan
