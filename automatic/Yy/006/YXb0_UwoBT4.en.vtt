00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
if you start pulling grout out of the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.950 
if you start pulling grout out of the
lines<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.600> then<00:01:51.920> wait<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> little<00:01:53.220> bit<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.960> go

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
lines and then wait a little bit and go

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.590 
lines and then wait a little bit and go
back<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.290> try<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.590> again<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.330> good

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
back to try it again but it's it's good

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.380 
back to try it again but it's it's good
to<00:01:57.750> kind<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.110> get<00:01:58.470> as<00:01:58.619> much<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.160> grout<00:02:00.149> off

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
to kind of get as much of the grout off

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.240 
to kind of get as much of the grout off
of<00:02:00.570> there<00:02:00.720> while<00:02:00.899> still<00:02:01.259> wet<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:02.009> that

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
of there while still wet as you can that

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.910 
of there while still wet as you can that
way<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.640> saves<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.090> otter<00:02:03.649> elbow<00:02:04.649> grease

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
