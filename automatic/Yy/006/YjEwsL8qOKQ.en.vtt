00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
does help and slows down the computers a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.590 
does help and slows down the computers a
little<00:01:01.920> bit<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.789> definitely<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.359> good

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
little bit that is definitely a good

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.109 
little bit that is definitely a good
point<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.589> let's<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:04.920> honest<00:01:05.309> here<00:01:05.519> when

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
point but let's be honest here when

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
point but let's be honest here when
you're<00:01:06.240> playing<00:01:06.479> Mario<00:01:06.990> Kart<00:01:07.020> how<00:01:07.680> often<00:01:08.100> are

you're playing Mario Kart how often are
you<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:08.640> playing<00:01:09.000> single-player<00:01:09.630> by

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
you really playing single-player by

you really playing single-player by
yourself<00:01:10.500> Mario<00:01:11.159> Kart<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.579> a<00:01:11.640> game<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:11.970> is

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
yourself Mario Kart is a game that is

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.179 
yourself Mario Kart is a game that is
very<00:01:12.329> social<00:01:13.110> before<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.619> play<00:01:13.829> with<00:01:13.979> real

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
very social before you play with real

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.280 
very social before you play with real
friends<00:01:14.759> next<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.570> or<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.840> play<00:01:16.079> online

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
friends next to you or you play online

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.859 
friends next to you or you play online
so<00:01:17.219> again<00:01:17.579> I<00:01:17.759> really<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.240> don't<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
so again I really just don't see the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.480 
so again I really just don't see the
look<00:01:19.020> we're<00:01:19.170> having<00:01:19.229> much<00:01:19.530> purpose<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
look we're having much purpose the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.819 
look we're having much purpose the
krazy-8<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.210> basically<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.350> lucky<00:01:22.619> 7

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
krazy-8 is basically just the lucky 7

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.010 
krazy-8 is basically just the lucky 7
they<00:01:23.579> might<00:01:23.759> as<00:01:23.850> well<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.240> use<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> lucky<00:01:24.840> 7

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
they might as well just use the lucky 7

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.780 
they might as well just use the lucky 7
because<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.680> has<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.040> relevance<00:01:26.399> to<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
because it has a relevance to the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.389 
because it has a relevance to the
lottery<00:01:27.149> and<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:28.229> crazy<00:01:28.500> 8<00:01:28.710> being<00:01:28.950> at<00:01:29.130> Mario

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
lottery and the crazy 8 being at Mario

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.120 
lottery and the crazy 8 being at Mario
Kart<00:01:29.430> 9<00:01:29.759> when<00:01:29.969> it<00:01:30.060> makes<00:01:30.240> sense<00:01:30.479> because

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
Kart 9 when it makes sense because

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.950 
Kart 9 when it makes sense because
obviously<00:01:32.130> crazy<00:01:32.640> 8<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:33.030> only<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.570> Mario<00:01:33.930> Kart

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
obviously crazy 8 was only in Mario Kart

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.630 
obviously crazy 8 was only in Mario Kart
8<00:01:34.229> because<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> title<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.219> game<00:01:35.399> I

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
8 because of the title in the game I

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.670 
8 because of the title in the game I
also<00:01:36.090> think<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.539> all<00:01:36.750> seven<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> items

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
also think that all seven of the items

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.350 
also think that all seven of the items
should<00:01:38.009> be<00:01:38.070> completely<00:01:38.549> different<00:01:38.909> every

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
should be completely different every

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.600 
should be completely different every
single<00:01:39.390> time<00:01:39.719> you<00:01:40.020> get<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.860> for<00:01:41.130> example

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
single time you get it so for example

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.849 
single time you get it so for example
you<00:01:42.000> could<00:01:42.119> get<00:01:42.270> three<00:01:42.659> red<00:01:42.930> cells<00:01:43.200> two<00:01:43.560> green

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
you could get three red cells two green

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.310 
you could get three red cells two green
cells<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.340> star<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.820> mushroom<00:01:45.240> one<00:01:45.450> time<00:01:45.719> but

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
cells a star in a mushroom one time but

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.569 
cells a star in a mushroom one time but
the<00:01:46.439> next<00:01:46.469> time<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.009> get<00:01:47.130> something

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the next time you get something

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.340 
the next time you get something
completely<00:01:48.119> different<00:01:48.149> from<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.810> the

this<00:01:51.750> point<00:01:52.020> on

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
this point on

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.039 
this point on
considering<00:01:52.950> making<00:01:53.100> life<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.820> yeah<00:01:54.780> there's

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
considering making life so yeah there's

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.749 
considering making life so yeah there's
definitely<00:01:55.109> no<00:01:55.619> reason<00:01:56.039> to<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.280> return

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
definitely no reason to have that return

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.880 
definitely no reason to have that return
the<00:01:57.179> fireball<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> great<00:01:58.079> item<00:01:58.320> from<00:01:58.560> Double

couple<00:02:08.179> games<00:02:08.629> I<00:02:08.989> doubt<00:02:09.649> we'll<00:02:09.769> ever<00:02:09.830> see<00:02:10.220> it

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
couple games I doubt we'll ever see it

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.479 
couple games I doubt we'll ever see it
again<00:02:10.340> anyway<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:11.450> super<00:02:11.780> leaf<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.110> just<00:02:12.489> okay

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
again anyway the super leaf is just okay

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.729 
again anyway the super leaf is just okay
I<00:02:13.730> mean<00:02:14.209> you<00:02:14.360> can<00:02:14.540> hit<00:02:14.690> players<00:02:15.019> next<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.650> you

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
I mean you can hit players next to you

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.589 
I mean you can hit players next to you
if<00:02:15.920> they're<00:02:16.099> really<00:02:16.400> close<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.420> you

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
if they're really close to you and you

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.420 
if they're really close to you and you
can<00:02:17.750> deflect<00:02:18.080> bananas<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.769> shells<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.190> stuff

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
can deflect bananas and shells and stuff

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.089 
can deflect bananas and shells and stuff
but<00:02:20.150> let's<00:02:20.420> be<00:02:20.569> honest<00:02:20.959> but<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.680> isn't<00:02:21.950> green

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
but let's be honest but it isn't green

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.039 
but let's be honest but it isn't green
shells<00:02:22.340> just<00:02:22.430> do<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.849> job<00:02:23.030> better<00:02:23.269> and

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
shells just do the job better and

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.050 
shells just do the job better and
besides<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.769> looks<00:02:24.799> really<00:02:25.370> awkward<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.940> the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
besides it looks really awkward on the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.210 
besides it looks really awkward on the
carpet<00:02:26.510> now<00:02:26.870> I've<00:02:27.019> changed<00:02:27.319> my<00:02:27.650> opinion<00:02:27.950> of

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
carpet now I've changed my opinion of

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.979 
carpet now I've changed my opinion of
the<00:02:28.340> thundercloud<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.209> I've<00:02:29.720> honestly

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
the thundercloud and I've honestly

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.800 
the thundercloud and I've honestly
really<00:02:30.530> grown<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.430> hate<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:31.819> this<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.510> another

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
really grown to hate it this is another

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.300 
really grown to hate it this is another
item<00:02:33.049> that<00:02:33.349> I<00:02:33.379> doubt<00:02:33.620> we'll<00:02:33.769> ever<00:02:33.860> see<00:02:34.220> again

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
item that I doubt we'll ever see again

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.420 
item that I doubt we'll ever see again
anyway<00:02:34.879> I've<00:02:35.450> saved<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.110> worst<00:02:36.349> item<00:02:36.890> for

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
anyway I've saved the worst item for

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.960 
anyway I've saved the worst item for
last<00:02:38.140> coins<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.500> do<00:02:39.860> like<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.430> coins<00:02:40.790> have

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
last coins I do like the coins have

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.720 
last coins I do like the coins have
returned<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.540> all<00:02:41.690> but<00:02:42.260> having<00:02:42.590> them<00:02:42.769> as<00:02:42.980> items

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
returned it all but having them as items

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.539 
returned it all but having them as items
was<00:02:44.299> a<00:02:44.590> ridiculously<00:02:45.590> bad<00:02:45.890> idea

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
was a ridiculously bad idea

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.970 
was a ridiculously bad idea
the<00:02:47.090> problem<00:02:47.569> with<00:02:47.720> coins<00:02:47.989> in<00:02:48.230> Mario<00:02:48.500> Kart<00:02:48.769> 8

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
the problem with coins in Mario Kart 8

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.069 
the problem with coins in Mario Kart 8
is<00:02:49.310> that<00:02:49.610> when<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:49.879> get<00:02:50.120> them<00:02:50.360> you're<00:02:50.780> left

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.900 
is that when you get them you're left
completely<00:02:51.860> vulnerable

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
completely vulnerable

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
the only time you really get them is

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.350 
the only time you really get them is
when<00:02:54.950> you're<00:02:55.099> in<00:02:55.190> first<00:02:55.430> place<00:02:55.670> when<00:02:56.239> I'm

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
what's worse is that when you're in

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.699 
what's worse is that when you're in
first<00:03:12.470> place<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:13.489> get<00:03:13.790> coins<00:03:14.090> just<00:03:14.840> as<00:03:15.230> often

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
as you get green shells and bananas it's

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.550 
as you get green shells and bananas it's
almost<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.310> game<00:03:19.670> breaker<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.420> have<00:03:20.989> seriously

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
times in a row it's one thing to have

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.580

of<00:03:30.680> like<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:30.950> super<00:03:31.130> horn<00:03:31.459> is<00:03:31.670> but<00:03:32.299> that's

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
of like the super horn is but that's

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.629 
of like the super horn is but that's
just<00:03:32.630> not<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.900> case<00:03:33.260> for<00:03:33.470> Mario<00:03:33.739> Kart<00:03:33.769> 8<00:03:34.130> so

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
just not the case for Mario Kart 8 so

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.190 
just not the case for Mario Kart 8 so
now<00:03:34.760> that<00:03:34.819> that's<00:03:35.090> out<00:03:35.389> of<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.599> way<00:03:35.750> let's

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
now that that's out of the way let's

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.190 
now that that's out of the way let's
talk<00:03:36.410> about<00:03:36.709> new<00:03:37.040> items<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:38.030> acorn<00:03:38.389> suit<00:03:38.660> I'm

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
talk about new items the acorn suit I'm

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.690 
talk about new items the acorn suit I'm
not<00:03:39.410> sure<00:03:39.650> how<00:03:39.889> well<00:03:40.130> this<00:03:40.280> would<00:03:40.489> work

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
not sure how well this would work

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.789 
not sure how well this would work
considering<00:03:41.359> we<00:03:41.540> can<00:03:41.690> already<00:03:41.840> glide<00:03:42.260> but

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
considering we can already glide but

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.159 
considering we can already glide but
hear<00:03:43.069> me<00:03:43.099> out<00:03:43.190> when<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:43.940> have<00:03:44.209> this<00:03:44.359> item<00:03:44.630> not

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
hear me out when you have this item not

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.319 
hear me out when you have this item not
only<00:03:45.590> will<00:03:45.739> you<00:03:45.799> be<00:03:45.950> able<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.160> jump<00:03:46.519> higher<00:03:46.790> but

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
only will you be able to jump higher but

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.849 
only will you be able to jump higher but
you<00:03:47.389> can<00:03:47.540> also<00:03:47.720> buy<00:03:48.109> it<00:03:48.169> around<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.709> make

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
you can also buy it around and make

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.860 
you can also buy it around and make
little<00:03:49.069> shortcuts<00:03:49.609> over<00:03:49.880> things<00:03:50.120> you'd<00:03:50.690> be

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
little shortcuts over things you'd be

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.990 
little shortcuts over things you'd be
able<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.169> do<00:03:51.290> this<00:03:51.470> up<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.799> three<00:03:52.069> times<00:03:52.310> now

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
able to do this up to three times now

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.089 
able to do this up to three times now
again<00:03:53.299> this<00:03:53.630> may<00:03:53.840> not<00:03:54.049> work<00:03:54.349> because<00:03:54.560> ladders

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
again this may not work because ladders

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.309 
again this may not work because ladders
already<00:03:55.459> exist<00:03:55.970> but<00:03:56.239> I<00:03:56.540> still<00:03:56.840> think<00:03:57.169> it'd<00:03:57.290> be

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
already exist but I still think it'd be

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.009 
already exist but I still think it'd be
cool<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.680> see<00:03:58.040> ice<00:03:58.700> flower<00:03:59.090> this<00:03:59.690> can<00:03:59.900> work

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
cool to see ice flower this can work

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.780 
cool to see ice flower this can work
exactly<00:04:00.650> like<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.889> fire<00:04:01.069> flower<00:04:01.370> if<00:04:01.549> you<00:04:01.669> hit

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
exactly like the fire flower if you hit

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.059 
exactly like the fire flower if you hit
someone<00:04:02.030> however<00:04:02.840> they<00:04:03.200> get<00:04:03.349> frozen<00:04:03.680> for<00:04:04.040> a

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
someone however they get frozen for a

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.220 
someone however they get frozen for a
couple<00:04:04.370> seconds<00:04:04.700> instead<00:04:05.060> even<00:04:05.630> if<00:04:05.959> you<00:04:06.049> miss

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
couple seconds instead even if you miss

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.050 
couple seconds instead even if you miss
your<00:04:06.380> shot<00:04:06.650> though<00:04:06.950> whatever<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.730> ice<00:04:07.849> ball

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
your shot though whatever the ice ball

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.150 
your shot though whatever the ice ball
touches<00:04:08.510> becomes<00:04:08.840> icy<00:04:09.349> first<00:04:09.620> short

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
touches becomes icy first short

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.490 
touches becomes icy first short
time<00:04:10.340> apple<00:04:11.060> pie<00:04:11.240> I<00:04:11.630> bet<00:04:11.990> you<00:04:12.050> didn't<00:04:12.260> see<00:04:12.290> that

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
time apple pie I bet you didn't see that

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.440 
time apple pie I bet you didn't see that
coming<00:04:13.100> now<00:04:13.280> instead<00:04:13.580> of<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.790> blooper<00:04:14.240> being

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
coming now instead of the blooper being

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.320 
coming now instead of the blooper being
an<00:04:14.600> item<00:04:14.930> why<00:04:15.440> not<00:04:15.680> have<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:16.070> apple<00:04:16.370> pie<00:04:16.550> what

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
an item why not have the apple pie what

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.850 
an item why not have the apple pie what
if<00:04:17.420> you<00:04:17.510> could<00:04:17.690> throw<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:18.110> like<00:04:18.230> you<00:04:18.380> do<00:04:18.500> a<00:04:18.530> bomb

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:18.860 
if you could throw it like you do a bomb

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.550 
if you could throw it like you do a bomb
and<00:04:19.250> if<00:04:19.610> you<00:04:19.730> hit<00:04:19.910> someone<00:04:20.239> not<00:04:21.019> only<00:04:21.320> do<00:04:21.440> they

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
and if you hit someone not only do they

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.200 
and if you hit someone not only do they
slow<00:04:21.860> down<00:04:22.130> but<00:04:22.370> their<00:04:22.490> screen<00:04:22.760> gets<00:04:22.970> a<00:04:23.060> little

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
slow down but their screen gets a little

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.300 
slow down but their screen gets a little
blurry<00:04:23.510> from<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:23.930> now<00:04:24.500> this<00:04:24.680> is<00:04:24.830> kind<00:04:25.100> of<00:04:25.160> like

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
blurry from it now this is kind of like

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.920 
blurry from it now this is kind of like
the<00:04:25.430> blooper<00:04:25.820> which<00:04:25.970> I'm<00:04:26.150> not<00:04:26.300> a<00:04:26.360> big<00:04:26.600> fan<00:04:26.900> of

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
the blooper which I'm not a big fan of

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.960 
the blooper which I'm not a big fan of
but<00:04:27.470> if<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.650> player<00:04:27.860> significantly<00:04:28.610> slows

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
but if the player significantly slows

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.060 
but if the player significantly slows
down<00:04:29.270> after<00:04:29.570> getting<00:04:29.600> hit<00:04:30.050> by<00:04:30.290> it<00:04:30.350> then<00:04:30.950> it

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
down after getting hit by it then it

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.340 
down after getting hit by it then it
would<00:04:31.130> have<00:04:31.310> a<00:04:31.340> lot<00:04:31.640> more<00:04:31.670> relevant<00:04:32.350> Magnum

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
would have a lot more relevant Magnum

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.410 
would have a lot more relevant Magnum
you<00:04:33.890> basically<00:04:34.370> grab<00:04:34.730> coins<00:04:35.090> that<00:04:35.270> are

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
you basically grab coins that are

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.540 
you basically grab coins that are
surrounding<00:04:35.870> you<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:36.230> maybe<00:04:36.980> if<00:04:37.190> you<00:04:37.340> hit<00:04:37.520> a

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
surrounding you and maybe if you hit a

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.760 
surrounding you and maybe if you hit a
player<00:04:37.850> is<00:04:38.150> steal<00:04:38.540> two<00:04:38.720> coins<00:04:39.050> from<00:04:39.260> them<00:04:39.470> if

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
player is steal two coins from them if

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.160 
player is steal two coins from them if
they<00:04:40.130> have<00:04:40.310> two<00:04:40.520> points<00:04:40.850> that<00:04:40.970> is<00:04:41.150> double<00:04:41.900> Baba

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
they have two points that is double Baba

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.960 
they have two points that is double Baba

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.670 
now I know this one isn't very
innovative<00:04:44.300> but<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:44.930> would<00:04:45.110> be<00:04:45.230> cool<00:04:45.440> to<00:04:45.500> be

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
innovative but it would be cool to be

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.320 
innovative but it would be cool to be
able<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:45.890> have<00:04:46.040> two<00:04:46.280> bottoms<00:04:46.790> that<00:04:46.880> want<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.240> be
