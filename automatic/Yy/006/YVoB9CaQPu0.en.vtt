00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
start that right off the bat I followed

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.460 
start that right off the bat I followed
this<00:00:14.969> guy<00:00:15.089> because<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.509> really<00:00:15.780> am<00:00:15.990> unfamiliar

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
this guy because I really am unfamiliar

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.560 
this guy because I really am unfamiliar
with<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.680> map<00:00:16.890> by<00:00:17.550> noticing<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.119> rushing<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
with the map by noticing the rushing a

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.630 
with the map by noticing the rushing a
pretty<00:00:18.869> different<00:00:19.220> it<00:00:20.220> looks<00:00:20.400> like<00:00:20.430> it's

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
pretty different it looks like it's

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.740 
pretty different it looks like it's
about<00:00:20.670> equal<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.270> get<00:00:21.420> there<00:00:21.539> at<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.689> same

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
about equal to get there at the same

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.390 
about equal to get there at the same
time<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.590> looks<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.949> looks<00:00:23.100> like<00:00:23.340> a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
time so that looks that looks like a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.640 
time so that looks that looks like a
bonus<00:00:23.789> side<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.269> I'm<00:00:24.990> still<00:00:25.230> learning<00:00:25.380> these

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
bonus side and I'm still learning these

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.650 
bonus side and I'm still learning these
maps<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.430> only<00:00:26.609> downfall<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.420> you

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
maps of the only downfall is is you

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.120 
maps of the only downfall is is you
gotta<00:00:27.840> wait<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> day<00:00:28.320> or<00:00:28.349> two<00:00:28.529> before<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.920> find

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
gotta wait a day or two before you find

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.230 
gotta wait a day or two before you find
how<00:00:29.250> these<00:00:29.429> games<00:00:29.640> are<00:00:29.760> really<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.150> be

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
how these games are really going to be

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.389 
how these games are really going to be
in<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.570> actual<00:00:30.869> rush<00:00:31.170> points<00:00:31.560> because<00:00:31.859> so

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
in the actual rush points because so

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.709 
in the actual rush points because so
many<00:00:32.520> people<00:00:32.880> are<00:00:32.940> afraid<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.300> come<00:00:33.510> out<00:00:33.570> of

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
many people are afraid to come out of

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.510 
many people are afraid to come out of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
would go see perfect example that guy

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.720

corners and none of them are willing to
come<00:00:41.070> out<00:00:41.100> because<00:00:41.370> they're<00:00:41.550> afraid<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.850> die

same time you're dealing with the same
exact<00:01:07.260> thing<00:01:07.380> everybody<00:01:07.740> else<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.130> why<00:01:08.729> are

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
exact thing everybody else is why are

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.219

you<00:01:08.939> sitting<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.330> corner<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.140> forth

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
you sitting in corner so on and so forth

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.170 
you sitting in corner so on and so forth
so<00:01:10.619> that's<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.369> downfall<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.939> playing

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
so that's just the downfall to playing

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.719 
so that's just the downfall to playing
new<00:01:12.330> maps<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.920> it's<00:01:13.920> always<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.549> in

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
new maps and it's always going to be in

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.010 
new maps and it's always going to be in
downfalls<00:01:15.180> because<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.570> many<00:01:15.659> people<00:01:15.960> are

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
downfalls because so many people are

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.749 
downfalls because so many people are
afraid<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.320> die<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.680> get<00:01:17.009> raped<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.520> run

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
afraid to die and get raped and run

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.249 
afraid to die and get raped and run
through<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.540> don't<00:01:18.720> know<00:01:18.840> what's<00:01:18.990> going<00:01:19.170> on

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
through they don't know what's going on

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.390 
through they don't know what's going on
there<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.470> familiar<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:19.950> they'd<00:01:20.040> rather<00:01:20.189> just

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
there and familiar so they'd rather just

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
this and that there's a lot of cover I'm

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.289 
this and that there's a lot of cover I'm
actually<00:04:01.919> getting<00:04:02.280> around<00:04:02.669> the<00:04:02.819> map<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.150> get

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
actually getting around the map to get

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.509 
actually getting around the map to get
back<00:04:03.449> here<00:04:03.629> towards<00:04:03.959> see<00:04:04.169> actually<00:04:04.709> has<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.069> lot

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
back here towards see actually has a lot

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.710 
back here towards see actually has a lot
of<00:04:05.549> cover<00:04:05.819> to<00:04:06.000> get<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.269> I<00:04:06.299> mean<00:04:06.569> it's

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
of cover to get to I mean it's

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.689 
of cover to get to I mean it's
vulnerable<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.319> the<00:04:07.379> nades<00:04:07.590> but<00:04:08.489> there's

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
vulnerable to the nades but there's

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.599 
vulnerable to the nades but there's
really<00:04:09.109> really<00:04:10.109> it<00:04:10.739> reminds<00:04:11.069> me<00:04:11.159> of<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.340> mixture

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
really really it reminds me of a mixture

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.430 
really really it reminds me of a mixture
between<00:04:11.699> salvaging<00:04:12.540> storm<00:04:12.840> or<00:04:13.019> something<00:04:13.169> it

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
between salvaging storm or something it

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.379 
between salvaging storm or something it
really<00:04:13.500> does<00:04:13.799> give<00:04:14.010> me<00:04:14.069> that<00:04:14.159> comfort<00:04:14.609> and<00:04:14.790> I

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
really does give me that comfort and I

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:16.339 
really does give me that comfort and I
don't<00:04:15.599> even<00:04:15.659> know<00:04:15.780> what<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.959> hell<00:04:15.989> I<00:04:16.139> just

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
map by sitting in a corner is success

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.670 
map by sitting in a corner is success
really<00:05:06.210> that<00:05:06.360> important<00:05:06.810> you<00:05:06.840> that<00:05:07.110> you<00:05:07.470> feel
