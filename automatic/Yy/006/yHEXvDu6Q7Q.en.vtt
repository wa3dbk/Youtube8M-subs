00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.779
 when I heard about her and me 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.019
 I wanted to do this piece 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.900
 First you mix the composer 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.880
 uci we did not call 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.720
 but I knew that she already 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.260
 at that time sacrifice about it 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.449
 I wanted to and in the music and liked 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.460
 We understood each other immediately and 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.240
 We thought we would try this as 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.240
 ballet 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.809
 working towards the bar 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.110
 the most important thing was to decide if you wanted to 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.300
 that tells biographically or whether you are in 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.390
 the workroom is whether you in the pictures 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.860
 dives in and we thought is danced 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.740
 this definitely the right direction 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.460
 with these insane pictures too 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.460
 work 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.859
 thus begins then get this book 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.979
 you had scared then for the first time 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.289
 a big fat book so much and how 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.789
 behave respectfully and 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.890
 dignified to such a monster 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:56.189
 great value and that somehow 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.409
 also almost feels or part of the evening 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.600
 is also best works 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.280
 with projections world then you can do a lot 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.780
 make respectful, nonetheless 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.780
 opposite the factory 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.430
 death accompanies us all that that is 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.270
 Actually, what's important to me is it 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.300
 that demanded her statement to the end 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.310
 from her factory she says, therefore, that 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.760
 that death can look in the eyes 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.290
 I know that I want to live and me 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.290
 the threefold year 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.370
 I think go so far with this theme 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.370
 how charlotte goes about these topics
