and<00:00:41.340> everything<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.879> unfortunately<00:00:42.030> i<00:00:42.540> don't

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
and everything and unfortunately i don't

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
have the shoes with me right now but I

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.010 
have the shoes with me right now but I
wish<00:00:44.309> put<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> picture<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.989> video

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.110 

so<00:00:50.680> that's<00:00:50.830> how<00:00:50.950> it<00:00:51.100> looks<00:00:51.280> like<00:00:51.520> it's<00:00:51.760> by

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
so that's how it looks like it's by

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.180 
so that's how it looks like it's by
dolce<00:00:52.510> vita<00:00:52.750> a<00:00:52.840> really<00:00:53.320> nice<00:00:53.500> alternative<00:00:53.770> to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
dolce vita a really nice alternative to

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.650 
dolce vita a really nice alternative to
the<00:00:54.580> ones<00:00:54.790> from<00:00:54.880> the<00:00:55.060> department<00:00:55.450> stores

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
the ones from the department stores

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.930 
the ones from the department stores
because<00:00:55.870> it<00:00:56.380> looks<00:00:56.950> like<00:00:57.070> pretty<00:00:57.700> much<00:00:57.790> a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
because it looks like pretty much a

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.450 
because it looks like pretty much a
similar<00:00:58.480> style<00:00:58.870> but<00:00:59.320> instead<00:01:00.130> of<00:01:00.250> having

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
similar style but instead of having

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.610 
similar style but instead of having
genuine<00:01:00.910> leather<00:01:01.120> it's<00:01:01.480> synthetic<00:01:02.260> leather

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
genuine leather it's synthetic leather

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.400 
genuine leather it's synthetic leather
and<00:01:02.950> I<00:01:03.700> really<00:01:04.000> love<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.270> because<00:01:04.510> it<00:01:04.750> it's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
and I really love it because it it's

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.080 
and I really love it because it it's
kind<00:01:05.620> of<00:01:05.740> edgy<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:06.220> it's<00:01:06.370> super<00:01:06.820> comfortable

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
kind of edgy and it's super comfortable

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.690

rubber soles on the bottom as far as
height<00:01:15.580> wise<00:01:15.910> it<00:01:16.150> is<00:01:16.180> a<00:01:16.330> little<00:01:16.570> bit<00:01:16.720> high<00:01:16.930> for

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
height wise it is a little bit high for

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.540 
height wise it is a little bit high for
me<00:01:17.320> it's<00:01:17.530> about<00:01:17.710> like<00:01:18.160> four<00:01:18.400> and<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.520> half

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
me it's about like four and a half

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.880 
me it's about like four and a half
inches<00:01:18.910> but<00:01:19.570> because<00:01:19.930> it<00:01:20.050> has<00:01:20.170> a<00:01:20.200> platform<00:01:20.740> the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
inches but because it has a platform the

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.560 
inches but because it has a platform the
front<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.250> really<00:01:21.550> don't<00:01:21.729> mind<00:01:21.850> it<00:01:22.060> much<00:01:22.210> it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
front I really don't mind it much it

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.120 
front I really don't mind it much it
usually<00:01:22.810> isn't<00:01:23.140> my<00:01:23.320> style<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.650> buy<00:01:23.800> something

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
usually isn't my style to buy something

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.590 
usually isn't my style to buy something
like<00:01:24.340> that<00:01:24.520> with<00:01:24.640> thick<00:01:24.880> straps<00:01:25.210> because<00:01:25.570> I

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
like that with thick straps because I

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.109 
like that with thick straps because I
really<00:01:26.560> don't<00:01:26.740> like<00:01:26.830> thick<00:01:27.190> straps<00:01:27.520> but<00:01:27.850> I

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
really don't like thick straps but I

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.850 
really don't like thick straps but I
thought<00:01:28.509> that<00:01:28.570> one<00:01:28.869> looked<00:01:29.050> pretty<00:01:29.290> edgy<00:01:29.680> and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
thought that one looked pretty edgy and

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.440 
thought that one looked pretty edgy and
it's<00:01:30.190> a<00:01:30.280> pretty<00:01:30.460> nice<00:01:30.640> color<00:01:30.880> so<00:01:31.060> I<00:01:31.119> picked<00:01:31.330> it

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
it's a pretty nice color so I picked it

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.570 
it's a pretty nice color so I picked it
up<00:01:31.540> so<00:01:32.050> I've<00:01:32.140> been<00:01:32.259> really<00:01:32.470> loving<00:01:32.740> it<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.160> the

is kind of a copper ish metallic copper

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.839 
is kind of a copper ish metallic copper
color<00:02:52.599> been<00:02:53.590> looking<00:02:53.890> into<00:02:54.040> getting<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.640> pair

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
color been looking into getting a pair

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.400 
color been looking into getting a pair
of<00:02:54.910> sandals<00:02:55.120> but<00:02:55.480> they've<00:02:55.690> all<00:02:55.959> been<00:02:56.170> just

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
of sandals but they've all been just

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.100 
of sandals but they've all been just
like<00:02:56.560> super<00:02:57.069> flat<00:02:57.459> all<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.760> way<00:02:57.880> across

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
like super flat all the way across

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.620 
like super flat all the way across
and<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.350> really<00:02:59.770> don't<00:02:59.920> like<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:01.330> think

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
and I really don't like that so I think

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.460 
and I really don't like that so I think
this<00:03:01.840> offers<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.290> little<00:03:02.650> bit<00:03:02.770> better<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.730> a

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
this offers a little bit better of a

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.590 
this offers a little bit better of a
arch<00:03:05.470> protection<00:03:06.310> or<00:03:06.520> arch<00:03:06.790> support<00:03:07.360> because

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
arch protection or arch support because

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.020 
arch protection or arch support because
it<00:03:08.050> is<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.230> little<00:03:08.470> bit<00:03:08.620> higher<00:03:08.890> here<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.760> next

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
it is a little bit higher here the next

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.620

cotton for so I use this and this is
really<00:05:34.410> great<00:05:34.620> because<00:05:34.830> it's<00:05:35.190> almost<00:05:35.550> lit

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.770 
free it's not completely lint free but
it<00:05:38.040> does<00:05:38.340> have<00:05:38.580> a<00:05:38.760> rougher<00:05:39.090> edge<00:05:39.270> which<00:05:39.660> I

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
it does have a rougher edge which I

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.510 
it does have a rougher edge which I
mentioned<00:05:39.840> in<00:05:40.170> another<00:05:40.740> video<00:05:41.160> is<00:05:41.370> really

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
mentioned in another video is really

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.190 
mentioned in another video is really
good<00:05:41.730> for<00:05:41.850> exfoliating<00:05:42.540> and<00:05:42.750> putting<00:05:43.080> on

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
good for exfoliating and putting on

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.560 
good for exfoliating and putting on
toner<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:43.890> then<00:05:44.460> I<00:05:44.490> picked<00:05:44.760> up<00:05:44.850> an<00:05:45.000> extra<00:05:45.150> pair

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
toner and then I picked up an extra pair

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.410 
toner and then I picked up an extra pair
of<00:05:45.600> my<00:05:46.050> favorite<00:05:46.440> lashes<00:05:46.950> these<00:05:47.760> are<00:05:48.090> PA

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
of my favorite lashes these are PA

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.870 
of my favorite lashes these are PA
lashes<00:05:49.320> and<00:05:49.500> I<00:05:49.560> think<00:05:49.830> the<00:05:50.400> reason<00:05:50.610> why<00:05:50.820> I

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
lashes and I think the reason why I

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.550 
lashes and I think the reason why I
really<00:05:51.180> love<00:05:51.360> these<00:05:51.510> lashes<00:05:51.720> because<00:05:52.140> they

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
really love these lashes because they

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.650 
really love these lashes because they
are<00:05:52.740> exactly<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:53.610> right<00:05:53.760> length<00:05:54.000> for<00:05:54.180> my<00:05:54.420> eyes

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
are exactly the right length for my eyes

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.930 
are exactly the right length for my eyes
don't<00:05:55.080> have<00:05:55.320> to<00:05:55.440> cut<00:05:55.620> it<00:05:55.650> at<00:05:55.860> all<00:05:56.010> just<00:05:56.370> it's

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
don't have to cut it at all just it's

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.090 
don't have to cut it at all just it's
perfectly<00:05:57.570> arched<00:05:57.960> I<00:05:58.320> just<00:05:58.530> put<00:05:58.710> the<00:05:58.830> glue<00:05:59.070> on

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
perfectly arched I just put the glue on

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.150 
perfectly arched I just put the glue on
and<00:05:59.430> it<00:05:59.550> fits<00:05:59.820> on<00:06:00.030> my<00:06:00.060> I<00:06:00.240> perfectly<00:06:01.080> and<00:06:01.320> the

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
and it fits on my I perfectly and the

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.770 
and it fits on my I perfectly and the
band<00:06:02.430> is<00:06:02.610> a<00:06:02.700> little<00:06:03.150> bit<00:06:03.270> stiffer<00:06:03.600> and<00:06:03.630> I

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
band is a little bit stiffer and I

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.840 
band is a little bit stiffer and I
really<00:06:04.110> like<00:06:04.290> that<00:06:04.320> so<00:06:05.040> it's<00:06:05.190> not<00:06:05.310> droopy

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
really like that so it's not droopy

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.270 
really like that so it's not droopy
sometimes<00:06:06.510> when<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:06.810> band<00:06:07.050> is<00:06:07.380> really<00:06:08.040> soft

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
sometimes when the band is really soft

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.890 
sometimes when the band is really soft
yes<00:06:08.580> it's<00:06:08.820> really<00:06:08.970> comfortable<00:06:09.480> but<00:06:09.750> it

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
yes it's really comfortable but it

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.540 
yes it's really comfortable but it
starts<00:06:10.230> getting<00:06:10.350> droopy<00:06:10.710> throughout<00:06:11.250> the<00:06:11.370> day

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
starts getting droopy throughout the day

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.310 
starts getting droopy throughout the day
so<00:06:11.580> I<00:06:11.820> really<00:06:12.150> love<00:06:12.390> kind<00:06:12.630> of<00:06:12.690> like<00:06:12.810> a<00:06:12.840> stiffer

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
so I really love kind of like a stiffer

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.070 
so I really love kind of like a stiffer
band<00:06:13.620> of<00:06:14.120> eyelashes<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.360> then<00:06:15.900> the<00:06:15.960> last
