00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
is because it is massive it's made of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.360 
is because it is massive it's made of
heavy-duty<00:00:33.360> steel<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:34.200> welded<00:00:34.530> all<00:00:34.770> up<00:00:34.980> its

about this is you can put it up against

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.369 
about this is you can put it up against
your<00:00:50.760> garage<00:00:51.270> wall<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.170> park<00:00:52.350> your

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
your garage wall you can park your

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.319 
your garage wall you can park your
snowblower<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.149> gonna

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
snowblower in there and it's just gonna

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.790 
snowblower in there and it's just gonna
be<00:00:54.510> out<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.899> way<00:00:55.020> not<00:00:55.260> taking<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.680> lot<00:00:55.770> of

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
be out of the way not taking up a lot of

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.340 
be out of the way not taking up a lot of
space<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.280> really<00:00:56.969> really<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.570> now<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
space I really really like that now the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.959 
space I really really like that now the
reason<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:58.920> such<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> cool<00:00:59.430> idea<00:00:59.550> is

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
reason this is so such a cool idea is

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.250 
reason this is so such a cool idea is
because<00:01:00.359> we've<00:01:00.510> all<00:01:00.660> been<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.020> we've<00:01:01.109> been

because we've all been that we've been

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.450 
because we've all been that we've been
trying<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.500> move<00:01:01.620> your<00:01:01.770> snowmobile<00:01:02.070> around

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
helping my friends out I don't care to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.140 
helping my friends out I don't care to
do<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.930> again<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.890> sled<00:01:14.220> dolly<00:01:14.400> makes<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.970> so

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
do it again this sled dolly makes it so

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.969 
do it again this sled dolly makes it so
much<00:01:15.240> easier<00:01:15.330> because<00:01:15.930> all<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.590> you

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
much easier because all you do is you

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.920 
much easier because all you do is you
walk<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.850> put<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> little<00:01:18.270> prongs<00:01:18.630> right

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
walk up you put the little prongs right

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.149 
walk up you put the little prongs right
there<00:01:19.110> underneath<00:01:19.409> your<00:01:19.650> tunnel<00:01:19.950> right<00:01:20.100> by

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
there underneath your tunnel right by

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.620 
there underneath your tunnel right by
the<00:01:20.280> running<00:01:20.549> boards<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.390> need<00:01:21.509> more

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the running boards if you need more

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.300 
the running boards if you need more
space<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> extended<00:01:22.890> route<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.220> it

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
space but the extended route so it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.350 
space but the extended route so it
actually<00:01:23.400> grabs<00:01:23.759> everything<00:01:24.000> underneath

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
actually grabs everything underneath

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.230 
actually grabs everything underneath
there<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:26.040> wise<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.640> protected<00:01:27.119> by<00:01:27.210> a
