00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
decided to build myself a pc which I

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.280 
decided to build myself a pc which I
connect<00:00:11.610> actually<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:12.330> for<00:00:12.450> everyday<00:00:12.840> use

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
connect actually it's for everyday use

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.180 
connect actually it's for everyday use
as<00:00:14.809> you<00:00:15.809> don't<00:00:16.020> want<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.320> switching<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:16.920> a

high<00:00:17.460> end<00:00:17.670> gaming<00:00:17.940> ring<00:00:18.500> just<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.650> use<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
high end gaming ring just to use the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.900 
high end gaming ring just to use the
internet<00:00:20.300> each<00:00:21.300> time<00:00:21.859> so<00:00:22.859> let's<00:00:23.490> just<00:00:23.670> start

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
internet each time so let's just start

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.960 
internet each time so let's just start
off<00:00:24.000> with<00:00:24.240> all<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.930> components<00:00:25.760> which<00:00:26.760> I've

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
off with all the components which I've

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.679 
off with all the components which I've
actually<00:00:27.150> put<00:00:27.930> together<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.470> build<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.859> pc

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
actually put together to build this pc

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.580 
actually put together to build this pc
starting<00:00:30.689> with<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> case<00:00:31.230> which<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.989> by<00:00:33.989> lee

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
starting with the case which is by lee

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.880 
starting with the case which is by lee
ann<00:00:34.770> lee<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:37.129> b25<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.430> case<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:40.710> actually

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
ann lee is the b25 be case it actually

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.260 
ann lee is the b25 be case it actually
has<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> door<00:00:41.640> at<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.910> front<00:00:42.149> we<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.680> open<00:00:44.270> and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
has a door at the front we can open and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.830 
has a door at the front we can open and
once<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.690> open<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.710> reveals<00:00:50.000> 35.2<00:00:51.000> 5<00:00:51.510> inch

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
once you open it it reveals 35.2 5 inch

and<00:02:49.519> it's<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.670> bit<00:02:50.819> hard<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.120> see<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:52.560> mower

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
and it's a bit hard to see but the mower

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.440 
and it's a bit hard to see but the mower
board<00:02:53.129> is<00:02:53.280> actually<00:02:53.609> covered<00:02:54.030> by<00:02:54.180> all<00:02:54.329> of

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
board is actually covered by all of

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.349 
board is actually covered by all of
these<00:02:54.569> components<00:02:55.019> but<00:02:55.579> the<00:02:56.579> motherboard<00:02:57.090> is

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
these components but the motherboard is

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:03.729 
these components but the motherboard is
biases<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.700> it's<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.909> p5<00:03:00.450> ki<00:03:00.810> pro<00:03:02.180> motherboard

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
biases and it's a p5 ki pro motherboard

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.679 
biases and it's a p5 ki pro motherboard
I<00:03:04.739> actually<00:03:05.310> decided<00:03:05.579> to<00:03:05.939> go<00:03:06.180> with<00:03:06.299> me<00:03:06.450> until

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
I actually decided to go with me until

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.069 
I actually decided to go with me until
this<00:03:06.989> time<00:03:07.670> rather<00:03:08.670> than<00:03:08.849> an<00:03:09.180> nvidia<00:03:09.750> chipset

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
this time rather than an nvidia chipset

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.089 
this time rather than an nvidia chipset
as<00:03:11.090> this<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.299> for<00:03:12.480> everyday<00:03:12.750> use<00:03:13.109> and<00:03:13.319> actually

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
as this is for everyday use and actually

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.869 
as this is for everyday use and actually
needed<00:03:14.719> something<00:03:15.719> more<00:03:15.870> stable<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:18.319> nvidia

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
needed something more stable and nvidia

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:26.629 
needed something more stable and nvidia
chip<00:03:20.879> sets<00:03:21.180> are<00:03:22.069> some<00:03:23.069> more<00:03:25.099> you<00:03:26.099> can<00:03:26.280> say<00:03:26.459> not

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
chip sets are some more you can say not

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:33.009 
chip sets are some more you can say not
stable<00:03:27.150> some<00:03:27.389> of<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.629> time<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.699> crash<00:03:29.699> a<00:03:29.730> lot

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:39.140 

I'm<00:03:34.019> still<00:03:34.290> actually<00:03:34.469> waiting<00:03:35.159> for<00:03:36.139> the<00:03:38.150> x58
