the EVGA 1300 g2 supernova power supply
I'm<00:00:26.000> piling<00:00:27.000> dual<00:00:27.150> Titans<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:29.330> most<00:00:30.330> people

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
shut off next 79 also draws a little bit

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.450 
shut off next 79 also draws a little bit
more<00:00:46.950> power<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:48.559> 850<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.770> didn't<00:00:50.070> cut<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
more power so 850 just didn't cut it

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.450 
more power so 850 just didn't cut it
with<00:00:50.610> modded<00:00:51.030> bios<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.539> had<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:52.410> was<00:00:52.829> fine<00:00:53.129> with

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
with modded bios I had it was fine with

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.760 
with modded bios I had it was fine with
