00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.590
 in today's tutorial we will learn to 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:16.630
 make a tracing table or light table 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.280
 economically to start with the 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.260
 Help from a hammer and a goat stand 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.210
 we disassembled four slats of a pallet 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:43.480
 and we remove the nails that can 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:45.670
 stay in them we mark the measures 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.079
 in the strips obtained when asking 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.059
 the father and we cut them the measurements of 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.059
 our light table are the equivalent 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.190
 to a din a3 and also a margin of 2.5 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:01.170
 centimeters on each side to make it 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.170
 much more comfortable to work on it 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.660
 now let's choose the slats and 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.130
 we will proceed to present it to see that 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.130
 all those sites match 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.820
 then proceed to decorate the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.630
 songs and we will review the unions 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.630
 through clear 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.149
 for the back cover sumps 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.270
 the contour of our table in a sheet 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.549
 of wood then cut it with a 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.659
 jigsaw and subsequently 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.659
 we will fix the songs 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.070
 the surface of the immense can use 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.080
 a glass or a plastic 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.510
 we have used a methacrylate 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.480
 for safety and comfort for 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.340
 work with him as in step 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.250
 previous we loaded the outline of the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.350
 times but before proceeding to cut it 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.240
 we have to change the blade for a 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.770
 for soft materials and lower the 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.480
 tool speed so that it does not 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.980
 the plastic is melted 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.390
 Once this is done, we can 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.640
 export it with the jigsaw and 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.840
 Subsequently sanding it to remove 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.020
 all rebates that have been 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.020
 occasioned 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.280
 the next step is to transform the 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.599
 transparent plastic in translucent 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.879
 first we clean the surface well 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.950
 so that when we paste our paper 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.800
 adhesive this one does not fall and leave 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.080
 imperfections we will place it in the 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.450
 corners directly with a cloth or a 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.580
 sponge we are moving forward having it to the 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.180
 surface and eliminating the bubbles that 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.180
 they can inform 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.420
 next we nail the part 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.950
 later of the joint table this 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:32.860
 will serve as a basis to house the 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:35.040
 luminaire for the light we have 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.239
 chosen a flourishing economic light 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.650
 we load the silhouette at the base and 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.739
 we mark where the 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.420
 switch below we make a 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.579
 hole with a size drill 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.799
 enough for then for the part 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.120
 back to be able to cut with the saw a 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.010
 body with the intention of power 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.840
 turn on and off our table 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.819
 If the light you buy has the 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.659
 switch on the cable you will not have to 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.659
 perform this step 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.350
 we place the luminary in its place and 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.540
 we mark where the cable will come from 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.460
 then drill with a drill bit 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.140
 thick enough so that 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.140
 fit the cable through the hole 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.289
 in order to be able to transport our 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.419
 table comfortably let's put a handle 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.669
 but in a very simple way only 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.889
 we have to make two holes and pass 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.750
 a rope by this nullifying the 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.990
 strongly on the inside of the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.990
 table 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.730
 do not 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.160
 it's time to paste the fluorescent to the 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.350
 base we recommend doing it with 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.940
 a good instant adhesive for 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.940
 improve grip and application 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.889
 once stuck together we check that it is 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.139
 well fixed to the base and we proceed to 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.520
 make the connection to verify that 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.520
 work everything correctly 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.140
 ah 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.510
 now let's fix the surface to the 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.550
 table for it we will make four holes 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:38.500
 in the corners for later 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:40.540
 screw it if we use washers 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.370
 we will increase the surface on which 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.470
 the screw head is supported and 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.000
 we will avoid that in this way we 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.000
 break or split the plastic 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:02.189
 Well we have our table 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.080
 light we only have to light it 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.380
 and start tracing everything in it 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.530
 you want 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.530
 ah 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.840
 and remember that you can take it to 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.600
 any good side because here it is 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.130
