00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.949
 ae 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.120
 Everyone is welcome to 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.609
 One more video on my channel today I'm 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.039
 recording here means trying to record 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.439
 I did not cadets because I entered Egypt 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.689
 I think it's going to suck here 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.460
 I already see the guys only from vodka sg only 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.240
 where they kill with a 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.870
 human shot 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.989
 looks just do not even need to say anything the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.920
 title means the title not the series 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.960
 It will be called cross it there already have 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.239
 In the channel of the skull games does not mean 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.070
 It's not quite a series so I think I 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.160
 I'm the first to do this. 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.449
 I do not know just think right looks older only 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.000
 This is telling you a little bit about 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.550
 reality of this game because a lot of people 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.010
 wants to play cf speaks amano 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.780
 I played well of the time the graphics are not 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.600
 it's all kind of air face f3 type né 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.200
 but it is a very fun game to play 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.810
 huh 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.060
 Good, but the guy comes in the kadett. 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.790
 connected, which only has a low 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.549
 wants to learn a little by playing with the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.770
 beginners, let's not talk about bi and 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.560
 ends up fucking old because he has a 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.590
 garbage in the room is killing itself 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.560
 well this is the way I think everyone 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.470
 You know, I do not need to talk five times. 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.320
 which is not to report increase because the guy 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.350
 he is very low pat is hospitalized 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.200
 to be older 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.320
 you are hacker to use I'm connected 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.619
 who always has always got a hacker 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.899
 watch this video right because in about 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.540
 of 10 players 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.079
 one is a hacker the one is a hacker of ten 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.710
 Good players and no-one there 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.229
 here at least five already the hacker or 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.630
 what a Roman brother made 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.180
 spoiling an old game, that's not it 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.000
 will help in nothing because you play 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.250
 hacker because you have heard ten years 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.710
 face playing hackers and either use it 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.850
 It's also not to be underneath. 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.670
 And look, man, I learned to play in the 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.500

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.700
 Well, well, there you are if you find a stroi. 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.580

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.240
 even if it rules bg l public net will not 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.780
 Do you want to watch if you think Brunão? 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.670
 There you are a hacker to find the pair. 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.690
 Is Oscar going to speak human like that? 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.020
 kid plays 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.750

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.840
 weird huh older I'm 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.570

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.880

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.140

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.660
 a hacker 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.540
 and I just died human to 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.680
 human is a lot of clowning this type game 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.860
 c 8 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.460
 Come on, man, let's get these hackers out. 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.490
 old will stop bani innocent net 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.610
 on my own, it was banned innocent 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.160
 just because my ip was camouflaged 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.490
 of a pirate cef and it is not that I put 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.990
 I logged in type the supper was not the same 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:37.620
 what if there was sef type and sef 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.590
 pirate but manos to steal my ip and 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.210
 c8 saw that whoever had my ip there 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.010
 cariocas who are using a hacker to 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.830
 hack the site right? 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.950
 they bathroom good unfortunately I was 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.710
 in the midst of it its kind 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.810
 I registered there at the pirate sef I was with 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.570
 ip of them and i 'm speaking this here 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.640
 for the simple reason that many people 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.170
 I was a bit confused when I said that 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.910
 I was banned right? 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.210
 The reason I got banned was 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.560
 just this one this time we 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.760
 it's not 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.460
 I think a lot of people saw that it was the 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.570
 the first time this happened in the 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.970
 story of life all said is faithful hand 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.490

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.280
 I will not kid when f 1 11 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.440
 because if df 11 will stop recording 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.590
 but look 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.310

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.370

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.620
 Notion in your mind, man, it will not hurt you. 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.770

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.920
 one side of the hand base disgust simply 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.040
 A disgust of this crazy game is like 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.370

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.170

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:06.720
 hacker download it good nerd and start to 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.180
 kill behind the wall like I think 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.750
 It's a game to play. 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:16.650
 The type of strategy game is you. 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.030
 you control your aim you listen to the 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.360
 face noise right? 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.360
 You try, man, you try to be one. 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.200
 real soldier at least I feel 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.960
 this is not it 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.880
 but a lot of people prefer low hacker only 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.430
 because the child himself is killing himself 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.090
 behind the wall nor do I think that 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.810
 It's not for the father just to make fun even more.
