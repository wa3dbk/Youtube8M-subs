00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.170
 or to well put my name next to the acoustic consultant variation 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.870
 I am here today to ask doubts about a 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.410
 problem that everyone at home most people who live in 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.209
 homes 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.260
 as well as in apartments the noise generated by your neighbor is the uncomfortable 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.069
 The whole day we worked thinking about getting married, we're going to the street. 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:25.880
 we found that very large auditory discomfort 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.429
 then go home quiet a little quiet you take your shower 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.360
 dinner 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.120
 and then sits on the couch there begins those problems you started saw 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.470
 to ruin your neighbor or is for dog shout 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.640
 it was a crying child's noise 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.290
 any kind of noise that's bothering you 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.040
 now exists for us understand two types of noise the airborne noise 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.770
 vibration generated guira 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.520
 that's when I want to put myself now with you if your goal and give him what 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.600
 I believe that hearing these things easier to solve is not so 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.710
 difficult not if you live in the town house and for example your neighbor the wall 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.429
 twinned with you 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:04.969
 and make a beautiful cintra 

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:07.540
 is not germinated and geminated taboão 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.780
 many people went home but let's act or anything goes by December 19 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.610
 Most constructions today are made of material that does not give good 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.800
 insulation appear brick Bahian 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.120
 and that they do not care about the construction with the insulation this 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.530
 proportion worry 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.710
 in simply of environment then what happened a noise passes 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.829
 from side to side 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.219
 but do not worry no this is easy to solve just put in your 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.469
 house double wall account of gereshk humala in the middle independent was due 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.850
 to defeat do not want this is not she gonna cry 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.380
 so you put room 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.460
 on the wall with one with the plaster 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.110
 practically you will not even remember that the neighbor exists 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.300
 in fact, so you can do it in any room in your home. 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.969
 House 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:57.819
 there are apartments I've seen that I find an absurd keiko dormitory divided 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:58.980
 with another neighbor 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.900
 a kitchen in the living room make you lose all your privacy we 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.680
 we have dealt with many cases of always being the person was totally satisfied neither the 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.360
 I saw more 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.240
 what with the neighbor is doing that good right now this happened comes from above 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.930
 as if it were the apartment also to the acoustic treatment in the same way 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.940
 only on the wall you lose about eight centimeters 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.750
 but it is much more viable that you have lost 8 cents and wall than you have and 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.239
 it's okay 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.909
 irritability listening to noise from the neighbor in broad daylight you want to rest 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.929
 but on Sundays and holidays not terrible 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:40.359
 on the roof the same thing makes the kneeling if it will lose about 18 centimeters 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:46.729
 do forró but you're quiet now you have a problem the noise generated by 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.010
 vibration 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.639
 never internal 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.120
 why vibration is the type of noise generated through ports 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.990
 door slamming 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.660
 There have been people that fight song that we climbed to tim intend to commit. 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.580
 batting on the wall this generates a vibration 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.400
 and these are he passes protocolated not only to the wall by the ceiling 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.379
 he passes everywhere by kelson of vibration he walks it 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.439
 walk the wall lane just obey there is more complicated not only that 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.370
 you put the lowered ceiling 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.050
 because it goes through the wall 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.890
 the main point of 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.139
 it is our perception of noise is by the ceiling like neighbor from above 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.239
 but if you treat the ceiling you will see that it goes through the wall to them too 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.260
 starts to complicate 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.710
 I get a little more expensive 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.500
 because it treats and makes ceiling up walls 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.620
 and you're going to have to shell out a little bit more 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.779
 but be 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:42.319
 the best thing there you always obey or be respected 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.250
 the noise limit inside a house 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.629
 and that he marry land-based apartments to the norms 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.600
 at least the common sense of the person 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.199
 but do not forget a boring thing 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.570
 as far as you can go to the world the officer wants me too 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.379
 had comfort 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.410
 I hope I have taken this doubt from you. 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.930
 in the other match of this year together 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.380
 but forget I'm here for the answers are 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.270
 my brand means several to steal the team and the tale with the repetition joao ap 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.930
 breakdowns 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.390
 @ one beat a tone can send 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.959
 your email that I take all your doubts as good 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.419
 Thank you and see you next time.
