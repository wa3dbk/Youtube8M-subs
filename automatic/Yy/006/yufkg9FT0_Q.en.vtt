00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 i 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.140
 how about internet people like shelves 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.850
 but they are very well the day 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.559
 today I come to talk with you about 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.660
 I saw that it has been circulating a lot 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.240
 last week in which it shows 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.240
 to Mr. Caesar Milan who was bitten by 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.949
 this nice little guide dog 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.050
 situation of the video and I'm going to 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.660
 show below is that Caesar 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.730
 milan is in a chapter of his series the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.499
 Dog Whisperer 'in which is 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.310
 to modify the behavior upon receipt 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:34.950
 of a labrador dog for which he 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.750
 will provide a plate with food with 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.789
 some croquettes are going to leave a 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.730
 moment to feed a little and 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:44.969
 then he as leader of the pack wants 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.949
 remove the plate to show level 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.469
 of hierarchy for which the dog does not 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.809
 take it in a good way and say I'm not 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.739
 eating and I'll bite you psychological 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.320
 then the dog and the dog look at him and 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.300
 he wants to bite here this situation and 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.350
 so that you have no doubts, let's see 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.610
 the fast video 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.960
 well here in this video it is clear that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.299
 the gentleman develop he loves you 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.460
 show the level difference between him 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.020
 and the dog wants to show that he is the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.600
 morning leader remember that the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.189
 dogs are governed by hierarchies not by the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.409
 The fact of living with you becomes 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.500
 a human being or your baby or your child 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.820
 it was the small one by 7m and by the fact of 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.619
 put that dress in tie 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.060
 shoes or whatever they want becomes 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.340
 in the human being it is still a dog 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.039
 in my hand we agree truth 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.190
 so the situation here is that the 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.840
 dog says ok to omit is to remove my plate 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.179
 of food and I'm not going to leave it 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.159
 because I'm eating and I'm going to act 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.380
 aggressively because I am by 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.630
 above you and it's very normal 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.429
 any terror when eating is 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.780
 will focus only on one action 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.399
 what is eating 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.770
 well here in the video is captured 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.810
 like césar milan after he gives the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.580
 bitten the dog he defends himself by giving 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.720
 a kick in the side of the dog to 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.880
 which I think is an answer 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.250
 totally normal I do not think he feels 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.080
 fear of a dog will you tolerate it or will you 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.789
 to say oh god is biting me a 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.610
 best dog that was left without moving 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.410
 see if I loose the dog better 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.060
 when a song talks about a poem or 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.970
 I tell him that I do not want when he has 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.290
 died this subtle rite but I did not 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.900
 situation is that if a dog gives you 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.000
 bite you want to defend the sea ​​and a 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.950
 dog bites another dog for u and coward 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.780
 let it be the other dog to which the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.060
 cowardly dog ​​is going to defend equal 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.460
 biting the other dog is something very 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.020
 normal occurs between dogs then yes 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.640
 the dogs knew you as part of 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.260
 the herd in fact consider you as a 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.000
 another dog not like a human being 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.070
 then it is another dog inside the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.320
 herd if I bite you can you 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.580
 respond with equal aggression 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.530
 then that ant 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.680
 if he responds with an aggression equal is 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.360
 to mark and anarchy is not like to 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.400
 assaulting dogs 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.950
 in fact césar milan says that by the hand 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.930
 but some of them I do not know how it is in their 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.060
 daily life or as you plate your own 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.800
 dogs in his house but because of the little 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.410
 I can see how he treats dogs and 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.080
 I can tell you that he calls everyone 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.360
 dogs in general but if you try to see 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.330
 how to modify those behaviors that 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.760
 sometimes they can be modified or sometimes 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.940
 no but in this case that a dog is 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.640
 aggressive that your own dogs are 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.560
 if it has to be modified to the extent 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.820
 of possible and good now I'm going to 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.680
 say a few comments that 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.450
 we found irrigated by the internet and 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.250
 this is the first comment I say that 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.790
 that fucking dog is possessed by the 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.620
 demon no normal dog is like that 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.750
 I suppose the dogs are possessed and 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.310
 maybe at some point you jump 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.110
 when cipher next comment 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.210
 He says that they should sacrifice the 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.030
 animal is a danger to society and 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.800
 nocturnal bipolar the animal in fact to 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.080
 I do not like I prefer dogs 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.660
 good cats if you do not like dogs 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.610
 stupid good if you do not like 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.040
 your dogs is very dense but before the 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.900
 situations that are not going to certify the 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.960
 dog because the dog is not to blame 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.270
 the dog is acting in a way if 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.560
 they could make aggressive mouths but not for 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.950
 that is going to end the world or going to 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.160
 Lead a band of devouring dogs 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.010
 of Mexicans or something like this next 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.410
 comment says I think dylan uses 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.810
 abusive methods there are those who only cover 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.060
 interrupting a dog can feed 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.730
 see the scare face and milan in the 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.010
 answer 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.840
 I think that the one that has no control is the 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.100
 when I guess the normal response to 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.350
 a bite of a dog is that you 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.990
 you want to defend kicking it or giving my hand 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.090
 so much so that if you also love a 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.890
 but maybe you recited his new sun and 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.670
 sing a song to see if it lets go 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.840
 very well reasoned in your own way 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.270
 respond to the aggression of a dog 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.550
 thanks for your comment has 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.040
 comment says one thing is to teach to 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.230
 dogs good manners and teach us to 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.630
 behave but another thing is 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.900
 bothering them at mealtime does not 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.340
 forget he is a poor type animal that does not 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.010
 knows how to respect our brothers 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.870
 minors because the truth is that I do not know about 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.690
 What family do you come for? 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.860
 brothers dogs but good the situation 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.570
 is that if you do not know about training 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.750
 Canine can not say so much about the subject 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.870
 because dogs are not babies they are not 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.780
 brothers and they are not human then not 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.300
 you have clear the idea ok and this is the 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.910
 last comment that took the night 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.270
 I say the week because you try the 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.610
 poly is 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.830
 and this is just a new episode 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.350
 of doggy revenge on humans 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.600
 that has had events as serious as 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.660
 the devouring packs of humans in the 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.850
 df my hypothesis is that this wave of 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.490
 dog attacks is in revenge because 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.580
 humans particularly the taqueros 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.280
 they have been doing barbecue or 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.260
 guagua as I said somehow 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.510
 dogs already realized this and 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:56.500
 they are looking for revenge now it touched him 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:58.450
 milan but tomorrow it could be you or me or 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.190
 any other person or maybe his 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.710
 children or a grandma 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.440
 the same dad or I who know the truth is 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.780
 I do not know also if you're right with your 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.400
 theory and be the truth comments that 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.350
 they say that if they are milan his whole life is 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.030
 have dedicated to animal abuse in all 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.370
 the chapters that he has from his series the 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.610
 lovely dog and he just lives from 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.740
 abuse or comments that say 16 to 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.009
 milan around dog and that only with 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.469
 ready 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:28.129
 if you admire I wanted to remove the 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:29.839
 food to eat it he is totally 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:31.699
 logical and you want to eat the properties 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:33.409
 for all the other people who 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.779
 They want to take my born in a way 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:37.969
 mistaken wrong or that killed the dog 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:40.069
 I want the truth to be reported a little 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:42.110
 is that it is very good to criticize but when 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:43.399
 you do it with foundation if you think that 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.589
 I'm wrong at some point 

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:47.270

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:49.819
