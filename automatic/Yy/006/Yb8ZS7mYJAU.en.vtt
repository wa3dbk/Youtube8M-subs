00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.670
 hello girls so today what you there 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.950
 I want to propose the king is ok is a 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.650
 lipstick so today will make a tutorial of a 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.940
 very lipstick the bill is simple is 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.240
 really very easy to do 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.630
 I only need three colors I use 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:30.240
 this is my usual red 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:33.210
 carmine of the ato2 ok then use the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.730
 black of the first soft 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.760
 who is the number we have already said 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.620
 however many times it is the number if 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.489
 a number 9 sorry in black 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.780
 or behind there is a black noir member 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:55.110
 and then the silver gray always of the figure 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.690
 I was n't 0 40 then all that 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.340
 you have to do is take the proportions 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:06.119
 a big black ball is there 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.830
 big enough and serious as i know 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:15.320
 if you can see so ok fi and near 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.320
 in proportion it must be so 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.280
 this way so less red plus black and 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.140
 then he directed them, he could really take them 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.750
 very little so it will still be the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.220
 then let's dance gray 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.010
 what we have to do to get the ball 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.180
 make a ball of black 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:38.030
 there is a cylinder and then crush it in 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.910
 so that you don't center a cylinder 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.820
 great so more or less must be 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.910
 huge and so wide of a line 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.590
 centimeter in diameter then we take the 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:54.550
 Red we make another cylinder 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:57.260
 this one is finer and is so high 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.360
 obviously saved sizes vary 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.980
 from person to person depends how you want 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.670
 do it anyway I do these 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.240
 dimensions 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.240
 at this point they cut diagonally 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:17.600
 in this way to give them to classical 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:20.570
 lipstick shape that like everyone 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.420
 you know crushed that is obviously 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.420
 cross it must be so see 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.260
 then cut ok then we imagine it 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.350
 to give him practically a physical but 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.110
 just there is a round will we say it 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.460
 because otherwise it seems too much 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.970
 which seems really wrong not 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.630
 consumed in this way ok and then 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:55.790
 let's see how we put pressure 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.790
 on black and that's it this way 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:06.100
 and this is our professor or that one 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:13.150
 people now finishing what we do 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:16.780
 where we pay a little but we do it 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.480
 a cylinder of cello rifles in direct 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.530
 how would you like to call me sincerely in 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.950
 every time I find a different name 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:35.170
 ok and then started to crush him 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:36.880
 we must make it end fine end like 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.920
 crush with a rolling pin hoping 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.140
 not to make trouble like people 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:50.540
 don't have this because of problems there 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:55.180
 that ok but ok now in Italian 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:59.709
 or the thin thin thin strip 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.709
 it must be really very thin 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.690
 ok 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.920
 let's do it no wider than that 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.600
 ok 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:37.680
 then 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.980
 in italy a border because it was too much 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.920
 so returned 3 and now for what i am 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:49.470
 we intend to include it on the side we have 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:55.220
 neither between red and black does not 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.220
 support this knot 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.050
 we're giving up 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.190
 here 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:09.180
 and where the two grays touch base which 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.180
 you cut me 1 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.660
 here it is this way 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:18.270
 ok 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.750
 then my name is beatrice that this panda 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:24.800
 black own gray and therefore used 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.720
 this color is practically gray 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.580
 lightened with a bit of white but not 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.450
 no matter I used this because it 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:36.540
 I saw it finish it is fine that 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:42.090
 religious licensed the galles rules 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:44.300
 born ok nothing almost the part that 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.190
 camper knife cutter mountain 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.840
 let's go and arrange the gray so 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.520
 that followed had stuck to the 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.910
 lipstick and not that you pass over black into 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.630
 this way you see they practically push 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:06.560
 out of the gray, that is, excuse yourself inside and 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.560
 then 4 I try to merge them 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.840
 come here this is our respect 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:18.300
 it's really very simple to do it there 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:21.120
 they are also others we say of three forms 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.530
 other models however this does 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.360
 to start it seems to me really good 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.240
 simple and therefore nothing more done 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.020
 see this if you then have something else 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.080
 time I will show you 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.639
 other models I am now 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.300
 waiting for the creations to come 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:39.159
 they cook and then nothing I will do another 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.389
 video with the creations I made 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:43.150
 till now 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.289
 I hope you enjoyed it and no course 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.050
 even if you have any suggestions 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:49.120

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.300
