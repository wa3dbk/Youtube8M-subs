have to admit it looks very clean solid

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.899 
have to admit it looks very clean solid
and<00:01:05.750> basic<00:01:06.380> it's<00:01:06.560> also<00:01:06.890> very<00:01:07.100> lightweight<00:01:07.369> the

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
and basic it's also very lightweight the

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
back looks fairly basic - here are the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.190 
back looks fairly basic - here are the
SATA<00:01:10.459> connections<00:01:11.060> as<00:01:11.240> you<00:01:11.630> may<00:01:11.749> already<00:01:11.959> know

tools<00:03:26.750> result<00:03:27.199> so<00:03:27.620> here<00:03:27.949> in<00:03:28.010> this<00:03:28.160> benchmark<00:03:28.519> I

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
tools result so here in this benchmark I

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.339 
tools result so here in this benchmark I
get<00:03:28.940> some<00:03:29.120> really<00:03:29.299> nice<00:03:29.569> results<00:03:29.720> especially

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
get some really nice results especially

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.589 
get some really nice results especially
at<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:30.919> sequential<00:03:31.310> tests<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.090> even<00:03:32.449> the

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
at the sequential tests and even the

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.629 
at the sequential tests and even the
access<00:03:33.019> time<00:03:33.199> is<00:03:33.230> really<00:03:33.560> really<00:03:33.889> fast<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.519> I

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
access time is really really fast and I

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.430 
access time is really really fast and I
like<00:03:34.849> that<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.389> separate<00:03:35.780> read<00:03:35.989> score<00:03:36.290> would

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
like that the separate read score would

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.470 
like that the separate read score would
be<00:03:36.500> 92<00:03:37.160> while<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.609> ride<00:03:37.819> score<00:03:38.120> is<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.239> lot

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
be 92 while the ride score is a lot

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.500 
be 92 while the ride score is a lot
higher<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:39.079> I'm<00:03:39.169> speaking<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.760> 156<00:03:40.760> these<00:03:41.269> two

features or bias appearing could help -

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.000 
features or bias appearing could help -
as<00:04:36.390> you<00:04:36.690> can<00:04:36.810> see<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.110> timer's<00:04:37.500> already

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
as you can see the timer's already

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.590 
as you can see the timer's already
starting<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.640> boo<00:04:38.820> rap<00:04:39.000> is<00:04:39.150> done<00:04:39.420> in

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
starting and the boo rap is done in

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:47.420 
starting and the boo rap is done in
roughly<00:04:39.960> 11<00:04:40.560> seconds

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.999 

so<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.270> boot<00:04:48.419> up<00:04:48.570> speed<00:04:48.870> is<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:49.229> fast<00:04:49.259> compared

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
so the boot up speed is so fast compared

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.950 
so the boot up speed is so fast compared
to<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.220> traditional<00:04:50.910> hard<00:04:51.120> disk<00:04:51.360> drive<00:04:51.630> but

overall<00:05:28.710> performance<00:05:29.490> then<00:05:29.970> it's<00:05:30.150> very

overall performance then it's very

the cons I have nothing to say at all

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.050 
the cons I have nothing to say at all
and<00:05:34.169> so<00:05:34.289> I<00:05:34.320> give<00:05:34.530> this<00:05:34.710> SSD<00:05:35.039> a<00:05:35.190> ten<00:05:35.610> out<00:05:35.760> of<00:05:35.789> ten

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
and so I give this SSD a ten out of ten

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.060 
and so I give this SSD a ten out of ten
