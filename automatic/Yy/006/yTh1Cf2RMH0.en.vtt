00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.819 

now<00:00:00.179> we're<00:00:00.359> taking<00:00:00.630> a<00:00:00.690> look<00:00:00.810> at<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.199> site<00:00:01.650> we

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
now we're taking a look at the site we

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.130 
now we're taking a look at the site we
tablet<00:00:02.429> and<00:00:02.669> it<00:00:02.730> uses<00:00:03.030> their<00:00:03.419> wireless

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
tablet and it uses their wireless

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.920 
tablet and it uses their wireless
streaming<00:00:04.290> technology<00:00:04.730> and<00:00:05.730> it's<00:00:06.120> connecting

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
streaming technology and it's connecting

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.740 
streaming technology and it's connecting
with<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.200> TV<00:00:07.529> over<00:00:07.560> here<00:00:08.330> this<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.480> what<00:00:09.630> the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
with the TV over here this is what the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.360 
with the TV over here this is what the
receiver<00:00:10.080> bike<00:00:10.260> box<00:00:10.620> looks<00:00:10.830> like<00:00:11.010> it's<00:00:11.219> going

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
receiver bike box looks like it's going

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:19.159 
receiver bike box looks like it's going
to<00:00:11.400> do<00:00:12.049> hdmi<00:00:13.049> out<00:00:13.230> up<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.160> today

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:19.169 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.269 

so<00:00:20.169> the<00:00:20.289> idea<00:00:20.380> is<00:00:20.560> that<00:00:20.619> you<00:00:20.740> could<00:00:20.919> be<00:00:21.009> across

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
so the idea is that you could be across

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.890 
so the idea is that you could be across
the<00:00:21.490> room<00:00:21.669> what's<00:00:22.179> this<00:00:22.240> android<00:00:22.689> tablet<00:00:23.109> or

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.990 

and<00:00:26.109> stream<00:00:26.410> it<00:00:26.439> to<00:00:26.619> your<00:00:26.710> big<00:00:26.859> screen<00:00:27.000> that's

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
and stream it to your big screen that's

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.910 
and stream it to your big screen that's
playing<00:00:28.810> right<00:00:28.930> there<00:00:30.360> better<00:00:31.770> take<00:00:32.770> your

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
playing right there better take your

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.670 
playing right there better take your
transition<00:00:33.640> when<00:00:33.880> you<00:00:33.970> do<00:00:34.120> a<00:00:34.150> video<00:00:34.450> to<00:00:34.840> get

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
transition when you do a video to get

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:44.170 
transition when you do a video to get
audio

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.120 

so<00:00:44.780> you<00:00:44.870> can<00:00:45.020> as<00:00:45.200> you<00:00:45.290> can<00:00:45.410> see<00:00:45.560> is<00:00:45.740> walking

so you can as you can see is walking

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.400 
so you can as you can see is walking
pretty<00:00:46.250> far<00:00:46.490> away<00:00:47.650> very<00:00:48.650> little<00:00:48.830> degradation
