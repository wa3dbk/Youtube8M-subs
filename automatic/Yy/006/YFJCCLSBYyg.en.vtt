 visit the site ru maynkravt dot ru 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.330
 then download the pipix program 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.939

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.130

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.250

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.230
 swinging you 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.219
 somewhere 1 megabyte weighs but a little more 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.890
 then open the folder where you have 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.559
 I downloaded but at work history 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.469
 I will transfer it to be more convenient to open this 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.109
 program run and then in principle 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.539
 nothing complicated we remove the version 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:04.019
 mine mine 152 and already 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.960
 said here and choose the language here but 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:12.450
 so that you understand and remove here 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.479
 mod there are a lot of mods since 15 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.400
 also here until the fig I so can here 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.030
 select emotions and click install 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.450
 let's 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.680
 animal bikes there they are with me already 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.710
 well worth it 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.799
 this mod can be build craft let's 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.829
 install you want to back up 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.430
 a copy of the current installation but it is valid 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.290
 create copies if suddenly you have minekravt 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.369
 because of the mod flew or something not 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.500
 it turned out to install 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.930
 then you can create a copy copy 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.990
 your files before you install the mod 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.159
 and if you have a mod with mikroft 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.000
 problems and for fashion 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.840
 then you insert your copy again 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.880
 and those file is deleted where you cant here 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.640
 I have a point 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:05.820
 mikroft all copy here daddies 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.510
 so here's a copy too advises you 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.490
 necessarily 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.209
 then suddenly you Mycroft you fly 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.580
 you will blame me and so not everyone 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.630
 copied everything just in case 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.030
 not here 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.220
 if you create right here click on 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.680
 yes then you have copied a couple of bin files and 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.410
 it's better he move all his files 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.830
 in another folder if you have a macro fly 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.200
 mod mod is installed now waiting for it 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.110

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.290
 thought that I will show you manual but there 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.860

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.350
