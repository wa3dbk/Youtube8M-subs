00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.980 

machine<00:00:06.680> from<00:00:07.100> solid<00:00:07.820> billet<00:00:08.060> aluminum<00:00:08.690> these

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
machine from solid billet aluminum these

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.710 
machine from solid billet aluminum these
are<00:00:09.170> the<00:00:09.260> cones<00:00:09.610> that<00:00:10.610> goes<00:00:10.850> into<00:00:11.090> the<00:00:11.300> yg

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:11.720 
are the cones that goes into the yg

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.910 
are the cones that goes into the yg
speaker<00:00:12.460> that<00:00:13.460> one's<00:00:13.670> finished<00:00:14.379> this<00:00:15.379> one

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
speaker that one's finished this one

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.500 
speaker that one's finished this one
better<00:00:17.990> see<00:00:18.990> how<00:00:19.140> thick<00:00:19.440> that<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:20.330> imagine<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
better see how thick that is imagine the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.470 
better see how thick that is imagine the
waste<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.110> the<00:00:22.170> money<00:00:22.440> that<00:00:22.680> goes<00:00:22.830> into<00:00:23.070> that

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
waste and the money that goes into that

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.200 
waste and the money that goes into that
99%<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.900> wasted<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.860> course<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.490> recycle

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
99% is wasted of course we recycle

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.679 
99% is wasted of course we recycle
because<00:00:27.540> we're<00:00:27.750> good<00:00:28.020> green<00:00:28.380> folks<00:00:28.770> but<00:00:29.730> but

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
because we're good green folks but but

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.930 
because we're good green folks but but
yeah<00:00:30.930> the<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.619> material<00:00:32.160> has<00:00:32.520> never<00:00:32.730> been

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
yeah the the material has never been

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.570 
yeah the the material has never been
bent<00:00:33.360> or<00:00:33.660> stamped<00:00:34.379> it's<00:00:34.800> literally<00:00:35.250> been

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
bent or stamped it's literally been

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.320 
bent or stamped it's literally been
carved<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.480> never<00:00:36.809> stressed<00:00:37.580> it<00:00:38.580> also<00:00:38.879> allows

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
carved and never stressed it also allows

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.799 
carved and never stressed it also allows
us<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:40.040> machine<00:00:41.040> these<00:00:41.640> ribs<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.449> the<00:00:42.600> back

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
us to machine these ribs in the back

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.380 
us to machine these ribs in the back
which<00:00:43.080> adds<00:00:43.350> stiffness<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.309> cone<00:00:44.610> these

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
which adds stiffness to the cone these

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.180 
which adds stiffness to the cone these
are<00:00:45.540> not<00:00:45.720> glued<00:00:46.080> on<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.470> is<00:00:46.620> part<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
are not glued on this is part of the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.250 
are not glued on this is part of the
original<00:00:47.400> Billa<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.360> our<00:00:48.720> machine<00:00:49.080> can

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
original Billa this is our machine can

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.860 
original Billa this is our machine can
machine<00:00:49.650> these<00:00:49.800> ridges<00:00:50.430> under<00:00:50.909> the<00:00:51.360> back<00:00:51.720> of

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
machine these ridges under the back of

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.219 
machine these ridges under the back of
the<00:00:51.930> cone<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:53.000> it's<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.239> stiffest<00:00:54.690> code<00:00:54.960> we've

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
the cone so it's the stiffest code we've

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.820 
the cone so it's the stiffest code we've
ever<00:00:55.589> encountered<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.839> may<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.409> the

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
ever encountered and this may be the

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.100 
ever encountered and this may be the
stiffest<00:00:59.280> cone<00:00:59.580> on<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> market<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.900> think

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
stiffest cone on the market we think

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.350 
stiffest cone on the market we think
today<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.949> who<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.339> not<00:01:02.549> found<00:01:02.820> one<00:01:03.120> with

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
today we who have not found one with

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.700 
today we who have not found one with
greater<00:01:03.629> stiffness<00:01:03.960> yet<00:01:04.379> we're<00:01:04.589> still

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
greater stiffness yet we're still

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.399 
greater stiffness yet we're still
looking<00:01:05.129> back<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.320> congratulations

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
looking back so congratulations

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.140 
looking back so congratulations
excellent<00:01:07.979> thank<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.820> before

excellent thank you and this is before

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.590 
excellent thank you and this is before
anodization<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:11.280> then<00:01:11.460> anodized<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.450> and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
anodization so we then anodized it and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.109 
anodization so we then anodized it and
we<00:01:12.690> do<00:01:12.900> use<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> black<00:01:14.010> pigment<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.850> black

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
we do use a black pigment so we black

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.330 
we do use a black pigment so we black
anodized<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:16.560> drivers<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.070> see<00:01:17.250> in

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
anodized it so the drivers you see in

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.090 
anodized it so the drivers you see in
the<00:01:17.460> speakers<00:01:17.850> will<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.150> fact<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.570> black<00:01:19.100> but

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the speakers will in fact be black but

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.330 
the speakers will in fact be black but
this<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.670> prior<00:01:21.149> to<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.600> operation

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
this is prior to that operation

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.590 
this is prior to that operation
that<00:01:24.109> is<00:01:25.109> beyond<00:01:25.710> belief<00:01:26.369> oh<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.090> Peter<00:01:27.299> keep

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that is beyond belief oh and Peter keep

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.280 
that is beyond belief oh and Peter keep
it<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.469> is<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.979> building

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
like so you can see this came from that

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.330 
like so you can see this came from that
look<00:01:36.320> at<00:01:36.619> see<00:01:37.280> how<00:01:37.850> much<00:01:38.030> has<00:01:38.180> been<00:01:38.360> wasted

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.030 

that's<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.119> starting<00:01:43.689> point<00:01:43.990> of<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.770> cone

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
that's the starting point of the cone

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.569 
that's the starting point of the cone
yeah<00:01:45.659> how<00:01:46.659> thick<00:01:46.899> that<00:01:46.930> is<00:01:47.350> ooh<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:48.130> it's<00:01:48.250> very
