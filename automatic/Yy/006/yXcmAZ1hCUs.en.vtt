00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.500
 airport we go straight as if 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.420
 we were to take the luxury jet to the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.090

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.520

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.250

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.240

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.380

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.140
