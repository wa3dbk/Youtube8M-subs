about that's mixed up so nice that color
is<00:01:34.889> almost<00:01:35.069> identical<00:01:35.279> to<00:01:35.700> diesel<00:01:36.359> 10<00:01:36.539> so<00:01:37.109> now

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
is almost identical to diesel 10 so now

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.969 
is almost identical to diesel 10 so now
we're<00:01:37.319> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.469> take<00:01:37.679> our<00:01:37.889> roller<00:01:39.799> roll<00:01:40.799> that

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
we're going to take our roller roll that

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.129 
we're going to take our roller roll that
reef<00:01:41.219> flat<00:01:41.459> so<00:01:42.149> I<00:01:42.179> can<00:01:42.389> lay<00:01:42.539> it<00:01:42.689> right<00:01:42.779> over<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:43.139 
reef flat so I can lay it right over the

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:48.640 
reef flat so I can lay it right over the
top<00:01:43.349> of<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:44.609> Z<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.929> completely<00:01:46.319> cover

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.930 

so<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.770> keep<00:01:49.920> rolling<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.370> back<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:50.850> forth

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
so the keep rolling this back and forth

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.730 
so the keep rolling this back and forth
until<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:51.660> a<00:01:51.720> sheet<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.230> play-doh
