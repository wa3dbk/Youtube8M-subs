00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430
 sonic is probably the most well-known hedgehog 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.870
 of all times and completely wrongly 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.400
 at least lately already 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.170
 sonic goes through more than ten years 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.790
 games cooled he actually does 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.200
 No need to just take him in 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.570
 would age the certain 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.510
 Other video game characters will be sunny 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.250
 can still be exploited 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.390
 you call it exploited at all 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.140
 if the games are not good at all 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.269
 Selling 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.710
 no seriously i want to be very surprised 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.699
 though the post will be about profit 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.140
 made because the sales figures 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.330
 are rather mau 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.790
 you want me now safely ask r ge 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.550
 sonic boom is the rebirth of 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.129
 Angry and I can only say yes 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.260
 and how on a very very 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.820
 Bad way will be sonic boom 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.440
 your worst fears again 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.950
 but why do I talk like that? 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.629
 a lot around 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.280
 I'll show it to you the best 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.899
 already right at the beginning of the game 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.489
 I had the fear of the game 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.899
 will be incredibly bad in 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.579
 pulling dry is just cheap 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.079
 made and lies about dramatic and 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.640
 even those slight delays 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.500
 Reaction of the characters makes me 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.460
 crazy and that's not the only one 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.739
 that happens 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.329
 it comes in almost every cat in front 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.339
 besides, you try the whole game 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.900
 that's about being convulsively funny 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.850
 for call of duty players maybe still 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.290
 quite funny but everyone who tenth 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.580
 has exceeded daly is the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.580
 probably rather boring here 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.940
 in ran 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.840
 naked, a idiot is nice too 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.610
 know that this is the prejudice 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.770
 everyone who is stupid automatically stupid 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.480
 you do not have to exploit completely 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.060
 be incredibly strong 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:37.250
 well shut your mouth you will sacrifice 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.390
 open up to have or no 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.920
 that is too asylum for me 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.210
 I also heard that we 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.950
 us in our videos more to the 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.630
 adolescents have to be right 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.060
 his language please something okay 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.610
 okay I'm going to seduce you first 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.050
 are such a haiku at incredible in 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.300
 sonic boom is about the usual 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.979
 doctorate then everybody has 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.020
 something else and then there is 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.869
 still needed a talking snake in the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.270
 space suit or something like the story is 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.979
 but probably just to stop there and be 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.440
 actually has no deeper meaning 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.270
 in other words who is sonic boom 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.840
 because of the story he bought 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.700
 disappointed 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.430
 but I think nobody buys sonic 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.900
 boom because of the story or the gameplay 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.620
 Sonic boom can not be quite so 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.150
 points 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.100
 You can fight with a button 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.600
 attack and suffice with one button 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.489
 besides, every character has one 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.540
 special move but actually 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.280
 not worth talking about 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.200
 so that has a total of three possible 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.030
 action in the fight but the fighting is 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.100
 usually so easy knitted that they only 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.810
 the normal attack week would be that 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.049
 fighting system thus consists only of the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.519
 spam the y button wonderful but to 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.110
 happiness come new over time 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.810
 moves to the gameplay something 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.970
 refresh 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.590
 oh so it comes within the whole 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.319
 not a single new move to play 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.180
 cool but of course it is in such a 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.970
 not only fight but also fight 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.410
 to explore the world take a look 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:00.880
 this great world 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.959
 so many things to explore and sonic 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.330
 boom comes with four different ones 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.880
 Characters naturally play sonic 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.739
 tails knuckles and amy each character 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.650
 has different skills here 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.330
 in the fight as well as on the vmworld sonic 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.110
 Can this speed passages here 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.819
 to walk along 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.680
 partly can with these mini robots 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.780
 Obstacles destroying knuckles can 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.400
 climb up walls and amy can 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.260
 balancing tight passages 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.970
 that's pretty much the best thing about 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.739
 if it is not always so 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.049
 obviously everyone what you are doing 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.000
 Funnily, that must have me 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.160
 passages in which it best suits 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.569
 I'm a little faster 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.790
 I'm not even a big sonic fans 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.560
 the only sonic game I ever had 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.269
 What did his cinemas do? 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.370
 somehow I expected that 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.870
 game is similar here but it is 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.940
 just something completely different 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.590
 Although you can find it everywhere at vmworld 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.420
 rings and any robot parts 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.459
 but they do not bring anything in one 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.010
 one can acquire thereby upgrade 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.510
 but honestly you do not need that 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.760
 and now comes the hammer 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.650
 There is one useful thing in the game 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.209
 you can upgrade through this 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.459
 upgrade twice as many rings with you 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.489
 wear and that would really help here 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.049
 and how do you get this upgrade by 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.239
 to get the 3ds version with the wii u 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.130
 version connects how else should one 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.079
 that's getting sad that's it 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.100
 only useful extra feature with 40 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.560
 should cost euro 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.609
 if you have not noticed, I 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.680
 hate this game 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.970
 it is boring and you notice that 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.960
 either too little time for developers 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.490
 was given 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.889
 or that they themselves at all 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.300
 no effort but have not put in 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.889
 Everything about this game is bad 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.930
 here something at least not quite 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.090
 so bad is the developer have on 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.680
 some really good ideas make the 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.180
 fight against shuttle for example is 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.639
 pretty cool but not three times 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.410
 one after another this ground puzzle here 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.760
 is actually quite cool but not 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.490
 five times in a row 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.870
 this water fight is great but not 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.790
 ten times in a row 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.170
 I honestly do not know why that 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.640
 Developers thought that the player 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.680
 always want to play the same and 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.010
 the mainly within a few seconds 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.700
 but they just did it 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.930
 the game is not graphic either 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.760
 really something special 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.170
 Some have said that 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.940
 play with the exception of the higher resolution 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.220
 as well as a game cube game looks like though 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.350
 I would not go that far 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.720
 it does not look okay anymore and not 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.790
 less definitely one of the stronger ones 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.740
 sides of the game also the soundtrack 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.900
 is one of the positive sides of the game 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.150
 that too is not really good though 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.490
 after all not bad but one 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.310
 really good thing has the game laser 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.170
 Lasers are always epic if everything 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.970
 others at the game shit is then save 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.650
 at least that's what you do 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.920
 sonic boom but liked the best 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.440
 that's the end because then it's just 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:40.600
 over makes sense 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.580
 or I'm grad ne na.de stamp 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.740
 let make 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.720
 where is there automata epic fail 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.980
 I'm only here yes like my level 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.690
 picture jolo 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.300
 Actually, the video is over 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.500
 you shit what a I go now 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.060
 again the round on the sidewalk 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.160
 the carriage act and there are a few 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.170
 people obama I have absolutely no 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.580
 idea what I'm talking about'm holding purpose 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.940
 and you are not you idiot with 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:08.820
 enrollment background keen 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:12.760
 foto eso it geil ugly peter boudgoust 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:15.490
 self like athlete's foot stress her stallion 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.910
 snowden that was already sonic 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.200
 boom 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.670
 I really could not do much for the game 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.290
 win and I think that one has 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.970
 quite good if it is you 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.500
 I would have liked it anyway 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.000
 me as always very much about one 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.560
 thumbs up when you see more 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.270
 I want to give you two videos 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.190
 recommend on the left side could 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.990
 I call you something to call of duty advanced 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.580
 warfighter recommend what my special 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.500
 wait for the twentieth birthday 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.120
 really worth seeing on the 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.800
 on the right side we have a video that 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.350
 possibly on drugs was created and 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.700
 Although top 5 tastiest pokemon otherwise 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:47.100
 Let's see you next time 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.100
 then bite again and look
