00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.850 
of south park I think that's sort of an
artificial<00:03:02.360> device<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:03.140> many<00:03:03.319> people<00:03:03.620> know

about the show is it something about
sort<00:03:06.980> of<00:03:07.069> authority<00:03:07.310> has<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.090> be<00:03:08.239> rational<00:03:09.019> or

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
sort of authority has to be rational or

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.080 
sort of authority has to be rational or
you<00:03:09.739> have<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.010> kind<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.190> derive<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.760> lesson
