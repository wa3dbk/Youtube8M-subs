okay<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.280> remove<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.149> nubs<00:00:03.389> on<00:00:03.720> cranks<00:00:04.500> we're

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
okay to remove the nubs on cranks we're

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.830 
okay to remove the nubs on cranks we're
going<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.640> use<00:00:06.290> angle<00:00:07.290> grinder<00:00:09.860> earmuffs<00:00:10.860> and

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
going to use angle grinder earmuffs and

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.070 
going to use angle grinder earmuffs and
some<00:00:12.840> glasses<00:00:14.089> it's<00:00:15.089> going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.330> help<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.870> have

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
some glasses it's going to help to have

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.050 
some glasses it's going to help to have
an<00:00:16.289> angle<00:00:16.680> grinder<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:17.490> already<00:00:17.880> has<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
an angle grinder that already has a

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.090 
an angle grinder that already has a
somewhat<00:00:18.449> worn<00:00:18.750> wheel<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.380> edge<00:00:19.500> gets<00:00:19.859> kind

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
somewhat worn wheel the edge gets kind

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.939 
somewhat worn wheel the edge gets kind
of<00:00:20.279> rounded<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:21.510> helps<00:00:21.840> for<00:00:21.990> grinding<00:00:22.439> if

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
of rounded that helps for grinding if

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.259 
of rounded that helps for grinding if
you<00:00:23.070> got<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.220> little<00:00:23.340> rounded<00:00:23.730> edge<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.060> there

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
you got a little rounded edge on there

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.170 
you got a little rounded edge on there
so<00:00:25.140> hopefully<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.250> one<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.789> been<00:00:26.939> used

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
so hopefully you have one it's been used

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.259 
so hopefully you have one it's been used
quite<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.140> bit<00:00:28.279> that<00:00:29.279> way<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.760> just<00:00:29.789> makes<00:00:30.179> it

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
quite a bit that way it just makes it

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.889 
quite a bit that way it just makes it
easier<00:00:30.570> for<00:00:30.779> sliding<00:00:31.349> around<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.719> it's<00:00:33.719> also

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
easier for sliding around so it's also

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.720 
easier for sliding around so it's also
important<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.649> you're<00:00:34.980> not<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> hold

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
important that you're not going to hold

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.819 
important that you're not going to hold
it<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.149> place<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> long<00:00:37.079> time<00:00:37.350> otherwise

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
it in place for a long time otherwise

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.930 
it in place for a long time otherwise
you're<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.160> heat<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.579> metal<00:00:38.670> and

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
you're going to heat up the metal and

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.630 
you're going to heat up the metal and
probably<00:00:39.239> screw<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:39.719> powder<00:00:39.930> coating<00:00:40.350> or

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
probably screw up your powder coating or

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.930 
probably screw up your powder coating or
whatever<00:00:41.640> kind<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> paint<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.239> out<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.480> there

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
whatever kind of paint you out on there

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:53.900 
whatever kind of paint you out on there
so<00:00:51.199> you're<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.320> gonna<00:00:52.530> run<00:00:53.190> across<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.760> like

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
so you're just gonna run across it like

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.689 
so you're just gonna run across it like
this<00:00:56.629> I'm<00:00:57.629> also<00:00:57.899> keeping<00:00:58.320> my<00:00:58.680> crank<00:00:59.190> bolts<00:00:59.520> in

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
this I'm also keeping my crank bolts in

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.000 
this I'm also keeping my crank bolts in
because<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.780> don't<00:01:00.899> want<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.289> grind<00:01:01.500> down<00:01:01.770> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
because you don't want to grind down to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.119 
because you don't want to grind down to
the<00:01:02.100> point<00:01:02.399> where<00:01:02.699> you're<00:01:03.799> you<00:01:04.799> don't<00:01:04.949> want<00:01:05.070> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
the point where you're you don't want to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.280 
the point where you're you don't want to
take<00:01:05.220> them<00:01:05.339> out<00:01:05.489> grind<00:01:06.270> down<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.900> then<00:01:06.990> find

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
take them out grind down and then find

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.020 
take them out grind down and then find
out<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.710> your<00:01:07.830> crank<00:01:08.100> bolts<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:08.580> sticking

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
out that your crank bolts are sticking

00:01:09.030 --> 00:03:30.720 
out that your crank bolts are sticking
out<00:01:09.150> because<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.510> grind<00:01:09.720> down<00:01:09.930> too<00:01:10.200> low

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.900 

okay<00:03:31.730> so<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:32.750> is<00:03:32.930> our<00:03:33.080> progress<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:33.830> far<00:03:33.910> this

is about as far as I want to grind mine

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.670 
is about as far as I want to grind mine
down<00:03:36.470> so<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:38.450> clean<00:03:38.720> up<00:03:38.900> this<00:03:39.080> stuff<00:03:39.380> on<00:03:39.590> the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
once with the angle grinder around the

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.210 
once with the angle grinder around the
sides<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:44.750> kind<00:03:44.930> of<00:03:44.960> an<00:03:45.080> angle<00:03:45.380> kind<00:03:45.920> of<00:03:45.980> clean

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
sides it kind of an angle kind of clean

00:03:46.220 --> 00:04:10.480 
sides it kind of an angle kind of clean

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.790 

okay<00:04:11.240> so<00:04:11.300> we<00:04:11.570> took<00:04:11.750> our<00:04:11.930> nub<00:04:12.230> comes<00:04:12.590> something

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
okay so we took our nub comes something

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.120 
okay so we took our nub comes something
about<00:04:13.040> like<00:04:13.370> that<00:04:14.680> does<00:04:15.680> something<00:04:15.830> about

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
about like that does something about

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.280 
about like that does something about
like<00:04:16.340> that<00:04:16.580> that's<00:04:17.209> pretty<00:04:17.780> much<00:04:17.900> all<00:04:18.140> there

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
like that that's pretty much all there

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.860 
like that that's pretty much all there
is<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:18.620> it<00:04:18.970> kind<00:04:19.970> of<00:04:20.030> rounded<00:04:20.330> the<00:04:20.420> edges<00:04:20.450> on

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
is to it kind of rounded the edges on

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.770 
is to it kind of rounded the edges on
their<00:04:21.670> made<00:04:22.670> it<00:04:22.790> look<00:04:22.910> nicer<00:04:23.300> so<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:24.410> it's<00:04:24.530> done
