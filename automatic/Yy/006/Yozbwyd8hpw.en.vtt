00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:05.390
 Nine people in this short video would like 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.700
 i the compatibility of the new songs 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.710
 coffee capsules in the de'longhi 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.309
 lattissima plus nespresso machine 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.590
 test 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.019
 encapsulate the lidl coffee there since 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.770
 short for 1 euro 99 per pack too 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:21.200
 I buy ready in this part of the test 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.530
 an espresso with 40 milliliters of water 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.330
 to the coffee capsule itself consists of 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.190
 plastic and has an aluminum bottom 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.790
 Close the most again 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.560
 alternatives to nespresso 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.460
 in the lattissima plus works 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.530
 perfect 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.210
 The lock lever is easy to handle 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.210
 and close without violence 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:52.630
 also the coffee outlet is impeccable 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.630
 there are no dribbles 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.390
 it is already obvious that I am 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:08.570
 Also a nice chandler on the espresso 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:10.909
 So here we once have it 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.780
 pro espresso result can be quite 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.200
 let see 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:20.570
 beautiful climate beautiful espresso the cup 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.130
 is also very well filled already now 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.360
 whether the coffee capsule too 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.649
 ejected properly 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.090
 as you may have heard, that is 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.140
 coffee capsule now here in the 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.640
 Storage container for the life 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.710
 Coffee pods like that's ever 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.390
 very well 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.490
 the coffee capsule was clean 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.740
 stuck and did not 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.259
 deforms the compatibility with the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.810
 lattissima plus de'longhi is thus 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:50.149
 also perfect if you like this video 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.640
