00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:14.210 
I'm gonna play a TED green copy page
today<00:00:09.139> called<00:00:10.139> on<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.380> clear<00:00:10.740> day<00:00:11.870> that<00:00:13.220> pages

today called on a clear day that pages
4v2<00:00:15.059> comping<00:00:16.019> on<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.260> top<00:00:16.439> four<00:00:16.710> strings<00:00:16.769> so

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
4v2 comping on the top four strings so

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.589 
4v2 comping on the top four strings so
there's<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.430> lot<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.760> movement<00:00:17.970> along<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:18.599 
there's a lot of movement along the

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.760 
there's a lot of movement along the
board<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:20.660> get<00:00:21.660> right<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.080> I'll<00:00:22.380> play<00:00:22.619> it

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
board and get right to it I'll play it

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.840 
board and get right to it I'll play it
for<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.400> simple<00:00:23.930> sustained<00:00:24.930> way<00:00:25.850> and

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
for you in a simple sustained way and

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.099 
for you in a simple sustained way and
then<00:00:27.029> I'll<00:00:27.119> show<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.449> variation<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:28.080> it

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
then I'll show you a variation on it

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.650 
then I'll show you a variation on it
okay<00:00:28.850> so<00:00:29.850> here<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.000> go<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> key<00:00:30.630> of

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
okay so here we go it's in the key of

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.270 
okay so here we go it's in the key of
a-flat<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:32.539> this<00:00:33.539> guitar<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.079> tuned<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
a-flat and this guitar is tuned to a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:02:01.149 
a-flat and this guitar is tuned to a
regular<00:00:36.210> pitch<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:37.500> two<00:00:38.130> three<00:00:38.970> four

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.340 

okay<00:02:01.700> there's<00:02:02.329> an<00:02:02.509> alternative<00:02:03.049> to<00:02:03.109> that

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
okay there's an alternative to that

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:19.710 
okay there's an alternative to that
ending<00:02:03.740> so<00:02:04.009> am<00:02:04.130> i<00:02:04.280> from<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.780> last<00:02:06.319> line

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.770 

that's<00:02:20.260> very<00:02:20.440> nice<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:21.099> lot<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.879> very<00:02:22.239> beautiful

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
that's very nice a lot of very beautiful

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.780 
that's very nice a lot of very beautiful
voice<00:02:22.989> leading<00:02:23.290> if<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.739> listen<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.190> what's

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
voice leading if you listen to what's

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.570 
voice leading if you listen to what's
happening<00:02:25.180> often<00:02:25.450> on<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.810> B<00:02:26.019> string<00:02:26.580> there

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
happening often on the B string there

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.610 
happening often on the B string there
are<00:02:27.730> some<00:02:27.879> subtle<00:02:28.120> changes<00:02:28.269> going<00:02:28.900> on<00:02:29.110> on<00:02:29.349> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
are some subtle changes going on on the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.399 
are some subtle changes going on on the
B<00:02:29.799> string<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:31.180> most<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.629> the<00:02:31.720> melody<00:02:32.110> stuff

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
B string the most of the melody stuff

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.020 
B string the most of the melody stuff
that<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.680> perceive<00:02:33.099> right<00:02:33.370> off<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.700> bat<00:02:33.849> is

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
that you perceive right off the bat is

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.809 
that you perceive right off the bat is
on<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.330> top<00:02:34.569> string<00:02:34.959> obviously<00:02:35.830> but<00:02:36.610> if<00:02:36.700> you

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
on the top string obviously but if you

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.000 
on the top string obviously but if you
once<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.810> learn<00:02:38.019> it<00:02:38.049> you<00:02:38.410> listen<00:02:38.620> carefully

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
once you learn it you listen carefully

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.830 
once you learn it you listen carefully
to<00:02:39.400> what's<00:02:39.549> going<00:02:39.790> on<00:02:39.940> on<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.180> especially<00:02:40.810> the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
to what's going on on the especially the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.830 
to what's going on on the especially the
B<00:02:41.110> string<00:02:41.440> but<00:02:41.680> all<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.010> rest<00:02:42.129> of<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.400> strings

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
B string but all the rest of the strings

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.360 
B string but all the rest of the strings
you'll<00:02:43.840> see<00:02:44.110> that<00:02:44.230> there's<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.500> great<00:02:44.890> logic

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
you'll see that there's a great logic

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.229 
you'll see that there's a great logic
and<00:02:45.910> flow<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.329> this<00:02:46.629> thing<00:02:47.220> okay<00:02:48.220> now<00:02:48.940> it's

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
and flow to this thing okay now it's

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.949 
and flow to this thing okay now it's
possible<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.810> Ted<00:02:50.200> was<00:02:51.299> listening<00:02:52.299> also<00:02:52.450> in

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
possible that Ted was listening also in

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.930 
possible that Ted was listening also in
addition<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.530> being<00:02:54.069> familiar<00:02:54.370> with<00:02:54.640> the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
addition to being familiar with the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.199 
addition to being familiar with the

Johnny<00:03:04.150> Smith<00:03:04.390> even<00:03:04.720> they<00:03:05.140> they<00:03:05.500> all<00:03:05.650> did

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
Johnny Smith even they they all did

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.500 
Johnny Smith even they they all did
versions<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.579> most<00:03:06.790> of<00:03:06.970> them<00:03:07.090> were<00:03:07.239> quite

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
versions and most of them were quite

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.170 
versions and most of them were quite
swinging<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:08.410> this<00:03:08.950> too<00:03:09.190> lends<00:03:09.519> itself<00:03:09.879> quite

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
swinging and this too lends itself quite

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.289 
swinging and this too lends itself quite
nicely<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.810> that<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:11.680> I'm<00:03:11.980> gonna<00:03:12.069> play<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.519> with

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
nicely to that so I'm gonna play it with

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.140 
nicely to that so I'm gonna play it with
a<00:03:13.329> little<00:03:13.629> bit<00:03:13.750> more<00:03:13.930> of<00:03:14.109> a<00:03:14.200> copy<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:18.150> of

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
a little bit more of a copy and of

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.270 
a little bit more of a copy and of
course<00:03:19.390> this<00:03:19.510> is<00:03:19.660> my<00:03:19.810> interpretation<00:03:20.109> of<00:03:20.769> what

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
course this is my interpretation of what

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.659 
course this is my interpretation of what
I<00:03:21.609> think<00:03:21.970> perhaps<00:03:22.900> Ted<00:03:23.319> might<00:03:23.560> have<00:03:23.799> liked<00:03:24.069> to

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
I think perhaps Ted might have liked to

00:03:24.669 --> 00:04:32.260 
I think perhaps Ted might have liked to
play<00:03:25.569> on<00:03:25.840> this<00:03:26.099> too<00:03:27.099> the<00:03:27.940> one<00:03:28.150> two<00:03:28.630> three<00:03:29.200> four

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.270 

okay<00:04:33.270> I<00:04:33.690> made<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.350> few<00:04:34.560> little<00:04:34.800> boo-boos<00:04:35.130> in

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
okay I made a few little boo-boos in

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.120 
okay I made a few little boo-boos in
there<00:04:35.460> but<00:04:35.760> I<00:04:36.060> think<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:36.420> get<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.570> idea

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
there but I think you get the idea

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.130 
there but I think you get the idea
it's<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.450> good<00:04:39.810> idea<00:04:40.140> if<00:04:40.410> you<00:04:40.440> don't<00:04:41.990> have<00:04:42.990> all

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
it's a good idea if you don't have all

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.230 
it's a good idea if you don't have all
of<00:04:43.320> these<00:04:43.440> voicings<00:04:44.040> on<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.430> middle<00:04:44.730> set<00:04:45.000> I

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
of these voicings on the middle set I

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.920 
of these voicings on the middle set I
would<00:04:46.200> write<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.620> whole<00:04:46.770> thing<00:04:47.040> out<00:04:47.930> exactly

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
would write the whole thing out exactly

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.840 
would write the whole thing out exactly
this<00:04:49.200> with<00:04:49.710> these<00:04:49.890> voicings<00:04:50.400> but<00:04:50.640> on<00:04:50.730> the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
this with these voicings but on the

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.690 
this with these voicings but on the
middle<00:04:51.150> set<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.450> strings<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.050> then<00:04:52.860> perhaps

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
middle set of strings and then perhaps

the song and see what he was doing with

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
little bit more about the way Ted might

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.100 
little bit more about the way Ted might
think<00:05:31.560> about<00:05:31.620> this<00:05:31.919> thing<00:05:32.180> okay<00:05:33.180> the<00:05:34.080> other

thing<00:05:34.290> you<00:05:34.500> can<00:05:34.650> do<00:05:34.770> is<00:05:35.040> use<00:05:35.700> some<00:05:35.940> of<00:05:36.060> these

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
thing you can do is use some of these

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.350 
thing you can do is use some of these
voicings<00:05:36.660> as<00:05:36.840> a<00:05:36.870> sort<00:05:37.200> of<00:05:37.290> swinging<00:05:37.680> trio

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
voicings as a sort of swinging trio

voicings as a sort of swinging trio
approach<00:05:39.360> you<00:05:39.960> might<00:05:39.990> I'm<00:05:40.350> gonna<00:05:40.470> try<00:05:40.710> this

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
approach you might I'm gonna try this

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.350 
approach you might I'm gonna try this
just<00:05:41.010> off<00:05:41.220> the<00:05:41.370> top<00:05:41.520> of<00:05:41.580> my<00:05:41.700> head<00:05:41.880> see<00:05:42.060> if<00:05:42.150> I<00:05:42.210> can

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
just off the top of my head see if I can

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.540 
just off the top of my head see if I can
do<00:05:42.510> it
