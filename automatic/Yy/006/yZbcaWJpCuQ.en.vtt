00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.519
 Now all are looking for a new episode of 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.639
 five things minecraft you do not yet 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.080
 knew this time is a very good one 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.880
 thing here because I somehow so 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.010
 inwardly one celebrates in the ultra awesome 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.150
 then come right at the beginning and he 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.529
 could again rate how of how 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.880
 many things you already knew 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.740
 Write 10 comments and if you have the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.000
 after checking in via youtube happy 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.359
 end if they are good they come off 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.070
 and let's go the first thing is like this 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.750
 a kind I hope that speaks one 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.579
 so if you have a hatch on one 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.050
 rail and puts in it 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.670
 So that the angel on the floor of the lore 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.500
 looks and the angel ejects danilo 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.760
 broken and you bake them in the ground 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.290
 so to say like a hidden one 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.460
 secret entrance but that is somehow 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.050
 been extremely genial have the Sun 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.460
 celebrated I do that too I set 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.789
 meet me here once with the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.430
 fishing rod 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.079
 and suddenly I'm downstairs 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.899
 through the fallen through the wall 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.879
 that is full of genius secret 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.350
 at the beginning hides without doors and so you 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.149
 he can just so through the wall 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.920
 through and that is still completely legal so 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.879
 I have this only for example 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.559
 not just a layer 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.970
 earth that because the rails let him 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.369
 that minecraft puts me on top of it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.900
 purely right click and drive once 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.689
 completely lied by course 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.580
 broken is clear but that will pass away here 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.810
 as the entrance at all tells me 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.680
 not the first animal I celebrate 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.689
 that the next one is from v videos 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.850
 for all and that piston can 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.869
 apparently no science move 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.220
 and as she wrote that 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.990
 must be complicated explained the first 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.310
 ski pistes then made block and one 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.659
 sign over but it works without it 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.799
 this blog as just that one 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.170
 tries to sign with slopes 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.150
 different and is mainly 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.159
 nice I actually expected 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.460
 this works because knowledge can 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.140
 move almost everything except obsidian 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.430
 Rangers do not even know if it works or not 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.500
 not one of what I am or stoves 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.090
 something of it was still and 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.549
 supply vessels against so 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.200
 signs like he like picture frames for 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.149
 I finally follow me 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.710
 she is still being moved 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.149
 Could not seem like the case is us 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.829
 just test out a warning sign 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.850
 implemented and yes no one can 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.860
 signs I move something else 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.049
 expected said why tested too 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.000
 always that too well out too well 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.609
 found but I can mention it 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.499
 I knew completely 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:15.120
 the next thing is from the ultra hd 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.590
 and he writes when you tap 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.879
 and then you can not get a number 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.290
 move and, firstly, it is not quite true 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.209
 but somehow it surprised me 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.560
 I tried it because I like it 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.349
 could not imagine if not 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.560
 footprints and how once I can still 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.329
 run if not imprints and the 2 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.799
 I can still walk though 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.480
 only to the side and back 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.849
 sometimes hurts nothing happens 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.349
 Interestingly, if not from and the 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.430
 I can push three backwards too 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.719
 but run right to left 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.090
 also not forward if the 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.310
 bridge nothing happens if not off and 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.870
 then I can press the four again 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.609
 all directions are running at the same time 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.750
 keep it pressed I'll try 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.159
 Do not know why that's for 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.719
 want to be key combination or 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.099
 Anything else I can not 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:54.989
 explain why you when you tap 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.060
 and two or three keep it pressed 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.319
 can not run forward but to the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.139
 look backwards 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.090
 the holds is for me that's one 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.560
 somehow this is a bug and 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.090
 worth mentioning is sure it has me 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.090
 it does not surprise that crazy 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.389
 spectacular what but what surprised it 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.180
 worth it, why is that the next one? 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:17.909
 thing is shooter knowledge playground 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.319
 and when you're at the bottom of the minecraft world 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.669
 placed a torch on the floor 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.590
 the top holds box more facts 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:24.000
 this connects with the 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.280
 invisible wall there we see already 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.599
 shown that here in the area pretty much 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.739
 everything crazy plays must to bake 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.329
 the last one also about ten times 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.099
 big like to look in older episodes 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.169
 There are some great interesting ones 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.629
 things in there but now comes in wiso 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.549
 the sticking point and specifically here too 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.379
 but turned to us at 30 block 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.290
 by flying can stop over and over again 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.120
 at 007 something I do not do that 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.060
 a bit too exaggerated when I do that 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.949
 could yes and that follows the likes 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.500
 to make visible to the invisible wall 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:56.579
 He makes that up to her 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.889
 is stuck and the wall came here on this 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.299
 you make fashion visible 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.430
 can not be nimble either 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.259
 somehow such barrier blogs for otherwise 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.969
 to let know from the new 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:08.639
 version still the only five legacy 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:10.439
 not yet but you really can 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.329
 sound through but you can do it 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.979
 that means these invisible ones 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.019
 blocks act somehow as well 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.620
 connections for torches from which 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.690
 always found 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.329
 I think it's funny that they are for 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.770
 But the blocks behave like a barrier 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.439
 here you can torch sunday 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.840
 interesting and the last thing for 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:29.550
 Today is signed for Crayon M &amp; C 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.409
 He found out that one 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.110
 experience bottles can continue to throw 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.710
 as a flash special effects my that 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.659
 is now a bit too 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:42.180
 simple but why why fly models 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.819
 continue on the chan thing as passions ob 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.710
 For example, so I out of the grave 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:48.479
 I think the same always the 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.930
 fly over it still cares about where 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:54.990
 we fly it to the very edge 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.069
 that's why I fall exactly the fly 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.169
 The front in about the 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:01.080
 reach the leagues with fish 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.270
 if the kag had already come from before 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.120
 not so far loose here in the 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.690
 blog earlier and the farmer's changing 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.520
 Sounds a lot further behind why none 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.180
 That's right, that's why there is 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.560
 with pure 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.139
 I am also surprised a bit 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.639
 he should not really know that 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.099
 equals but actually exists 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.469
 difference in the throwing distance of motion 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:25.229
 to the bodies of on the water of jennings 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:26.729
 no post that is clear but in principle 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.469
 the effect should be the same 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.889
 but somehow you are in panic 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:32.969
 bottles actually continues to look 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.740
 makes German different flies 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.979
 still a whole block down and down 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.710
 the motion young place lands here 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.440
 on it and the model down here it is yes 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.339
 okay okay 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.020
 that would be it already 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:47.699
 this follow and you have to say 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.650
 So the thing with the mainka 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:53.250
 that was the first cream I find interest 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.270
 so that's because i find the good one i do 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.889
 will you like it is suitable 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.520
 perfect for secret entrances or 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:01.529
 Other things that nobody else can get 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.940
 and yes then brings to watch how 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.979
 said how much did you write 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.479
 comments and who has ideas so synonymous 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.830
 are awesome as for example first go 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.839
 Send this thing to serve 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.520
 If I see her then just take it 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.210
 go through that and then good will 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.849
 Leave a Comment 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.990
 and then seven more bad bank for 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.990
 watch and do it well
