bounces<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.560> up<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.160> little<00:01:31.520> bit<00:01:31.640> faster<00:01:32.740> let's

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
bounces a up a little bit faster let's

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.330 
bounces a up a little bit faster let's
let's<00:01:33.950> try<00:01:34.070> that<00:01:34.190> again<00:01:38.500> all<00:01:39.500> right<00:01:39.680> that's

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
let's try that again all right that's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.880 
let's try that again all right that's
