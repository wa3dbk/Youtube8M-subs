00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.759
 frankly good of his newspaper geek 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.600
 it's anne and today I want 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.980
 represent the samsung galaxy camera 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.029
 as you can see here we have 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.890
 the impression that it's just a simple 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.330
 smartphone and by the way when we 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.460
 compare for example to a galaxy s iii 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.910
 can see that it's pretty much the same 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.099
 cut 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.619
 the small difference already in terms of 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.450
 android level is to discover that 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.280
 the buttons here have become virtual 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.940
 while we still have the buttons 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.660
 Sensitive on the galaxy 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.800
 on this side we discover the apn all 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.600
 which is classic with a 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.879
 a wide-angle zoom of 23 millimeters in 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.379
 wide angle and an optical zoom forgiveness of 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.800
 21 years old so you can not imagine had 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.649
 the extent 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.210
 they could already see the 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.720
 difference in size between a simple 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.770
 smartphone 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.910
 and apn under android at the apn 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.850
 doubt there they are very strong since 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.650
 it is an apn under android 4.1 jelly bean 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.960
 so with and sheep you recognize 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.820
 so the way is pretty classic because 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.130
 android connected under gingham or 3 giants 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.110
 of ath only and not in 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.370
 mode by voice words which can not 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.250
 to call with it is a little pity that 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.990
 I do not have with a subscription 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.040
 additional resources that would allow 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.780
 take pictures sharing 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.190
 video all this is a bit that's a 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.770
 little damage 300 g 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.840
 it's a little heavy I confess by cons in 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.070
 After barely grip it 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.830
 perfect since there was a trigger 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.810
 the zoom ring the chronicle is very 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.610
 nice power button 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.900
 here the flash is pretty basic but 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.540
 which is still a lot more 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.260
 powerful than what we have and then here 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.330
 the famous of the famous zoom ring 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.270
 which zooms in to zoom out to 21 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.610
 hours is here in terms of interface 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.370
 photo it's pretty classic we find 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.950
 the famous focus seem pretty fast 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.020
 that we can see coming I had a 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.530
 model that was a bit more a bit more 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.209
 slow but otherwise 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.440
 goodbye that it works very well and 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.350
 in us and we take a picture in 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.480
 makes a little son 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.270
 here is the video recording in full hd 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.620
 if you have your menu with a shape 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.110
 options as the flashes 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.470
 video the video mode etc here the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.330
 different modes so the famous fashion 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.470
 post the expert mode is quite funny 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.700
 because 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.890
 you will see that you can all 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.410
 control so if he was you by 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.860
 example in manual mode 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.190
 propose may adjust opening time 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.190
 shutter 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.660
 forgiveness exposure it is foolish to 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.780
 end 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.970
 science note that in havoc mode that on 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.190
 the opening water that will play is so in 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.330
 fashion play also same thing there you have 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.660
 plus an action on the exposure and the 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.850
 climb or not this can be iso 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.530
 go out now 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.290
 6 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.290
 return to this mode all auto and see 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.000
 we will hear about split then 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.829
 necessarily with a video on a video 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.519
 bass was not great but there we see 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.519
 well the thing 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.720
 so 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.819
 next door we find the gallery 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.800
 so this is a gallery here in display 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.480
 to the photographers etc the facts evoked 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.569
 this same gallery under android have 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.230
 not enough to go back here on android 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.740
 by pressing the button home button 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.330
 home 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.010
 allows you to access the gallery 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.050
 simply 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.790
 so 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.260
 limit it's true that I had seen in 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.900
 some comments that it was good 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.290
 to have a stylus and on it I'm 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.290
 totally 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.959
 we find inevitably since it android 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.300
 is completely compatible google close on 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.340
 find in this case serious facebook that 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.660
 it's a choice now is it 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.730
 you are ready to see 300 grams in 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.900
 your pocket to remind his sitting to 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.970
 see you 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.440
 so there 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.210
 android all that is classic one 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.790
 restart the application 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.640
 with now also sepia effects 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.070
 negative to the sunshine state support is at 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.330
 his boxes 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.859
 here I think I pretty much did 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.479
 round 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.540
 the atrium which really bothered me 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.150
 it was going to happen that something else 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.300
 now as a second we will say 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.620
 smartphone pmp apn it may be the 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.400
 do especially saint-aignan and sensor of 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.670
 16 megapixels 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.290
 the stuff and and in my opinion it's rather 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.690
 wait to see the pictures but that 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.849
 meanwhile should get out a 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.529
 simple it's huge 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.699
 than a simple smartphone 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:46.600
 I saw in the comments you 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.690
 compare these families 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.400
 genk six cameras in pure view did not 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.540
 not quite sure we're left when 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.300
 even huh 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.190
 a smartphone with a 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.470
 with 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.820
 very very big sensor and function 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.460
 cropping 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.900
 personally I am not persuaded that 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.320
 the function then be the best 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.450
 solution 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.580
 I still prefer to have a course with 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.449
 less pixels world but with a real 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.360
 optical zone and on it 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.189
 because 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.050
 the idea there I think in the future 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:16.240
 I would have wanted a zoom range a 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.810
 little less strong 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.750
 as a 4.5- fold zoom ranging from 25 to 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.750
 125 m it should normally be sufficient 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:30.050
 largely in terms of bit rate at 2 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.280
 quoted in everyday life 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.390
 so these questions do not hesitate I 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.400
 Thank you very much for your attention 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.640
 and soon after on the geek newspaper 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.640
