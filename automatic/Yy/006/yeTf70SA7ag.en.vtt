way as long as you take four weeks off
every<00:01:59.920> have<00:02:00.220> four<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.610> ten<00:02:00.789> weeks<00:02:00.970> I<00:02:01.240> think

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
every have four to ten weeks I think

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.130 
every have four to ten weeks I think
you're<00:02:01.929> in<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.020> good<00:02:02.140> spot<00:02:02.580> protease<00:02:04.140> that

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
you're in a good spot protease that

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.870 
you're in a good spot protease that
helps<00:02:05.410> you<00:02:05.470> digest<00:02:05.590> protein<00:02:06.190> it's<00:02:06.340> an<00:02:06.490> enzyme

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
helps you digest protein it's an enzyme

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.650 
helps you digest protein it's an enzyme
not<00:02:07.479> a<00:02:07.509> bad<00:02:07.810> thing<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.619> include<00:02:09.039> in<00:02:09.160> here<00:02:09.660> next

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
not a bad thing to include in here next

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.010 
not a bad thing to include in here next
up<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:11.290> have<00:02:12.060> yeah<00:02:13.060> actually<00:02:13.270> if<00:02:13.599> you<00:02:13.690> look<00:02:13.720> at

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
up you have yeah actually if you look at

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.930 
up you have yeah actually if you look at
what<00:02:14.140> they<00:02:14.319> but<00:02:14.560> they<00:02:14.740> say<00:02:14.950> support<00:02:15.670> healthy

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
what they but they say support healthy

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.080 
what they but they say support healthy
glucose<00:02:16.300> metabolism<00:02:16.480> muscle<00:02:17.410> tissue<00:02:17.590> and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
glucose metabolism muscle tissue and

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.400 
glucose metabolism muscle tissue and
maximize<00:02:19.090> protein<00:02:19.569> utilization<00:02:20.170> throughout

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
maximize protein utilization throughout

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.520 
maximize protein utilization throughout
the<00:02:20.560> entire<00:02:20.890> body<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:22.569> way<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.319> know<00:02:23.410> it

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
the entire body that way you know it

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.990 
the entire body that way you know it
helps<00:02:23.560> you<00:02:23.830> utilize<00:02:24.190> your<00:02:24.340> protein<00:02:24.670> something

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
helps you utilize your protein something

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.190 
helps you utilize your protein something
it's<00:02:25.090> like<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.420> take<00:02:25.599> their<00:02:25.780> big<00:02:25.990> blood

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
it's like if you take their big blood

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.620 
it's like if you take their big blood
protein<00:02:26.680> powder<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.760> proteins<00:02:28.180> get<00:02:28.330> out<00:02:28.420> I

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
protein powder the proteins get out I

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.240 
protein powder the proteins get out I
take<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.560> enzymes<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.069> probiotics

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
take that just of enzymes and probiotics

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.059 
take that just of enzymes and probiotics
every<00:02:30.849> day<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:31.599> have<00:02:31.840> no<00:02:32.050> problem<00:02:32.319> would

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
every day so I have no problem would

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.890 
every day so I have no problem would
this<00:02:33.160> be<00:02:33.220> included<00:02:33.819> in<00:02:33.910> here<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.270> don't<00:02:34.720> see<00:02:34.870> it

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
this be included in here I don't see it

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.510 
this be included in here I don't see it
hinder<00:02:35.230> yet

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520

did verify that so calcium for day not a

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.890 
did verify that so calcium for day not a
bad<00:03:01.920> addition<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:02.490> product<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.630> DIA

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
bad addition to this product the DIA

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.480 
bad addition to this product the DIA
alone<00:03:04.380> i<00:03:04.530> think<00:03:04.770> is<00:03:04.860> enough<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.220> make<00:03:05.250> some

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
alone i think is enough to make some

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.880 
alone i think is enough to make some
damn<00:03:05.760> good<00:03:06.030> claims<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.780> be<00:03:07.260> while<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.440> think<00:03:07.740> da

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
damn good claims and be while I think da

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.010 
damn good claims and be while I think da
is<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.310> best<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.790> stop<00:03:09.030> mark<00:03:09.510> my<00:03:09.630> words<00:03:09.900> on

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
is the best to stop mark my words on

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.110 
is the best to stop mark my words on
this<00:03:10.140> da<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.070> best<00:03:11.280> testosterone<00:03:11.940> and

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
this da is the best testosterone and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.390 
this da is the best testosterone and
doggedness<00:03:13.050> testosterone<00:03:13.800> booster<00:03:14.100> on<00:03:14.130> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
doggedness testosterone booster on the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.700 
doggedness testosterone booster on the
market<00:03:14.760> right<00:03:14.790> now<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.360> it's<00:03:15.960> in<00:03:16.110> here<00:03:16.320> that

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
market right now and it's in here that

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.800 
market right now and it's in here that
alone<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.100> enough<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.940> add<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.330> some<00:03:18.600> cool

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
alone is enough you add in some cool

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.070 
alone is enough you add in some cool
thing<00:03:19.080> like<00:03:20.060> like<00:03:21.060> calcium<00:03:21.330> group<00:03:21.720> did<00:03:21.870> that's

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
thing like like calcium group did that's

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.960 
thing like like calcium group did that's
good<00:03:22.230> now<00:03:22.590> banaba<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.400> will<00:03:23.520> get<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.670> healthy

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
good now banaba it will get a healthy

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.330 
good now banaba it will get a healthy
glucose<00:03:24.270> levels<00:03:24.630> used<00:03:25.080> in<00:03:25.230> diabetes<00:03:25.590> used<00:03:26.250> to

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
glucose levels used in diabetes used to

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.370 
glucose levels used in diabetes used to
maintain<00:03:26.460> healthy<00:03:26.940> glucose<00:03:27.270> levels<00:03:27.720> along

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
maintain healthy glucose levels along

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.170 
maintain healthy glucose levels along
with<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.680> protease<00:03:29.130> i<00:03:29.430> think<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.000> good

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
with the protease i think is a good

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.300 
with the protease i think is a good
addition<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.660> testosterone<00:03:31.020> blend<00:03:32.010> here<00:03:32.160> in

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
addition of testosterone blend here in

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.610 
addition of testosterone blend here in
fact<00:03:33.000> I'd<00:03:33.270> likes<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.930> one<00:03:34.140> of<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.320> better

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
fact I'd likes it is one of the better

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.670 
fact I'd likes it is one of the better
