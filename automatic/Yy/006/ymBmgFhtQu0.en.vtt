00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello everyone mister this is today we 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.269
 playing maincraft game on version 1.5.1 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.280
 today I will also tell you about the key 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.519
 world generations that allow you 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.170
 find next to your spawn to us immediately 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.970
 two two things village and temple but all this 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.590
 find in the desert 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:35.940
 so we put the creative key with us 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:42.059
 oh ha here's so well about nothing 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.520
 the key will fit two things at once and here we are 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.770
 I thought that I had a friend 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.399
 who also plays maycroft at all 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.140
 zadrot shorter he and he likes he wants 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.230
 at least shoot reviews on mods 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.109
 but since what for what and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.309
 for some reason that he won't be able to 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.640
 to create your channel he asked to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 well he wrote reviews but sometimes he can 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.000
 together with me on fashion 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.549
 agreement to both allowed David 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.710
 agreed and now that is on our 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.869
 the channel will go out not only there but 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.970
 reviews letpley some but also reviews 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:26.880
 on fashion so here we wrap it up for everything 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.290
 said already spoke so and somewhere here 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.350
 there must be a village 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.350
 so here is the village on the left because the village is 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.640
 how is it called the temple and now we 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.829
 let's play this skinny skinny 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.810
 the devil because how would we his 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:52.700
 chased so so let's say something like this 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.700
 the village is average so medium sized 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.700
 there is 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.040
 we have as you see the blacksmith 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.990
 so there certainly is not a lot 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:15.040
 but for the first time armor enough for an apple 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:21.400
 three so now let's go on 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:24.250
 to rather to the temple here now I will show you 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.700
 as there should be close but no one 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.760
 is able 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.030
 for those who do not know how to this one if 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.100
 you break this one to fall but this one 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.540
 a piece of wool then you fall immediately on 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.660
 ladies dynamite on the stove 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.110
 so you break it here or here 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.660
 my break but here I stick up everywhere except 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.530
 blue can be broken here we have chests of 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:52.230
 wow that we have chests 2 diamonds 5s 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:57.840
 gold bars two iron bones 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.840
 rotten flesh bone four more gold 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.380
 insect death enchanted book oh yeah 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:08.650
 it's more than that but it's enough for you 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.959
 so let's say so here only bones like you 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.540
 would in principle be able to pick up more chests 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:17.890
 if you play survival can pick up 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.100
 dynamite see how much is 11 in my opinion 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.850
 dynamite 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:30.250
 can pick up 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:36.490
 so you fly flew well in principle 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:38.670
 everything seems to be nothing more than that 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.900
 narrate 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.910
 village well, as if this key I would say 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.890
 very suitable for exactly modes 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.030
 survival because here you appear 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:55.330
 where so in palm trees you dial there 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.640
 tree go here to the village well you know 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.860
 that the village temple nearby that is you 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.720
 you can settle as in the village so 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.610
 and in the temple 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.910
 because the temple is also possible to equip 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.420
 as housing and the more you have here and 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:14.290
 resources well what resources and up to 7 on 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:20.110
 everyones there is a full-fledged village 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:25.690
 there are merchants see such garbage 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:30.780
 sell well and that's all with you was 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.780
 mr red all good luck all bye
