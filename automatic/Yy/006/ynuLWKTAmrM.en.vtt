disaster late in 2008 my boys and I
decided<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:07.980> build<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.460> man<00:00:08.639> model<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.360> RMS

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
decided to build a man model of the RMS

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.140 
decided to build a man model of the RMS
Titanic<00:00:10.280> we<00:00:11.280> settled<00:00:11.610> on<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.759> scale<00:00:12.000> of

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
Titanic we settled on a scale of

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.030 
Titanic we settled on a scale of
approximately<00:00:12.750> 150th<00:00:13.410> which<00:00:13.590> made<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.889> about

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
approximately 150th which made it about

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.400 
approximately 150th which made it about
16<00:00:14.549> feet<00:00:14.790> long<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.780> we<00:00:15.870> made<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.139> slightly

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
16 feet long and we made it slightly

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.050 
16 feet long and we made it slightly
wider<00:00:16.770> than<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.070> should<00:00:17.250> have<00:00:17.369> been<00:00:17.520> at<00:00:17.789> about

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
wider than it should have been at about

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.599 
wider than it should have been at about
3<00:00:18.359> feet<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.779> order<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> bit<00:00:20.460> more

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
3 feet in order to have it be a bit more

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.859 
3 feet in order to have it be a bit more
stable<00:00:22.070> using<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.250> CAD<00:00:23.460> program<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.090> did<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> basic

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
stable using a CAD program I did a basic

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.839 
stable using a CAD program I did a basic
layout<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.320> all<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.590> dimensions<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.699> is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
layout of all the dimensions and this is

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.050 
layout of all the dimensions and this is
all<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.029> used<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.689> build<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> model<00:00:28.880> from<00:00:29.880> there

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
all I used to build the model from there

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.049 
all I used to build the model from there
I<00:00:30.090> got<00:00:30.929> sheets<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.859> plywood<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.520> joined<00:00:32.759> two

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
I got sheets of plywood and joined two

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.840 
I got sheets of plywood and joined two
for<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> bottom<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> 16<00:00:34.500> feet<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.130> then

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
for the bottom so a 16 feet and then

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.209 
for the bottom so a 16 feet and then
using<00:00:36.450> scarf<00:00:36.870> joints<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.410> created<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> sides

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
using scarf joints I created the sides

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.010 
using scarf joints I created the sides
of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> hull<00:00:38.790> joining<00:00:39.390> them<00:00:39.510> together<00:00:39.629> with

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
of the hull joining them together with

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.880 
of the hull joining them together with
some<00:00:40.559> adhesive<00:00:42.079> then<00:00:43.079> using<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> stitching

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
some adhesive then using the stitching

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.190 
some adhesive then using the stitching
glue<00:00:44.100> method<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.640> laid<00:00:45.000> our<00:00:45.239> created<00:00:45.840> most<00:00:46.079> of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
glue method I laid our created most of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.290 
glue method I laid our created most of
the<00:00:46.289> rest<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> hull<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.969> hull<00:00:48.149> went

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
the rest of the hull the hull went

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.930 
the rest of the hull the hull went
together<00:00:48.390> quite<00:00:48.750> rapidly<00:00:49.320> then<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.610> rest<00:00:50.789> of

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
together quite rapidly then the rest of

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.819 
together quite rapidly then the rest of
the<00:00:51.000> time<00:00:51.180> was<00:00:51.390> spent<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.079> details

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the time was spent on the details

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.650 
the time was spent on the details
themselves<00:00:53.520> such<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> funnels<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.510> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
a part of the stern where I had to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.140 
a part of the stern where I had to
create<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:08.070> tight<00:01:08.280> radius<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.909> create

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150

here's one of the funnels you can see
the<00:01:14.220> details<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.850> how<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> constructed<00:01:15.689> it

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the details of how I constructed it

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.859 
the details of how I constructed it
there's<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.530> motor<00:01:16.830> well<00:01:17.159> we<00:01:17.369> use<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
there's the motor well we use the

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.039 
there's the motor well we use the
trolling<00:01:18.869> motor<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.680> power<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.189> Titanic<00:01:20.729> I

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
trolling motor to to power the Titanic I

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.359 
trolling motor to to power the Titanic I
had<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.140> make<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.619> could<00:01:22.710> open<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.220> order

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
had to make it so it could open in order

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.920 
had to make it so it could open in order
to<00:01:23.490> fit<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.729> motor<00:01:24.000> down<00:01:24.240> inside<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.659> the

motor well then you can see here some of

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.510 
motor well then you can see here some of
the<00:01:27.930> details<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> rigging<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.220> all<00:01:29.310> this

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
the details of the rigging and all this

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.679 
the details of the rigging and all this
that<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.540> created<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> ship<00:01:32.270> we<00:01:33.270> did<00:01:33.479> quite

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
that I created for the ship we did quite

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.030 
that I created for the ship we did quite
a<00:01:33.750> bit<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.990> research<00:01:34.290> before<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.710> did<00:01:34.860> any

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
a bit of research before we did any

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.210 
a bit of research before we did any
painting<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.299> then<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.990> tried<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.680> do<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:37.950> best

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
painting and then we tried to do as best

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.890 
painting and then we tried to do as best
we<00:01:38.310> could<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.759> match<00:01:39.000> what<00:01:39.270> was<00:01:39.420> done<00:01:39.659> by<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
we could to match what was done by the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.530 
we could to match what was done by the
White<00:01:40.200> Star<00:01:40.470> Line<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:40.950> actual

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
White Star Line and the actual

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.350 
White Star Line and the actual
construction<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.750> Titanic<00:01:43.290> itself<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:44.360> was

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
construction of the Titanic itself I was
