pretty sad because actually I thought it

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.929 
pretty sad because actually I thought it
would<00:00:21.150> be<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.600> Barrett<00:00:22.140> 50<00:00:22.859> Cal<00:00:23.310> from

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
would be like the Barrett 50 Cal from

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.620 
would be like the Barrett 50 Cal from
modern<00:00:24.359> come<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.960> over<00:00:25.230> 43<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:25.859> example<00:00:26.630> but

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
modern come on over 43 for example but

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.919 
modern come on over 43 for example but
yeah<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.019> doesn't<00:00:28.980> have<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> one<00:00:30.000> hit<00:00:30.240> kill<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
for the ayran site I wouldn't use the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.709 
for the ayran site I wouldn't use the
cts<00:00:38.129> scope<00:00:38.430> because<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:39.090> don't<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.510> it's

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
cts scope because I don't know it's

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.869 
cts scope because I don't know it's
really<00:00:40.020> weird<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> get<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> enemy<00:00:40.950> there<00:00:41.190> it's

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
really weird to get the enemy there it's

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.000 
really weird to get the enemy there it's
even<00:00:42.210> difficult<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.960> hit<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> enemy<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:43.739> all

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010

even difficult to hit the enemy at all
it's<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.640> weird<00:00:45.590> while<00:00:46.590> moving<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
size or even more damage so that would

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.340 
size or even more damage so that would
be<00:01:19.590> pretty<00:01:19.770> cool<00:01:19.970> but<00:01:20.970> yeah<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.750> would

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
be pretty cool but yeah so I would

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.260 
be pretty cool but yeah so I would
recommend<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.979> normal<00:01:23.310> arion<00:01:23.580> site<00:01:23.880> because

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
recommend the normal arion site because

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.910 
recommend the normal arion site because
it's<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.320> think<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.979> best<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.610> use<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:27.119> gun<00:01:27.420> I

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
it's I think it's best to use this gun I

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.569 
it's I think it's best to use this gun I
usually<00:01:28.920> prefer<00:01:29.040> normal<00:01:29.549> air<00:01:29.700> inside<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:31.579> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
usually prefer normal air inside so the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.990 
usually prefer normal air inside so the
thermal<00:01:32.850> scope<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.720> also<00:01:34.350> quite<00:01:34.590> okay<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.700> mean

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
thermal scope is also quite okay I mean

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.060 
thermal scope is also quite okay I mean
the<00:01:36.420> sniper<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.960> not<00:01:37.140> really<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.590> thing<00:01:37.890> i

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the sniper is not really the thing i

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.719 
the sniper is not really the thing i
would<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.430> play<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.880> lot<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.640> but<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
would really play a lot so but the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.880 
would really play a lot so but the
thermal<00:01:41.939> scope<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.509> ok<00:01:42.869> i<00:01:42.899> mean<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.560> good<00:01:43.740> on

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
thermal scope is ok i mean it's good on

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.899 
thermal scope is ok i mean it's good on
long-range<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.329> makes<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:47.640> makes<00:01:47.790> it

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
long-range that it makes it makes it

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.289 
long-range that it makes it makes it
easier<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.240> hit<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> target<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.460> like<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.180> can

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
easier to hit the target so like you can

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.899 
easier to hit the target so like you can
see<00:01:51.420> here<00:01:51.720> three<00:01:52.049> hits<00:01:52.259> when<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.490> get<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> no

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
see here three hits when you get a no

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.100 
see here three hits when you get a no
scope<00:01:54.180> kill<00:01:54.479> around<00:01:54.840> yeah<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:56.119> um<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.420> front<00:01:58.020> of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
scope kill around yeah so um in front of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.190 
scope kill around yeah so um in front of
the<00:01:58.229> sniper<00:01:58.500> i<00:01:58.649> would<00:01:58.860> recommend<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.460> range

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
the sniper i would recommend the range

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.389 
the sniper i would recommend the range
attachment<00:02:01.200> thing<00:02:01.619> or<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.909> silencer<00:02:03.810> i

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
attachment thing or a silencer i

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.069 
attachment thing or a silencer i
wouldn't<00:02:05.399> use<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.090> model<00:02:06.390> muzzle<00:02:06.840> brake

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
wouldn't use the model muzzle brake

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.400 
wouldn't use the model muzzle brake
because<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.680> decreases<00:02:07.920> many<00:02:09.140> things<00:02:10.140> like

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
because it decreases many things like

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.990 
because it decreases many things like
range<00:02:11.400> or

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
range or

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.890 
range or
damage<00:02:13.160> yeah<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.370> makes<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.970> cyber<00:02:15.210> kind<00:02:15.690> of

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
damage yeah that makes the cyber kind of

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.940 
damage yeah that makes the cyber kind of
not<00:02:16.650> able<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:17.070> play<00:02:17.310> anymore<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:18.120> yeah<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.170> go

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
not able to play anymore and yeah so go

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.270 
not able to play anymore and yeah so go
with<00:02:20.100> with<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.910> silencer<00:02:21.600> or<00:02:21.870> with<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.650> range

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
with with a silencer or with a range

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.790 
with with a silencer or with a range
thing<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.940> don't<00:02:24.870> know<00:02:25.050> how<00:02:25.200> it's<00:02:25.350> called<00:02:25.620> it's

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
thing I don't know how it's called it's

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.760 
thing I don't know how it's called it's
like<00:02:26.240> just<00:02:27.240> increasing<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.780> range<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:28.530> that's

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
like just increasing the range so that's

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.449 
like just increasing the range so that's
good<00:02:28.950> for<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.160> sniping<00:02:29.459> rifle<00:02:30.530> um<00:02:31.530> yeah<00:02:32.190> so

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
good for the sniping rifle um yeah so

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.730 
good for the sniping rifle um yeah so
i'm<00:02:32.790> using<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.330> cts<00:02:33.780> cope<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.350> most<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
i'm using the cts cope and most of the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.310 
i'm using the cts cope and most of the
game<00:02:34.920> plays<00:02:35.160> here<00:02:35.459> but<00:02:35.670> definitely<00:02:36.570> don't<00:02:36.990> use

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
game plays here but definitely don't use

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.260 
game plays here but definitely don't use
this<00:02:37.590> because<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.190> really<00:02:38.370> difficult<00:02:38.790> to

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
this because it's really difficult to

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.750 
this because it's really difficult to
hit<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.510> enemy<00:02:39.660> there<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.320> before<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.400> use

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
hit the enemy there and before you use

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.410 
hit the enemy there and before you use
those<00:02:42.090> snipers<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.440> sniper<00:02:43.709> in<00:02:44.270> rank<00:02:45.270> at

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
those snipers that the sniper in rank at

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.570 
those snipers that the sniper in rank at
games<00:02:45.660> i<00:02:45.870> would<00:02:46.020> definitely<00:02:46.380> recommend<00:02:47.070> to

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
games i would definitely recommend to

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.650 
games i would definitely recommend to
use<00:02:47.760> at<00:02:48.239> first<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:50.060> custom<00:02:51.060> matches<00:02:51.270> because

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
use at first and custom matches because

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.860 
use at first and custom matches because
the<00:02:52.650> snipers<00:02:53.070> just<00:02:53.370> not<00:02:54.000> really<00:02:54.330> good<00:02:54.600> and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
the snipers just not really good and

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.479 
the snipers just not really good and
yeah<00:02:55.739> you<00:02:55.800> will<00:02:56.310> have<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:57.000> get<00:02:57.150> used<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:58.489> so

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
yeah you will have to get used to it so

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.990 
yeah you will have to get used to it so
the<00:03:00.420> only<00:03:00.690> good<00:03:01.170> thing<00:03:01.200> about<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:02.310> sculpt<00:03:02.790> is

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
the only good thing about the sculpt is

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.340 
the only good thing about the sculpt is
that<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.600> makes<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.200> easy<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.620> hit<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.430> heart

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
that it makes it easy to hit the heart

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.729 
that it makes it easy to hit the heart
of<00:03:07.350> an<00:03:07.560> enemy<00:03:07.680> but<00:03:08.190> yeah<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.930> still<00:03:10.560> not

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
of an enemy but yeah so it's still not

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.300 
of an enemy but yeah so it's still not
easy<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.110> good<00:03:13.230> thing<00:03:13.290> about<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:14.040> sniping

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
easy so the good thing about the sniping

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.960 
easy so the good thing about the sniping
rifle<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.060> high<00:03:15.209> fire<00:03:15.570> rate<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.760> it<00:03:17.760> has<00:03:17.940> a

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
rifle is the high fire rate and it has a

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.170 
rifle is the high fire rate and it has a
low<00:03:18.390> recoil<00:03:18.690> so<00:03:19.350> I<00:03:19.590> usually<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.549> sniper<00:03:20.880> has

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
low recoil so I usually a sniper has

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.100 
low recoil so I usually a sniper has
like<00:03:21.420> after<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.290> shoot<00:03:22.560> Oh<00:03:22.830> recoil<00:03:23.730> um<00:03:24.390> yes

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
like after you shoot Oh recoil um yes

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.039 
like after you shoot Oh recoil um yes
like<00:03:25.470> modern<00:03:26.040> combat<00:03:26.220> 3<00:03:26.580> for<00:03:27.180> example<00:03:27.690> when

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
like modern combat 3 for example when

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.640 
like modern combat 3 for example when
you<00:03:28.170> when<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.040> shoot<00:03:29.670> then<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:31.230> sculpt<00:03:31.530> is

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
you when you shoot then the sculpt is

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.289 
you when you shoot then the sculpt is
like<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:31.950> little<00:03:32.370> bit<00:03:32.720> yeah<00:03:33.720> moving<00:03:34.680> around<00:03:35.299> and

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
like a little bit yeah moving around and

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.789 
like a little bit yeah moving around and
that's<00:03:36.420> pretty<00:03:36.720> low<00:03:37.290> here<00:03:37.790> with<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.820> sniper<00:03:39.799> but

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
that's pretty low here with a sniper but

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.069 
that's pretty low here with a sniper but
the<00:03:41.040> problem<00:03:41.459> is<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.180> has<00:03:42.329> a<00:03:42.360> really<00:03:42.690> long

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
the problem is that it has a really long

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.880 
the problem is that it has a really long
reload<00:03:43.470> time<00:03:43.769> compared<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.850> x6<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.890> it

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
reload time compared to the x6 and it

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.240 
reload time compared to the x6 and it
has<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.220> 2<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.640> kill<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.239> sighs<00:03:48.840> with<00:03:49.739> two<00:03:50.070> it

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
has a 2 it kill so sighs with two it

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.140 
has a 2 it kill so sighs with two it
kills<00:03:50.549> are<00:03:50.820> always<00:03:51.390> not<00:03:51.630> that<00:03:51.810> good<00:03:52.760> so<00:03:53.760> um

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
kills are always not that good so um

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.020 
kills are always not that good so um
yeah<00:03:54.630> it's<00:03:54.780> kinda<00:03:55.170> on<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.350> power<00:03:55.620> though<00:03:56.030> so

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
yeah it's kinda on a power though so

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.509 
yeah it's kinda on a power though so
this<00:03:57.420> clip<00:03:57.750> shows<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.560> thermal<00:03:58.950> scope<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.370> mean

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
this clip shows the thermal scope I mean

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.729 
this clip shows the thermal scope I mean
the<00:03:59.940> scope<00:04:00.180> looks<00:04:00.420> weird<00:04:00.810> but<00:04:00.840> it's<00:04:01.140> not<00:04:01.230> that

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
the scope looks weird but it's not that

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.420 
the scope looks weird but it's not that
bad<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.459> use<00:04:02.700> with<00:04:03.000> this<00:04:03.180> gun<00:04:03.450> because<00:04:04.130> it<00:04:05.130> is

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
bad to use with this gun because it is

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.750 
bad to use with this gun because it is
good<00:04:05.970> at<00:04:06.090> long<00:04:06.299> range<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.810> mean<00:04:07.489> this<00:04:08.489> gun<00:04:08.730> is

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
good at long range I mean this gun is

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.979 
good at long range I mean this gun is
probably<00:04:09.769> made<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:11.160> play<00:04:11.760> but<00:04:12.600> really<00:04:12.959> really

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
probably made to play but really really

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.449 
probably made to play but really really
really<00:04:13.709> long<00:04:14.070> range<00:04:14.480> because<00:04:15.480> yeah<00:04:15.959> I'm<00:04:16.530> not

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
really long range because yeah I'm not

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.180 
really long range because yeah I'm not
really<00:04:17.700> good<00:04:18.060> at<00:04:18.120> using<00:04:18.750> such<00:04:19.620> snipe<00:04:19.950> as<00:04:20.160> a

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
really good at using such snipe as a

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.839 
really good at using such snipe as a
close<00:04:20.459> range<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.120> mean<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.140> kill<00:04:22.440> and

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
close range and I mean to it kill and

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.379 
close range and I mean to it kill and
low<00:04:23.849> fire<00:04:24.180> rate<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:24.930> not<00:04:25.050> that

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
low fire rate and it's not that

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.200 
low fire rate and it's not that
accurate<00:04:25.749> and<00:04:26.020> yeah<00:04:26.979> so<00:04:27.249> it's<00:04:27.520> definitely<00:04:28.090> a

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
accurate and yeah so it's definitely a

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.969 
accurate and yeah so it's definitely a
really<00:04:28.509> long<00:04:29.050> range<00:04:29.349> gun<00:04:30.360> um<00:04:31.360> yeah<00:04:32.229> so<00:04:32.259> I'm<00:04:32.949> not

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
really long range gun um yeah so I'm not

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.029 
really long range gun um yeah so I'm not
really<00:04:33.129> sure<00:04:33.370> but<00:04:34.349> yeah<00:04:35.349> I<00:04:35.379> wouldn't<00:04:35.830> use<00:04:36.009> it

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
really sure but yeah I wouldn't use it

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.820

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830

my<00:04:38.949> secondary<00:04:39.370> weapon<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:41.560> yeah<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:42.150> i'm
