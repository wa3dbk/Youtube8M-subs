00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.530
 and now we are going to follow together known 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.430
 verse 10 to all secret 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:13.040
 scored 58 to 28 with 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.690
 technical however superior to that of 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.790
 thomas bernhard we camped up 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.380
 Internet instead continue at 40 euros per 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.520
 what they all concern pump 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.560
 quickly make a list of 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.030
 elements that must present the boys 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.550
 this afternoon in their program a 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.840
 long are eight jumps some can 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.700
 to be rightly in combinations for 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.620
 which means the landing of the first 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.649
 jump is immediately attacked 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.649
 second jump 338 the two sequences of 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.710
 steps of which one will acquire a level 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.899
 technical while the other is a step 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.120
 sequence practically give possibilities 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.899
 skaters to express themselves 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.899
 completely 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.910
 fourfold 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.580
 the triple axel also for him not 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.580
 performed correctly 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.219
 triple lutz 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.090
 and triple 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.880
 and triple axel after tones 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.170
 that with the error because he had to 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.510
 get the balance by supporting the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.490
 hand on the journey in this case i 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.490
 judges will give a negative turn 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.340
 triple rent 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.640
 the oil hawk 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.090
 and triple togo 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.090
 this is false 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.139
 a definitely special choice 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.970
 this of program 17 already open 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.030
 short said that instead he had yesterday 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.350
 wrong in the scors you make problems 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.220
 even if she won she had been good at that 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.610
 I'm the room combination 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.010
 I want to stick to the initial triple la 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.110
 recovered after all who looks at one 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.760
 immigration match even after the man 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.590
 look must be only happy 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.210
 because if evening he really skated 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.370
 well in base we remember that however it is 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.220
 a boy who is growing up and being 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.800
 doing all the experience and all for 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.200
 let's call it this way the case is 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.140
 however in his strings we already see that he has 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.880
 already a great technical background can be achieved 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.130
 definitely improve on quality 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.710
 of the execution of the elements however 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.940
 in my opinion he should feel very much 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.170
 satisfied 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.210
 let's see some though his 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.850
 coach thinks like we go is 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.070
 liked this I 'm a little bit of a breaker 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.630
 a little street dance 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.300
 the young guy also good 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.530
 experimenting, here it will be particular 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.840
 then he did something very special 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:25.690
 these details instead of the quadruple 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:27.520
 talk 1234 very well made a 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.190
 particular movement the sequence of 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.220
 steps that become a proper 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.290
 breakdance movement almost and knows 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.850
 that in that case I wouldn't know how there 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.590
 technical panel to evaluate why 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.650
 he was leaning completely for a 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.800
 instant to the hands in the considered 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:48.180
 I almost don't know how to fall 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.919
 simply stop them 3508 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.510
 reports to clarifications precisely for 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:54.169
 also help the technical panel ad 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.539
 to be 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:59.270
 to competent and able to judge in 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:00.560
 best of all the races too 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.629
 because it is rightly necessary to give 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.389
 freedom for athletes to find new ones 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:07.249
 solutions to create new things 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:08.629
 they are inside parameters and we see a 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:13.159
 as the panel will judge 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:15.229
 technician however looks liked sparkling 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:16.490
 very powerful merry he had found 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:18.800
 also yesterday of the show then obviously 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.819
 too many errors and attached to his 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.110
 presentation 

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:24.550
 we see that he still misses it 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.350
 quality also in nutrition because 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:32.250
 the music was not very intense 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.250
 it certainly is n't helps 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:42.880
 meanwhile he goes into a tent because with 125 and 04 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:44.260
 manages to dominate werner at 63 82 per 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.420
 this technical score 

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.010
 the deduction painting in my opinion 

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.750
 that's the thing he did in the 

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.640
 sequence of steps he and they have 

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.060
 considered as a fall and then we are in 

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.060
 so from 283 32 I think it can be 

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.060
 satisfied
