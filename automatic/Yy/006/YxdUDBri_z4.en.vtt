trying to get her and I have side rock

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.330 
trying to get her and I have side rock
but<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> haven't<00:01:14.189> reviewed<00:01:14.460> him<00:01:14.729> yet<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:19.340> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
but I haven't reviewed him yet and the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.920 
but I haven't reviewed him yet and the
instruction<00:01:20.909> has<00:01:21.119> 20<00:01:21.689> sweep-a<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.700> DC

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
instruction has 20 sweep-a and when DC

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.289 
instruction has 20 sweep-a and when DC
dead<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.110> fading<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.640> backward<00:01:27.090> and

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
dead so fading and it's a backward and

dead so fading and it's a backward and
so<00:01:27.600> no<00:01:27.780> mistakes<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.290> suction<00:01:28.770> no<00:01:28.860> missing

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
so no mistakes and suction no missing

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.120 
so no mistakes and suction no missing
pieces<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.729> set<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.150> now<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.390> was<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> set

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
pieces in the set and now it was a set

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
pieces in the set and now it was a set
that's<00:01:32.130> officer<00:01:32.720> he<00:01:33.720> gets<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.020> plate<00:01:34.320> here

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
that's officer he gets this plate here

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:44.749 
that's officer he gets this plate here
it<00:01:34.979> does<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:42.229> this<00:01:43.229> head<00:01:43.799> here<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.340> this

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
it does so and this head here and this

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.100 
it does so and this head here and this
idea<00:01:45.210> also<00:01:45.899> swivel<00:01:47.090> say<00:01:48.090> almonds<00:01:48.509> poseable

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
idea also swivel say almonds poseable

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.730 
idea also swivel say almonds poseable
the<00:01:49.740> decks<00:01:50.040> are<00:01:50.159> possible<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.590> take<00:01:52.590> that

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
the decks are possible but take that

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.020 
the decks are possible but take that
will<00:01:52.920> fall<00:01:53.310> down<00:01:53.460> very<00:01:54.000> easily<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.810> just

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
will fall down very easily and just

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.889 
will fall down very easily and just
never<00:01:57.030> here<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:57.840> also<00:01:59.719> it's<00:02:00.719> also

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
never here can be also it's also

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.749 
never here can be also it's also
possible<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:02.479> then<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.780> part<00:02:04.469> here<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.579> it's

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
possible and then this part here so it's

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.630 
possible and then this part here so it's
down<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.270> comes<00:02:06.420> back<00:02:06.780> because<00:02:07.409> he<00:02:07.649> says

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
down and comes back because he says

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.320 
down and comes back because he says
stick<00:02:09.270> here

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
stick here

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:21.510 
stick here
it<00:02:10.990> is<00:02:12.990> owned<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.060> can<00:02:20.070> use<00:02:21.070> all<00:02:21.340> the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
it is owned and you can use all the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.280 
it is owned and you can use all the
blade<00:02:22.120> mechanism<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:23.980> have<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.640> side<00:02:25.510> this

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
blade mechanism so you have to side this

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.250 
blade mechanism so you have to side this
part<00:02:26.350> here<00:02:27.390> out<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.800> then<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:31.080> will<00:02:32.080> show<00:02:32.200> you

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
part here out and then I will show you

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.220 
part here out and then I will show you
this<00:02:32.590> one<00:02:32.830> with<00:02:32.980> two<00:02:33.220> hand<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:37.050> start<00:02:38.050> in<00:02:38.200> the
