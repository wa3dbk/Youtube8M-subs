ideas the intellectual content of
universities<00:00:28.610> and<00:00:28.969> of<00:00:29.090> engineering

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:29.509 
universities and of engineering

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.720 
universities and of engineering
departments<00:00:30.050> they<00:00:30.590> could<00:00:30.770> translate<00:00:31.189> it<00:00:31.550> into

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
departments they could translate it into

something that really made things that

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.350 
something that really made things that
were<00:00:34.160> important<00:00:34.730> for<00:00:34.820> high<00:00:35.059> value

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
were important for high value

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.330 
were important for high value
manufacturing<00:00:35.989> they<00:00:36.710> did<00:00:36.890> it<00:00:37.039> with

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
manufacturing they did it with

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.069 
manufacturing they did it with
commercial<00:00:37.789> partners<00:00:38.270> they<00:00:38.750> did<00:00:38.960> it

commercial partners they did it

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.900 
commercial partners they did it

whole<00:01:06.800> well<00:01:07.700> high<00:01:07.850> value<00:01:08.090> manufacturing

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
whole well high value manufacturing

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.350 
whole well high value manufacturing
implies<00:01:08.960> high-level<00:01:09.920> skills<00:01:10.060> if<00:01:11.060> we<00:01:11.180> don't

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
implies high-level skills if we don't

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.820 
implies high-level skills if we don't
have<00:01:11.450> a<00:01:11.479> skilled<00:01:11.780> people<00:01:11.960> then<00:01:12.440> in<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.680> future

have a skilled people then in the future
we<00:01:13.070> go<00:01:13.190> tell<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.520> girls<00:01:13.670> which<00:01:14.240> is<00:01:14.330> why<00:01:14.480> we

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
we go tell the girls which is why we

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.780 
we go tell the girls which is why we
need<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:14.840> help<00:01:15.080> manufacture<00:01:15.590> when<00:01:16.580> you<00:01:16.640> have

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
need you help manufacture when you have

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.430 
need you help manufacture when you have
a<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:17.000> MRC<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:17.630> we're<00:01:17.780> developing<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.290> latest

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
a a MRC and we're developing the latest

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.030 
a a MRC and we're developing the latest
manufacturing<00:01:19.280> practices<00:01:20.230> we<00:01:21.230> need<00:01:21.710> the

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
manufacturing practices we need the

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.860 
manufacturing practices we need the
latest<00:01:22.190> manufacturing<00:01:22.610> skills<00:01:23.120> to<00:01:23.570> go<00:01:23.660> along

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
latest manufacturing skills to go along

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.960 
latest manufacturing skills to go along
with<00:01:23.900> that<00:01:24.380> latest<00:01:24.770> machine<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.700> latest

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
with that latest machine that latest

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.290 
with that latest machine that latest
methodology<00:01:26.720> I<00:01:26.930> think<00:01:27.230> the<00:01:27.320> main<00:01:27.700> reason<00:01:28.700> for

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
methodology I think the main reason for

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.780 
methodology I think the main reason for
for<00:01:29.930> a<00:01:30.200> company<00:01:30.830> coming<00:01:31.070> here<00:01:31.400> is<00:01:31.520> that<00:01:31.640> they

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
for a company coming here is that they

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.820 
for a company coming here is that they
see<00:01:31.850> that<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.420> definite<00:01:32.900> benefits<00:01:33.470> from<00:01:33.650> day

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
see that the definite benefits from day

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.180 
see that the definite benefits from day
one<00:01:34.130> they<00:01:34.970> have<00:01:35.180> lots<00:01:35.570> more<00:01:35.890> skills<00:01:36.890> around

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
one they have lots more skills around

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.020 
one they have lots more skills around
things<00:01:38.180> like<00:01:38.300> employability<00:01:39.250> they<00:01:40.250> have<00:01:40.640> a

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
things like employability they have a

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.540 
things like employability they have a
good<00:01:41.450> knowledge<00:01:41.660> of<00:01:41.900> what<00:01:42.530> it's<00:01:42.950> like<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.520> be

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
good knowledge of what it's like to be

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.460 
good knowledge of what it's like to be
in<00:01:43.760> manufacturing<00:01:44.480> before<00:01:44.840> they<00:01:44.990> get<00:01:45.200> out

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
in manufacturing before they get out

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.950 
in manufacturing before they get out
into<00:01:46.000> that<00:01:47.000> environment<00:01:47.300> so<00:01:47.660> they're<00:01:47.810> much

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
into that environment so they're much

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.320 
into that environment so they're much
more<00:01:48.110> prepared<00:01:48.590> as<00:01:48.950> an<00:01:49.430> individual<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.270> I

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
more prepared as an individual and I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.360 
more prepared as an individual and I
think<00:01:50.360> that's<00:01:50.660> what<00:01:50.840> employers<00:01:51.080> like<00:01:52.010> about

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
think that's what employers like about

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.920 
think that's what employers like about
the<00:01:52.550> approach<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:52.850> the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
the approach of the

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.350 
the approach of the
you'll<00:01:54.170> see<00:01:54.350> ASL<00:01:55.340> support<00:01:55.700> apprenticeships

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
you'll see ASL support apprenticeships

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.760 
you'll see ASL support apprenticeships
because<00:01:56.870> we<00:01:57.140> have<00:01:57.260> a<00:01:57.290> highly<00:01:57.740> skilled

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
because we have a highly skilled

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.980 
because we have a highly skilled
workforce<00:01:58.450> obviously<00:01:59.450> because<00:01:59.720> of<00:01:59.750> the

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
workforce obviously because of the

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.450 
of our highly skilled machinists may no
longer<00:02:06.020> be<00:02:06.380> AAS<00:02:06.890> because<00:02:07.220> they<00:02:07.340> may<00:02:07.430> have

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
longer be AAS because they may have

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.969 
longer be AAS because they may have
retired<00:02:07.869> things<00:02:08.869> like<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.440> we<00:02:09.560> need<00:02:09.740> to
