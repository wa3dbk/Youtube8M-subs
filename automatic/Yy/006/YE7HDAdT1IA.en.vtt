00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.960 
alright same tactic they're more
aggressive<00:03:58.950> now<00:03:58.980> because<00:03:59.370> they're<00:03:59.579> really

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
aggressive now because they're really

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.149 
aggressive now because they're really
close<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.239> dying

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
close to dying

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.009 
close to dying
yeah<00:04:02.159> if<00:04:02.790> one's<00:04:03.120> like<00:04:03.329> we're<00:04:03.510> next<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.900> you

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
yeah if one's like we're next to you

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.270 
yeah if one's like we're next to you
just<00:04:04.200> do<00:04:04.560> like<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.799> row<00:04:05.069> or<00:04:05.250> something<00:04:06.890> but<00:04:07.890> you

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
just do like a row or something but you

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.039 
just do like a row or something but you
just<00:04:08.430> want<00:04:08.579> to<00:04:08.640> hug<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.909> wall<00:04:09.060> until<00:04:09.209> this

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
just want to hug the wall until this

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.849 
just want to hug the wall until this
attack<00:04:10.379> phase<00:04:10.650> away<00:04:10.950> it<00:04:11.909> would<00:04:12.120> have<00:04:12.269> sucked

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
attack phase away it would have sucked

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.589 
attack phase away it would have sucked
and<00:04:13.859> this<00:04:14.159> is<00:04:14.280> like<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.459> permanent<00:04:15.030> thing<00:04:15.090> but

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
and this is like a permanent thing but

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.830 
and this is like a permanent thing but
it's<00:04:15.810> not<00:04:16.019> thing<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.329> way<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.449> found<00:04:18.660> this

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
it's not thing and the way I found this

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.930 
it's not thing and the way I found this
out<00:04:19.049> it's<00:04:19.259> um<00:04:19.530> it's<00:04:20.250> because<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.549> was<00:04:20.699> fighting

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
out it's um it's because I was fighting

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.680 
out it's um it's because I was fighting
her<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:22.190> I<00:04:23.190> wasn't<00:04:23.460> even<00:04:23.580> attacking<00:04:24.479> because

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
her and I wasn't even attacking because

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.409 
her and I wasn't even attacking because
I<00:04:24.810> couldn't<00:04:25.080> talk<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.979> couldn't<00:04:26.760> get<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.090> timing

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
I couldn't talk I couldn't get a timing

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.200 
I couldn't talk I couldn't get a timing
down<00:04:27.510> for<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.750> factor<00:04:28.310> pairs<00:04:29.310> on<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.910> second

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
down for the factor pairs on the second

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.719 
down for the factor pairs on the second
one<00:04:30.300> competitor<00:04:30.830> I'm<00:04:31.830> just<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.310> was<00:04:32.550> just

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
one competitor I'm just I was just

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.310 
one competitor I'm just I was just
basically<00:04:32.880> dodging<00:04:33.600> your<00:04:33.720> moves<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.139> I<00:04:34.229> don't

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
basically dodging your moves and I don't

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.850 
basically dodging your moves and I don't
know<00:04:34.560> where<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.280> smoke<00:04:35.850> went<00:04:36.090> away

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
know where the smoke went away

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.930 
know where the smoke went away
so<00:04:37.860> by<00:04:38.130> that<00:04:38.340> outlet<00:04:39.470> maybe<00:04:40.470> you<00:04:41.400> can<00:04:41.580> drag

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
so by that outlet maybe you can drag

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.490 
so by that outlet maybe you can drag
this<00:04:43.550> hog<00:04:44.550> out<00:04:45.180> long<00:04:45.630> enough<00:04:45.840> until<00:04:46.320> it

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
this hog out long enough until it

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.330 
this hog out long enough until it
disappears<00:04:47.370> so<00:04:48.680> that's<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.860> way<00:04:49.979> I<00:04:50.009> found

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
disappears so that's the way I found

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.689 
disappears so that's the way I found
that<00:04:50.580> tactic<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.990> I<00:04:52.860> think<00:04:53.160> you<00:04:53.280> can<00:04:53.430> feel<00:04:53.610> it

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
that tactic and I think you can feel it

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.820 
that tactic and I think you can feel it
sure<00:04:53.849> if<00:04:53.970> you<00:04:54.090> did<00:04:54.270> get<00:04:54.990> her<00:04:55.110> to<00:04:55.289> walk<00:04:55.470> into<00:04:55.680> the

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
sure if you did get her to walk into the

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.350 
sure if you did get her to walk into the
wall<00:04:56.039> group<00:04:56.250> but<00:04:56.430> what<00:04:56.610> are<00:04:56.729> the<00:04:56.849> chances<00:04:57.090> of

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
wall group but what are the chances of

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.420 
wall group but what are the chances of
this<00:04:57.419> happening<00:04:57.479> and<00:04:58.080> at<00:04:58.830> this<00:04:59.010> point<00:04:59.220> I'm

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
this happening and at this point I'm

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.189 
this happening and at this point I'm
like<00:04:59.580> wait<00:05:00.180> why<00:05:00.449> is<00:05:00.510> this<00:05:00.690> you're<00:05:00.900> attacking

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
like wait why is this you're attacking

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.320 
like wait why is this you're attacking
this<00:05:01.860> is<00:05:01.949> what<00:05:02.099> I<00:05:02.280> think<00:05:02.430> I<00:05:02.580> mean<00:05:02.789> to<00:05:02.910> do<00:05:03.030> this<00:05:03.060> I

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
this is what I think I mean to do this I

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.969 
this is what I think I mean to do this I
didn't<00:05:03.479> even<00:05:03.570> know<00:05:03.720> but<00:05:04.050> apparently<00:05:04.530> it<00:05:04.919> looks

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
didn't even know but apparently it looks

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.320 
didn't even know but apparently it looks
like<00:05:05.160> a<00:05:05.190> glitch<00:05:05.460> because<00:05:05.669> she<00:05:05.820> can't<00:05:06.060> get<00:05:06.210> out

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
like a glitch because she can't get out

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.379 
like a glitch because she can't get out
of<00:05:06.479> his<00:05:06.599> way<00:05:07.729> quite<00:05:08.729> a<00:05:08.760> bit<00:05:09.000> so<00:05:09.180> if<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.330> guys

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
of his way quite a bit so if you guys

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.879 
of his way quite a bit so if you guys
have<00:05:09.599> like<00:05:09.720> range<00:05:09.960> weapons<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:10.500> can<00:05:10.620> pretty

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
have like range weapons you can pretty

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.210 
have like range weapons you can pretty
much<00:05:11.010> cheesy<00:05:11.460> and<00:05:11.970> get<00:05:12.360> hurt

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
much cheesy and get hurt

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.610 
much cheesy and get hurt
but<00:05:14.820> I<00:05:14.880> didn't<00:05:15.180> really<00:05:15.390> want<00:05:15.600> to<00:05:15.690> cheesy<00:05:16.080> cuz<00:05:16.500> I

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
but I didn't really want to cheesy cuz I

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.010 
but I didn't really want to cheesy cuz I
wanna<00:05:16.770> I<00:05:17.040> wanted<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.400> fair<00:05:17.610> fight<00:05:17.850> so<00:05:18.600> I<00:05:18.630> was

apparently she did a melee attack and
then<00:05:24.630> she<00:05:24.780> got<00:05:24.930> out<00:05:25.080> of<00:05:25.230> it<00:05:25.350> I<00:05:25.470> was<00:05:25.590> quite<00:05:25.950> happy
