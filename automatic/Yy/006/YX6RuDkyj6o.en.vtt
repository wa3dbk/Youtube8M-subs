plus<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.329> believe<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.690> wind

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
plus so I believe it's the wind

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.330 
plus so I believe it's the wind
winchester<00:00:52.800> Edition<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:55.680> an<00:00:55.890> LAN

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
winchester Edition so it is not an LAN

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.180 
winchester Edition so it is not an LAN
processor<00:00:57.680> there's<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.859> retail<00:00:59.340> processor<00:01:01.190> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
processor there's a retail processor the

gigabyte hard drive SATA for this it's

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.170 
gigabyte hard drive SATA for this it's
gonna<00:02:40.989> be<00:02:41.170> nice<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.650> Western<00:02:42.550> Digital<00:02:42.730> by<00:02:43.120> the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
gonna be nice to Western Digital by the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.760 
gonna be nice to Western Digital by the
way<00:02:44.040> if<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.640> do<00:02:46.300> have<00:02:46.510> an<00:02:46.600> IDE<00:02:46.900> hard<00:02:47.050> drive<00:02:47.470> and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
way if you do have an IDE hard drive and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.360 
way if you do have an IDE hard drive and
you<00:02:47.890> don't<00:02:48.190> have<00:02:49.180> SATA<00:02:49.630> don't<00:02:50.530> worry<00:02:50.770> because

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
you don't have SATA don't worry because

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.090 
you don't have SATA don't worry because
it<00:02:51.580> has<00:02:51.730> three<00:02:52.060> IDE<00:02:52.390> headers<00:02:52.870> here<00:02:53.170> for<00:02:53.950> that

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
it has three IDE headers here for that

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.600 
it has three IDE headers here for that
reason

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
reason

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.080 
reason
so<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:55.660> can<00:02:55.870> run<00:02:56.020> an<00:02:56.170> older<00:02:56.560> id<00:02:56.890> East<00:02:57.250> hard

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
so you can run an older id East hard

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.190 
so you can run an older id East hard
drive<00:02:58.390> without<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.989> problem<00:02:59.290> on<00:02:59.530> this<00:02:59.680> board

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
drive without a problem on this board

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.500 
drive without a problem on this board
the<00:03:02.200> other<00:03:02.590> thing<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.280> did<00:03:03.670> like<00:03:03.850> about<00:03:03.910> this

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
the other thing I did like about this

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:16.160 
the other thing I did like about this
board<00:03:04.900> is<00:03:12.180> see<00:03:13.180> here<00:03:13.420> this

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.050 

this<00:03:16.740> is<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.920> very<00:03:17.220> basic<00:03:17.460> motherboard<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:20.700> the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
this is a very basic motherboard it the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.210 
this is a very basic motherboard it the
only<00:03:21.270> downside<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.560> has<00:03:22.710> a<00:03:22.740> swell

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
only downside of it is it has a swell

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.240 
only downside of it is it has a swell
memory<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.780> only<00:03:24.960> running<00:03:25.260> on<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.590> 939

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
memory and it's only running on the 939

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.400 
memory and it's only running on the 939
socket<00:03:26.820> for<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.060> AMD<00:03:27.510> Athlon<00:03:27.900> times<00:03:28.170> two

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.030 
socket for the AMD Athlon times two
processors<00:03:29.360> so<00:03:30.360> I'm<00:03:31.110> limited<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.770> what<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:31.950> can

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
processors so I'm limited to what I can

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.720 
processors so I'm limited to what I can
do<00:03:32.400> there<00:03:33.080> it's<00:03:34.080> very<00:03:34.500> hard<00:03:34.740> to<00:03:34.770> find<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.130> 939

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
do there it's very hard to find a 939

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.050 
do there it's very hard to find a 939
