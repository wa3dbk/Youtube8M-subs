00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 yo everyone knows if my look of 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:10.400
 diamonds and extra and today we're going 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.400
 ride is gone 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.200
 you'll understand today I can 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.660
 show you the way to remedy the 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.160
 lack of snow this season ok for 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.029
 start this experiment we will take 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.840
 a diaper 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:31.029
 finally we will take a lot we will 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.660
 then our take a unfold it and the 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.660
 cut in length 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.230
 once done we will take the courage 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.230
 and put it aside 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.170
 we will then take a container it 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.590
 put the stuffing close it and the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.590
 technical 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.770
 this step will allow us to separate 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.770
 the wadding of the crystals 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.350
 and here we get our little crystals 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.340
 25 diapers later I 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.689
 starts to have a lot of powder and 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.789
 we will be able to start the real 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:02:15.380
 experience to do that just 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:02:18.010
 mix the powder with water and that's it 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.010
 we have snow 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.060
 but what are these crystals 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.350
 in fact it is a super polymers 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.420
 absorbents it's a substance 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.160
 consisting of macromolecules that can 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.690
 absorb and contain very large 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.220
 amounts of liquid compared to its 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.740
 mass in the case of diapers 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.660
 the polymer use the polyacrylate of 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.730
 sodium and it can absorb up to 1000 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.260
 times sum to his name but what is 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.030
 interesting is how he 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.830
 made to absorb + and 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.940
 it's simple it's dry this polymer 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.740
 created a long chain or several 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.080
 molecules will get together while 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.450
 in the presence of water the ions sodium n 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.730
 more is said this and makes the polyacrylate 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.890
 negative which generates who will be able 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.230
 attract the water molecules and by this 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.890
 do it hard but the gene wholesale if you 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.330
 did not understand 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.620
 at the base the molecules are put 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.750
 together and form a very very long 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.370
 chain and when they mix with 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.890
 the water 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.690
 the chain breaks and the mud remains 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.240
 mix with water and form the jem 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.260
 that's basically that's it short I hope that 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.610
 this video will have pleased you 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.080
 if that's the case do not forget to put 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.510
 a little thumb make and share it 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.510
 it makes me super happy and see you soon
