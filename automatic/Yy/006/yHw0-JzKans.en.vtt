you know last September in October and

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.370 
you know last September in October and
and<00:00:27.820> that's<00:00:28.270> been<00:00:28.540> surmounted<00:00:28.870> and<00:00:29.260> that's

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
and that's been surmounted and that's

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.410 
and that's been surmounted and that's
enormously<00:00:29.890> important<00:00:30.430> but<00:00:30.910> in<00:00:31.000> terms<00:00:31.180> of<00:00:31.300> the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
enormously important but in terms of the

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.960 
enormously important but in terms of the
economy<00:00:31.510> coming<00:00:32.170> back<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:33.520> takes<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.850> while

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
economy coming back it takes a while

economy coming back it takes a while
there<00:00:34.150> were<00:00:34.240> a<00:00:34.270> lot<00:00:34.420> of<00:00:34.450> excesses<00:00:34.900> to<00:00:35.200> be<00:00:35.320> wrung

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:35.740 
there were a lot of excesses to be wrung

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.670 
there were a lot of excesses to be wrung
out<00:00:35.890> and<00:00:36.250> and<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.840> process<00:00:38.110> is<00:00:38.350> still

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
out and and that process is still

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.900 
out and and that process is still
underway<00:00:38.920> that<00:00:39.160> looks<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.460> me<00:00:39.550> like<00:00:39.580> it'll<00:00:39.880> be

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
underway that looks to me like it'll be

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.190 
underway that looks to me like it'll be
underway<00:00:40.270> for<00:00:40.330> quite<00:00:40.660> a<00:00:40.690> while<00:00:40.840> in<00:00:40.990> the<00:00:41.050> annual

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
underway for quite a while in the annual

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.260 
underway for quite a while in the annual
report<00:00:41.590> I<00:00:41.740> said<00:00:42.280> that<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.640> economy<00:00:42.850> would<00:00:43.120> be

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
report I said that the economy would be

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.000 
report I said that the economy would be
in<00:00:43.360> a<00:00:43.420> shambles<00:00:43.660> this<00:00:43.990> year<00:00:44.230> probably<00:00:44.590> well

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
in a shambles this year probably well

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.150 
in a shambles this year probably well
beyond<00:00:45.340> and<00:00:45.610> I'm<00:00:46.480> afraid<00:00:46.720> that's<00:00:46.960> true<00:00:47.290> we

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160

do you think overall about it there's a

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.240 
do you think overall about it there's a

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
consumer protection agency that's

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.500 
consumer protection agency that's
involved<00:04:10.640> with<00:04:10.850> this<00:04:11.000> there's<00:04:11.270> a<00:04:11.330> lot<00:04:11.480> of

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
involved with this there's a lot of

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.540 
involved with this there's a lot of
other<00:04:11.720> different<00:04:12.230> arenas<00:04:13.100> but<00:04:13.220> is<00:04:13.340> this<00:04:13.489> the

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
other different arenas but is this the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.430 
other different arenas but is this the
right<00:04:14.000> is<00:04:14.209> this<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:14.660> step<00:04:14.930> in<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.290> right

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
right is this a step in the right

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.810 
right is this a step in the right
direction<00:04:15.500> we'll<00:04:16.010> see<00:04:16.160> how<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.340> statute

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
direction we'll see how the statute

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.659 
direction we'll see how the statute
reads<00:04:17.030> but<00:04:17.299> basically<00:04:17.980> we<00:04:18.980> got<00:04:19.190> way<00:04:19.400> over

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
reads but basically we got way over

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.849 
reads but basically we got way over
leveraged<00:04:20.030> in<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.299> financial<00:04:20.780> arena<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:21.830> the

American public on over leveraged choose

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.870 
American public on over leveraged choose
I<00:04:23.720> mean<00:04:23.930> we<00:04:24.440> do<00:04:24.890> need<00:04:25.100> something<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.669> address

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
I mean we do need something to address

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.920 
I mean we do need something to address
that<00:04:26.210> we<00:04:26.390> do<00:04:26.600> need

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
that we do need

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.170 
that we do need
something<00:04:27.259> to<00:04:27.860> address<00:04:28.100> institutions<00:04:29.000> where

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
something to address institutions where

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.879 
something to address institutions where
the<00:04:29.300> wrong<00:04:29.539> incentives<00:04:29.930> are<00:04:30.259> in<00:04:30.350> place<00:04:30.590> so

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
the wrong incentives are in place so

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.330 
the wrong incentives are in place so
that<00:04:31.039> they<00:04:31.190> their<00:04:31.789> personal<00:04:32.270> incentives<00:04:32.780> are

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
that they their personal incentives are

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.040 
that they their personal incentives are
at<00:04:34.340> real<00:04:34.610> variance<00:04:35.120> with<00:04:35.360> what<00:04:35.539> our<00:04:35.570> national

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
at real variance with what our national

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.249 
at real variance with what our national
incentives<00:04:36.500> should<00:04:36.650> be<00:04:36.770> and<00:04:37.539> so<00:04:38.539> we<00:04:38.660> do<00:04:38.720> we

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
incentives should be and so we do we

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.020 
incentives should be and so we do we
need<00:04:39.410> something<00:04:39.979> to<00:04:40.130> make<00:04:40.160> sure<00:04:40.490> we<00:04:40.639> don't<00:04:40.789> get

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
need something to make sure we don't get

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.909 
need something to make sure we don't get
into<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.419> situation<00:04:42.020> again<00:04:42.380> that<00:04:42.560> we<00:04:42.680> were<00:04:42.800> in

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
into the situation again that we were in

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.490 
into the situation again that we were in
last<00:04:43.100> September's<00:04:43.669> and<00:04:43.789> that<00:04:44.320> leverage<00:04:45.320> is<00:04:45.470> a

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
last September's and that leverage is a

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.230 
last September's and that leverage is a
big<00:04:45.770> key<00:04:45.949> to<00:04:46.100> it<00:04:46.190> now<00:04:46.280> that's<00:04:46.490> a<00:04:46.610> huge<00:04:47.030> problem

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
big key to it now that's a huge problem

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.390 
big key to it now that's a huge problem
to<00:04:47.630> attack<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.229> how<00:04:48.620> it's<00:04:48.800> written<00:04:49.009> and<00:04:49.310> how

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
to attack and how it's written and how

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.820 
to attack and how it's written and how
its<00:04:49.580> administered<00:04:49.699> is<00:04:50.570> not<00:04:50.780> an<00:04:50.900> easy<00:04:50.990> job<00:04:51.350> but

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
its administered is not an easy job but

can you lay that down as a rule I mean

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.629 
can you lay that down as a rule I mean
should<00:04:54.289> it<00:04:54.380> be<00:04:54.530> that<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:54.919> can't<00:04:55.130> be<00:04:55.280> levered

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
should it be that you can't be levered

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.370 
should it be that you can't be levered
more<00:04:56.000> than<00:04:56.509> ten<00:04:56.690> to<00:04:56.810> one<00:04:56.960> you<00:04:56.990> can't<00:04:57.110> be

figure<00:04:59.599> out<00:04:59.870> it's<00:05:00.110> very<00:05:00.380> very<00:05:00.650> and<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:00.949> can't

figure out it's very very and you can't

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.650
