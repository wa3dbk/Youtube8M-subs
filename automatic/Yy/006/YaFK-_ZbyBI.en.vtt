here<00:01:19.520> is<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:20.360> main<00:01:20.600> supply

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
here is the main supply

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.770 
here is the main supply
going<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.659> computer

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
going to the computer

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.219 
going to the computer
in<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.110> back<00:01:26.290> of<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.470> computer

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
in the back of the computer

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.820 
in the back of the computer
there's<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.799> heat<00:01:29.070> exchanger<00:01:29.549> plane

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.390 

and<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.490> comes<00:01:35.700> out<00:01:35.940> right<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:37.400> now

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
and it comes out right there now

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.940 
and it comes out right there now
obviously<00:01:39.030> from<00:01:39.240> right<00:01:39.390> there<00:01:39.660> I<00:01:39.900> took<00:01:42.950> this

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
obviously from right there I took this

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.550 
obviously from right there I took this
valve<00:01:44.250> out<00:01:44.460> right<00:01:44.760> here

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.430 

I<00:01:48.760> took<00:01:49.760> this<00:01:50.000> off<00:01:50.150> from<00:01:50.390> right<00:01:50.479> here<00:01:50.720> the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
I took this off from right here the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.200 
I took this off from right here the
reason<00:01:51.590> why<00:01:51.799> I<00:01:51.830> check<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:52.159> out<00:01:52.280> I'm<00:01:52.940> going<00:01:53.150> to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
reason why I check it out I'm going to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.510 
reason why I check it out I'm going to
show<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.479> what<00:01:54.440> causes<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:55.130> have<00:01:55.340> high

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
show you what causes to have high

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.149 
show you what causes to have high
pressure<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:56.240> your<00:01:56.930> filter<00:01:57.290> diesel<00:01:57.950> filter

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
pressure in your filter diesel filter

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.450 
pressure in your filter diesel filter
but<00:01:58.880> that's<00:01:59.090> not<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.330> case<00:01:59.479> okay

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
but that's not the case okay

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.670 
but that's not the case okay
this<00:02:02.390> that<00:02:02.690> comes<00:02:02.869> out<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.170> computer<00:02:03.560> the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
this that comes out of the computer the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.280 
this that comes out of the computer the
top<00:02:03.860> at<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.070> computer<00:02:04.899> there's<00:02:05.899> not<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.050> line

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
top at the computer there's not a line

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.930 
top at the computer there's not a line
that<00:02:06.409> goes<00:02:06.470> down<00:02:06.770> like<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.190> get<00:02:07.340> out<00:02:07.460> because<00:02:07.759> I

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
that goes down like to get out because I

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.240 
that goes down like to get out because I
bypass<00:02:08.360> everything<00:02:08.860> because<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:09.920> couldn't<00:02:10.130> get

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
bypass everything because I couldn't get

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.460 
bypass everything because I couldn't get
it<00:02:10.340> started<00:02:10.399> as<00:02:11.390> she<00:02:11.569> would<00:02:11.630> start<00:02:11.900> but<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.350> was

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
it started as she would start but it was

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.070 
it started as she would start but it was
stall<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:12.950> had<00:02:13.220> no<00:02:13.310> power<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.569> decided<00:02:15.020> to

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
stall and I had no power so I decided to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.570 
stall and I had no power so I decided to
do<00:02:15.230> some<00:02:15.380> more<00:02:15.500> investigation<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.340> figure

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
do some more investigation and figure

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.990 
do some more investigation and figure
out<00:02:16.610> what<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.910> problem<00:02:17.270> is<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:19.610> valve

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
out what the problem is so this valve

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.550 
out what the problem is so this valve
right<00:02:20.239> here<00:02:22.660> why<00:02:23.660> do<00:02:23.720> we<00:02:23.870> when<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.230> take<00:02:24.410> this

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
right here why do we when you take this

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.540 
right here why do we when you take this
out<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:25.040> valve<00:02:27.010> take<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.130> wire<00:02:28.280> from<00:02:28.489> the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
out the valve take the wire from the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.820 
out the valve take the wire from the
computer<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.150> pull<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.989> wire<00:02:30.140> back<00:02:30.440> is<00:02:30.709> the

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
computer and pull the wire back is the

shall start right up without this if you

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.080 
shall start right up without this if you
might<00:03:31.109> go<00:03:31.200> back<00:03:31.379> to<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.590> tank<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.189> it<00:03:32.939> might

might go back to the tank and it might

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.459 
might go back to the tank and it might
start<00:03:33.329> but<00:03:33.540> then<00:03:33.629> it's<00:03:33.750> going<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.930> stall<00:03:34.200> and

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:34.469 
start but then it's going to stall and

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.259 
start but then it's going to stall and
you<00:03:34.799> might<00:03:34.950> not<00:03:35.069> be<00:03:35.129> able<00:03:35.189> to<00:03:35.430> restart<00:03:36.180> it

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
you might not be able to restart it

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.559 
you might not be able to restart it
again<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.629> you<00:03:36.720> fill<00:03:36.930> out<00:03:36.959> that<00:03:37.260> diesel<00:03:38.010> filter

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
again so you fill out that diesel filter

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.890 
again so you fill out that diesel filter
so<00:03:40.220> this<00:03:41.220> right<00:03:41.400> here<00:03:41.549> was<00:03:41.670> completely

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
so this right here was completely

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.170 
so this right here was completely
clogged

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.750 

so<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:46.750> cleaned<00:03:47.019> it<00:03:47.110> put<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:47.680> back<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:48.489> now<00:03:48.580> I'm

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
so I cleaned it put it back and now I'm

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.479 
so I cleaned it put it back and now I'm
about<00:03:48.879> to<00:03:49.530> mount<00:03:50.530> everything<00:03:51.010> back<00:03:51.159> how<00:03:51.370> it
