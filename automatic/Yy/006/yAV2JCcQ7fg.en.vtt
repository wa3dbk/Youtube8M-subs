00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.880
 then with 12 17 we are going to blur well 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.810

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.000
 over the gray pencil to clarify it and 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.640
 that is not so dark and as you can see 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.770
 and now for the lower lashes I'm going 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.350
 to use this mascara of ethics is called 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.350
 continuous strengthening in wordpress 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.590

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.590
 inside with this neutral color 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.030

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.489
 clear I'll start by putting the clear 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.030
 with a weak brush and strokes first 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.030
 under the eyes 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.580
 and then with a mac brush we're going to 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.290
 blur this base pretty well because 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.060
 what I do not want is to cover all the 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.970
 freckles that I now like to be left 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.680
 the freckles a little more marked but what 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.260
 What I want is to match the tonality of 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.750
 his skin and that's why he chose this base 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.569
 because it is medium coverage but also 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.569
 It is super bright and is perfect for a 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.689
 look a little beach 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.240

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.880

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.500
 and now I'm going to take the color of the base 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.260
 darker and I'll put it in the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.170
 cheeks 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.270
 and with the same brush we are blurring 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.470
 and how can you see the skin is beautiful 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:27.780
 super bright but conserving enough 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.000

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.680

 they are small and the only thing they do is 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.319
 give a little more volume to the 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:13.419
 eyelashes and elongate your eyes a little and 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:13.419

00:05:53.479 --> 00:06:00.199
 darker and I'm going to put it where I put the 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:03.229
 base of darker color in this way 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:05.000

 put it gently on the cheek 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.020
