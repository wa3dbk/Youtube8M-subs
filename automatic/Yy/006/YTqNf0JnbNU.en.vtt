00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:12.799
 good afternoon to all we continued we 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:16.939
 finished the days of repairing the boat now we 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.920
 We are thinking about doing it or at least 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.740
 make boards for 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.070
 shop shop she like you remember 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.480
 we talked on southerk cancellation summary 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.609
 I think they are here on the bench to let this 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.930
 its moment is somewhere around 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:39.320
 I previously took a change in length 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:48.110
 a measurement of meters 150 for 1150 to us from afar 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:50.660
 ruler length and 1150 to 1150 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.890
 in short, so here it turns out 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:59.860
 so here we have meduski will be on average 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:06.140
 shop here turns out about 25 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:08.930
 width 110 shop somewhere 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.330
 I thought I should live on this board 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.700
 will be troops next to each other somewhere on 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.080
 native 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.260
 the distance of a friend another people twenty 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.750
 because it would not suckers about pulling a couple 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.100
 racer that was soft to sit because 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.100
 what with solid 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.890
 bad fish caught fish is caught and bad 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.230
 do not sit uncomfortably long sit out 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.160
 in one word, but when is monica 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:40.160
 Bottom about gave and more comfortable and cozier 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.320
 hiring what's there to say here and here because 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.260
 that is, from this we will do 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:50.200
 well preliminary that cut out these 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:53.660
 But for the Turks, but I'm even more precise 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.360
 I will set up this case for a boat 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.770
 will need to be generally more accurate 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.690
 move markup 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.570
 ratman strike mark removed all 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.340
 it is painted but also a small garden 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.179
 two boards we wanted but to use on 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.480
 Duku ass where we sit 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:14.300
 like captain up or skipper up 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.730
 will steer here by motor yes these two 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.740
 front it will be his passenger but 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.540
 if i succeed so i try 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.250
 here still make backs 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.770
 because anyway, that's a little bit when 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.130
 more comfort then not so tired and 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:35.180
 not much better feeling well here 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.700
 bye for now remember everything 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.590
 the grandfathers of the membrane walked and the boards stood out 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:46.250
 but now it will be much easier for us 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.650
 draw something on it draw 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.650
 saw through and all that jazz 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:59.550
 good evening 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:03.910
 today we want to show you how to do 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:10.300
 how do we siduhi all spirit it will 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:15.370
 stand in the middle of the boat 2 bones this 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:18.400
 is not inserted stand here on this 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.970
 the front compartment here silent walls 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:28.470
 valued in between their plywood 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:31.690
 here arrived here on 5 foam rubber 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.570
 extend which here is small 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.770
 count ten centimeters 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:42.070
 Shabnam did not hold so foam 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.130
 how to say uneasy they tell us about 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.650
 rubber simple steam can quickly 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.730
 is the side so goes stand out 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:55.150
 it is immediately updated settles and this 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:59.410
 pretty strong will be with us 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:06.220
 was on the main thoughts on what 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:09.269
 he could be covered there 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:17.169
 sort of dismantled went to the conclusion 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:19.690
 big to conclusion wary feet 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:25.360
 young people still have such a number 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:32.000
 Remember we do not know already probably just 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:36.250
 Catherine the second but he is pretty and 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:41.830
 of course does not pass water here and here 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:47.840
 there was such an idea to cover this your and 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:49.540
 fire it make a tight fit on this 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.120
 the seats 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:57.070
 this seat we have I emphasize this 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.890
 there will be a middle seat like this 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:05.990
 make and rear 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:08.870
 are busy pulling a wedge-shaped boat southerner 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.020
 if if you remember i talked about 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.919
 this and so do we pour in here 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:19.220
 is such we can not 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:22.040
 steam can now be about to shoot 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:27.830
 I'll show him something like this 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:30.669
 do here just around the edge that's because she 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.669
 squeezes 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.040
 and there will be no sauce already 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:54.340
 circle then on the front of this 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:59.229
 tried to carve something here with us 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:04.509
 In theory , everything should turn out 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:07.169
 for now we will reveal everything so we 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:13.530
 broke thick here and blame it 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:13.530
 a stapler went through 5-7 centimeters 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:23.259
 We do now began to leave a little bit 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.539
 this side is the back here 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:29.560
 go carefully to turn 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:33.090
 dovorot dovorotaem a little bit tight 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:39.610
 we get this easy one 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:42.580
 pretty comfortable and si sweetheart on 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.560
 fishing it will be a fight and its very nice 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:49.650
 I also sit on a bare board 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.650
 and we will sit on the soft and calm 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:02.380
 I think it will be thought 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:17.680
 now we made it the bottom corner to 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:22.599
 average virreina 1 do for later 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:24.460
 still try here all the same do not think either 

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:28.460
 she will come to think twice how 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.740
 make back because sit 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.630
 it would be much more convenient if you could 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.560
 for something to lean on for 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:38.930
 this case measures will need to back 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.849
 much in the house you will not be so tired and 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:46.009
 fishing anthem walks 

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:49.610
 In general , as it is known that good 

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:54.250
 get used quickly means the only way to 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.250
 and to do it would be necessary even to think while casting
