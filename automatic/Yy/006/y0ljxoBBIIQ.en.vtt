00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
tablets one thing it's slowed me down as

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.880 
tablets one thing it's slowed me down as
a<00:03:52.550> photographer<00:03:53.090> I'm<00:03:53.300> actually<00:03:53.840> taking<00:03:54.350> less

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
a photographer I'm actually taking less

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
photos I'm not just like shooting in

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.910 
photos I'm not just like shooting in
burst<00:03:57.650> mode<00:03:58.060> spraying<00:03:59.060> and<00:03:59.330> praying<00:03:59.770> the<00:04:00.770> last

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.449 
burst mode spraying and praying the last
two<00:04:01.100> weddings<00:04:01.459> I<00:04:01.820> took<00:04:02.240> quite<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.459> substantial

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
two weddings I took quite a substantial

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.000 
two weddings I took quite a substantial
amount<00:04:04.970> less<00:04:05.330> than<00:04:05.660> I<00:04:05.690> would<00:04:05.810> normally<00:04:06.080> with<00:04:06.980> a

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
amount less than I would normally with a

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.420 
amount less than I would normally with a
Nikon

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
Nikon

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.720 
Nikon
but<00:04:08.209> we've<00:04:08.810> got<00:04:08.959> way<00:04:09.260> more<00:04:09.290> keepers<00:04:09.950> so<00:04:10.430> my

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
but we've got way more keepers so my

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.850 
but we've got way more keepers so my
clients<00:04:11.150> were<00:04:11.660> benefiting<00:04:12.590> from<00:04:12.770> that

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
clients were benefiting from that

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.130 
clients were benefiting from that
because<00:04:13.340> this<00:04:14.090> camera<00:04:14.330> does<00:04:14.570> slow<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:14.900> down

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
because this camera does slow you down

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.949 
because this camera does slow you down
and<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:16.190> does<00:04:16.459> get<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:17.270> thinking<00:04:17.720> a<00:04:17.840> little

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
and it does get you thinking a little

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.720 
and it does get you thinking a little
bit<00:04:18.080> more<00:04:18.200> about<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.680> shot<00:04:18.950> so<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.520> that's

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
bit more about the shot so and that's

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.630 
bit more about the shot so and that's
only<00:04:19.910> a<00:04:20.030> good<00:04:20.209> thing<00:04:20.270> so<00:04:21.109> that's<00:04:21.950> it<00:04:22.160> I<00:04:22.340> won't

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
only a good thing so that's it I won't

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.830 
only a good thing so that's it I won't
go<00:04:22.760> on<00:04:22.790> and<00:04:23.030> on<00:04:23.120> about<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.479> because<00:04:23.750> it<00:04:23.960> is<00:04:24.110> as

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
go on and on about it because it is as

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.650 
go on and on about it because it is as
every<00:04:25.080> bit<00:04:25.290> amazing<00:04:26.160> as<00:04:26.360> people<00:04:27.360> have<00:04:27.480> said

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
every bit amazing as people have said

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.230 
every bit amazing as people have said
that<00:04:27.780> said<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.440> it<00:04:28.560> is<00:04:28.740> so<00:04:29.460> I<00:04:29.490> just<00:04:29.970> wanted<00:04:30.180> to

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240

show<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.660> off<00:04:30.750> one<00:04:30.960> more<00:04:31.080> time<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.620> do<00:04:32.100> an

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
show it off one more time and do an

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.830 
show it off one more time and do an
updated<00:04:32.880> video<00:04:33.410> about<00:04:34.410> really<00:04:35.250> I<00:04:35.490> think<00:04:36.150> the
