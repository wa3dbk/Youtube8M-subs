she was younger and he ended up marrying

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.430 
she was younger and he ended up marrying
him<00:01:37.000> they<00:01:37.180> spent<00:01:37.450> their<00:01:37.540> honeymoon<00:01:37.720> in<00:01:38.170> Lone

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
so that I guess he could keep working

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.760 
so that I guess he could keep working
because<00:01:43.540> most<00:01:43.930> of<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:44.110> films<00:01:44.410> were<00:01:44.560> shot

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
because most of the films were shot

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.820 
because most of the films were shot
there<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:46.630> was<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.810> smart<00:01:47.140> businessman<00:01:47.620> just

there it was a smart businessman just

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:58.600 
there it was a smart businessman just
like<00:01:47.950> Jean<00:01:48.370> I<00:01:48.400> guess

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.670 

you
