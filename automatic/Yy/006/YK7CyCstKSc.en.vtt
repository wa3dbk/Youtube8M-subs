00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 We love welcome example 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.779
 with me I have one again 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.490
 experiment box of cosmos 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.550
 rausgeholt natural law of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.089
 experiment box and directly the first 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.390
 try is a cress garden with in the set 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.850
 are contained crisan and you can 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.119
 now here the cress seeds sow for it 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.269
 I have a shell here once 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.330
 bits of kitchen roll and a bit 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.640
 water the same all the same 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.160
 to moisten and I want this cash register 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.280
 sawm here today with you and see 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.230
 that's part of the video and now 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.059
 if the size has grown out then 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.550
 I do more parts so synonymous 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.469
 at least in any case one with it 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.870
 then see how the crisis develops 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.940
 maybe you also have a desire 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.260
 It's fun to watch and it's too 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.149
 really delicious which you can eat nice 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.860
 together with cream cheese for example 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.949
 eat in the morning on the bun 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.850
 that's healthy and really tasty and now 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.579
 it starts directly 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.180
 as the first 30 of a kitchen paper like that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.619
 to strip a bit and tear that 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.400
 then again in small stripes 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:17.189
 and I put that here in my school 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.680
 So in total you should now be four 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.930
 to five small pieces of it have 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.450
 kitchen roll and that here in the shell 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.250
 so interpret and then come my already 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.890
 Crescent garden cress is scattered 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.890
 just a little bit on mine now 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:44.990
 kitchen roll on it and now only missing 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.990
 the water is just fine with water 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.990
 moisten 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.200
 The cress seeds do not seed until when 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.280
 They come in contact with water now 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.810
 Are you in contact with water ? 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.280
 Of course you have to come too 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.840
 always keep a bit wet and you 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.939
 you might see it too 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.159
 do not put it in the hot sun 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.380
 if the whole thing always dries up quietly 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.349
 add some water again and 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.080
 After about three days, these will be 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.880
 seed starts to sprout and then has 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.040
 man beautiful cress i am really 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.769
 curious what that looks like when out 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.200
 the crisis will only be small germs and 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.940
 then right small plants I heard 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.590
 Of course you keep up to date 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.110
 Maybe you have a lot of fun 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.880
 to see it as soon as it is new to me 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.360
 I will be back to a video 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.040
