and<00:00:06.109> I'm<00:00:07.109> going<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.379> talk<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.919> little<00:00:08.189> bit<00:00:08.370> about

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
and I'm going to talk a little bit about

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.740 
and I'm going to talk a little bit about
some<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.150> pad<00:00:09.599> apps<00:00:09.900> that<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.800> can<00:00:10.830> use<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.370> PE

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
some I pad apps that you can use in PE

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.970 
some I pad apps that you can use in PE
now<00:00:12.750> I'm<00:00:12.929> not<00:00:13.049> going<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.200> talk<00:00:13.349> about<00:00:13.410> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
now I'm not going to talk about the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.060 
now I'm not going to talk about the
usual<00:00:14.490> fare<00:00:15.170> with<00:00:16.170> things<00:00:16.350> like<00:00:16.500> coaches<00:00:16.949> I

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
usual fare with things like coaches I

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.550 
usual fare with things like coaches I
and<00:00:17.400> what-have-you<00:00:17.940> which<00:00:18.630> are<00:00:18.869> really

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
and what-have-you which are really

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.349 
and what-have-you which are really
really<00:00:20.130> closely<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.670> specifically<00:00:21.119> linked

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
really closely and specifically linked

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.390 
really closely and specifically linked
to<00:00:21.480> PE<00:00:21.689> but<00:00:22.560> I'm<00:00:22.680> going<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.890> put<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> few<00:00:23.250> apps

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
to PE but I'm going to put a few apps

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.089 
to PE but I'm going to put a few apps
which<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:23.970> use<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.390> PE<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:25.380> might<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
which you can use in PE that might be a

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.529 
which you can use in PE that might be a
little<00:00:26.430> bit<00:00:26.519> different<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.330> wouldn't

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
little bit different that you wouldn't

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.939 
little bit different that you wouldn't
normally<00:00:27.630> think<00:00:28.080> about<00:00:28.199> when<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.710> think

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
normally think about when you think

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.070 
normally think about when you think
about<00:00:29.010> PE<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.760> how<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.910> might<00:00:30.090> use<00:00:30.150> apps<00:00:30.689> and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
about PE and how you might use apps and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.479 
about PE and how you might use apps and
Technology<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.189> PE

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
Technology and PE

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.520 
Technology and PE
so<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> first<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:33.870> I'm<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> look<00:00:34.170> at<00:00:34.410> is

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
so the first one I'm going to look at is

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.569 
so the first one I'm going to look at is
one<00:00:34.680> called<00:00:34.890> Note<00:00:35.130> shelf

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
one called Note shelf

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.850 
one called Note shelf
it's<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.210> note-taking<00:00:36.690> tool<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.710> what's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it's a note-taking tool but what's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.250 
it's a note-taking tool but what's
particularly<00:00:38.280> useful<00:00:38.670> about<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:40.200> you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
particularly useful about it is that you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.950 
particularly useful about it is that you
can<00:00:40.410> actually<00:00:40.559> make<00:00:40.950> your<00:00:41.390> little<00:00:42.390> notebooks

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
can actually make your little notebooks

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.369 
can actually make your little notebooks
and<00:00:43.340> then<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:45.149> put<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.690> whatever<00:00:45.989> paper

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
and then you can put on whatever paper

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.430 
and then you can put on whatever paper
you<00:00:46.530> want<00:00:46.890> onto<00:00:47.160> them<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:48.390> example<00:00:48.899> you

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
you want onto them so for example you

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.350 
you want onto them so for example you
might<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:50.250> notebook<00:00:50.579> which<00:00:51.000> has<00:00:51.149> got

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
might have a notebook which has got

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.270 
might have a notebook which has got
score<00:00:51.719> sheets<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.320> by<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.129> can

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
score sheets in it by the one you can

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.670 
score sheets in it by the one you can
see<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:53.789> or<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.899> could<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.620> have

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
see here or it could be that you have

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.610 
see here or it could be that you have
another<00:00:56.610> one<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.420> basketball<00:00:58.079> court<00:00:58.379> on

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
another one with a basketball court on

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.340 
another one with a basketball court on
or<00:00:59.030> it<00:01:00.030> could<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.690> you've<00:01:00.840> got<00:01:01.050> one<00:01:01.230> with

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
or it could be that you've got one with

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.009 
or it could be that you've got one with
a<00:01:01.379> football<00:01:01.649> pitch<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.840> what's<00:01:03.840> really

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
a football pitch on it and what's really

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.289 
a football pitch on it and what's really
good<00:01:04.290> about<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.710> app<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.909> you

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
good about this app is that you can you

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.950 
good about this app is that you can you
know<00:01:06.420> only<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:06.900> draw<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
know only just draw on it like so and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.140 
know only just draw on it like so and
what<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:11.159> highlight<00:01:11.939> certain

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
what have you you can highlight certain

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.380 
what have you you can highlight certain
areas<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.790> rub<00:01:14.970> things<00:01:15.210> out

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
areas to like so you can rub things out

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.899 
areas to like so you can rub things out
as<00:01:15.509> well<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.869> want<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.520> just<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.700> that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
as well if you want to just like that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.690 
as well if you want to just like that

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you can also add text so if you want to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.469 
you can also add text so if you want to
use<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.090> your<00:01:21.439> team<00:01:22.850> play<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> sheet<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
use it for your team play a sheet to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.120 
use it for your team play a sheet to
show<00:01:24.659> who's<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> team<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.650> week<00:01:25.890> for

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
show who's on the team this week for

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.190 
show who's on the team this week for
your<00:01:26.220> match<00:01:26.460> what<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:27.990> that

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
your match what have you you can do that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.130 
your match what have you you can do that
you<00:01:28.950> could<00:01:29.100> also<00:01:29.280> add<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.210> other<00:01:30.329> things<00:01:30.659> you

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
you could also add on other things you

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.690 
you could also add on other things you
can<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.380> multiple<00:01:31.680> pages<00:01:31.979> into<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.460> as

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
can have multiple pages into this as

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.940 
can have multiple pages into this as
well<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.049> you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.170> use<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.439> over<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.740> over

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
well so you can use it over and over

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.230 
well so you can use it over and over
again<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.340> keep<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> for<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> record<00:01:36.060> for

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
again and keep it for a record for

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.719 
again and keep it for a record for
different<00:01:36.450> things<00:01:37.130> it's<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.400> quite<00:01:38.579> nice

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
different things it's really quite nice

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.060 
different things it's really quite nice
as<00:01:38.939> well<00:01:39.119> if<00:01:39.240> you're<00:01:39.360> talking<00:01:39.600> after<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.560> match

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
as well if you're talking after a match

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.780 
as well if you're talking after a match
this<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.060> what's<00:01:42.240> used<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.720> issues<00:01:43.110> or<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.500> PE

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
this is what's used in issues or in PE

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.120 
this is what's used in issues or in PE
