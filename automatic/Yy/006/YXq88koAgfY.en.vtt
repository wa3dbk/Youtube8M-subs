00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.800 
that just it gives me such a flawless
finish<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.250> actually<00:01:44.579> quite<00:01:44.729> thick<00:01:45.149> so

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
finish this is actually quite thick so

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.230 
finish this is actually quite thick so
it<00:01:45.840> doesn't<00:01:46.710> kind<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.369> come<00:01:47.850> off<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.180> soon

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
it doesn't kind of just come off as soon

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.690 
it doesn't kind of just come off as soon
as<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.600> then<00:01:48.750> move<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.110> around<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.460> here

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
as you then move it around and it's here

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.929 
as you then move it around and it's here
to<00:01:50.820> stay<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.420> was<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.810> good<00:01:52.229> they<00:01:53.130> do<00:01:53.189> loads

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
to stay and it was so good they do loads

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.969 
to stay and it was so good they do loads
of<00:01:54.240> different<00:01:54.420> colors<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.170> these<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.860> you're

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
of different colors in these so you're

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.520 
of different colors in these so you're
not<00:01:56.100> really<00:01:56.159> limited<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> range<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.630> I

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530

concealer you would not know it though

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.860 
concealer you would not know it though
because<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:11.270> label<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> front

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
because the label on the front

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.360 
because the label on the front
has<00:02:12.989> basically<00:02:13.260> come<00:02:13.530> off<00:02:13.709> which<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.069> really

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
little secret weapon this one is in

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.830 
little secret weapon this one is in
light<00:02:25.709> too<00:02:26.180> again<00:02:27.180> they<00:02:27.330> have<00:02:27.510> quite<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.750> few

different<00:02:28.260> colors<00:02:28.409> and<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.610> definitely

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940

i'd<00:02:30.720> say<00:02:30.989> one<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.230> my<00:02:31.440> go-to<00:02:31.650> concealers<00:02:32.549> i

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
i'd say one of my go-to concealers i

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.339 
i'd say one of my go-to concealers i
think<00:02:32.879> it's<00:02:32.970> probably<00:02:33.150> out<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:33.599> one<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.140> the

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
think it's probably out this one and the

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.770 
think it's probably out this one and the
one<00:02:34.530> I've<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:34.829> spoken<00:02:34.980> about<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.579> they<00:02:36.480> are

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
one I've just spoken about and they are

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.449 
one I've just spoken about and they are
just<00:02:37.140> oh<00:02:37.379> they're<00:02:37.920> great<00:02:38.010> they're<00:02:38.250> quite

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
just oh they're great they're quite

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.940 
just oh they're great they're quite
similar<00:02:38.909> in<00:02:39.150> texture<00:02:39.629> and<00:02:39.989> it's<00:02:40.650> just

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
similar in texture and it's just

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.559 
similar in texture and it's just
obviously<00:02:41.250> an<00:02:41.370> alternative<00:02:41.940> brand<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.390> think

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569

obviously an alternative brand I think
this<00:02:42.659> one's<00:02:42.900> actually<00:02:43.019> slightly<00:02:43.409> cheaper

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
this one's actually slightly cheaper

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.530 
this one's actually slightly cheaper

mixed<00:06:34.380> reviews<00:06:34.740> about<00:06:34.770> them<00:06:35.220> but<00:06:35.700> I<00:06:35.880> actually

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
mixed reviews about them but I actually

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.730 
mixed reviews about them but I actually
like<00:06:37.009> them<00:06:37.340> I<00:06:37.490> think<00:06:38.060> they<00:06:38.210> do<00:06:38.330> amazing<00:06:39.080> makeup

choices<00:06:40.310> and<00:06:40.580> a<00:06:40.970> lot<00:06:41.389> of<00:06:41.419> like<00:06:41.810> variety<00:06:41.990> and

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
choices and a lot of like variety and

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.379 
choices and a lot of like variety and
for<00:06:43.039> the<00:06:43.129> money<00:06:43.280> that<00:06:43.340> you<00:06:43.490> pay<00:06:43.669> for<00:06:43.940> I<00:06:44.150> think

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:44.389 
for the money that you pay for I think

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:46.300 
for the money that you pay for I think
like<00:06:44.569> this<00:06:44.780> is<00:06:44.960> amazing<00:06:45.229> none<00:06:45.979> of<00:06:46.099> the<00:06:46.190> other

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
like this is amazing none of the other

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.189 
like this is amazing none of the other
ones<00:06:46.550> have<00:06:46.849> got<00:06:47.030> like<00:06:47.240> this<00:06:47.449> much<00:06:47.720> of<00:06:47.870> a<00:06:47.930> range

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 
ones have got like this much of a range

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.779 
ones have got like this much of a range
and<00:06:48.530> there's<00:06:48.680> many<00:06:48.860> different<00:06:48.949> things<00:06:49.400> in<00:06:49.639> one

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:49.789 
and there's many different things in one

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:51.790 
and there's many different things in one
palette<00:06:50.180> so<00:06:50.659> I<00:06:50.690> think<00:06:50.960> that's<00:06:51.199> really<00:06:51.500> cool

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
palette so I think that's really cool

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.230 
palette so I think that's really cool
that<00:06:51.949> you've<00:06:52.039> got<00:06:52.190> the<00:06:52.280> option<00:06:52.430> there<00:06:52.789> if<00:06:52.970> you

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
that you've got the option there if you

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.559 
that you've got the option there if you
want<00:06:53.479> it<00:06:53.710> again<00:06:54.710> this<00:06:54.919> is<00:06:55.129> just<00:06:55.370> more<00:06:56.210> of<00:06:56.270> a

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:56.569 
want it again this is just more of a

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:58.809 
want it again this is just more of a
like<00:06:57.169> solid<00:06:57.620> base<00:06:57.889> so<00:06:58.129> when<00:06:58.280> you<00:06:58.370> put<00:06:58.550> it<00:06:58.639> on<00:06:58.759> it

00:06:58.809 --> 00:06:58.819 
like solid base so when you put it on it

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.790 
like solid base so when you put it on it
would<00:06:59.210> be<00:06:59.360> a<00:06:59.539> lot<00:06:59.780> more<00:06:59.840> solid<00:07:00.409> than<00:07:00.440> the

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
would be a lot more solid than the

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.219 
would be a lot more solid than the
creams<00:07:01.190> so<00:07:01.849> this<00:07:02.210> is<00:07:02.240> going<00:07:02.539> to<00:07:02.629> stay<00:07:02.840> in<00:07:02.870> place

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:03.229 
creams so this is going to stay in place

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:05.950 
creams so this is going to stay in place
and<00:07:03.669> yeah<00:07:04.669> obviously<00:07:05.000> again<00:07:05.509> if<00:07:05.690> you've<00:07:05.810> got<00:07:05.930> a

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
and yeah obviously again if you've got a

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.510 
and yeah obviously again if you've got a
bit<00:07:06.139> of<00:07:06.169> a<00:07:06.289> oily<00:07:06.470> skin<00:07:06.710> I<00:07:06.800> would<00:07:06.949> probably<00:07:07.129> stay

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
bit of a oily skin I would probably stay

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.129 
bit of a oily skin I would probably stay
away<00:07:07.699> from<00:07:07.759> these<00:07:08.060> stick<00:07:08.479> wars<00:07:08.690> the<00:07:08.870> creams

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139 
away from these stick wars the creams

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.499 
away from these stick wars the creams
but<00:07:09.680> if<00:07:09.830> you're<00:07:09.949> not<00:07:10.129> worried<00:07:10.879> about<00:07:10.940> that<00:07:11.090> and

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:11.509 
but if you're not worried about that and

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:13.029
