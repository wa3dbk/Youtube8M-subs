00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.580
 Y 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.920
 hello everyone welcome to negrÃ­n is yes 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.870
 you want to know how you are manicured with 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.340
 water ticas of a whole keep looking 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.220
 you will need a base polish 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.910
 preferably white water dicas of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.360
 whole nail scissors a container with 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.230
 water toilet paper a stick of 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.989
 Orange and top coat probably also 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.270
 you need nail polish removers and a cotton swab 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.640
 or something similar to clean to do 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.990
 this manicure we are going to use water 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.990
 whole nail 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.570
 there are also smaller designs 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.059
 to decorate some part of the nail but 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.579
 usually these are not usually 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.739
 problems of applying however 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.129
 use the largest designs can 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.409
 be more complicated this is that I'm going 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.990
 to use I are from born pretty store 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.990
 but you can use the ones you want 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.350
 What I do notice is that if it's the first 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.990
 Once you use them or have your nails 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.479
 too large depending on what water 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.119
 you use need to take more than 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.429
 a sheet or similar designs because 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.340
 example in these the space is very 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:29.020
 appraised although in my case it came to me just 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.320
 to do both hands 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.719
 some water dicas are transparent and 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.920
 therefore it is necessary to start by applying 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.439
 a base polish 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.159
 preferably white or the bottom of the 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.780
 they are not water but still 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.299
 necessary for the trick that I'm going to 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.789
 teach if you want you can give two 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.520
 layers in case they are not 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.950
 individual you will have to cut them 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.289
 for this we start measuring more or less 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.740
 the length of the nail on paper and 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.539
 we cut a strip as I told you in these 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.479
 you have to calculate the space very well 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.500
 and think very well before cutting the 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.500
 piece that you need 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.930
 then you have to cut in width to 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.390
 we have to calculate that we leave a 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.819
 little more space on the sides than the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.580
 width of the nail since the nails are 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.170
 curved and we will need a little more 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.319
 what may seem at first glance 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.650
 for example these are my bits from 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.370
 the little finger to the thumb we take the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.370
 Protective plastic 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.560
 and we put them in water about 15 seconds 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.720
 depending on the water and lime some 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.860
 They break more easily if you wet them a lot 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.870
 others 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.960
 Although the monks speak to us, they give and they do not 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.460
 hit do not skip this step but I'm going 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.110
 to teach a trick so that although not 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.110
 They are very soft 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.909
 made of water and the gently 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.860
 take off the paper you can help you 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.980
 some tweezers if you want but if they are 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.019
 rigid you can do it with hand 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.569
 you put in the nail more or less input 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.599
 and you remove the excess water with paper 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.140
 hygienic do not use cotton or they will stick 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.140
 the threads 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.290
 you do not stick or you have wrinkles 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.000
 no problem here I teach you a trick 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.190
 that is even valid if they have 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.850
 worked perfectly if you want that 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.550
 be easier to clean 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.760
 we throw a good layer of top coat 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.870
 all the nail with care not to go out and 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.250
 it will begin to dissolve the lime water 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.100
 we wait a few seconds for it to 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.720
 attach the top coat to the enamel 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.140
 base 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.030
 with an orange stick or something similar 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.160
 we remove the leftover pieces by pushing 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.040
 Carefully from the end of the nail 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.579
 outwards you will see that it comes out almost whole 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.170
 and leaving a perfect line finally 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.750
 with a little nail polish remover and a 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.070
 stick or something similar we clean the 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.070
 remains that may have remained 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.330
 and our manicure with water dick als 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:44.379
