00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
the typical scenario is a design school

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.369 
the typical scenario is a design school
have<00:00:52.699> an<00:00:53.300> architecture<00:00:53.840> department<00:00:54.320> or

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
have an architecture department or

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.509 
have an architecture department or
graphic<00:00:54.710> design<00:00:54.920> department<00:00:55.399> it's

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
graphic design department it's

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.400 
graphic design department it's
relatively<00:00:55.969> small<00:00:56.449> departments<00:00:57.109> within<00:00:57.260> a

relatively small departments within a

relatively small departments within a
very<00:00:57.590> large<00:00:57.890> University<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:59.239> no<00:00:59.390> matter<00:00:59.510> what

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
very large University so no matter what

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.450 
very large University so no matter what
you<00:00:59.870> might<00:01:00.079> think<00:01:00.140> about<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:00.949> potential<00:01:01.280> of

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
you might think about the potential of

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.950 
you might think about the potential of
the<00:01:01.550> relationship<00:01:02.000> is<00:01:02.120> very<00:01:02.179> half<00:01:02.570> designed

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
the relationship is very half designed

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.299 
the relationship is very half designed
to<00:01:03.079> have<00:01:03.199> any<00:01:03.350> great<00:01:03.620> voice<00:01:03.859> within<00:01:04.129> that

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
to have any great voice within that

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.370 
to have any great voice within that
institution<00:01:04.910> or<00:01:05.600> else<00:01:05.780> it's<00:01:05.930> a<00:01:06.020> standalone

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
institution or else it's a standalone

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.050 
institution or else it's a standalone
you<00:01:06.980> know<00:01:07.070> like<00:01:07.340> many<00:01:07.730> of<00:01:07.820> our<00:01:07.880> competitors

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
you know like many of our competitors

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.150 
you know like many of our competitors
are<00:01:08.480> standalone<00:01:08.840> institution<00:01:09.620> so<00:01:09.800> they<00:01:09.920> don't

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
are standalone institution so they don't

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.220 
are standalone institution so they don't
have<00:01:10.400> that<00:01:10.670> university<00:01:11.150> context<00:01:11.540> we<00:01:12.020> are<00:01:12.140> in

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
have that university context we are in

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.900 
have that university context we are in
this<00:01:12.320> in-between<00:01:12.610> State<00:01:13.610> which<00:01:13.760> is

incredibly exciting which is where

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.520 
incredibly exciting which is where
basically<00:01:17.570> nearly<00:01:17.840> fifty<00:01:18.110> percent<00:01:18.320> of<00:01:18.470> the

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
choices about how to construct things

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.899

social consequences increasingly we're
asking<00:02:09.009> design<00:02:09.280> students<00:02:09.849> to<00:02:10.299> not<00:02:10.539> just

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
asking design students to not just

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.789 
asking design students to not just
design<00:02:11.290> something<00:02:11.879> but<00:02:12.879> also<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.590> better<00:02:14.590> be

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
design something but also to better be

particular things are doing that they

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.869 
particular things are doing that they

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
have they're getting lectures talking

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.550 
have they're getting lectures talking
about<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.150> ethical<00:02:28.450> implications<00:02:28.690> of

about the ethical implications of

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.050 
about the ethical implications of
working<00:02:29.890> with<00:02:30.010> various<00:02:30.220> materials<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:30.879> furs

working with various materials and furs

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.250 
working with various materials and furs
and<00:02:31.239> what<00:02:31.359> have<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.540> now<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.019> we're<00:02:32.170> not

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
and what have you now so we're not

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.420 
and what have you now so we're not
telling<00:02:32.470> students<00:02:32.920> they<00:02:32.980> should<00:02:33.160> or<00:02:33.280> should

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
telling students they should or should

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.640 
telling students they should or should
not<00:02:33.459> do<00:02:33.819> things<00:02:34.030> but<00:02:34.720> we<00:02:34.810> are<00:02:34.930> asking<00:02:35.290> students

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
not do things but we are asking students

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.949 
not do things but we are asking students
to<00:02:35.829> simply<00:02:36.579> be<00:02:36.700> able<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.090> articulate<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.780> take

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
to simply be able to articulate and take

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.259 
to simply be able to articulate and take
a<00:02:38.040> personal<00:02:39.040> position<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.239> is

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
a personal position so this is

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.879 
a personal position so this is
increasingly<00:02:40.840> becoming<00:02:41.019> part<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.739> the

increasingly becoming part of the

increasingly becoming part of the

new york city is like you couldn't get
better<00:02:52.659> I<00:02:52.900> mean<00:02:53.170> there's<00:02:53.319> maybe<00:02:53.439> two<00:02:53.620> or<00:02:53.650> three

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
other cities in the world that would be

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.600 
other cities in the world that would be
comparable<00:02:55.629> but<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:56.170> often<00:02:56.709> compare<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.340> to

comparable but I often compare it to

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.210 
comparable but I often compare it to
