00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 I prefer not confirmed it we have to move 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.050
 but the Dutch will follow that day 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.180
 inside because it's very cold because we started at half past four 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.159
 the poet and musician charly tantes 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:17.109
 what good 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:18.859
 pd I put it 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.039
 I put it to pastore by phishing or an equal horror procedure 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.539
 percent stretching of pig's leg 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.489
 a lot of contract for 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.609
 but at no time despite not putting the opposite 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.090
 e melo 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.130
 I saved it 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.130
 the bridge lamented that what is there in Germany 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.720
 he arrived even today he pays red 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.930
 according to the note 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.040
 p taking into account what kicked recent titi with the theme of Brazil that 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.880
 want the prize 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.160
 in the path 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.690
 efe almost almost tomorrow as it is the final because it leaves a major obstacle 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.020
 I'm noticing the importance of that party and not so much Brazil 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.090
 and after that of mexico and after the great principle that we had in case 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.910
 I thought about having so much gala in the team for the game tomorrow and 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.090
 a little bit more of overalls events that are talked about so much 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.090
 of another type of game the goal for him to balance the fire that has this 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.570
 top selection 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.990
 racconto you said it and one in my book site next to worse 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.660
 efe 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.490
 rivero 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.330
 name a woman that you make a million squeezed so long 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.590
 but beware that you have to answer to remember the beginning of the question 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.820
 we arrived we arrived at this instance with this team 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.070
 percent 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.360
 we 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.570
 we show a team 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.160
 offensive 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
 and with balance in the midfield 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.020
 back and forth 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.020
 cear we have no problem lottery 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.220
 I'm not here to change or improvise 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.340
 at that moment 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.319
 Not as I said respect to everyone 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.629
 but I'm afraid of anyone 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.659
 Call yourself whatever you call it 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.339
 I have players chose and 23 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.339
 and I'm proud to have them 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.749
 as 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.379
 neither players nor selected 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.979
 and now that 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.289
 until now 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.289
 so far I have only gratitude for these players 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.049
 so it's done on the court and so it does not come out so I'm not going to change 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:34.590
 I'm going to see
