00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
his way with that jab and started moving

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.210 
his way with that jab and started moving
around<00:04:07.129> a<00:04:07.250> lot<00:04:07.370> better<00:04:08.049> so<00:04:09.049> Pacquiao<00:04:09.680> pretty

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
around a lot better so Pacquiao pretty

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.559 
around a lot better so Pacquiao pretty
much<00:04:10.370> couldn't<00:04:10.609> afford<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.849> jab<00:04:11.060> at<00:04:11.090> that<00:04:11.329> point

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
much couldn't afford a jab at that point

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.330 
much couldn't afford a jab at that point
could<00:04:12.260> have<00:04:12.349> been<00:04:12.410> a<00:04:12.470> combination<00:04:12.709> of<00:04:13.099> paki

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
could have been a combination of paki

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.800 
could have been a combination of paki
I'll<00:04:13.549> just<00:04:13.760> wanted<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.060> get<00:04:14.120> that<00:04:14.180> knockout<00:04:14.629> so

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
I'll just wanted to get that knockout so

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.939 
I'll just wanted to get that knockout so
he<00:04:14.870> was<00:04:15.019> willing<00:04:15.139> to<00:04:15.290> walk<00:04:15.410> through<00:04:15.680> them<00:04:15.829> but

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949 
he was willing to walk through them but

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:17.589 
he was willing to walk through them but
you<00:04:16.459> know<00:04:16.549> Pacquiao's<00:04:16.940> not<00:04:17.150> really<00:04:17.359> good<00:04:17.479> at

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:17.599 
you know Pacquiao's not really good at

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:19.770 
you know Pacquiao's not really good at
avoiding<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:18.019> jap<00:04:18.199> if<00:04:18.349> you<00:04:18.440> have<00:04:18.590> a<00:04:18.620> decent<00:04:18.889> jab

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
avoiding a jap if you have a decent jab

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.350 
avoiding a jap if you have a decent jab
it<00:04:20.780> seemed<00:04:21.229> that<00:04:21.349> Timothy<00:04:22.130> Bradley<00:04:22.370> made<00:04:23.180> an

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
it seemed that Timothy Bradley made an

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.719 
it seemed that Timothy Bradley made an
adjustment<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:24.140> it's<00:04:25.130> interesting<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:25.700> think

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
adjustment and it's interesting to think

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.520 
adjustment and it's interesting to think
that<00:04:26.090> you<00:04:26.599> know<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.810> man<00:04:26.930> was<00:04:27.110> able<00:04:27.200> to<00:04:27.409> make

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
that you know the man was able to make

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.500 
that you know the man was able to make
an<00:04:27.650> adjustment<00:04:27.770> after<00:04:28.219> taking<00:04:28.550> rounds<00:04:28.880> around

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
an adjustment after taking rounds around

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.330 
an adjustment after taking rounds around
rounds<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.050> rounds<00:04:30.110> of<00:04:30.440> punishment<00:04:30.860> so

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
rounds and rounds of punishment so

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.040 
rounds and rounds of punishment so
that's<00:04:31.460> one<00:04:31.610> thing<00:04:31.760> I<00:04:31.910> can<00:04:32.150> say<00:04:32.420> for<00:04:32.450> Timothy

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
that's one thing I can say for Timothy

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.790 
that's one thing I can say for Timothy
Bradley<00:04:33.230> that<00:04:33.620> is<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:34.190> plus<00:04:34.810> on<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:36.200> flip<00:04:36.770> side

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
Bradley that is a plus on the flip side

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.900 
Bradley that is a plus on the flip side
of<00:04:37.010> that<00:04:37.100> on<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.880> can<00:04:38.570> say<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:38.930> uh<00:04:39.760> you<00:04:40.760> know
