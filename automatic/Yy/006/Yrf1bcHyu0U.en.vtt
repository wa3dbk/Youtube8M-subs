pretty much flying all over the place at
the<00:00:18.710> moment<00:00:18.860> I've<00:00:19.190> got<00:00:19.490> a<00:00:19.520> scene<00:00:19.880> here<00:00:19.910> set<00:00:20.330> up

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
the moment I've got a scene here set up

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.150 
the moment I've got a scene here set up
we<00:00:20.660> have<00:00:20.810> created<00:00:21.290> a<00:00:21.470> simple<00:00:21.740> wall<00:00:22.010> with

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
we have created a simple wall with

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.400 
we have created a simple wall with
rock-type<00:00:22.430> texture<00:00:23.060> and<00:00:23.270> place<00:00:23.960> it<00:00:24.110> on<00:00:24.200> top<00:00:24.230> of

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
rock-type texture and place it on top of

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.330 
rock-type texture and place it on top of
a<00:00:24.710> ground<00:00:25.040> plan<00:00:26.439> and<00:00:27.439> as<00:00:27.590> I<00:00:27.740> scrub<00:00:28.130> through<00:00:28.250> the

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
a ground plan and as I scrub through the

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.190 
a ground plan and as I scrub through the
timeline<00:00:28.400> you'll<00:00:29.000> see<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.480> world<00:00:29.720> explodes

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200

out<00:00:30.500> into<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:30.919> field<00:00:31.189> to<00:00:33.550> do<00:00:34.550> this<00:00:34.730> I've<00:00:35.030> used

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
out into the field to do this I've used

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.450 
out into the field to do this I've used
a<00:00:35.690> mix<00:00:35.900> of<00:00:36.020> passive<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:36.530> rigid<00:00:36.800> bodies<00:00:37.070> the

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
trunks and then added fields to those

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.540 
trunks and then added fields to those
chunks<00:00:42.079> including<00:00:42.469> a<00:00:42.500> radio<00:00:42.800> field<00:00:43.070> gravity

animation<00:00:54.489> ok<00:00:55.489> let's<00:00:55.670> get<00:00:55.820> into<00:00:55.969> it<00:00:56.090> start<00:00:56.570> by

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
animation ok let's get into it start by

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.569 
animation ok let's get into it start by
creating<00:00:57.019> a<00:00:57.170> polygon<00:00:57.559> plane<00:00:57.859> and<00:00:58.070> place<00:00:58.399> it

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
creating a polygon plane and place it

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.849 
creating a polygon plane and place it
over<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.760> gap<00:00:59.000> in<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.329> wall<00:00:59.510> this<00:01:00.320> plane<00:01:00.649> will

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
over the gap in the wall this plane will

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.650 
over the gap in the wall this plane will
be<00:01:00.949> used<00:01:01.219> as<00:01:01.429> a<00:01:01.460> middle<00:01:01.879> where<00:01:02.089> the<00:01:02.210> particles

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
be used as a middle where the particles

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.620 
be used as a middle where the particles
we<00:01:02.899> created<00:01:03.289> from<00:01:04.030> once<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.150> particles<00:01:05.570> are

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
we created from once the particles are

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.570

next<00:01:37.430> we<00:01:37.520> want<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.759> key<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.360> rate<00:01:38.600> attribute

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
next we want to key the rate attribute

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.010 
next we want to key the rate attribute
what<00:01:39.799> we<00:01:39.920> want<00:01:40.130> is<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.640> first<00:01:40.909> 24<00:01:41.390> frames<00:01:41.689> to

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
what we want is the first 24 frames to

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.469 
what we want is the first 24 frames to
be<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:42.170> still<00:01:42.619> shot<00:01:42.649> then<00:01:43.280> at<00:01:43.460> frame<00:01:43.729> 25<00:01:44.180> that's

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
be a still shot then at frame 25 that's

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.899 
be a still shot then at frame 25 that's
when<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.750> explosion<00:01:45.259> begins<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.520> moved<00:01:46.790> to

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
when the explosion begins so moved to

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.240 
when the explosion begins so moved to
frame<00:01:47.119> 24<00:01:47.600> in<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.750> timeline<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.409> keep<00:01:49.070> the

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
frame 24 in the timeline and keep the

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.270 
frame 24 in the timeline and keep the
rate<00:01:49.490> at<00:01:49.700> 0<00:01:50.149> then<00:01:50.600> move<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.960> move<00:01:51.439> to<00:01:51.590> frame<00:01:51.799> 25

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
rate at 0 then move the move to frame 25

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.109 
rate at 0 then move the move to frame 25
and<00:01:52.579> care<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:52.880> 3,000<00:01:53.750> in<00:01:54.380> at<00:01:54.680> frame<00:01:54.920> 26<00:01:55.430> put<00:01:56.030> it

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
and care to 3,000 in at frame 26 put it

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.510 
and care to 3,000 in at frame 26 put it
back<00:01:56.210> down<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.570> zero<00:01:56.600> this<00:01:57.500> creates<00:01:58.009> a<00:01:58.189> quick

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
back down to zero this creates a quick

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.029 
back down to zero this creates a quick
burst<00:01:58.700> of<00:01:58.969> particles<00:01:59.479> ok<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.259> can<00:02:00.500> now<00:02:00.649> hide

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
burst of particles ok you can now hide

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.620 
burst of particles ok you can now hide
or<00:02:01.219> delete<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.640> plane<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:02.360> should<00:02:02.539> be

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
or delete the plane and you should be

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.929 
or delete the plane and you should be
able<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.930> see<00:02:03.259> a<00:02:03.500> hop<00:02:03.680> are<00:02:03.860> gray<00:02:04.250> points

okay<00:04:28.780> we're<00:04:29.020> slowly<00:04:29.290> getting<00:04:29.620> there<00:04:29.820> if<00:04:30.820> you

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
okay we're slowly getting there if you

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.970 
okay we're slowly getting there if you
highlight<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.750> particles<00:04:32.230> you<00:04:32.440> can<00:04:32.590> see<00:04:32.830> how

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
highlight the particles you can see how

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.040 
highlight the particles you can see how
fast<00:04:33.220> they<00:04:33.490> spread<00:04:33.730> across<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.150> scene<00:04:34.420> so<00:04:34.960> you

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
fast they spread across the scene so you

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.840 
fast they spread across the scene so you
might<00:04:35.200> want<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:35.530> do<00:04:35.890> some<00:04:36.100> touch-ups<00:04:36.340> on<00:04:36.730> the

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
might want to do some touch-ups on the

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.000 
might want to do some touch-ups on the
turbulence<00:04:37.300> on<00:04:37.390> radio<00:04:37.720> field<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.260> put<00:04:38.920> the

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
turbulence on radio field and put the

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.580 
turbulence on radio field and put the
magnitude<00:04:39.460> up<00:04:39.640> and<00:04:39.820> down<00:04:40.000> on<00:04:40.270> frame<00:04:40.660> 25<00:04:41.140> a<00:04:41.200> bit

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
magnitude up and down on frame 25 a bit

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.040 
magnitude up and down on frame 25 a bit
to<00:04:41.770> get<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.370> look<00:04:42.520> you're<00:04:42.670> going<00:04:42.820> for<00:04:42.990> so<00:04:43.990> you

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
to get the look you're going for so you

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.130 
to get the look you're going for so you
can<00:04:44.200> touch<00:04:44.470> up<00:04:44.650> on<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:44.890> later
