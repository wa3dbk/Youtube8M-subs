00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.519
 consider a set of a series of lego city 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.440
 Here such a garbage truck immediately say it 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.460

 article 44 32 5 to 12 years 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.869
 I purchased this model for one purpose. 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.660
 to use it in your new 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.500
 project in his new cartoons 3 parts 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.599
 cities x 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.239
 Well, who watches my first channel will understand about 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.360
 than i say pay attention to this 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.910
 box here we have two little people well and 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.570
 the car itself is a truck in on the carriage 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.000
 trash on the other side of us too 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.719
 It shows how what works where 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.660
 located 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.940
 but let's get down and open this 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.940
 box we press our paper flaps and 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 we open 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:04.170
 inside we have several packages following 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.780
 we have the first biggest package here 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.720
 various details including legs 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 people some clubs and so on 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.380
 next we have packet number two 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.840
 in size they are about the same here 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.210
 we have records 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.890
 well and everything else let's see what we have 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.170
 there is still nothing inside the inside 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.590
 here's the instruction itself and let's look through 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.520
 here everything is clear enough available 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.939
 Well, in the end a small advertisement 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.030
 here 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:43.680
 sites and of course we have inside 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.950
 and stickers car stickers 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.220
 number badge and and logos 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.490
 Well, let's proceed to the assembly 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.560
 of this lego set 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.600
 but here we have collected our set let's 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.049
 consider it closer let's start with 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.570
 little men the first copy is with us 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.930
 middle aged man 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.229
 his cap is removed from 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.479
 there is wearing overalls in general typical 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.230
 scavenger and of course 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.620
 one-sided face further we go it 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.250
 workmate woman costume exactly the same 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.870
 the only difference is the face itself 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.540
 This is the main character of this set. 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:32.380
 Well, remove them to the side and continue 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.540
 next we have the most simple trash 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.110
 tanks that open inside us 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.489
 something like garbage 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.720
 there is also 1 tank of a different color and 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:49.530
 here we can find more interesting 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.390
 spoiled banana and 2 rotten fish 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.220
 quite interesting elements that 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.350
 can be used in other sets 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.830
 as well as all that is well here 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.760
 such two barrels at the first and second 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.940
 there is 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.330
 caps will say even more here with us 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.600
 there are more details here 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.510
 also 2 caps 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.720
 our garbage trucks here most 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:24.430
 interesting first thing that catches your eye 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.980
 this cabin itself unfortunately doors like 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.870
 such you will not find therefore if you 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.450
 want to put inside a little man 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.370
 you have to remove the roof she is removed 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.750
 quite simple as in other sets 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.900
 and here you can sit 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:44.110
 little man regret only one here 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.260
 one chair is not a big assumption 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:51.850
 in my opinion of course if you wish you can 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.489
 put two but as they say by 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.489
 Only one thing fits in, but rather 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:01.000
 total authors of this model had the following 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:05.049
 that 2 just takes the trash it can 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.060
 put here on the bandwagon now we 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.459
 it will try to do well here it is, 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.940
 the car is going down the little man 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:16.680
 picks up the trash throws out and drives on 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.449
 well, or here you can attach it here 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.409
 that is, we have it here is a car 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.900
 drives up 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:24.330
 he goes down takes the garbage well here 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.030
 something like that 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.770
 little man flew us let's continue 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.530
 our inspection here we have headlights number and 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:41.250
 logo all this plays the role of stickers 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:43.750
 as well as here such elements 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.090
 side windows that can 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.310
 to regulate 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.500
 under any rut here we have a small 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.409
 podstavchka to the little man descent all 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.680
 although if there are no doors, in principle, why 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:05:01.539
 they are just for sight here with us 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.659
 such a big pipe well in general below 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:07.810
 everything looks simple enough 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:10.000
 here we still have a mop and shovel 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.940
 which are also removed and they can 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.020
 use in work 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:19.750
 somehow so on we go back 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.060
 and here we have an interesting thing here 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.969
 this part opens when fully 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.889
 everything is full of garbage can go there 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.909
 shake out that is just remove this 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:34.110
 part also now i will show you 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:37.960
 some focus here we have garbage 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:42.240
 he is put here right here 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:46.539
 lever and that's thrown like that 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:51.190
 quite an interesting idea 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:55.719
 very practical here we have the number well 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:59.620
 also glowing elements well and it is still 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:02.199
 not everything also rises with us 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.000
 part to throw out all 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.919
 what has accumulated there but you probably 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.550
 could see that there is no problem with us 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:14.650
 Kamaz can throw everything away also here. 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.900
 there is a bonus if you take this one off 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.009
 part everyone probably thinks that this 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.559
 is to open 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:24.539
 is this really all here 

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:27.309
 just enough it can also be removed 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:29.919
 attached but on parole though 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:34.089
 keeps well enough and on the other 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:36.099
 the parties are all exactly the same that is if you 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.639
 want to see what is there 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.789
 inside 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:43.839
 you can easily remove this part 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:47.129
 Well, just like this one, that is, you shoot 

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:51.520
 all that is and you get the usual 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:54.520
 cargo KAMAZ consider another this 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.770
 the part that is being filmed well in general here 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.139
 nothing unusual as they say everything 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.529
 brilliant enough just the same 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:04.930
 put in place and the garbage truck is ready 

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:07.930
 Well, that's all about this
