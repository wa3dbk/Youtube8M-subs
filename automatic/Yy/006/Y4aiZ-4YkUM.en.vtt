00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
based an age-old story when we can see

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.160 
based an age-old story when we can see
the<00:01:23.189> goal<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.640> don't<00:01:23.939> deal<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.570> going<00:01:24.750> down

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
the goal we don't deal with going down

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.109 
the goal we don't deal with going down
very<00:01:25.530> well<00:01:25.680> if<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.340> team<00:01:26.549> wants<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.850> sit<00:01:27.030> off

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119

like<00:01:27.299> when<00:01:27.420> panis<00:01:27.750> 11<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.320> they<00:01:28.740> thought

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
like when panis 11 it up they thought

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.380 
like when panis 11 it up they thought
right<00:01:29.130> let's<00:01:29.340> waste<00:01:29.490> time<00:01:29.729> we'll<00:01:29.909> sit<00:01:30.119> off<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
right let's waste time we'll sit off and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.399 
right let's waste time we'll sit off and
they<00:01:30.450> didn't<00:01:30.630> put<00:01:30.750> us<00:01:30.810> under<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.200> lot<00:01:31.380> of

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
they didn't put us under a lot of

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.200 
they didn't put us under a lot of
pressure<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.280> then<00:01:32.430> them<00:01:32.610> signs<00:01:32.939> aren't

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
pressure so then them signs aren't

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.999 
pressure so then them signs aren't
visible<00:01:33.479> but<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:33.990> ever<00:01:34.110> turn<00:01:34.350> they<00:01:34.710> scored

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
visible but with ever turn they scored

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.109 
visible but with ever turn they scored
the<00:01:35.100> first<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.520> kicked<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the first and they kicked on for the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.840 
the first and they kicked on for the
second<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.259> get<00:01:37.530> nervy<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.700> know

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
second and we do get nervy and you know

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.030 
second and we do get nervy and you know
we<00:01:39.659> need<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.990> address<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
we need to address that and I think the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.410 
we need to address that and I think the
way<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> address<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> central

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
way to address that is a central

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.510 
way to address that is a central
defensive<00:01:42.810> midfielder<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> calming

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
defensive midfielder that is a calming

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.270 
defensive midfielder that is a calming

and<00:02:05.280> he's<00:02:05.880> intelligent<00:02:06.360> enough<00:02:06.930> there's<00:02:07.590> an

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and he's intelligent enough there's an

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.760 
and he's intelligent enough there's an
ambulance<00:02:07.860> cool<00:02:08.509> if<00:02:09.509> you're<00:02:09.780> not<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.289> we

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
ambulance cool if you're not so so we

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.930 
ambulance cool if you're not so so we
not<00:02:10.950> just<00:02:11.069> over<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:11.610> jumping<00:02:11.970> on

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
not just over just jumping on

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.880 
not just over just jumping on
but<00:02:13.940> yeah<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.120> think<00:02:14.300> khedira<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.410> has<00:02:15.680> got

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
but yeah I think khedira is it has got

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.350 
but yeah I think khedira is it has got
to<00:02:16.010> be<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.190> answer<00:02:16.459> because<00:02:16.580> he<00:02:16.970> we<00:02:17.090> can<00:02:17.209> get

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
to be the answer because he we can get

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.030 
to be the answer because he we can get
him<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.600> cut-price<00:02:17.870> deal<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.620> he's

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
him on a cut-price deal and he's

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.920 
him on a cut-price deal and he's
intelligent<00:02:19.370> enough<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.790> play<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.209> role<00:02:20.420> so

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
intelligent enough to play that role so

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.990 
intelligent enough to play that role so
if<00:02:21.200> being<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.860> thinks<00:02:22.100> he<00:02:22.220> can<00:02:22.400> do<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.850> then

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
if being a thinks he can do that then

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.030 
if being a thinks he can do that then
get<00:02:23.300> him<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:23.569> there<00:02:23.780> ultimately<00:02:24.560> when<00:02:24.830> people

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
get him in there ultimately when people

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.170 
get him in there ultimately when people
say<00:02:25.100> oh<00:02:25.130> yeah<00:02:25.370> but<00:02:25.520> he's<00:02:25.670> not<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.940> right<00:02:26.120> man

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
say oh yeah but he's not the right man

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.449 
say oh yeah but he's not the right man
for<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.540> job<00:02:26.569> NORs<00:02:27.170> arteta<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:27.980> Khedira's

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
for the job NORs arteta and Khedira's

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.890 
for the job NORs arteta and Khedira's
better<00:02:28.640> than<00:02:28.790> Arteta<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.569> need<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.750> can

you say and going into the Schick test
game<00:02:34.790> optimistic<00:02:35.540> now<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.930> mean<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.560> some

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
game optimistic now I mean I some

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.710 
game optimistic now I mean I some
massive<00:02:37.220> morale<00:02:37.550> booster<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.300> will<00:02:38.510> be<00:02:38.690> a

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
massive morale booster it will be a

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.120 
massive morale booster it will be a
morale<00:02:38.989> booster<00:02:39.260> could<00:02:39.410> have<00:02:39.500> been<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:39.920> so

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
morale booster could have been so so

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.650 
morale booster could have been so so
different<00:02:40.550> but<00:02:40.670> yeah<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:40.880> know<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.060> expect<00:02:41.540> us

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
different but yeah you know I expect us

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.540 
different but yeah you know I expect us

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
to be better class anyway and we better

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.490 
to be better class anyway and we better
beat<00:02:43.819> them<00:02:44.000> because<00:02:44.209> if<00:02:44.330> we<00:02:44.480> don't<00:02:44.630> then<00:02:44.810> 30

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
beat them because if we don't then 30

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.140 
beat them because if we don't then 30
million<00:02:45.739> comes<00:02:46.070> out<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.340> transfer<00:02:46.670> key<00:02:46.790> to
