 I'm good, so I get paid for it as a result. 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.410
 So that's the goal of making money. 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:50.129
 I thought it was the same. 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:55.140
 Another bakery next door is the room where you make money. 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:59.969
 4 In fact, the fact that this is the purpose of the fearful justification of the means

 I do not think this is a crime restaurant. 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.210
 From the standpoint of 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:31.530
 I was not worried about trying to make money, but I did my job hard 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:36.360
 If I get the results, I can earn money, so what I can do is 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.110
 If you'll be making money, but I talk to General So Hard

 This possibility of success never one to think so. But now the yireongeot
