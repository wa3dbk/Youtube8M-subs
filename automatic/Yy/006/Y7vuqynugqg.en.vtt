00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.920 

it's<00:00:25.160> about<00:00:25.370> 85<00:00:25.640> metres<00:00:26.150> to<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.390> first<00:00:26.600> corner

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
it's about 85 metres to the first corner

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.920 
it's about 85 metres to the first corner
which<00:00:27.320> is<00:00:27.350> a<00:00:27.640> 180<00:00:28.640> degree<00:00:29.000> right<00:00:29.540> turn

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
which is a 180 degree right turn

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.810 
which is a 180 degree right turn
immediately<00:00:30.710> out<00:00:30.800> of<00:00:30.830> there<00:00:31.100> we're<00:00:31.280> into<00:00:31.520> four

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
immediately out of there we're into four

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.870 
immediately out of there we're into four
waves<00:00:32.500> so<00:00:33.500> from<00:00:33.680> that<00:00:33.800> far<00:00:34.040> back<00:00:34.220> I<00:00:34.550> mean<00:00:34.730> out

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
waves so from that far back I mean out

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.190 
waves so from that far back I mean out
of<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.030> first<00:00:35.210> turn<00:00:35.420> you<00:00:35.540> can<00:00:35.690> double<00:00:35.960> double

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
of the first turn you can double double

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.380 
of the first turn you can double double
your<00:00:36.320> way<00:00:36.410> through<00:00:36.710> turn<00:00:37.010> to<00:00:37.280> 90<00:00:37.700> degrees<00:00:38.000> then

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
your way through turn to 90 degrees then

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.360 
your way through turn to 90 degrees then
up<00:00:38.630> over<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.080> first<00:00:39.380> of<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.710> big<00:00:39.860> jumps<00:00:40.190> here

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
up over the first of the big jumps here

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.440 
up over the first of the big jumps here
and<00:00:41.470> then<00:00:42.470> as<00:00:42.650> we<00:00:42.830> swing<00:00:43.190> down<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:43.640> side<00:00:43.880> we

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
and then as we swing down to the side we

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.940 
and then as we swing down to the side we
sweep<00:00:44.690> through<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:45.080> left-hander<00:00:45.680> gets

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
sweep through the left-hander gets

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.680 
sweep through the left-hander gets
pretty<00:00:46.220> quick<00:00:46.489> through<00:00:46.700> here<00:00:46.820> over<00:00:47.330> the<00:00:47.510> first

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690

the first one longer than the second one
and<00:01:27.740> then<00:01:28.700> we<00:01:28.850> start<00:01:29.120> to<00:01:29.240> head<00:01:29.420> through<00:01:29.870> a

correct slightly midway through because

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.340 
correct slightly midway through because

the momentum automatically pushes you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.100 
the momentum automatically pushes you
