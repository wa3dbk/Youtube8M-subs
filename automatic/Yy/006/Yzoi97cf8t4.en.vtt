00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.500
 Welcome my friends and welcome to a new episode 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.500
 I am Leonardo today and I will draw you Lamborghini 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000
 We start by making some measurements, such as forward 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.500
 To collisions, elevation, etc. 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.700
 Then we draw the Super Aerobic shape. 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.700
 Set the height of the wheel and continue on the work line 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Not only do you take measurements 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 But all of the above measurements must of course be easier 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.400
 Other measurements were taken to protect the front glass 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 It does not seem true 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 To complete the work it's really fun :) 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 I will do some corrections on the back, 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 We have here an error that will clear all lines 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 That should not be there. That's better 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.300
 Finally we start shading 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.500
 I will use hard areas to light shadows 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 The soft and pen 2B of the tuna is medium and very soft 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 For dark shadow I use 6B 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.600
 List all the materials used in the information below this video 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.700
 We continue to shading 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.700
 I will do some reflection on the glass 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.769
 The shadow below the car is very important 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.749
 So do not look like it will fly 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:56.299
 I know that Lamborghini seems to be a space ship 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.200
 But you must be on the ground haha 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.950
 Many people asked me to draw this car for it 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.900
 I'm drawing it for you 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.950
 We can draw the street with lines and so to give 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.600
 Effect of speed 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.600
 Let us reinforce some shadows. 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.700
 Some reflections on the wheels become ready 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.700
 I like to know how you see it look 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.000
 If you enjoyed it please give it an impression and join us in 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.250
 This channel will see you 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.079
 Tuesday!
