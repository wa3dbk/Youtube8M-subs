later on so what you want to start off

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.370 
later on so what you want to start off
doing<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.449> want<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.720> start<00:00:21.990> off<00:00:22.080> by<00:00:22.350> asking

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
doing is you want to start off by asking

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.439 
doing is you want to start off by asking
the<00:00:22.800> spectator<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.490> hold<00:00:23.760> these<00:00:23.910> cards<00:00:24.330> and

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the spectator to hold these cards and

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.000 
the spectator to hold these cards and
it's<00:00:24.990> important<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.500> they<00:00:25.619> hold<00:00:25.800> them

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
it's important that they hold them

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.189 
it's important that they hold them
because<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.490> provides<00:00:26.760> miss<00:00:27.000> direction<00:00:27.480> later

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
because it provides miss direction later

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.009 
because it provides miss direction later
on<00:00:28.410> when<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.949> do<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> slight<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.820> hand

on when you have to do a slight of hand

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.450 
on when you have to do a slight of hand
so<00:00:31.019> once<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.890> do<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
so once you do that you have the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.270 
so once you do that you have the
spectators<00:00:33.000> select<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> card<00:00:33.739> any<00:00:34.739> card<00:00:35.100> they
