through<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:33.960> looking<00:01:34.140> at<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> video<00:01:34.560> with

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
through I was looking at the video with

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.620 
through I was looking at the video with
all<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.220> weapon<00:01:35.970> attachments<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
all the the weapon attachments and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
all the the weapon attachments and
weapons<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.110> everything<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.380> was<00:01:37.470> kind<00:01:37.619> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
weapons and everything I was kind of

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.630 
weapons and everything I was kind of
looking<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.920> those<00:01:38.040> details<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.460> looked

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
looking at those details and I looked

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.899 
looking at those details and I looked
over<00:01:38.759> at<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.869> combat<00:01:40.470> medic<00:01:40.890> profession<00:01:41.850> I

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
over at the combat medic profession I

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:42.770 
over at the combat medic profession I
guess<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.150> could<00:01:42.180> say<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:42.689> I

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
guess you could say I don't know what I

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.389 
guess you could say I don't know what I
think<00:01:43.140> they<00:01:43.200> call<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.470> career<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:44.280> it's

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
think they call it a career but it's

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.710 
think they call it a career but it's
basically<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> field<00:01:44.970> upgrade<00:01:45.149> paths<00:01:45.509> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
basically the field upgrade paths and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
basically the field upgrade paths and
I'm<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.930> put<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> image<00:01:46.409> overlay<00:01:46.680> for

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
I've talked about in previous videos and

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.609 
I've talked about in previous videos and
I'm<00:02:00.600> sure<00:02:00.780> most<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.079> know<00:02:01.170> quite<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.560> bit

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
I'm sure most of you know quite a bit

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.899 
I'm sure most of you know quite a bit
about<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.920> now<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.369> see<00:02:02.549> right<00:02:02.579> here<00:02:02.820> in

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
about it now you can see right here in

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.100 
about it now you can see right here in
middle<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> screen<00:02:03.329> we<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.600> offensive

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
middle of the screen we have offensive

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.679 
middle of the screen we have offensive
and<00:02:04.350> defensive<00:02:04.829> career<00:02:05.820> paths<00:02:06.060> field<00:02:06.509> upgrade

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
and defensive career paths field upgrade

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.050 
and defensive career paths field upgrade
paths<00:02:07.160> I've<00:02:08.160> spoken<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.700> I've<00:02:08.879> said<00:02:09.030> I

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
paths I've spoken to that I've said I

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.510 
paths I've spoken to that I've said I
think<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.569> defensive<00:02:10.020> path<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.379> much<00:02:11.250> more

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
think the defensive path is much more

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.730 
think the defensive path is much more
powerful

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
powerful

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.730 
powerful
even<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.130> an<00:02:14.220> offensive<00:02:14.490> mode<00:02:15.290> then<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
even in an offensive mode then the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.020 
even in an offensive mode then the
offensive<00:02:17.070> capabilities<00:02:17.670> but<00:02:17.730> time<00:02:17.940> will

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
offensive capabilities but time will

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
offensive capabilities but time will
tell<00:02:18.090> it's<00:02:18.360> gonna<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.630> matter<00:02:18.750> how<00:02:18.900> it

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
tell it's gonna be a matter how it

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.120 
tell it's gonna be a matter how it
bounces<00:02:19.140> out<00:02:19.500> that's<00:02:19.710> neither<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.010> nor

you're a little animations over he fit
right<00:04:15.900> away<00:04:16.230> and<00:04:16.380> then<00:04:16.470> there's<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.709> cool<00:04:16.920> down

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
right away and then there's a cool down

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.560 
right away and then there's a cool down
but<00:04:17.459> even<00:04:17.549> then<00:04:17.730> there's<00:04:17.880> not<00:04:18.000> much<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.420> cool

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570

but even then there's not much of a cool
down<00:04:18.750> at<00:04:18.930> all<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.320> we<00:04:19.799> all<00:04:19.920> thought<00:04:20.070> there

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
down at all and we all thought there

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.710 
down at all and we all thought there
might<00:04:20.370> be<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.520> cool<00:04:20.700> down<00:04:20.910> or<00:04:21.120> something<00:04:21.299> but<00:04:21.570> as

harm<00:04:41.600> now<00:04:41.720> that's<00:04:41.870> nice<00:04:42.050> it<00:04:42.229> helps<00:04:42.410> speed<00:04:42.530> up

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
harm now that's nice it helps speed up

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.290 
harm now that's nice it helps speed up
the<00:04:42.770> game<00:04:42.800> I<00:04:42.919> guess<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:43.280> could<00:04:43.400> say<00:04:43.580> but<00:04:43.760> it's

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
the game I guess you could say but it's

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.240 
the game I guess you could say but it's
really<00:04:44.540> kind<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.590> just<00:04:45.800> doesn't<00:04:46.100> mesh

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
really kind of it just doesn't mesh

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.670 
really kind of it just doesn't mesh
right<00:04:46.610> so<00:04:47.270> now<00:04:47.600> when<00:04:47.810> you<00:04:47.900> when<00:04:48.229> you<00:04:48.260> pull<00:04:48.650> out

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
right so now when you when you pull out

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.350 
right so now when you when you pull out
your<00:04:48.919> defense<00:04:49.250> they're<00:04:49.430> going<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.699> charge<00:04:49.729> and

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
your defense they're going to charge and

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.270 
your defense they're going to charge and
he's<00:04:50.630> kind<00:04:51.199> of<00:04:51.229> calculated<00:04:51.710> at<00:04:51.830> about<00:04:51.860> four

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
he's kind of calculated at about four

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.219 
he's kind of calculated at about four
seconds<00:04:52.669> they<00:04:53.060> did<00:04:53.210> notice<00:04:53.540> that<00:04:53.570> I<00:04:53.720> noticed

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
seconds they did notice that I noticed

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.939 
seconds they did notice that I noticed
in<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.979> live<00:04:55.490> stream<00:04:55.820> of<00:04:56.000> paracel<00:04:56.630> storm<00:04:56.949> it

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
in the live stream of paracel storm it

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.890 
in the live stream of paracel storm it
took<00:04:58.160> a<00:04:58.310> long<00:04:58.460> time<00:04:58.729> now<00:04:59.510> some<00:04:59.750> of<00:04:59.810> these

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900

took a long time now some of these
players<00:05:00.110> might<00:05:00.350> not<00:05:00.500> be<00:05:00.590> damned<00:05:00.710> very

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
experienced and it looked like the guy

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
know in the near future I will be but I

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.050 
know in the near future I will be but I
have<00:05:12.800> seen<00:05:12.979> other<00:05:13.160> times<00:05:13.460> where<00:05:13.699> the<00:05:13.880> guys

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
have seen other times where the guys

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.270 
have seen other times where the guys
were<00:05:14.990> a<00:05:15.020> little<00:05:15.139> quicker<00:05:15.590> about<00:05:15.889> it<00:05:16.039> I<00:05:16.130> don't

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
were a little quicker about it I don't

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.409 
were a little quicker about it I don't
know<00:05:16.340> if<00:05:16.430> this<00:05:16.550> is<00:05:16.580> just<00:05:16.669> kind<00:05:16.910> of<00:05:17.000> animation

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
know if this is just kind of animation

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.240 
know if this is just kind of animation
bugs<00:05:17.780> take<00:05:18.229> things<00:05:18.410> maybe<00:05:18.560> he's<00:05:18.770> resetting

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
bugs take things maybe he's resetting

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.529 
bugs take things maybe he's resetting
the<00:05:19.310> animation<00:05:19.729> so<00:05:19.850> it<00:05:19.940> looks<00:05:20.150> like<00:05:20.240> the

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
the animation so it looks like the

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:21.730 
the animation so it looks like the
defibs<00:05:20.930> were<00:05:21.020> then<00:05:21.169> available<00:05:21.350> but<00:05:21.680> they

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
defibs were then available but they

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.050 
defibs were then available but they
actually<00:05:21.830> really<00:05:22.190> were<00:05:22.340> not<00:05:22.370> I<00:05:22.669> don't<00:05:22.880> know

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
actually really were not I don't know

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.360 
actually really were not I don't know
but<00:05:23.180> uh<00:05:23.900> d<00:05:24.590> febs<00:05:24.800> are<00:05:24.860> going<00:05:24.979> to<00:05:25.039> work<00:05:25.130> very

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
but uh d febs are going to work very

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.230
