 While 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.109
 out there 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:21.759
 in resonance 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.849
 they emerge as if they were living beings 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.849
 the small sculptures 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:32.699
 my inner world I think it's full of colon is full of 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.409
 in this way it is ensured 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.639
 d of pension animals of pigeon postures 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.289
 of mothers infected with different valence 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.819
 in what I already expressed in my painting and cultural varnish 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.919
 I think what I think that's what they live 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.409
 It has a lot to do 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.409
 percent reserve form what you do 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.590
 here there is who what they like more is the decoration in the sentence as of 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.179
 donations 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:11.179
 with all kinds of things and if it was difficult 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.759
 suddenly the acceptance 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.429
 China does not understand work 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:18.699
 but 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.869
 little by little I think that this vaudeville 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:24.679
 it's not that there is not a style of its own 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:27.949
 the cnc stating that he feels very happy 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:34.339
 tortillas caracoles chappuis 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:38.479
 armadillos come from the artist's fertile imagination 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:42.839
 there is an ark of noah and in your imagination 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.789
 It has been a challenge for me because apart from seeing in what creative 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:54.599
 There is no mother in how I dedicate my home to my children 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:02.139
 in that is a challenge for children who become many much dynamism santín 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.299
 very well 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.180
 he is very smart and well 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.949
 for spectator 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.999
 it is a subject without it 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:14.999
 very easy to understand 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.639
 fantastic animals 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.329
 animals that were sculpted 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.909
 imagined facts 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.759
 with a touch of humor 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.759
 and with some schoolchildren 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.279
 someone told me about the crisis 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:39.020
 I came to see the countries that will be made 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.020
 because they told me that you had to know them 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:48.309
 I came to see his women among the landscape of astonished blues and 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:51.849
 makeup that grows restless in the face of total beauty 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.370
 The Jalisco Heights are famous for these women who now contrast the 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.409
 roads located in ancares 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.119
 very young skins that have some provocation 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.800
 provoke that 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.120
 to this stopped cycle 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.300
 the eyes that would like to discover more 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.599
 but it's impossible 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.900
 there is a wall to throw them 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.900
 that protect 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.199
 while the landscape darkens 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.229
 and in the distance he got down to the sun that is hidden 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.659
 and it remains as a simple reflection in the lagoon 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.779
 the night arrives 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:45.830
 and overturn

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:04.229
 min 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:10.110
 I feel that the unusual in a world where many changes are needed but 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.759
 suddenly encounters in these places people very sensitive because they have had 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.630
 contact the field but once in a while one or two run away to listen to you 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:23.589
 because they feel free of cost you did not want the generation that you planted 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:29.309
 pique as long as their search wait in selective withdrawal to exploit that which 

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:30.719
 you planted is already a 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:34.490
 in advantage for us it is an express decision this type of music 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:38.309
 million 200 the meeting 

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:40.249
 bush I said 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:41.389

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:42.990
 dyn-na 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.990
 the minister has incited 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.699
 the walk 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:51.610
 the minister 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.759
 there is nothing to anyone
