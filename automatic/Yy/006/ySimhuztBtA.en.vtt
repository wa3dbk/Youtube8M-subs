t WRP recovery you can flash any
recovery<00:01:08.920> but<00:01:09.280> I<00:01:09.490> prefer<00:01:09.880> TW<00:01:10.420> RP<00:01:10.750> recovery

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
recovery but I prefer TW RP recovery

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.510 
recovery but I prefer TW RP recovery
from<00:01:12.010> that<00:01:12.070> recovery<00:01:12.790> we<00:01:13.060> can<00:01:13.270> flash<00:01:13.510> norms<00:01:14.520> so

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520
