00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 to care that is a game for two 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.990
 people and it's about eating the chips 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.340
 of the opposing player in white by 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.349
 example theory to start here 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.139
 You have four options to move the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.449
 mussels that start is the black already 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.990
 start eating here hit the white 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.910
 he chooses to eat here he plays the black the black 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.520
 have to move a token is bound 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.070
 to that 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.620
 unless you bench me in fact you have to 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.940
 move along 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:36.399
 touch the white 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.149
 black and white 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:43.100
 the black one already has to eat here gives me 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.180
 two 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.830
 touch white 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.830
 blank is bound to attack 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.560
 his goal is also wanting to win 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.070
 the game touches the black 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.070
 here 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.340
 in fact a poster of the same color does not 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.059
 it could be missing to jump on another of the 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.830
 same color 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.730
 touch 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.730
 White 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.810
 over here 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.370
 to me of what has happened at this moment 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.010
 said touch the white 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.550
 in fact they do not have bigger chips than 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.290
 move 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.250
 but you have to move from all 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.610
 nations 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.110
 We're supposed to be here 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.200
 and the new ones have to start 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.509
 attack anyway 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.580
 here the white is going to have to move or 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.250
 xing 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.970
 in fact this could no longer return there 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.970
 what move is 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.469
 let's attack with black 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.700
 look white 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.590
 as he never touched white 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.170
 Where thousands move, it does not have many 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.740
 options that go 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.740
 to move 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.470
 and here is a problem the white should 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.670
 eat this 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.630
 how he did not eat 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.390
 blow that is to say the enemy player picks up 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.020
 this file and in passing makes a following 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.020
 move 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.920
 to see what can be for example of this 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.430
 and touch the white heavens and look what 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.640
 fits Seneca for example it has no longer 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.640
 many places like berna 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.840
 let's imagine that 9 is 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.840
 happen this touches the target and you have to 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.200
 move a tab and greater option we could 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.200
 see this one 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.810
 whites this one is processed just 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.930
 have to move has these options 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.909
 It is here but could see any 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.020
 what you do in fact is already the game 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.910
 is 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.600
 already for being empty for example dance 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.770
 upset 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.770
 the target 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.859
 is already attacking here 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.110
 is already processing at least optional that 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:30.709
 move even if they have less movement 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.190
 possible and the black is playing here and 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.710
 what's happening here 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.220
 in this case the game won the 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.220
 blacks
