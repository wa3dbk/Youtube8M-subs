marketing I'm an attorney by trade and I

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.840 
marketing I'm an attorney by trade and I
had<00:00:14.019> been<00:00:14.800> in<00:00:14.950> public<00:00:15.250> office<00:00:15.400> as<00:00:15.730> Secretary

had been in public office as Secretary
of<00:00:16.209> State<00:00:16.510> and<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:18.010> I<00:00:18.040> thought<00:00:18.520> that<00:00:18.580> network

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
of State and so I thought that network

of State and so I thought that network
marketing<00:00:19.810> was<00:00:19.990> the<00:00:20.110> thing<00:00:20.320> that<00:00:20.349> people<00:00:20.590> did

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
now my mother and my sister had done it

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.890 
now my mother and my sister had done it
but<00:00:26.470> I<00:00:26.500> didn't<00:00:26.890> quite<00:00:27.039> get<00:00:27.340> it<00:00:27.520> you<00:00:27.940> know<00:00:28.090> being

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900
