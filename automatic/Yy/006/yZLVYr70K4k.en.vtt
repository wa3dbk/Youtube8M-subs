00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
yesterday and i've been playing in a

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.800 
yesterday and i've been playing in a
fair<00:00:28.289> amount<00:00:28.349> since<00:00:28.650> then<00:00:28.970> but<00:00:29.970> really<00:00:30.330> unless

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
fair amount since then but really unless

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.630 
fair amount since then but really unless
you<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.470> few<00:00:31.710> people<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.040> your<00:00:32.160> team<00:00:32.219> what

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
you have a few people on your team what

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.910 
you have a few people on your team what
you<00:00:32.759> just<00:00:33.000> what<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:33.870> fill<00:00:34.710> up<00:00:34.829> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
you just what you do is just fill up a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.440 
you just what you do is just fill up a
hundred<00:00:35.190> water<00:00:35.399> buckets<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.940> then<00:00:36.030> AFK<00:00:36.420> for

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
hundred water buckets and then AFK for

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.030 
hundred water buckets and then AFK for
like<00:00:36.719> 15<00:00:36.989> minutes<00:00:37.020> because<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.590> can't<00:00:37.800> really

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
like 15 minutes because you can't really

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.639 
like 15 minutes because you can't really
do<00:00:38.190> much<00:00:38.219> brewing<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:39.570> only<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.140> person<00:00:40.320> and

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
do much brewing with only one person and

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.990 
do much brewing with only one person and
it's<00:00:40.770> not<00:00:40.890> really<00:00:41.040> worth<00:00:41.160> spending<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.820> time

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
it's not really worth spending the time

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.420 
it's not really worth spending the time
to<00:00:42.270> try<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> few<00:00:43.590> extra<00:00:43.739> pieces<00:00:44.160> of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
to try for like a few extra pieces of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.340 
to try for like a few extra pieces of
eight<00:00:44.550> at<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> end<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> game<00:00:45.200> but<00:00:46.200> if<00:00:46.260> you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
eight at the end of the game but if you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.600 
eight at the end of the game but if you
had<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> team<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> don't<00:00:47.399> know<00:00:47.489> maybe

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
had a team of like I don't know maybe

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.889 
had a team of like I don't know maybe
like<00:00:47.820> five<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.210> 10<00:00:48.390> people<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.719> could

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
like five to 10 people you could

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.330 
like five to 10 people you could
probably<00:00:49.140> actually<00:00:49.379> get<00:00:49.680> quite<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.920> few<00:00:49.980> more

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
probably actually get quite a few more

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.819 
probably actually get quite a few more
pieces<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.730> eight<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.289> much<00:00:52.289> as<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.530> fifty

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
pieces of eight as much as like fifty

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.170 
pieces of eight as much as like fifty
percent<00:00:53.070> more<00:00:53.309> pieces<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.640> eight<00:00:53.760> per<00:00:53.940> game

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
percent more pieces of eight per game

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.880 
percent more pieces of eight per game
than<00:00:54.840> doing<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.199> method<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.620> it'd<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> lot

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
than doing this method and it'd be a lot

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.529 
than doing this method and it'd be a lot
more<00:00:55.949> fun<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:56.969> was<00:00:57.030> thinking<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.390> starting

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
more fun so I was thinking of starting

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.849 
more fun so I was thinking of starting
an<00:00:57.750> event<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.739> know

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
an event to do that and you know

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.439 
an event to do that and you know
gradually<00:00:59.309> work<00:00:59.430> towards<00:00:59.760> my<00:00:59.910> own<00:00:59.940> personal

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
gradually work towards my own personal

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.270 
gradually work towards my own personal
goals<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.899> getting<00:01:01.140> all<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.530> naval<00:01:01.920> sets<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
goals of getting all the naval sets and

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.470 
goals of getting all the naval sets and
all<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> banners<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.969> other<00:01:03.120> people<00:01:03.390> could

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
all the banners and other people could

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.820 
all the banners and other people could
also<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.019> kind<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.229> stuff<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.619> it's

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
also go for that kind of stuff and it's

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.510 
also go for that kind of stuff and it's
a<00:01:05.070> really<00:01:05.549> cool<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:07.310> basically<00:01:08.310> what<00:01:08.430> I'm

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
a really cool so basically what I'm

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.490 
a really cool so basically what I'm
wondering<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.090> originally<00:01:09.180> thinking

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
wondering I was originally thinking

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.600 
wondering I was originally thinking
trouble<00:01:10.500> brewing<00:01:10.740> Tuesday's<00:01:11.159> because<00:01:11.490> you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
trouble brewing Tuesday's because you

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.210 
trouble brewing Tuesday's because you
know<00:01:11.729> alliteration<00:01:12.180> sounds<00:01:12.689> nice<00:01:12.950> but<00:01:13.950> I

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
know alliteration sounds nice but I

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.219 
know alliteration sounds nice but I
realized<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.630> me<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> don't<00:01:16.110> get

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
realized you know for me I don't get

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.660 
realized you know for me I don't get
home<00:01:16.350> from<00:01:16.500> school<00:01:16.560> until<00:01:17.070> usually<00:01:17.549> around

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
home from school until usually around

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.789 
home from school until usually around
like<00:01:17.850> three<00:01:18.060> or<00:01:18.150> four<00:01:18.180> p.m.<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.930> eastern

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
like three or four p.m. in eastern

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.469 
like three or four p.m. in eastern
standard<00:01:19.950> time<00:01:20.100> for<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.729> know<00:01:20.850> eastern

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
standard time for you know eastern

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.499 
standard time for you know eastern
United<00:01:21.810> States<00:01:22.049> which<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.759> think

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
United States which is like I think

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610

night<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.030> UK<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.470> would<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.590> when<00:01:28.770> I

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
night in the UK so that would be when I

a video on YouTube explaining how

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.059 
a video on YouTube explaining how
trouble<00:03:33.359> brewing<00:03:33.629> works<00:03:33.840> something<00:03:34.500> like<00:03:34.620> 10

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
trouble brewing works something like 10

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.009 
trouble brewing works something like 10
or<00:03:35.190> 15<00:03:35.459> minutes<00:03:35.639> and<00:03:35.879> it<00:03:35.940> ultra<00:03:36.180> shows<00:03:36.479> off<00:03:36.750> all

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
or 15 minutes and it ultra shows off all

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.869 
or 15 minutes and it ultra shows off all
of<00:03:37.169> the<00:03:37.290> different<00:03:37.620> reward<00:03:38.250> items<00:03:38.400> so<00:03:38.639> you<00:03:38.729> get

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
of the different reward items so you get

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.759 
of the different reward items so you get
from<00:03:39.030> trouble<00:03:39.269> brewing<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:40.409> you<00:03:40.470> could<00:03:40.590> get<00:03:40.709> a

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
from trouble brewing so you could get a

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.369 
from trouble brewing so you could get a
better<00:03:40.889> look<00:03:40.979> at<00:03:41.250> what<00:03:41.370> those<00:03:41.489> look<00:03:41.699> like<00:03:41.760> but

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
better look at what those look like but

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.659 
better look at what those look like but
the<00:03:43.379> coolest<00:03:43.709> item<00:03:43.979> that<00:03:44.099> you<00:03:44.159> can<00:03:44.280> get<00:03:44.400> in<00:03:44.549> my

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
the coolest item that you can get in my

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.020 
the coolest item that you can get in my
opinion<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.599> port<00:03:45.959> phasmatis<00:03:46.319> flag<00:03:47.030> this

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
opinion is the port phasmatis flag this

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.399 
opinion is the port phasmatis flag this
is<00:03:48.180> 1<00:03:48.329> i'm<00:03:48.449> going<00:03:48.720> for<00:03:48.870> right<00:03:49.019> now<00:03:49.049> it's<00:03:49.379> the

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
is 1 i'm going for right now it's the

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.199 
is 1 i'm going for right now it's the
most<00:03:49.620> expensive<00:03:49.979> one<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.370> costs<00:03:50.519> six<00:03:50.729> thousand

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
most expensive one it costs six thousand

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.089 
most expensive one it costs six thousand
pieces<00:03:51.329> of<00:03:51.569> eight<00:03:51.720> which<00:03:52.590> if<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:52.799> just<00:03:52.979> play

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
pieces of eight which if you just play

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.830 
pieces of eight which if you just play
25-minute<00:03:53.699> games<00:03:53.970> for<00:03:54.180> 100<00:03:54.479> pieces<00:03:54.599> of<00:03:54.780> a

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
25-minute games for 100 pieces of a

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.240 
25-minute games for 100 pieces of a
teacher's<00:03:55.169> forum<00:03:55.440> which<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:55.919> what<00:03:56.099> I'm<00:03:56.220> doing

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
teacher's forum which is what I'm doing

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.119 
teacher's forum which is what I'm doing
right<00:03:56.579> now<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:57.840> takes<00:03:58.019> about<00:03:58.049> 25<00:03:58.530> hours<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:58.979> get

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
right now it takes about 25 hours to get

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.619 
right now it takes about 25 hours to get
so<00:03:59.370> it's<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.579> pretty<00:03:59.729> tough<00:03:59.939> one<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.269> get<00:04:00.389> takes

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
so it's a pretty tough one to get takes

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.689 
so it's a pretty tough one to get takes
a<00:04:00.720> long<00:04:00.870> time<00:04:00.900> but<00:04:01.379> if<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:02.129> have<00:04:02.280> this<00:04:02.430> item

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
a long time but if you have this item

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.490 
a long time but if you have this item
you're<00:04:02.879> basically<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.269> badass<00:04:03.659> I<00:04:03.870> mean<00:04:04.019> I've

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
you're basically a badass I mean I've

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.259 
you're basically a badass I mean I've
only<00:04:04.650> seen<00:04:04.949> one<00:04:05.129> other<00:04:05.159> person<00:04:05.430> in<00:04:05.790> old<00:04:06.030> school

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
only seen one other person in old school

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.580 
only seen one other person in old school
with<00:04:06.449> this<00:04:06.629> flag<00:04:06.900> I'm<00:04:07.169> guessing<00:04:07.500> there's

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
with this flag I'm guessing there's

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.750 
with this flag I'm guessing there's
probably<00:04:07.889> less<00:04:08.040> than<00:04:08.220> 10<00:04:08.370> people<00:04:08.579> that

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
and they're also five other flags you

can get in seven different colors of
naval<00:04:35.009> sets<00:04:35.250> and<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.819> naval<00:04:36.060> stuff<00:04:36.300> really

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
naval sets and the naval stuff really

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.779 
naval sets and the naval stuff really
looks<00:04:37.169> nice<00:04:37.349> it's<00:04:37.860> got<00:04:38.039> different<00:04:38.310> colors<00:04:38.759> and

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
looks nice it's got different colors and

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.670 
looks nice it's got different colors and
then<00:04:39.000> like<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.150> white<00:04:39.389> trim<00:04:39.720> it's<00:04:40.349> kind<00:04:40.560> of<00:04:40.590> like

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
then like a white trim it's kind of like

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.390 
then like a white trim it's kind of like
it<00:04:40.800> looks<00:04:40.919> like<00:04:41.009> a<00:04:41.039> ship<00:04:41.310> captain<00:04:41.520> type<00:04:41.880> armor

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
it looks like a ship captain type armor

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.129 
it looks like a ship captain type armor
and<00:04:44.400> you<00:04:44.490> can<00:04:44.610> also<00:04:44.729> purchase<00:04:44.970> from<00:04:45.720> throwing

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
and you can also purchase from throwing

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.950 
and you can also purchase from throwing
the<00:04:46.259> stuff<00:04:46.620> which<00:04:47.430> you<00:04:48.000> can<00:04:48.150> use<00:04:48.180> with<00:04:48.539> brewing

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
the stuff which you can use with brewing

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.420 
the stuff which you can use with brewing
and<00:04:49.199> increase<00:04:49.440> increases<00:04:50.009> the<00:04:50.130> chance<00:04:50.340> of

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
and increase increases the chance of

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.120 
and increase increases the chance of
getting<00:04:50.669> mature<00:04:50.849> mature<00:04:51.750> ales<00:04:52.169> and<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:52.949> think

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
getting mature mature ales and I think

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.770 
getting mature mature ales and I think
like<00:04:53.250> mature<00:04:53.460> dwarven<00:04:53.970> stouts<00:04:54.240> and<00:04:54.419> mature

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
like mature dwarven stouts and mature

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.510 
like mature dwarven stouts and mature
greenman<00:04:55.560> sales<00:04:55.740> actually<00:04:56.069> go<00:04:56.190> for<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.400> decent

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
greenman sales actually go for a decent

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.159 
greenman sales actually go for a decent
amount<00:04:56.699> of<00:04:56.819> money<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:57.270> there<00:04:57.900> may<00:04:57.990> be<00:04:58.020> a

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
amount of money so there may be a

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.260 
amount of money so there may be a
potential<00:04:58.620> way<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:58.830> make<00:04:59.190> some<00:04:59.430> sort<00:04:59.729> of<00:04:59.849> non

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
potential way to make some sort of non

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.879 
potential way to make some sort of non
focused<00:05:00.720> money<00:05:00.900> man<00:05:01.139> what's<00:05:01.380> brewing<00:05:01.740> it's

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
focused money man what's brewing it's

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.860 
focused money man what's brewing it's
sort<00:05:02.009> of<00:05:02.070> like<00:05:02.160> farming<00:05:02.580> you<00:05:02.759> go<00:05:03.389> and<00:05:03.570> set<00:05:03.780> up

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
sort of like farming you go and set up

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.969 
sort of like farming you go and set up
the<00:05:04.020> brewing<00:05:04.349> and<00:05:04.440> then<00:05:04.530> you<00:05:04.590> wait<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:04.770> while

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
the brewing and then you wait a while

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.480 
the brewing and then you wait a while
and<00:05:05.160> come<00:05:05.280> back<00:05:05.460> and<00:05:05.870> get<00:05:06.870> back<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.410> ales<00:05:08.190> and

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
and come back and get back the ales and

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.310 
and come back and get back the ales and
stuff<00:05:08.729> and<00:05:09.000> you<00:05:09.360> can<00:05:09.479> also<00:05:09.599> buy<00:05:09.810> rum<00:05:10.110> the

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
stuff and you can also buy rum the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.870 
stuff and you can also buy rum the
teleports<00:05:10.770> you<00:05:10.860> back<00:05:11.009> to<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.250> mini-game

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
teleports you back to the mini-game

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.860 
teleports you back to the mini-game
which<00:05:12.000> isn't<00:05:12.180> really<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:12.419> useful<00:05:12.570> since

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
which isn't really that useful since

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.779 
which isn't really that useful since
there's<00:05:13.050> a<00:05:13.139> minigame<00:05:13.410> teleport<00:05:13.889> but<00:05:14.099> I<00:05:14.310> guess

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
there's a minigame teleport but I guess

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.490 
there's a minigame teleport but I guess
if<00:05:14.910> you're<00:05:15.060> on<00:05:15.180> cooldown<00:05:15.870> it<00:05:16.110> could<00:05:16.259> be<00:05:16.349> nice

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
if you're on cooldown it could be nice

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.320 
if you're on cooldown it could be nice
to<00:05:16.680> have<00:05:16.770> a<00:05:16.830> few<00:05:17.039> of<00:05:17.070> those<00:05:17.250> but<00:05:17.310> pretty<00:05:18.270> much

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
to have a few of those but pretty much

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.850 
to have a few of those but pretty much
the<00:05:18.570> rewards<00:05:18.900> are<00:05:18.960> just<00:05:19.139> cosmetic<00:05:19.590> and<00:05:19.740> that's

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
the rewards are just cosmetic and that's

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.439 
the rewards are just cosmetic and that's
why<00:05:19.979> so<00:05:20.159> few<00:05:20.340> people<00:05:20.400> play<00:05:20.789> it<00:05:20.940> but<00:05:21.090> it<00:05:21.210> is<00:05:21.330> some

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
why so few people play it but it is some

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:22.670 
why so few people play it but it is some
really<00:05:21.570> cool<00:05:21.780> looking<00:05:22.020> stuff<00:05:22.289> that's<00:05:22.500> really

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
really cool looking stuff that's really

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.649 
really cool looking stuff that's really
uncommon<00:05:23.669> to<00:05:23.909> see<00:05:24.090> because<00:05:24.240> hardly<00:05:24.569> anyone

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
uncommon to see because hardly anyone

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.330 
uncommon to see because hardly anyone
ever<00:05:24.990> actually<00:05:25.319> played<00:05:25.590> this<00:05:25.800> game<00:05:26.009> obviously
