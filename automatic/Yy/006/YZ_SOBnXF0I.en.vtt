a baby that's not how the Kryptonians

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.639 
a baby that's not how the Kryptonians
did<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.729> they<00:01:50.820> had<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> different<00:01:51.329> type<00:01:51.479> of

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
did it they had a different type of

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.929 
did it they had a different type of
reproduction<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.829> maybe<00:01:53.130> Cara's<00:01:53.520> ro<00:01:53.729> had<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
reproduction so maybe Cara's ro had a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.850 
reproduction so maybe Cara's ro had a
way<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.630> she<00:01:55.110> became<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
way to do that and she became the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.889 
way to do that and she became the
matriarch<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.969> founding<00:01:57.450> member<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.689> an

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.869 
think I'm a little bit crazy to I'm not
sure<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.509> buy<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.719> myself<00:02:07.190> but<00:02:08.190> now<00:02:08.640> there's

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
sure I buy it myself but now there's

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.760 
sure I buy it myself but now there's
more<00:02:09.149> more<00:02:09.450> people<00:02:09.750> starting<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.140> theorize

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
more more people starting to theorize

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.680 
more more people starting to theorize
that<00:02:11.250> that's<00:02:11.849> exactly<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.540> direction

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
that that's exactly the direction

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.190 
that that's exactly the direction
they're<00:02:12.930> going

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
they're going

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.690 
they're going
what<00:02:13.319> do<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:13.440> guys<00:02:13.530> think<00:02:13.620> about<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.250> like

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
what do you guys think about that I like

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.020 
what do you guys think about that I like
that<00:02:14.730> idea<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.810> mean<00:02:16.170> maybe<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.590> it's<00:02:16.739> not

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
that idea I mean maybe that it's not

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.970 
that idea I mean maybe that it's not
Kara<00:02:18.030> but<00:02:18.810> part<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.319> ship<00:02:19.590> or<00:02:19.800> something

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
Kara but part of the ship or something

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.770 
Kara but part of the ship or something
has<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.340> know<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:20.730> codex<00:02:21.209> with<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> skull

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
has you know that codex with the skull

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.869 
has you know that codex with the skull
like<00:02:22.440> it's<00:02:22.620> only<00:02:22.830> half<00:02:23.069> of<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.280> skull<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:23.790> it

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
like it's only half of the skull so it

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.850 
like it's only half of the skull so it
can<00:02:24.000> only<00:02:24.150> reproduce<00:02:24.510> women<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.440> know<00:02:25.470> any<00:02:25.739> me

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
can only reproduce women you know any me

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.020 
can only reproduce women you know any me
because<00:02:26.069> it's<00:02:26.220> Island<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.239> van<00:02:27.390> behind<00:02:27.860> whoa

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
because it's Island a van behind whoa

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.190 
because it's Island a van behind whoa
just<00:02:30.030> blew<00:02:30.239> my<00:02:30.420> mind<00:02:30.630> something<00:02:31.019> could<00:02:31.170> be

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
just blew my mind something could be

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.380 
just blew my mind something could be
along<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.769> maybe<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:32.550> not<00:02:32.700> her<00:02:33.030> because

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
along and the maybe it's not her because

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.880 
along and the maybe it's not her because
she's<00:02:33.599> not<00:02:33.720> immortal<00:02:34.140> or<00:02:34.230> whatever<00:02:34.530> but<00:02:34.709> then

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
she's not immortal or whatever but then

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.740 
she's not immortal or whatever but then
yeah<00:02:35.040> something<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:36.030> know<00:02:36.150> happened<00:02:36.540> yeah<00:02:36.720> I

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
yeah something you know happened yeah I

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.089 
yeah something you know happened yeah I
really<00:02:36.870> gets<00:02:37.080> her<00:02:37.170> i<00:02:37.230> think<00:02:37.319> she<00:02:37.560> died<00:02:37.800> a

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
really gets her i think she died a

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.740 
really gets her i think she died a
thousand<00:02:38.610> years<00:02:38.760> ago<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.269> i<00:02:39.299> think<00:02:39.569> maybe

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
thousand years ago but i think maybe

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.509 
thousand years ago but i think maybe
that<00:02:39.840> maybe<00:02:40.380> their<00:02:40.590> descendants<00:02:41.010> second<00:02:41.370> work

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
that maybe their descendants second work

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.009 
that maybe their descendants second work
and<00:02:41.790> uh<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.330> don't<00:02:42.540> know<00:02:42.629> we're<00:02:42.750> gonna<00:02:42.840> have<00:02:42.959> to
