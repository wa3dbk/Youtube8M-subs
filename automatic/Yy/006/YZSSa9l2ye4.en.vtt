00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.470
 I want to start this video declaring my 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.000
 condolences for the writer's death says 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.570
 It's the year with this story of him right but I understand that he was a guy who 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.570
 contributed too much to computing 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.929
 as they say - without him we might not have a computer at home 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.019
 So 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.019
 rest in peace these acts 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.810
 this afternoon I played with the electric games and three more in turn 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.810
 our hands that selecting your pictures from us three 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.010
 but anyway we got the good sharp shooter I loved it 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.500
 and heat as he defends himself has made almost all matches from within him I owe much 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.710
 well almost take the first place 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.060
 but I played well there a few games of thiago feltri decide to get this 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.860
 innovation on the bmb map 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.100
 was the fourth goal of letter r I wanted to talk about politics 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.170
 that I thought about twitter before having the channel 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.230
 You do not need to do anything, it's no good. 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.000
 that I'm going to talk to my friends through what we want 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.020
 influential, I preached nobody 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.850
 on that next day 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.689
 these things came I never inter title before making the channel 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.280
 and today I understand 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.780
 let's say more professionally speaking and terrestrial a mind the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.650
 last 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.180
 and so I wanted to make an invitation to all of you here do not have twitter 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.390
 to make a 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.060
 but why make a twitter 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.590
 I know what all may be thinking that even I'm not going to be very strong. 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.880
 crop 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.660
 but I practice cyber museum 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.290
 it can be very useful for you 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.040
 I realized this today when mine alone did not work right 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.910
 no way 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.590
 few people gave their son everything is listen again I tried post bulletin 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.430
 elkeson on the right and also worries people and 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.860
 and so I wanted to be invited to meet the twitter site if you did not 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.570
 has 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.470
 which is a very useful tool the little pig followed us on twitter the 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.550
 Turks knowing at the time if there is going to be any pledge or peak or any event 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.969
 something like that 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:11.899
 when is any 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:16.519
 carol that you like I can see again he will always post on twitter that he 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.179
 accused again the select will never lose knowing this even if the 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.179
 subscribe box is not working correctly 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:28.329
 d I know it can be annoying 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.689
 I have a more processing place and such a ball 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.689
 There are people who do not like the lawsuit and 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.859
 this medical pc makes a tui worth it can follow all guys 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.180
 that make videos and the rv event games 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.060
 educating others and it is not too much, I know I asked the new 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.950
 It is also for asking questions and is fit to content I will stay for staying for 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.799
 they all stay inside 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.829
 of conversations and discussions about something 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.999
 in this recess of seeing 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.919
 Why do I want to make a video to call you on twitter? 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:07.889
 is here 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.999
 even when the channel has many of the traitors as he is who knows it 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:12.699
 has 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.579
 I think almost 30 thousand 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.579
 only a small percentage of his colleagues 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.859
 twitter and follow free and I in my case the amount of followers I have 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.289
 so I think too much of the debt slip that are more or less 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:31.650
 thousand and five hundred very big even many people said that I never thought 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:32.649
 that I was 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.649
 It leaves so many people interested in what I have to say. 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.729
 but even so is a small amount near the number of partners with 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:40.600
 The time that I have 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.820
 and I would like very much that you all said vicente I think that yes that to be 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.939
 very difficult 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.159
 but it's something I love I really like 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.339
 and so that's why I'm just making you twitter twitter 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:56.809
 the favorite channels that are worth it are worth even 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:58.399
 So 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:01.399
 is once again my twitter screen for those who do not know 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:06.889
 then municipality mano but second others because I always use cross 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.639
 because she has already lost grace 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.419
 but then it is not that there months earth you have twitter I hope everything twitter 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:13.969
