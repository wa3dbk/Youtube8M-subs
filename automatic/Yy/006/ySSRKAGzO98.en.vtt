so the matter is outdoors doing up a ex
sheath<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:08.010> will<00:00:08.130> have<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.250> tech<00:00:08.460> lock<00:00:08.610> on<00:00:08.760> the

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:08.850 
sheath this will have a tech lock on the

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.700 
sheath this will have a tech lock on the
back<00:00:09.030> then<00:00:09.750> kind<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.050> see<00:00:10.170> some<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.500> prep

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
back then kind of see some of the prep

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.140 
back then kind of see some of the prep
work<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.430> figure<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:11.759> was<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.940> good

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
work in this I figure this was a good

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.919 
work in this I figure this was a good
video<00:00:12.320> you<00:00:13.320> see<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.589> axe<00:00:13.740> here

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
video you see the axe here

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.840 
video you see the axe here
this<00:00:15.929> isn't<00:00:16.290> axe<00:00:16.500> appear<00:00:16.860> but<00:00:17.010> here<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.760> can

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
this isn't axe appear but here you can

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.490 
this isn't axe appear but here you can
see<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> prep<00:00:18.270> work<00:00:18.300> what<00:00:18.780> I<00:00:18.810> do<00:00:18.900> typically

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
see the prep work what I do typically

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.609 
see the prep work what I do typically
with<00:00:19.620> these<00:00:21.619> can<00:00:22.619> see<00:00:22.769> my<00:00:22.920> layout<00:00:23.849> paper<00:00:24.619> I'll

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
with these can see my layout paper I'll

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.980 
with these can see my layout paper I'll
put<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> trace<00:00:26.730> everything<00:00:27.029> kind<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.810> get<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
put a trace everything kind of get a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.839 
put a trace everything kind of get a
rough<00:00:28.170> sketch<00:00:28.410> what<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.650> want<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.429> then<00:00:29.580> hold

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
rough sketch what I want and then hold

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.100 
rough sketch what I want and then hold
the<00:00:29.970> axe<00:00:30.150> here<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.199> backs<00:00:32.660> pivots<00:00:33.660> out<00:00:33.840> of

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the axe here and it backs pivots out of

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.990 
the axe here and it backs pivots out of
the<00:00:34.200> sheath<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.400> is<00:00:35.580> I<00:00:35.670> hold<00:00:35.879> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the sheath so what I do is I hold the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.860 
the sheath so what I do is I hold the
tip<00:00:36.180> here<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.600> Mark<00:00:37.500> all<00:00:37.680> my<00:00:37.800> pivot<00:00:38.100> points<00:00:38.399> as

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
tip here and Mark all my pivot points as

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.479 
tip here and Mark all my pivot points as
it<00:00:39.870> comes<00:00:40.050> out<00:00:40.230> then<00:00:40.680> I'll<00:00:40.800> make<00:00:40.920> blocks<00:00:41.160> for

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
it comes out then I'll make blocks for

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.740 
it comes out then I'll make blocks for
that<00:00:41.610> because<00:00:41.789> you<00:00:41.879> really<00:00:42.090> can't<00:00:42.300> reheat<00:00:42.570> for

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
that because you really can't reheat for

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.170 
that because you really can't reheat for
that<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.020> makes<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.260> lousy<00:00:43.410> sheath<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.730> this

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that it makes a lousy sheath so this

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.000 
that it makes a lousy sheath so this
will<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.450> kind<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.690> over<00:00:45.930> blocked<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.920> know

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
will be kind of over blocked you know

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.520 
will be kind of over blocked you know
this<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.340> filled<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.320> tip

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
this is filled in and then that the tip

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.889 
this is filled in and then that the tip
here<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.829> gonna<00:00:49.980> curve<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.510> rock<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
here is gonna curve up as I rock the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.990 
here is gonna curve up as I rock the
sheath<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> axe<00:00:52.649> out<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.160> kind<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:53.910> all

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
sheath for the axe out I kind of do all

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.180 
sheath for the axe out I kind of do all
that<00:00:54.090> prep<00:00:54.329> work<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.809> make<00:00:55.500> wood<00:00:55.680> blocks<00:00:55.949> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
that prep work and make wood blocks to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.510 
that prep work and make wood blocks to
fit<00:00:56.370> leaving<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.149> enough<00:00:57.390> space<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:58.250> fit<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
fit leaving just enough space to fit the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.790 
fit leaving just enough space to fit the
X<00:00:59.730> really<00:01:00.359> well<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.930> stays<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.199> place<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.769> I

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
X really well so it stays in place so I

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.319 
X really well so it stays in place so I
don't<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.070> reheat<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.519> at<00:01:02.670> all<00:01:02.789> it'll<00:01:03.090> hold<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
don't to reheat that at all it'll hold a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.540 
don't to reheat that at all it'll hold a
nice<00:01:03.510> retention<00:01:04.050> just<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.430> love<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
nice retention just like this I love a

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.310 
nice retention just like this I love a
rivet<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:05.940> here<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.780> axe<00:01:06.960> will<00:01:07.140> come<00:01:07.260> in

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
rivet here here the axe will come in

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.260 
rivet here here the axe will come in
here<00:01:07.440> this<00:01:07.560> will<00:01:07.680> all<00:01:07.800> be<00:01:07.950> cut<00:01:08.160> out<00:01:08.190> this<00:01:09.090> will

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
here this will all be cut out this will

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.960 
here this will all be cut out this will
be<00:01:09.360> cut<00:01:09.540> out<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.280> cut<00:01:11.280> up<00:01:11.400> somewhere<00:01:11.730> in<00:01:11.760> there

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
be cut out and cut up somewhere in there

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.000 
be cut out and cut up somewhere in there
this<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.690> actually<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.110> slide<00:01:13.380> lock<00:01:13.620> on<00:01:13.860> it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
this is actually on my slide lock on it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.580 
this is actually on my slide lock on it
so<00:01:14.370> you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.460> slide<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.820> down<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.420> lock<00:01:16.410> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
so you can slide it down and lock the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.010 
so you can slide it down and lock the
Kydex<00:01:16.770> down<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.280> well<00:01:17.340> oh<00:01:17.750> yeah<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.930> get

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
Kydex down really well oh yeah I can get

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.480 
Kydex down really well oh yeah I can get
the<00:01:19.110> axe<00:01:19.260> and<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.650> gives<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.950> nice<00:01:20.100> channel

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the axe and this gives a nice channel

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.000 
the axe and this gives a nice channel
that's<00:01:20.880> pre-made<00:01:21.300> for<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.630> axe<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.830> see

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
that's pre-made for the axe and you see

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.280 
that's pre-made for the axe and you see
just<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.970> thickness<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.480> blade<00:01:24.570> so

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
just the thickness of the blade so

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.750 
just the thickness of the blade so
there's<00:01:25.440> no<00:01:25.590> reheating<00:01:26.160> I'll<00:01:26.430> probably<00:01:26.610> throw

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
there's no reheating I'll probably throw

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.060 
there's no reheating I'll probably throw
a<00:01:26.880> thumb<00:01:27.090> break<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:27.510> yet<00:01:27.660> adds<00:01:27.930> really<00:01:28.920> nice

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
a thumb break here yet adds really nice

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.430 
a thumb break here yet adds really nice
that<00:01:29.310> way<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.300> couple<00:01:30.540> milled<00:01:30.780> slots<00:01:31.050> up<00:01:31.260> top

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
that way so a couple milled slots up top

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.430 
that way so a couple milled slots up top
for<00:01:32.040> running<00:01:32.460> webbing<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.150> your<00:01:33.240> shoulder

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
for running webbing for on your shoulder

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.350 
for running webbing for on your shoulder
it's<00:01:35.340> figure<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.670> show<00:01:35.730> you<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
it's figure to show you that just the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.410 
it's figure to show you that just the
extra<00:01:36.690> work<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.870> these<00:01:37.200> customs<00:01:37.650> go<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.420> to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
extra work that these customs go to to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.640 
extra work that these customs go to to
get<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.660> stuff<00:01:39.900> proper<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.410> know<00:01:40.440> it's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
get this stuff proper you know it's

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.310 
get this stuff proper you know it's
making<00:01:40.880> custom<00:01:41.880> blocks<00:01:42.120> for<00:01:42.360> everything<00:01:42.720> so
