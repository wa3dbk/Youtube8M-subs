00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.839
 when they brought me this we said that this is a budget option 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.730
 special and most likely I will be disappointed it turned out that in this segment this mouse 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:21.210
 can do any asus rog sika is a mouse out 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.050
 categories of small symmetrical without additional buttons and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.000
 for inexpensive suitable mainly for people with small hands, although with 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.550
 my normal can hold any grip 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.760
 I hold with my palm a matte plastic on top of which there are no prints left 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.670
 Pack is also plastic to the touch the same except for these patterns 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.379
 but they are made just for beauty and they are slightly sloping for the coupling of the tank but 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.670
 It is likely that the mouse was more convenient to raise some do not like it but 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.440
 question subjective buttons do not believe 3 buttons 3 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.420
 under the main omron switches with a resource click and at 10 million due to 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.939
 the fact that the mouse can easily understand them just as easily can be replaced and this 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.140
 great news because a very common problem in bags is double 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.200
 click here if you suddenly ordered a pair 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.640
 mikryukov any aliexpress with unscrew the two screws and easy 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.049
 Replaced the same thing if you suddenly do not like the click although I do not think such 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.950
 the switches are in most of the top mouse so the click will be familiar 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.970
 many of our viewers are more discriminating wounds. 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.530
 the buttons themselves were slightly loose, but this is due to the fact that they are separated from 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.259
 The main body of the encoder is mechanical and scroll with a pronounced stroke cover with 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.009
 weights in the middle so that the mouse was not very easy but this thing 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.300
 scatters the light from the grandfather's most important advantage of this mouse 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.680
 in comparison with competitors there will be a sensor here is worth the allaga 3310 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.420
 And this is one of the best optical sensors. There is no acceleration and corner binding. 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.740
 which means that the movement of the mouse will not think out for you and you will do 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.760
 exactly what conception height is one and a half millimeters and the maximum 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.430
 the resolution is 5000 d5 increments of change in 50 that is, you can configure it this way 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:30.100
 how do you need it to be at least 400 at least 450 at least just 59 wire of medium thickness and 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.250
 stiffness without braid protection kinks have legs 3 and they 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.360
 easily removed thanks to a good deepening would be more just me 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.110
 I liked some kind of mouse rides on the control version mats but this is more likely 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.830
 all because I was just used to playing them and in fact the mouse is suitable for 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.940
 any mats it was very interesting to knit it with this handsome man who 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.300
 called vat stone type grindstone 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.670
 as you can see here the same picture as on the mouse at first glance it is some kind of 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.080
 rubberized material or silicone or what is it but in fact this fabric 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.670
 Here they used sophisticated technology and wove them into the base of a metal thread. 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.810
 as they say in order to not have any electromagnetic fields despite 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.290
 on the metal mat perfectly curled into a straw 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.019
 the fabric is water repellent and it is very easy to wash it and the bottom is rubberized surface 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:31.000
 that the mat is not food on the table is 2 millimeters thick and the size is 326 by 273 it 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.830
 the average size for floor mats, despite the fact that this is a mat version of the kontra mouse on 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.380
 it rides a little faster than on my raider 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.590
 And what did not like the very loud sound of the friction of the mouse about the cover? Well, you're the price of course 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.459
 flush with the mouse that is, the mouse at the price of the rug is obtained 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.920
 The software is called rock armory, it's pretty beautiful and everything is clear here, change de 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.790
 peau and polling frequency adjust negative or positive 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.049
 acceleration plus you can reassign buttons and adjust the backlight 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.250
 don't forget about macros as well, save your settings in your profile 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.480
 in this segment of mice a very attractive price however because of it 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.680
 you always have to sacrifice something it can be sensors it can be 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.239
 materials or something else and this is where sika compares favorably with its 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.720
 competitors here is an excellent sensor housing which 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.510
 easily understood mikriki that change easily 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.310
 If this form suits you and you do not need additional buttons, then for such money 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.990
 Sika most likely the best option on it all with you was an online store 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.900
 f his im my name is max you know what to do
