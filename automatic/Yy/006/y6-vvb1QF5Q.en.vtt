00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.109
 here is clear again with your questions 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.820
 and the question became really complete 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.290
 often asked, and really since mine 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.250
 first book appeared that's it 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.860
 a long time ago 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.180
 the question is simple i am like teen 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.519
 I tell my parents that I am 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.390
 interested in the witch tower and got there 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.340
 I'm a bit too 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.800
 experience gathered together with us 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.119
 the people who wrote me what 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.420
 works well what works 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.670
 less well and we are also happy to 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.590
 here at this point to discuss yes 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.000
 first to the thing in itself so me 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.980
 do not even think it so surprising 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.579
 that many of the teen-age in itself 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.290
 discover 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.230
 because if you look a bit like that 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.870
 in traditional cultures, a 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.329
 it was classic antique and similar 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.090
 yes the puberty the teenie time so 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.950
 the time in which one was initiated the 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.170
 so into the cultural and spiritual 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.360
 Traditions it at the place or 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.670
 until today there in traditional 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.789
 was introduced and then 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.370
 there his place gets so in the 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.759
 in the end I see that the teenie is 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.469
 then in this country interested in it 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.270
 Actually it is integrated in such a way 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.889
 human experience 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.450
 we are high today 

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:16.359
 technical and what do not I know everything 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.920
 but ultimately these transitions in the 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:21.270
 we have still life and in the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.130
 end effect would be that time in man 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.139
 In the end, yes and that is initiated 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.270
 this reflection of it we see with us 

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:29.889
 just keep in shape that 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.539
 I then go for spiritual too much 

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:32.679
 not only start to interest now 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.249
 for witches do there are quite 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:39.490
 different paths but also good 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:40.840
 so that you still get tired of it 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.090
 how can you do that to the parents at 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.159
 best at primel i think there should 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.770
 first of all the parents 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.770
 put it in a bit so yeah 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.520
 Just imagine 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.259
 let's say the parents are me 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.329
 insanely conservative but not too 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:00.189
 totally easy going healthy midfield and 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.079
 when your parents hear the word witch 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.179
 or I am now witch hexa me 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.529
 I'm interested in the way 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.869
 they will most likely think 

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:10.420
 So first, what do you think about Hansel and 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.060
 Gretel and then fall still some 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.069
 images 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.870
 the symbol was media where which weird 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.120
 People with dark customers are standing in the forest 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.950
 and very peculiar things does 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.590
 should something like this be what they 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.810
 think most of the worries are mostly about 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.680
 For the sake of God, that is a sect, yes me 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.840
 this is somehow in danger my child 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.080
 black magic satanism what is that 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.390
 and there he will be masoned as well 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.550
 a defensive attitude just because they 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.140
 it just does not know so most 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.050
 Parents are just honest about theirs 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.730
 children worried and if you have no info 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.180
 how do you know that it is 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.519
 nature spiritual way the word nature 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.140
 spirituality is him as a last resort 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.180
 come up with it if you have never heard of it 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.709
 You just have to listen 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.349
 to put another one in 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.510
 and therefore I always recommend two things 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.310
 the one is a bit the one 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.060
 salamitaktik and the other is such a 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.500
 little bit of information than not just one 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.610
 bit but as much as possible 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.000
 information 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.440
 The salamitaktik means does not matter 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.239
 the big number according to the motto 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.269
 Mom dad I always have you 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.280
 Wanted to say step by step 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.170
 slice by slice bring it slowly 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.420
 with and give the chance to it 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.230
 to get used to it and also about that 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.280
 to inform the second point 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.900
 Just look for books in 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.100
 the city library or similar are 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.989
 It's always something I personally do 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.650
 would say that for example the book 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.840
 weka by scott cunningham beautiful beautiful 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.150
 thing must be to show the parents times 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.829
 They can also look in the internet there 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.299
 There is still plenty of information if we 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.910
 do not want to buy books now 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:51.440
 or so share your knowledge with them 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.420
 share with him what you say about it yes 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.010
 just show them what is you 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.910
 can not assume yours 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.319
 Parents know that 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.060
 you can not expect that the 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.329
 parents like to freak out 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.080
 that is cases for many simple that 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.000
 it is so far away from her life as 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.860
 is first a defense since there is 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.600
 maybe so doubtful at first 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.620
 The obscure find that you will find 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.510
 weird really try your time 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.910
 to inform yourself that 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.170
 often takes a time and some will 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.060
 never really so with it 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.210
 You can also make friends with that 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.620
 all people respect the same 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.930
 the same goes for parents a 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.290
 Basic tips are easy says 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.450
 them mother slowly walked for 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.210
 step and above all something completely 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.320
 important is give to your parents 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.970
 information to keep track of you 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.650
 What that is that can not do that 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.110
 any dark sects are that 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.550
 that no satanists are that your child 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.560
 not in danger now either 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.120
 crazy or from space or in the 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.920
 Catches of any esoterics 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.990
 but that your child ends up 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.190
 easy for a form of nature religion 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.740
 interested that too it can too 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.360
 always like down here 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.230
 be discussed for others for tips 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.550
 for experience 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.900
 I can get something for myself today 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.880
 or other parents about the video 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.380
 I think that's why I'm stumbling there 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.310
 most important that you open 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.310
 talking to each other
