00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.100

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.619
 have you ever stopped to think that many 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.150
 Sometimes we use the mask of course. 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.460
 it is very important for you to have a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.080
 recharge more intense than you remembered 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.939
 only you knew that a 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.030
 shampoo for damaged hair 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.430
 can improve performance up to the brand 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.020
 Why are you already preparing your hair? 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.860
 since the washing so I'll introduce 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.829
 for you in the shampoo note 10 that I already 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.739
 I know and I will tell you that when I used it 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.710
 he usually tests some products, right? 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.719
 I'm so tough on the test 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.520
 I said okay, I'll go there and see the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.440
 hair with it smell wonderful to 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.719
 creamy texture alexandre because 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.590
 to make rich lather is I will not pass 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.649
 conditioner 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.580
 I want to see what will happen the people 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.070
 my hair looked so beautiful and it had not 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.500
 My hair is not clear easy. 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.960
 So that's okay, I'll go out there 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.750
 with an advantage but hair and with 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.080
 wonderful because this kind of today that 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.640
 You see, it's the ex 30 networks who 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.619
 was made for those with hair 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.100
 damaged and needs a treatment 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.490
 intense since the shampoo because who has 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.890
 ceramides and protein will already work 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.439
 in the most damaged areas of the hair is 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.270
 Can you guys get this back? 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.369
 resistance that is missing then goes 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.409
 reconstructing the hair fiber and also 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.810
 gives a restoration in protection because the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.520
 Damaged hair is more exposed 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.530
 It's a hair that anything that you 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.450
 make a basic brush is going to get worse 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.060
 the situation so he really needs 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.520
 well-focused treatment. 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.810
 to be able to recover quickly 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.149
 for you not to risk the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.860
 to jeopardize giving him that I who is 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.439
 with a unified bank does not have time to 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.329
 losing has to care and the brightness is not 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.219
 beyond all this reconstruction of the 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.930
 resistance of the hair 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.090
 will be mine protein 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.229
 you have here a brightness recovery 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.200
 of hair 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.720
 often it also is by ozu 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.569
 opaque with that touch is not a 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.700
 soft touch is not a silky touch and this 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.540
 Shampoo I found in the clear wash 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.730
 used does not make as much foam and 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.799
 second, it does a lot and like this foam 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.709
 could get a hand through the 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.510
 avoiding those wires then we already feel the 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.090
 hair was fine but I was what 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.340
 happened he dried disciplined and macy 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.470
 so I thought it was fantastic that with a 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.870
 washing in the first wash I already liked 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.239
 of the result and of course my hair is not 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.220
 so damaged so I have here the 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.260
 My questions that I use a lot are 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.700
 thermal procedures and then 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.069
 in when I like to use a shampoo more 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.739
 power and is super ok then to 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.989
 You who need a recovery there? 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.390
 will let your hair little by little 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.299
 better developing resistance 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.129
 strengthens and returns the brightness 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.440
 to get a healthy hair face 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.840

 explaining why using more than one 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.519
 time in their treatment already takes 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.190
