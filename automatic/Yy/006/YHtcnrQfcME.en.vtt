00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
sometimes people think that it actually

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.260 
sometimes people think that it actually
is<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.710> even<00:00:35.130> if<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.340> are<00:00:35.520> an<00:00:35.640> employee<00:00:35.940> and

you're trying to get into this this is
going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> be<00:00:37.980> beneficial<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.850> probably

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.200 
share with you time does not equal money
which<00:00:47.100> you're<00:00:47.579> probably<00:00:47.610> not<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
which you're probably not going to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.850 
which you're probably not going to
understand<00:00:48.570> why<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:48.780> I'm<00:00:49.260> going<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.500> get<00:00:49.620> into

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
understand why but I'm going to get into

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.040 
understand why but I'm going to get into
that<00:00:49.980> right<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.390> what<00:00:51.390> I'm<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.870> tell

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
that right now what I'm going to tell

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.439 
that right now what I'm going to tell
you<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.260> financial<00:00:52.980> leverage<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.730> directly

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
you is financial leverage is directly

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.430 
you is financial leverage is directly
proportional<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.289> money<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:57.170> I'm<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:58.320> going

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
proportional to money and I'm just going

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.170 
proportional to money and I'm just going
to<00:00:58.530> show<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.399> know<00:00:59.520> how<00:00:59.699> leverage

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
to show with you you know how leverage

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.709 
to show with you you know how leverage
is<00:01:00.420> equal<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.840> money<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:02.399> example<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:03.420> as

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
is equal to money so for example you as

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.690 
is equal to money so for example you as
a<00:01:03.750> normal<00:01:04.110> person<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.710> 24<00:01:05.220> hours<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.610> your

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
a normal person have 24 hours in your

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.210 
a normal person have 24 hours in your
day<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.619> what<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.740> means<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
day and you know what that means you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.570 
day and you know what that means you
have<00:01:08.869> 8760<00:01:09.869> hours<00:01:10.140> every<00:01:10.500> year<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.430> could

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
have 8760 hours every year you could

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.700 
have 8760 hours every year you could
possibly<00:01:11.790> be<00:01:12.090> working<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.200> all<00:01:13.500> know<00:01:13.680> that

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
possibly be working but we all know that

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.929 
possibly be working but we all know that
not<00:01:14.430> everyone<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:15.240> work<00:01:15.930> 24<00:01:16.439> hours<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.680> day<00:01:16.939> so

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
not everyone can work 24 hours a day so

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.420 
not everyone can work 24 hours a day so
more<00:01:18.180> realistic<00:01:18.750> thing<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.439> averaging<00:01:20.159> 10

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
more realistic thing is averaging 10

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.310 
more realistic thing is averaging 10
hours<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.820> work<00:01:21.270> every<00:01:21.600> single<00:01:21.780> day<00:01:21.960> which<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
hours of work every single day which is

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.950 
hours of work every single day which is
kind<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.799> excessive<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.720> you're<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.810> going

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
kind of excessive and you're just going

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.300 
kind of excessive and you're just going
to<00:01:25.080> end<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.229> wearing<00:01:25.470> yourself<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:25.979> doing

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
to end up wearing yourself out doing

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.940 
to end up wearing yourself out doing
this<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:27.049> even<00:01:28.049> with<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.560> work<00:01:28.740> 10

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
this but even with this you work 10

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.859 
this but even with this you work 10
hours<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.220> day<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:30.619> 3650<00:01:31.619> hours<00:01:32.009> per<00:01:32.520> year<00:01:32.869> she

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
hours a day it's 3650 hours per year she

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.710 
hours a day it's 3650 hours per year she
want<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.079> just

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
want to just

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.170 
want to just
this<00:01:36.350> explains<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:37.010> more<00:01:37.400> than<00:01:37.550> anything<00:01:37.820> like

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
this explains it more than anything like

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.340 
this explains it more than anything like
you<00:01:39.020> just<00:01:39.260> lost<00:01:39.470> a<00:01:39.740> almost<00:01:40.640> 4,000<00:01:41.420> hours<00:01:41.540> just

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
you just lost a almost 4,000 hours just

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.490 
you just lost a almost 4,000 hours just
because<00:01:42.680> you<00:01:42.920> can't<00:01:43.220> work<00:01:43.400> 24<00:01:43.700> hours<00:01:44.240> in<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.450> day

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
because you can't work 24 hours in a day

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.240 
because you can't work 24 hours in a day
so<00:01:45.500> what<00:01:45.590> are<00:01:45.650> you<00:01:45.710> supposed<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:46.010> do<00:01:46.130> about

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
so what are you supposed to do about

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.650 
so what are you supposed to do about
that<00:01:47.170> well<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.560> create<00:01:48.980> value<00:01:49.610> see<00:01:50.480> this

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
that well you create value see this

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.560 
that well you create value see this
value<00:01:51.050> creation<00:01:51.350> is<00:01:51.680> critical<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:53.300> more

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
value creation is critical the more

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.840 
value creation is critical the more
things<00:01:53.900> that<00:01:54.050> you<00:01:54.290> are<00:01:54.320> doing<00:01:54.470> each<00:01:55.250> day<00:01:55.580> when
