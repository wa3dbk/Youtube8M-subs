we're going to move and remove some

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.430 
we're going to move and remove some
components<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.840> reason<00:00:13.080> why<00:00:13.139> we're<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.320> to

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
components the reason why we're going to

components the reason why we're going to
do<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.040> give<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.250> some<00:00:14.429> better<00:00:14.639> working

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
do this is give it some better working

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.519 
do this is give it some better working
room<00:00:15.179> inside<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:15.990> have<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.230> do<00:00:16.350> some

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
room inside it so you have to do some

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.529 
room inside it so you have to do some
drilling<00:00:16.820> first<00:00:17.820> off<00:00:18.029> we'll<00:00:18.180> take<00:00:18.359> off<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
drilling first off we'll take off the
