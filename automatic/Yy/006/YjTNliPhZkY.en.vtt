hi<00:00:01.079> I'm<00:00:01.410> Odelle<00:00:01.800> Borg<00:00:02.540> our<00:00:03.540> signature<00:00:04.049> food<00:00:04.259> is

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
hi I'm Odelle Borg our signature food is

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.190 
hi I'm Odelle Borg our signature food is
different<00:00:04.770> from<00:00:04.830> our<00:00:05.009> traditional<00:00:05.220> series

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
different from our traditional series

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.690 
different from our traditional series
because<00:00:07.200> we<00:00:07.379> make<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.710> internal<00:00:08.040> mechanism<00:00:08.610> a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
because we make the internal mechanism a

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.810 
because we make the internal mechanism a
little<00:00:08.910> bit<00:00:09.030> differently<00:00:10.070> what<00:00:11.070> we<00:00:11.219> found<00:00:11.490> is

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
little bit differently what we found is

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.169 
little bit differently what we found is
that<00:00:12.389> air<00:00:12.660> turbulence<00:00:13.049> or<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:14.519> eliminate<00:00:14.759> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
that air turbulence or to eliminate the

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.830 
that air turbulence or to eliminate the
air<00:00:15.269> turbulence<00:00:15.599> creates<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.830> smoother<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.840> a

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
air turbulence creates a smoother and a

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.330 
air turbulence creates a smoother and a
more<00:00:19.020> full<00:00:19.730> brighter<00:00:20.730> voice<00:00:21.890> when<00:00:22.890> air<00:00:23.130> goes

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
more full brighter voice when air goes

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.420

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
there for you you can feel it you can

there for you you can feel it you can
trust<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.730> interesting<00:01:03.270> thing<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.570> it

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
trust it and the interesting thing is it

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.270 
trust it and the interesting thing is it
takes<00:01:03.870> very<00:01:04.199> little<00:01:04.350> breath<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.890> play<00:01:05.070> these

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
takes very little breath to play these

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.510 
takes very little breath to play these
flutes<00:01:06.590> which<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.830> advantage<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.369> is

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
flutes which the advantage to that is

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.350 
flutes which the advantage to that is
when<00:01:09.180> you're<00:01:09.360> starting<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.729> create<00:01:11.729> use<00:01:12.119> your

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
when you're starting to create use your

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.880 
when you're starting to create use your
techniques<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.260> with<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.590> flute

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
techniques with it with this flute

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.850 
techniques with it with this flute
you'll<00:01:14.189> notice<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.390> you're<00:01:16.320> trilling

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
you'll notice that you're trilling

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.550 
you'll notice that you're trilling
you're<00:01:17.340> tonguing<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.750> very<00:01:19.020> subtle<00:01:19.320> it

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
you're tonguing it can be very subtle it

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.410 
you're tonguing it can be very subtle it
can<00:01:19.680> be<00:01:19.770> very<00:01:19.979> harsh<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.610> right<00:01:20.909> there<00:01:21.180> for

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
can be very harsh it's right there for

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.719 
can be very harsh it's right there for
you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.780> trust<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.290> flute<00:01:22.590> no<00:01:23.280> matter<00:01:23.460> what

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you can trust this flute no matter what

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
you can trust this flute no matter what
it<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.060> want<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.409> be

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
it is you want it to do it's going to be

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.249 
it is you want it to do it's going to be
there<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:27.479> notes<00:01:27.720> are<00:01:27.900> clean<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
there for you the notes are clean and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:46.200 
there for you the notes are clean and
clear<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.590> full

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.550 

it<00:01:47.210> does<00:01:47.480> take<00:01:47.720> us<00:01:47.840> longer<00:01:48.080> to<00:01:48.260> make<00:01:48.410> this

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
it does take us longer to make this

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.220 
it does take us longer to make this
flute<00:01:49.000> just<00:01:50.000> in<00:01:50.150> terms<00:01:50.330> of<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.660> internal

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
flute just in terms of the internal

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.830 
flute just in terms of the internal
mechanism<00:01:51.710> but<00:01:52.460> we<00:01:52.670> also<00:01:52.880> have<00:01:53.270> put<00:01:53.480> more<00:01:53.600> work

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
mechanism but we also have put more work

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.410 
mechanism but we also have put more work
into<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:56.030> design<00:01:56.390> of<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.630> flute<00:01:56.870> so

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
into the the design of the flute so

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.290 
into the the design of the flute so
because<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:00.590> design<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:00.980> unique<00:02:01.520> every<00:02:01.910> flute

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
because the design is unique every flute

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.600 
because the design is unique every flute
is<00:02:02.480> unique<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:03.200> decided<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:03.860> limit<00:02:04.070> them<00:02:04.400> to

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
is unique we decided to limit them to

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.540 
is unique we decided to limit them to
100<00:02:05.480> flute<00:02:05.690> of<00:02:05.930> each<00:02:06.320> design<00:02:06.560> for<00:02:07.190> each<00:02:07.310> key
