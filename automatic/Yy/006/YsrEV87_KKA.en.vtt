promise you another challenge there it
is<00:00:09.860> this<00:00:10.670> time<00:00:11.000> instead<00:00:11.270> of<00:00:11.389> going<00:00:11.629> for<00:00:11.959> time

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
is this time instead of going for time

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.140 
is this time instead of going for time
we're<00:00:12.500> going<00:00:12.590> to<00:00:12.650> go<00:00:12.770> for<00:00:13.129> revolution<00:00:13.910> so

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
we're going to go for revolution so

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.269 
we're going to go for revolution so
we're<00:00:14.299> going<00:00:14.420> to<00:00:14.480> use<00:00:14.629> an<00:00:14.750> almost<00:00:15.080> 120<00:00:15.680> or<00:00:15.949> 2

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
we're going to use an almost 120 or 2

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.150 
we're going to use an almost 120 or 2
inch<00:00:16.520> or<00:00:16.789> a<00:00:16.850> one<00:00:17.180> and<00:00:17.270> a<00:00:17.360> half<00:00:17.390> inch<00:00:17.840> when<00:00:18.830> it<00:00:18.949> go

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
inch or a one and a half inch when it go

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.400 
inch or a one and a half inch when it go
as<00:00:19.460> many<00:00:19.850> times<00:00:20.270> as<00:00:20.449> you<00:00:20.630> can

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
as many times as you can

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.320 
as many times as you can
no<00:00:21.650> set<00:00:21.980> amount<00:00:22.100> of<00:00:22.340> time<00:00:22.460> so<00:00:22.670> count<00:00:23.030> how<00:00:23.270> many

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
no set amount of time so count how many

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.830 
no set amount of time so count how many
revolutions<00:00:24.140> reviews<00:00:24.530> you<00:00:24.800> get<00:00:25.300> the<00:00:26.300> true

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
revolutions reviews you get the true

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.930 
revolutions reviews you get the true
strength<00:00:27.230> of<00:00:27.410> motion<00:00:27.770> so<00:00:28.039> how<00:00:28.250> long<00:00:28.550> can<00:00:28.760> you

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
strength of motion so how long can you

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.810 
strength of motion so how long can you
sustain<00:00:29.320> this<00:00:30.320> strengthen<00:00:30.980> efficiency<00:00:31.520> all

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
sustain this strengthen efficiency all

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.170 
sustain this strengthen efficiency all
right

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180

rule is there's no stopping there's no
break<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:52.039> there's<00:00:52.159> no<00:00:52.280> double<00:00:52.760> jumping<00:00:53.389> all

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
break and there's no double jumping all

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.450 
break and there's no double jumping all
right<00:00:53.780> double<00:00:54.109> a<00:00:54.229> double<00:00:54.260> skip<00:00:54.979> of<00:00:55.159> the<00:00:55.280> other

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460

come off the ground the world passes

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:01.779 
come off the ground the world passes
through<00:00:59.170> feet<00:01:00.170> hit<00:01:00.409> the<00:01:00.440> ground<00:01:00.559> will<00:01:01.489> comes

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
through feet hit the ground will comes

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.570 
through feet hit the ground will comes
through<00:01:01.999> again<00:01:02.120> beat<00:01:02.749> go<00:01:02.899> underneath<00:01:03.580> rope
