the teaching approach and what stops us
from<00:00:39.600> making<00:00:39.719> changes<00:00:40.399> so<00:00:41.399> some<00:00:41.610> fundamentals

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
from making changes so some fundamentals

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.139 
from making changes so some fundamentals
here<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:43.440> all<00:00:43.530> change<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.520> teachers<00:00:44.850> change

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149

with maturity and change with confidence
it's<00:00:49.500> really<00:00:49.860> important<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.370> try<00:00:50.520> out<00:00:50.730> new

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
it's really important to try out new

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.060 
it's really important to try out new
things<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.600> creative<00:00:51.920> things<00:00:52.920> are

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
things and to be creative things are

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.860 
things and to be creative things are
changing<00:00:53.489> all<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.730> time<00:00:53.910> around<00:00:54.390> us<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
changing all the time around us and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.170 
changing all the time around us and
simply<00:00:55.289> things<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.100> being<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.640> date<00:00:56.789> with

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
simply things like being up to date with

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.540 
simply things like being up to date with
technology<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.989> how<00:00:58.500> we're<00:00:58.649> using<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.160> as

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
technology and how we're using it as

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.250 
technology and how we're using it as
well<00:00:59.820> as<00:00:59.910> our<00:01:00.059> approach<00:01:00.390> will<00:01:00.719> help<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.109> build

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
well as our approach will help to build

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.299 
well as our approach will help to build
confidence<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.989> we<00:01:03.989> need<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.320> also<00:01:04.530> accept<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
confidence and we need to also accept to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.820 
confidence and we need to also accept to
know<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.000> naturally<00:01:06.450> resist<00:01:06.900> change<00:01:07.290> we

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
know that we naturally resist change we

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.609 
know that we naturally resist change we
all<00:01:08.070> do<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:08.850> don't<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
all do it we don't like it and we have a

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.890 
all do it we don't like it and we have a
very<00:01:10.830> clear<00:01:11.220> comfort<00:01:11.670> zone<00:01:11.850> around<00:01:12.180> us<00:01:12.540> so

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
very clear comfort zone around us so

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.080 
very clear comfort zone around us so
I'll<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.080> talking<00:01:13.229> about<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:14.010> well<00:01:14.250> so

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
I'll be talking about that as well so

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.640 
I'll be talking about that as well so
first<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.450> all<00:01:15.509> think<00:01:15.840> about<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.380> changes

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
first of all think about what changes

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.190 
first of all think about what changes
you<00:01:17.400> may<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.759> made<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.360> your<00:01:18.420> teaching<00:01:18.930> in

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
profession you may have made changes

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.679 
profession you may have made changes
based<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:23.130> feedback<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:24.060> may<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.479> been

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
based on feedback that may have been

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
will be changing all the time it's

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.160 
will be changing all the time it's
important<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> know<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.689> teach<00:01:51.899> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
important to know that when we teach and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.889 
important to know that when we teach and
train<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.710> are<00:01:52.799> always<00:01:53.100> open<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:54.090> criticism<00:01:54.210> we

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
train we are always open to criticism we

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.200 
train we are always open to criticism we
are<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.229> center<00:01:55.890> stage<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.670> people<00:01:57.090> will

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
are on center stage and people will

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.209 
are on center stage and people will
criticize<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.590> therefore<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.040> need<00:01:59.159> to

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
criticize and so therefore you need to

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.429 
criticize and so therefore you need to
know<00:01:59.490> how<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.759> take<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.329> board<00:02:00.360> when<00:02:01.259> to

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
know how to take that on board when to

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.520 
know how to take that on board when to
take<00:02:01.619> your<00:02:01.829> boards<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.689> how<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.170> then

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
take your boards and if so how you then

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.730 
take your boards and if so how you then
change<00:02:04.829> or<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.729> may<00:02:05.880> not<00:02:06.030> change<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.170> need

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
change or you may not change so you need

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.710 
change or you may not change so you need
to<00:02:07.829> be<00:02:07.920> very<00:02:08.099> very<00:02:08.310> aware<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.849> how<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.390> deal

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
to be very very aware of how you deal

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.880 
to be very very aware of how you deal
with<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.200> how<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.379> deal<00:02:10.649> with<00:02:10.679> that

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
with that and how you deal with that

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.640 
with that and how you deal with that
criticism

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
criticism

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.680 
criticism
and<00:02:12.890> finally<00:02:13.310> thinking<00:02:13.760> about<00:02:14.060> technology

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
and finally thinking about technology

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.470 
and finally thinking about technology
and<00:02:15.020> whether<00:02:15.680> or<00:02:16.010> not<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.520> are<00:02:16.550> adaptable<00:02:17.270> to

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
and whether or not you are adaptable to

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.530 
and whether or not you are adaptable to
that<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.260> how<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:18.530> adapt<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:20.090> in<00:02:20.390> the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
that and how you adapt to that in the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.839 
that and how you adapt to that in the
classroom<00:02:21.080> technology<00:02:21.980> would<00:02:22.160> have<00:02:22.250> impacted

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
classroom technology would have impacted

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.370 
classroom technology would have impacted
everything<00:02:23.270> that<00:02:23.510> you<00:02:23.630> do<00:02:23.810> from<00:02:24.200> how<00:02:24.319> you

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
everything that you do from how you

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.860 
everything that you do from how you

prepare to how you deliver something in
the<00:02:27.050> classroom<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.680> your<00:02:27.830> students<00:02:28.370> may<00:02:28.610> very

technology than you are so it's really

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.680

benefits<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.170> changing<00:02:39.769> our<00:02:39.950> approach<00:02:40.700> when

failure<00:03:37.250> so<00:03:38.120> failure<00:03:38.480> is<00:03:38.810> where<00:03:39.019> you<00:03:39.140> actually

failure so failure is where you actually

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.680 
failure so failure is where you actually
learn<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:40.040> most<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.730> we<00:03:41.000> can<00:03:41.180> get<00:03:41.359> a<00:03:41.390> lot<00:03:41.660> of

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
learn the most and we can get a lot of

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.759 
learn the most and we can get a lot of
creativity<00:03:42.140> coming<00:03:42.799> out<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:43.130> failure<00:03:44.769> finally

what<00:03:46.160> stops<00:03:46.489> us<00:03:46.640> from<00:03:46.940> making<00:03:47.060> changes<00:03:47.720> I

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
what stops us from making changes I

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.110 
what stops us from making changes I
talked<00:03:48.410> about<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.890> comfort<00:03:49.280> zone<00:03:49.489> earlier

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
talked about the comfort zone earlier

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.140 
talked about the comfort zone earlier
and<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:51.440> fact<00:03:51.680> is<00:03:51.890> we<00:03:51.920> all<00:03:52.340> like<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.730> operate

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
and the fact is we all like to operate

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.130 
and the fact is we all like to operate
inside<00:03:53.989> our<00:03:54.350> comfort<00:03:54.920> zone<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:56.239> we<00:03:56.720> naturally

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
inside our comfort zone and we naturally

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.039
