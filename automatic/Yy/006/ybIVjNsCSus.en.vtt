00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 has long been the fine dust theme in 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.899
 our cities have an official face 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.120
 The entrance prohibition signs before the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.800
 inside cities, the environmental zones 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.110
 next to too the controls of 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.630
 entry authorization the retrofit 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.400
 with soot particulate filter system can get away 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.210
 free again and your car something 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.640
 make it more valuable 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.609
 the number of environmental zones in ours 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.320
 Cities are steadily increasing in need of them too 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.750
 stay outside soon 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.140
 More and more cities allow the entrance 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.489
 only with the green plaque 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.930
 Authorized vehicles must comply with this 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.489
 the corresponding plaque on the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.649
 prove windshield 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.200
 Otherwise, there is a risk of a fine 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.200
 from 40 euros and a point in flensburg 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.100
 this also affects the state 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.930
 subsidy of 330 euros for the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.570
 retrofitting a diesel vehicle with 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.430
 a soot particle filter 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.409
 The Federal Environment Ministry has for the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.830
 diesel particulate filter retrofit for 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.290
 the year 2012 a total of 30 million 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.439
 euro in the federal budget 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.950
 This corresponds to about 90,000 retrofits 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.439
 since february 2012 via the federal office 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.390
 for economy and export control 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.369
 These vehicles are handled without 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.500
 Filter retrofitting can only be done 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.380
 very very difficult to sell from the market 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.700
 Vehicles with diesel filter retrofit 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.350
 have a much higher 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.500
 resale value 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.810
 At the same time you will also be examining the kfz champion's business 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.840
 whether the ossi catalyst be renewed 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.350
 must be at more than 80,000 km mileage 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.549
 is the exchange 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.650
 a requirement for a 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.659
 functioning particle filter system 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.299
 the plaque requirement also applies 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.850
 transporters and light commercial vehicles 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.119
 with a total mass of 3.5 tons 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.619
 permissible total weight 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.299
 at worst they can 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.700
 soon deliver their customers no longer 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.560
 or your own with your vehicle 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.209
 Company property no longer free of impunity 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.850
 leave or reach 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.760
 Although there are exemptions but the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.819
 are becoming increasingly restrictive 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.220
 fees are also charged 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.090
 Do something for the environment and stay 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.040
 she is mobile 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.519
 equip your diesel with one 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.319
 Particulate filter ask for the 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.319
