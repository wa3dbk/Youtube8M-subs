00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.370 
nasty last time the good fight but yeah
I<00:03:58.770> think<00:03:58.950> he's<00:03:59.250> good<00:03:59.459> challenger<00:04:00.150> but<00:04:00.750> I'm

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
I think he's good challenger but I'm

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.400 
I think he's good challenger but I'm
from<00:04:02.209> my<00:04:03.209> point<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.570> view<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:03.780> think<00:04:03.870> he's<00:04:04.230> not

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
from my point of view I think he's not

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.280 
from my point of view I think he's not
there<00:04:04.770> just<00:04:04.800> yet<00:04:05.370> he<00:04:05.730> still<00:04:05.810> there's<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.959> I

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
there just yet he still there's the I

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.440 
there just yet he still there's the I
think<00:04:07.739> he<00:04:07.860> still<00:04:08.070> needs<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.430> be<00:04:08.520> built<00:04:08.760> but<00:04:09.150> he

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
think he still needs to be built but he

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.500 
think he still needs to be built but he
definitely<00:04:09.720> could<00:04:10.080> be<00:04:10.520> yeah<00:04:11.520> could<00:04:11.880> be<00:04:12.030> one<00:04:12.480> of

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
definitely could be yeah could be one of

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.650 
definitely could be yeah could be one of
the<00:04:12.690> big<00:04:12.840> guys<00:04:13.020> someday
