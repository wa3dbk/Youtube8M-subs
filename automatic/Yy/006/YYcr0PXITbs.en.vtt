00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.500
 the astronauts of the mission sts 115 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.690
 they were subject to great tension 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.030
 during the entire mission they saw UFOs and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.130
 even in the end a UFO prevented the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.770
 return of the ferry to land by 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.410
 24 hours upon return 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.090
 stephanie without piper the astronaut tried 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.100
 to offer a press conference 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.939
 but he passed out on two occasions 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.289
 because of the stress syndrome 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.439
 post-traumatic that was what they lived 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.190
 these men these women in the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.620
 space the information was 11 with 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.860
 45 minutes of the morning of that 9 of 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.530
 September 2006 when the sts mission 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.989
 115 for the atlantis ferry 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.160
 took off from the launch complex 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.410
 39a 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.899
 located in the Kennedy space center in 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.760
 florida as it was however 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.710
 the nasa changed the plans to return 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.469
 then the return of atlantis to the earth 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.440
 it was delayed one day because of the meeting 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.629
 with this object on September 19 a 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.459
 object that for more than 11 hours 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.540
 remained the upper layers of the 

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.700
 atmosphere 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.620
 enabling the step although in a 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.410
 principle it was said that it was about 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.520
 space debris from ice and even from 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.200
 a bag 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.660
 the nasa finally commented that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.380
 he did not know the presence referring to 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.330
 this as a strange object once in 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.400
 land and during a conference where 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.110
 the crew gave details of their 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.110
 activities happened this 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.330
 in good shape efe 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.710
 in the neighborhood 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.260
 is astronaut stephen and without a paper 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.090
 of the members of the sts 115 mission 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.060
 of the atlantis shuttle who gets 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.130
 fades just when he related to the 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.350
 press his experience when observing a 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.720
 strange object very close to 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.240
 ferry when he intended to perform 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.700
 a maneuver outside the ship tried 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.500
 continue however to remember that 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.990
 unexpected encounter with the object 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.540
 manifested once again the call 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.790
 PTSD to 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.860
 point of leaving the room for a 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.120
 revision that was what kept the 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.670
 crew of atlantis to the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.010
 expectation these images reveal 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.590
 while the shuttle throws a 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.450
 Unknown liquid in the background is observed 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.310
 as something emerges from space is approaching 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.850
 their movements rule out the possibility 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.430
 of a reflection or a satellite this object 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.760
 tubular would seem to watch over the strange 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.430
 situation little by little it moves away until 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.980
 disappear but this was not the only 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.600
 image unidentified objects 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.640
 captured during the mission since the 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.460
 I hit business without imagining what 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.370
 would happen from the first day they started 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.530
 the unexpected encounters 5 spheres of 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.690
 large size a formation that called the 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.820
 attention of the crew pictures 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.710
 captured from the ferry that 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.080
 I was orbiting the republic 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.120
 mexicana the dawn of the 14 of 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.400
 September while trying to put 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.960
 in motion the new solar panels that 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.270
 double the energy capacity 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.340
 electric space station in the 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.370
 take notice of the existence of a 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.560
 object suddenly and without explanation the 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.640
 transmission was interrupted by several 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.100
 minutes chance see how this 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.290
 luminous sphere swiftly passed in front of 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.060
 the international space station the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.630
 cameras installed in the atlantis 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.000
 they managed to capture the on September 17 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.220
 what happened in the 13 days and hours that 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.050
 lasted the mission was transcendental in the 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.880
 count of previous missions and 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.340
 reference for crews 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.980
 subsequent encounters with strangers 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.380
 presences that were not foreseen 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.660
 within the plans presences that 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.430
 interfered with human activities 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.909
 in him 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.500
 the sts 115 managed to collect a greater 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:10.120
 number of UFO images 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.879
 that is, the sts 115 was never alone in 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.489
 the space challenging images that we 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:18.280
 suggest but they reveal reality in 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.789
 the space a reality that not only 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.190
 belongs to the sts 115 mission but to the 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.620
 humanity to every man on earth and 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.710
 the space visitors crew 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.280
 that they are never alone and neither 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.280
 preparations 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.230
 what happened on the outskirts of 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.330
 atlantis ferry between 9 and the 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.580
 September 20, 2006 is 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.260
 transcendental but it is not more the 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.030
 stephanie astronaut reaction without 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.160
 faiffer when remembering to have been found 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.830
 so closely in space with a 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.380
 strange object an event for which neither 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.870
 she nor the rest of the crew 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.520
 They were prepared for the third millennium
