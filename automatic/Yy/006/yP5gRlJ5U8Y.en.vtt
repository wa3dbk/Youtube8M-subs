pick up focus on the flat surface of the
mirror<00:03:03.490> a<00:03:03.790> simple<00:03:04.510> trick<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.080> solve<00:03:05.320> this<00:03:05.560> is

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
mirror a simple trick to solve this is

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.680 
mirror a simple trick to solve this is
to<00:03:05.830> simply<00:03:06.310> move<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.520> camera<00:03:06.910> over<00:03:07.180> slightly

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
to simply move the camera over slightly

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.780 
to simply move the camera over slightly
so<00:03:08.410> it<00:03:08.530> picks<00:03:08.680> up<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.010> edge<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.460> the<00:03:09.610> mirror

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
so it picks up the edge of the mirror

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.850 
so it picks up the edge of the mirror
there's<00:03:10.390> more<00:03:10.690> light<00:03:10.930> on<00:03:10.960> the<00:03:11.290> subject<00:03:11.470> and

there's more light on the subject and

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.740 
there's more light on the subject and
the<00:03:11.980> camera<00:03:12.280> finds<00:03:12.520> it<00:03:12.700> easier<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.240> focus<00:03:13.450> on
