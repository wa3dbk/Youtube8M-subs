00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 hello people with you antoha goodnight 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.300
 and today such a small video will be 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.099
 solution to one small technical 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.540
 problem with which in principle can 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.500
 push anyone into the assembly 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.460
 computer although now of course this 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.920
 problem occurs 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.130
 less often and in principle with me she originated in 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.900
 first time here and well let me tell you all 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:32.309
 I will tell you everything; 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.370
 there is a plan going today 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.800
 such a small working computer here 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.000
 for the home for the Internet is very this such 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.640
 here it is 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.020
 that is, there is basically nothing 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.790
 interesting not everything is not there 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.390
 intel pentium 2 gig memory processor 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.710
 there is a simple motherboard 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.130
 relatively inexpensive power supply 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.480
 a cheap 350 watt flash that's it 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.100
 and the client had it relatively 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.050
 fresh that is, there he was old 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.780
 computer so we from him under and how much 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.780
 it means it was a fresh hard drive 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.050
 for 500 gigs they changed it already for 350 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.970
 watt power supply he also changed here but 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.619
 everything else there was trash old here 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.530
 we decided to just from as where is the internet 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.600
 build and such an inexpensive computer 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:23.190
 Here we bought a new case zalman such 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.820
 but basically here are all the glands here we are 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.789
 gathered here you put here and in general 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.350
 What is my problem? 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:35.729
 I had a technical problem 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.090
 plan when trying to connect this 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.640
 power supply here in this case to this 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.820
 motherboard connector connect 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.979
 processor power connector 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.650
 Look even directly, that is, they 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.090
 how can I not get it 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.799
 no not to mention that I would 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.840
 of course I wanted to pave it all behind 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.080
 I started to see you here 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.720
 lay as if everything is beautiful here alone 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.229
 from the front panel laid wiring 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.489
 there on food yarensk payment that is what 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.200
 same back you can prokinut 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.540
 what I have the desire to do everything 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.790
 nice but nothing works 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.989
 even here directly even directly nifiga 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.540
 does not want to connect 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:23.940
 here and behind there, all the more accordingly 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.530
 usually this problem is solved but i am so 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.170
 I understand in big cities where there is 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.840
 reputable stores decided purchase 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.700
 power supply line extension 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.459
 there can be bought here just an extension cord 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.799
 everything will be fine and good 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:42.959
 here but but I ran into such a problem 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.000
 our city is not very big and serious 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.400
 we are not very strong stores and 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.739
 in principle, they are not very serious 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.170
 so call everyone all the stores 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.440
 who is such a miracle 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:00.050
 CPU power extension was not found 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:02.120
 here respectively respectively than 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.310
 It can be done in principle very well 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.709
 simple solution to roughly lengthen 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.770
 build up this wire this is 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.470
 cut it solder solder here 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.010
 extra wire and that is just 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.840
 so lengthen the meaning here than 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.260
 power supply ton new year warranty 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.269
 sit on cutting the wire we will lose 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.860
 guarantee this will be bad because 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.660
 that power supplies are pretty naughty 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.330
 something breaks they pretty often 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.569
 here it costs 950 rubles, which is basically 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.870
 for our province, too, like money 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:43.209
 here therefore as though this is not our method 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.450
 here we are something thinking after thinking I decided 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.690
 to stir up 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.400
 an extension cord with my own hands here in 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.220
 general that we need for that 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.190
 we will do we need 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.940
 he will need an old motherboard 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:00.730
 here with which we will evaporate 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.040
 processor power connector 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.579
 here's the old motherboard killed 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.120
 and we donâ€™t need it anymore 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:17.090
 with us as a donor here and we act here 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:20.060
 This connector is soldering this 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:25.360
 the connector here to the tail we 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:28.880
 cut off the dead again from the dead 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:34.340
 PSU old here here at 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:37.610
 We hung here and the key does not want to shoot 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:42.860
 focus infection such here and here 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:45.880
 hung on his cuts by that is we him 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:52.190
 solder here to the back 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:59.390
 it will be inserted here now 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:00.919
 we have his strawberry friend here and here 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.590
 there will be this here and here 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:08.659
 connector will hang and in connector we 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.050
 already insert we already insert our one 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.380
 most 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.760
 why the bayonets rock that's why such here 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.200
 two weeks try to do 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.010
 with our own hands for this to us 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.229
 would need 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:22.360
 Well, what I listed is the old block 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.360
 power old old power supply 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:28.340
 hence the old motherboard and different 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:34.820
 there soldering accessories 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:37.720
 and now i'm doing all this and then 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.720
 I'll show you what you got 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:46.380
 in general, in general, after all the manipulations and 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.480
 Here is such a thing turned out 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.310
 razmerchik I really soldered a connector 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.050
 the other is not so much that I first 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.820
 showed there something i liked how 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.010
 it is firmly attached there is already complicated 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.650
 a little bit was soldering something that is complicated 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:03.090
 it was possible but this infringement was me there 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:06.310
 I found the solder easier to find 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:09.280
 Here is such a so here for the thread with us 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.440
 turned out so now let's try 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.190
 how does he work first check 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.140
 we will check i think correctly using 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.330
 At night, the multimeter will be first 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.800
 check 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:24.640
 in fact it is already in his corps 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.850
 use here i have such here 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.600
 multimeter to check the power supply god 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:34.960
 in the power here we hooked up 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.770
 connector in the extension cable here we are 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.520
 brought out too 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:45.430
 that is, in general, and the connection 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:51.960
 let's try to start his block 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:57.370
 power wound up here is how we see 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:59.610
 the voltage is all right here plus minus 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.610
 there 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:07.650
 in general , well, and now the general soul 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:12.139
 before picking up the kombu, I'll show you how 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.139
 will work in practice 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:18.940
 so well, here I have collected a computer in general 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:22.390
 finally that's what happened with us 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.310
 Look, I had enough of my own 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.320
 homemade extension cord to 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:30.820
 shove that is totally back 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.050
 wall all the wires well, that's like a 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:36.720
 here is cable management 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:41.530
 yes in the building on campus for a thousand rubles 

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:43.270
 here is quite nothing happened come on 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:51.670
 Now if we do not see anything 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:54.090
 it will spark start here in general everything 

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.090
 furychit 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:07.380
 everything is okay 

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:09.690
 install windu everyone thanks for all 

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.540
 viewing hopefully was useful maybe 

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:14.540
 Someone like this thing 

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.540
 happen
