00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.129
 that we do not throw his friend back here 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.840
 alan I bring you this video where they 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.789
 I will show the different types of 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.189
 connections that can be made in a 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.660
 pair of double coil subwoofer 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.340
 difference of the connections that 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.680
 have in a single dual coil subwoofer 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.380
 in a couple of its buffer connections that 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.380
 we have three serial connections 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.989
 the parallel connection and the connection in 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.910
 parallel series if you missed the video 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.410
 how to connect a single double subwoofer 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.969
 coil I recommend you deploy the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.260
 next video for what there is that 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.120
 load 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.700
 then we have a final charge left here 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.290
 of two eyes first in this video 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.820
 let's see the connection in parallel the 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.800
 parallel connection is made from the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.810
 next way we take the positive of 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.860
 this coil and we connect it to the positive 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.710
 from the other coil 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.580
 then we take the negative of this 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.680
 coil and we connect it to the negative of 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.290
 this other government come to this same 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.910
 connection logic let's take the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.650
 positive of this coil and what 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.290
 we will connect to the positive of this other 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.050
 coil as it is a very short station 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.510
 we can make ourselves a smaller cable 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.290
 then we connect the positive of this 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.760
 coil with the positive of this other and 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.409
 then we take the negative of this 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.689
 coil 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.720
 and we connect it to the negative of this other 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.140
 urine 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.300
 we take the state positive wine 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.850
 but before connecting it to the positive of 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.230
 this other coil let's join it with this 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.570
 another cable 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.659
 and then 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.040
 we connect it we take another cable what 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.920
 we connect to the positive of this coil 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.659
 we unite 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.170
 with this cable 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.170
 Y 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.350
 connect 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.190
 to the negative of this other government 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.590
 social cable sport that will go 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.700
 connected to our amplifier 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.870
 we only connect positive and negative 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.940
 and ready 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.300
 good in the event that our surfers 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.580
 are each double coil 4 oms the 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.890
 final race we are left 1 and in the 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.260
 case we have the boomers that 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.460
 be double coil of 2 or more we are going to 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:26.210
 stay connected to 0.5 or more if you do not 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.010
 suffers are double coil of 8 charge 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.500
 final that we are going to obtain is going to be of 2 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.210
 sons and for this occasion as they 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.250
 commented only we saw the connection 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.510
 in parallel in other subsequent videos 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.540
 we will be seeing how it should be done 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.530
 the series connection and parallel series 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.750
 I hope you have been very helpful 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.120
 do not forget to subscribe to comment give 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.400
 they liked it and we go for the 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.530
 next video bay we also have the 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.600
 nipples that some protectors for 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.720
 horns that when we get on the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.930
 holes in the doors we do not want that 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.930
 be seen
