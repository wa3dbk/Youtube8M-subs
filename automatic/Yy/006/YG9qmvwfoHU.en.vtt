00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
hard to do that I think we're the only

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.630 
hard to do that I think we're the only
real<00:02:31.110> downside<00:02:31.380> with<00:02:31.830> Sam<00:02:31.980> card<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.370> mean<00:02:32.459> it's

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640

a really neat Auto scan app you need to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.960 
a really neat Auto scan app you need to
have<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> steady<00:02:34.860> hand<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.550> can<00:02:35.640> get<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.820> good

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
have a steady hand you can get a good

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.550 
have a steady hand you can get a good
photo<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.630> taking<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.900> photo<00:02:37.080> op<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.230> screen
