over<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.799> world<00:01:41.979> I<00:01:42.250> have<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.759> ask<00:01:42.909> you<00:01:43.119> this<00:01:43.240> is

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
over the world I have to ask you this is

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.600 
over the world I have to ask you this is
your<00:01:43.869> I<00:01:44.049> think<00:01:44.290> second<00:01:44.650> HPT<00:01:45.159> event<00:01:45.460> we've

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
your I think second HPT event we've

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.999 
your I think second HPT event we've
we've<00:01:46.090> modified<00:01:46.479> our<00:01:46.810> structure<00:01:47.350> I'm<00:01:47.799> sure

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
we've modified our structure I'm sure

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.050 
we've modified our structure I'm sure
you've<00:01:48.159> looked<00:01:48.310> at<00:01:48.490> it<00:01:48.579> what<00:01:48.670> do<00:01:48.759> you<00:01:48.820> think<00:01:48.970> of

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
you've looked at it what do you think of

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.999 
you've looked at it what do you think of
the<00:01:49.180> current<00:01:49.479> HPT<00:01:49.960> structure<00:01:50.350> Daniel

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
the current HPT structure Daniel

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.920 
the current HPT structure Daniel
Negreanu<00:01:51.280> of<00:01:51.640> course<00:01:51.850> helped<00:01:52.299> us<00:01:52.420> design<00:01:52.600> that

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
Negreanu of course helped us design that

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.140 
Negreanu of course helped us design that
structure<00:01:53.259> but<00:01:53.350> what<00:01:53.470> are<00:01:53.530> your<00:01:53.619> thoughts<00:01:53.799> I

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
structure but what are your thoughts I

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.490 
structure but what are your thoughts I
really<00:01:55.150> like<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.450> structure<00:01:55.930> I<00:01:55.960> think<00:01:56.350> I

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
really like the structure I think I

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.399 
really like the structure I think I
think<00:01:56.740> Daniel<00:01:57.399> is<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.549> smart<00:01:57.850> guy<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.329> he<00:01:59.020> sets

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
think Daniel is a smart guy and he sets

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.139 
think Daniel is a smart guy and he sets
things<00:01:59.649> up<00:01:59.950> so<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.340> there's<00:02:00.610> more<00:02:00.820> skill

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
things up so that there's more skill

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.389 
things up so that there's more skill
later<00:02:01.540> in<00:02:01.750> tournaments<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.560> that's<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.280> way

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
later in tournaments and that's the way

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.490 
later in tournaments and that's the way
it<00:02:03.460> should<00:02:03.520> be<00:02:03.729> so<00:02:04.270> I<00:02:04.600> really<00:02:05.079> like<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.409> new

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
it should be so I really like the new

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.399 
it should be so I really like the new
structure<00:02:05.829> and<00:02:06.720> you<00:02:07.720> know<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:07.840> don't<00:02:08.200> have<00:02:08.289> that

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:08.409 
structure and you know I don't have that

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.889 
structure and you know I don't have that
many<00:02:08.679> chips<00:02:09.039> I<00:02:09.219> have<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:09.549> know<00:02:09.719> 79,000<00:02:10.719> so

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
many chips I have you know 79,000 so

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.839 
many chips I have you know 79,000 so
we'll<00:02:11.590> see<00:02:11.769> how<00:02:11.799> it<00:02:11.919> plays<00:02:12.040> out<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.519> mean<00:02:12.760> it

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
we'll see how it plays out I mean it

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:13.059 
we'll see how it plays out I mean it
could

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
could

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.649 
could
easily<00:02:13.459> be<00:02:13.670> one<00:02:13.939> of<00:02:14.030> those<00:02:14.120> things<00:02:14.359> where<00:02:14.540> I

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
easily be one of those things where I

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:15.970 
easily be one of those things where I
get<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.989> like<00:02:15.140> two<00:02:15.469> or<00:02:15.499> three<00:02:15.620> hundred

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
get to like two or three hundred

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.280 
get to like two or three hundred
thousand<00:02:16.370> early<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:16.969> day<00:02:17.540> two<00:02:17.599> and<00:02:17.989> just<00:02:18.170> have
