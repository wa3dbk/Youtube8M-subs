00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
we keep running to get the hell out of

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:36.350 
we keep running to get the hell out of
here

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
here

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.289 
here
and<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:37.350> path<00:01:37.560> also<00:01:38.130> forces<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.850> warp<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
and this path also forces you to warp to

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.060 
and this path also forces you to warp to
level<00:01:39.689> 10<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.290> can't<00:01:40.590> play<00:01:40.770> through<00:01:40.979> all<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
level 10 so I can't play through all the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.389 
level 10 so I can't play through all the
levels<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.610> said<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.820> was<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.299> I

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
levels like I said I was going to I

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.289 
levels like I said I was going to I
honestly<00:01:44.399> don't<00:01:44.490> know<00:01:44.610> why<00:01:44.820> they<00:01:45.000> did<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.270> I

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
honestly don't know why they did that I

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.310 
honestly don't know why they did that I
guess<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.750> mercy<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.200> you're

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
guess it's kind of a mercy if you're

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.719 
guess it's kind of a mercy if you're
going<00:01:46.439> for<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> better<00:01:46.890> endings<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.640> don't
