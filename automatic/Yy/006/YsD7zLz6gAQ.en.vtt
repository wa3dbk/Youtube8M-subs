00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.950
 Then thank you , Mr. Yuki Machida, congratulations 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.820
 There 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.240
 What kind of feeling did the venue last be a standing ovation 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.090
 I'm glad I just 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:18.850
 No 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:22.920
 The other half 3 minutes or so was the battle against the hole beauty opposite to the fall 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.920
 It was a perfect fight against myself 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:32.740
 I see how the other players are coming out and say that I fight with myself 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.210
 But there was St. Praxedis of the second regular second 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:41.400
 Unplug in Well of their bodies were found in the fact that no other 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:46.500
 That strategy Tteyuu the time being until the end together like 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.910
 To but I'd done or the way to have a shift change it any time that the audience really 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.400
 You are excited 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.750
 Really this 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.110
 That completion 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.250
 Alone 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.970
 No, this suffering 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.840
 voice 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.990
 It is worth it 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.000
 I 'm really just just happy 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.380
 It will be more from now when it is the first time you get this response while playing in front of you 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.670
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:20.710
 Than I think about 60% because really now, as can be Well 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:25.520
 You still go even triple Axel still Kunming at the step Yes Feripu jump 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:29.300
 Because there should be three consecutive combinations and a back step 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.080
 I think I can earn more than 10 points lightly 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.840
 How tired do you feel when it comes to yesterday? 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.800
 I didn't think so too 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.430
 Oh dear 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:46.150
 It's the game that comes to an end ready, but I couldn't do it 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:51.790
 So Well things in that that was able to acting only this is 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:55.950
 I'm proud and I think this was 120% of my performance today 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:59.570
 Just maa from the next France 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.570
 In addition, raise your capacity 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.590
 I think I have to do I think I still have to grow a frame of growth short 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.289
 Because 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.990
 A total of 15 points and 20 points 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.670
 I believe it should be raised 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:19.700
 The same is true for that place, but players who will appear in the future will buy that last year's American convention 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:24.940
 When I was talking standing received a terribly stimulation Hanyu players 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.940
 The strength is not reflected in everyone's mind, I wonder 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.350
 that 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:37.520
 Yes, not only to Hanyu players but also to Japanese players 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.770
 I think I might have been thrown a good ball 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.720
 How does the other party beat it back? 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:47.150
 And I watched carefully how the other party throws back I 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.159
 Poised with that Don 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:55.909
 Only ride to the game next tomorrow in the previous Though the French tournament 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.410
 There is also an exhibition I look forward to it 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.370
 The 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.900
 Body 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:08.150
 Because it is reluctantly but really second place second place Celebration version of that chair peach rice fields 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:12.730
 Because you are preparing the foreign country is the first voice, I will surely also 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.650
 Maybe I think first of my last season's short 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.840
 that 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:25.099
 I think I'll betray you in a good sense, so I'm going to support myself well tomorrow 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.099
 I think from it after the audience of local and want to deliver to all customers of Japan
