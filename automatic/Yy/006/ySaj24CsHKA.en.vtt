through it but not quite a bit more you
can<00:01:11.520> also<00:01:11.670> use<00:01:12.030> pasta<00:01:12.540> machine<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.229> think

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860

it<00:03:07.650> won't<00:03:07.890> hurt<00:03:08.100> anything<00:03:10.370> but<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.550> want<00:03:11.790> to

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
it won't hurt anything but you want to

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.940 
it won't hurt anything but you want to
try<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.150> keep<00:03:12.420> them<00:03:12.600> as<00:03:12.750> separated<00:03:13.380> as<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.680> can

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
try to keep them as separated as you can

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.500 
try to keep them as separated as you can
so<00:03:14.280> they<00:03:14.580> look<00:03:14.790> natural

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.690 

if<00:03:21.050> you<00:03:21.349> find<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:21.830> your<00:03:22.099> petals<00:03:22.459> are

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
if you find that your petals are

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.229 
if you find that your petals are
sticking<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:24.530> can<00:03:25.000> do<00:03:26.000> every<00:03:26.480> other<00:03:26.510> one<00:03:28.239> like

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
sticking you can do every other one like

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.020 
sticking you can do every other one like
so

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.630 

and<00:03:33.120> then<00:03:33.750> go<00:03:33.930> back<00:03:33.960> and<00:03:34.530> catch<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.250> ones<00:03:35.460> it

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
and then go back and catch the ones it

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.310 
and then go back and catch the ones it
gives<00:03:35.820> them<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.090> little<00:03:36.210> bit<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.450> chance<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:37.080> dry

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
gives them a little bit of chance to dry

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.000 
gives them a little bit of chance to dry
in<00:03:37.620> between<00:03:39.050> mine<00:03:40.050> are<00:03:40.230> not<00:03:40.260> giving<00:03:40.800> many

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
in between mine are not giving many

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.000 
in between mine are not giving many
problems<00:03:41.580> so<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:41.880> can<00:03:42.300> continue<00:03:42.770> but<00:03:43.770> keep<00:03:43.980> that

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
problems so I can continue but keep that

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.830 
problems so I can continue but keep that
in<00:03:44.220> mind<00:03:44.550> in<00:03:44.670> case<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:45.030> do<00:03:45.180> have<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:45.390> sticking

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
in mind in case you do have a sticking

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:53.199 
in mind in case you do have a sticking
problem<00:03:48.110> okay<00:03:49.110> now<00:03:49.380> there's<00:03:49.590> our<00:03:49.830> last<00:03:50.220> petal

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.400 

and<00:03:55.640> we're<00:03:56.640> now<00:03:56.820> going<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.390> make<00:03:57.630> our<00:03:57.930> center

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
and we're now going to make our center

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.650 
and we're now going to make our center
now<00:03:58.920> we're<00:03:59.160> ready<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.430> make<00:03:59.670> our<00:03:59.820> Daisy<00:04:00.060> Center

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
now we're ready to make our Daisy Center

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.340

I have this egg yellow gum paste and it

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.050 
I have this egg yellow gum paste and it
doesn't<00:04:04.740> take<00:04:04.950> a<00:04:04.980> lot<00:04:05.220> just<00:04:05.820> a<00:04:06.270> small<00:04:06.750> amount

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
doesn't take a lot just a small amount

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.240 
doesn't take a lot just a small amount

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
directly on a cake it'll probably be dry

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:16.350 
directly on a cake it'll probably be dry
within<00:05:10.689> 30<00:05:11.080> minutes<00:05:11.349> or<00:05:11.650> so<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:13.650> if<00:05:14.650> you<00:05:15.360> want

and just on the outside of the center we

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.730 
and just on the outside of the center we
want<00:05:34.419> to<00:05:34.830> just<00:05:35.830> lightly<00:05:36.490> dust<00:05:36.759> a<00:05:37.589> little<00:05:38.589> bit

and when we're through we'll blend it
out<00:05:48.980> just<00:05:49.430> a<00:05:49.640> bit<00:05:51.610> and<00:05:52.960> brush<00:05:53.960> outward<00:05:54.530> ever<00:05:54.920> so

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
because this is the last part that

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
darker they're green and then as they

darker they're green and then as they
open<00:06:35.120> up<00:06:35.330> then<00:06:35.660> they<00:06:35.810> turn<00:06:36.020> the<00:06:36.200> yellow<00:06:36.410> shade

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
open up then they turn the yellow shade

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.900
