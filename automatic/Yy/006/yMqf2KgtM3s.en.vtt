00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.370
 we are very aware of the road 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.590
 are marcel wiener and we are 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.460
 also aware of the power strikes

 put street lamps 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.780
 so we do not want to make fake 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.580
 promises 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.310
 on the other hand one thing is sure we 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.520
 take into account alternatives and its 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.869
 alternatives are going to have one thing that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 we are aware is that 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.100

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.680

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.000
 affinities will create this 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.570
 cohesion that will allow us to go 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.360
