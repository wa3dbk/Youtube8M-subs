that's<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:57.790> for<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.060> coding<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.659> we're<00:03:59.170> going

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
that's it for the coding and we're going

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.970 
that's it for the coding and we're going
to<00:04:00.510> be<00:04:01.510> editing<00:04:01.989> the<00:04:02.170> user<00:04:02.470> interface<00:04:02.890> file

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
crack two labels from here a text field

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:24.689 
crack two labels from here a text field
and<00:04:20.310> button<00:04:21.990> now<00:04:22.990> we<00:04:23.050> don't<00:04:23.380> want<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.740> be<00:04:23.889> we

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
and button now we don't want to be we

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.070 
and button now we don't want to be we
don't<00:04:24.729> know<00:04:25.000> what<00:04:25.120> this<00:04:25.300> label<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.780> contain

don't know what this label to contain

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.129 
don't know what this label to contain
any<00:04:26.350> code<00:04:27.250> any<00:04:27.400> text<00:04:27.940> because<00:04:28.600> we're<00:04:28.870> going<00:04:29.020> to

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
any code any text because we're going to

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.750 
any code any text because we're going to
set<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.530> text<00:04:29.740> inside<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.789> code<00:04:32.490> this<00:04:33.490> is<00:04:33.639> the

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
set the text inside the code this is the

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.580 
set the text inside the code this is the
light<00:04:33.910> blue<00:04:34.090> let's<00:04:34.240> test<00:04:34.870> that<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.289> going<00:04:35.470> to

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
light blue let's test that is going to

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.070 
light blue let's test that is going to
be<00:04:35.680> there<00:04:35.919> so<00:04:36.580> we<00:04:36.880> want<00:04:37.150> some<00:04:37.330> text<00:04:37.630> mr.<00:04:37.960> in

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
be there so we want some text mr. in

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.370 
be there so we want some text mr. in
here<00:04:38.410> and<00:04:39.250> we<00:04:39.970> want<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.479> button<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:40.990> store

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
here and we want the button to store

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.860 
here and we want the button to store
some<00:04:41.620> text<00:04:42.010> also<00:04:42.190> we<00:04:43.150> added<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.479> text<00:04:43.750> by

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
some text also we added the text by

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.089 
some text also we added the text by
double-clicking<00:04:44.289> on<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.970> object<00:04:46.349> now<00:04:47.349> we

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
double-clicking on the object now we

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.279 
double-clicking on the object now we
need<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.370> tell<00:04:48.610> Xcode<00:04:49.060> which<00:04:49.419> object<00:04:49.900> is<00:04:50.050> which

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
need to tell Xcode which object is which

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.060 
need to tell Xcode which object is which
so<00:04:51.010> we<00:04:51.520> select<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:52.030> files<00:04:52.479> on<00:04:52.810> your<00:04:52.960> icon<00:04:53.410> we

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
so we select the files on your icon we

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.740 
so we select the files on your icon we
press<00:04:54.340> command<00:04:54.820> to<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:58.240> connections

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
press command to and and the connections
