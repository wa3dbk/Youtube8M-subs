00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
thousand watts RMS and then yep I can't

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.809 
thousand watts RMS and then yep I can't
remember<00:03:29.340> right<00:03:29.459> now<00:03:29.670> but<00:03:29.819> I<00:03:29.849> think<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.120> makes

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
remember right now but I think it makes

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.819 
remember right now but I think it makes
650<00:03:32.819> or<00:03:33.180> somewhere<00:03:33.510> around<00:03:33.599> there<00:03:33.870> watts<00:03:34.620> of

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
650 or somewhere around there watts of

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.110 
650 or somewhere around there watts of
RMS<00:03:35.190> at<00:03:35.430> 2<00:03:35.790> ohms<00:03:35.970> and

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
RMS at 2 ohms and

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.339 
RMS at 2 ohms and
really<00:03:38.120> miniscule<00:03:38.540> amount<00:03:38.750> of<00:03:38.840> forums<00:03:39.200> so

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
really miniscule amount of forums so

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:40.900 
really miniscule amount of forums so
it's<00:03:39.500> definitely<00:03:39.830> designed<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:40.190> run<00:03:40.340> it<00:03:40.490> one

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
it's definitely designed to run it one

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.000 
it's definitely designed to run it one
own<00:03:41.470> but<00:03:42.470> overall<00:03:42.770> this<00:03:42.950> thing<00:03:43.010> looks<00:03:43.370> very

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
own but overall this thing looks very

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.500 
own but overall this thing looks very
steadily<00:03:46.010> built<00:03:46.370> looks<00:03:46.580> like<00:03:46.670> it's<00:03:46.819> got<00:03:47.300> a<00:03:47.330> lot

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
steadily built looks like it's got a lot

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.260 
steadily built looks like it's got a lot
of<00:03:48.640> ways<00:03:49.640> to<00:03:49.819> dissipate<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.330> heat<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:52.270> we'll

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
of ways to dissipate the heat and we'll

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.790 
of ways to dissipate the heat and we'll
hook<00:03:53.360> it<00:03:53.540> up<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:53.870> then<00:03:53.959> I'll<00:03:54.080> also<00:03:54.110> hook<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.680> up

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
hook it up and then I'll also hook it up

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.600 
hook it up and then I'll also hook it up
to<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:56.600> high<00:03:56.720> Phonics<00:03:57.110> 12s<00:03:57.530> later<00:03:57.770> which<00:03:58.520> I

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
to the high Phonics 12s later which I

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.949 
to the high Phonics 12s later which I
got<00:03:58.730> a<00:03:58.760> wire<00:03:58.970> down<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.300> one<00:03:59.420> ohm<00:03:59.569> and<00:03:59.690> put<00:03:59.810> in<00:03:59.900> my

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
got a wire down to one ohm and put in my

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.100 
got a wire down to one ohm and put in my
box<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.470> then<00:04:00.560> I'll<00:04:00.680> give<00:04:00.800> you<00:04:00.830> a<00:04:01.750> demo<00:04:02.750> on<00:04:02.870> my

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
box and then I'll give you a demo on my

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.009 
box and then I'll give you a demo on my
system<00:04:03.440> so<00:04:03.650> thanks<00:04:04.250> for<00:04:04.340> watching

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.360 

so<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.049> forgot<00:04:08.439> to<00:04:08.530> mention<00:04:08.650> it<00:04:08.920> comes<00:04:09.129> with<00:04:09.340> a

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
so I forgot to mention it comes with a

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.099 
so I forgot to mention it comes with a
audio<00:04:10.209> pipe<00:04:10.450> inline<00:04:10.840> fuse<00:04:11.730> it's<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:13.060> 80<00:04:13.629> amp<00:04:13.930> I

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
audio pipe inline fuse it's a 80 amp I

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.179 
audio pipe inline fuse it's a 80 amp I
don't<00:04:14.230> know<00:04:14.319> if<00:04:14.379> you<00:04:14.469> can<00:04:14.560> see<00:04:14.799> that<00:04:14.950> in<00:04:15.069> there

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:15.189 
don't know if you can see that in there

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
don't know if you can see that in there
it's<00:04:15.400> 80<00:04:15.639> amps<00:04:15.969> fuse<00:04:17.370> that<00:04:18.370> you<00:04:18.549> wired<00:04:18.820> into

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
it's 80 amps fuse that you wired into

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.759 
it's 80 amps fuse that you wired into
and<00:04:19.449> then<00:04:19.570> it<00:04:19.660> also<00:04:19.780> comes<00:04:20.139> with<00:04:20.259> a<00:04:20.470> remote

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
and then it also comes with a remote

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:32.360 
and then it also comes with a remote
base<00:04:21.039> enough<00:04:27.000> obviously<00:04:28.000> plugs<00:04:28.419> into<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.810> new

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.890 

this<00:04:33.370> which<00:04:33.820> is<00:04:33.970> quite<00:04:34.210> unusual<00:04:34.360> normally

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
this which is quite unusual normally

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.839 
this which is quite unusual normally
they're<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.080> little<00:04:35.470> like<00:04:35.680> foam<00:04:36.250> wire<00:04:36.460> looking

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
they're a little like foam wire looking

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.010 
they're a little like foam wire looking
things<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.960> this<00:04:38.169> is<00:04:38.229> the<00:04:38.500> actual<00:04:39.539> audio<00:04:40.539> pipe

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
things and this is the actual audio pipe

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.699 
things and this is the actual audio pipe
bass<00:04:41.430> with<00:04:42.430> cool
