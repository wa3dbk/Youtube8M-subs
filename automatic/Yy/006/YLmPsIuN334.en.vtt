00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:04.180
 so what does this look like 21st century stage 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.510
 this is a stage where we can see the example ground here from the seat on 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.629
 further 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:12.299
 at the end of a bend 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.299
 it may seem trivial but everyone who knew bollÃ©e will understand 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:21.969
 the view is obviously even better from the boxes with an option 

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:24.650
 on the 24-hour circuit 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.589
 the same arena against 1 5064 place 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.320
 an ability that according to them the most adapted to the public Sarthe must be 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.310
 make choices to the size of the population you represent 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.450
 and I would say that today surprise the output 550 thousand inhabitants if we 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.760
 takes the most departures the catchment area within 100 kilometers 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.140
 and a half concerned halftime and then I consider that the emissions of 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.040
 the balanced I prefer to have a stadium with a capacity of 25000 seats 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.620
 but that is too often fulfilled rather than having a stage 32 48 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.900
 places they are motivated 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.100
 then these are pretty amazing scenes including 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.780
 the dressing rooms of the players 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.620
 true troicki hope it 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.950
 we will not want to go beyond them because everything has been thought out for them 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.610
 and in particular the lawn real gem produced in this station of yerres 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.160
 from the Orleans region no detail was disguised 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.090
 it is necessary that one can roll percent of sufficiently been fast enough 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.000
 far enough 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.960
 I take limited time slightly since the player needs to anticipate 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.270
 its run this case sales in north america no structured repository 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.320
 you have to qualify against the property for the turnaround time 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.109
 the 21st century stage is also security 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.239
 with this video surveillance and a hundred cameras 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.860
 able to zoom in on each viewer 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.950
 and then - of restoration we call that kiosks 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.580
 and it does not have much to do with leon's fried huts 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:01:58.789
