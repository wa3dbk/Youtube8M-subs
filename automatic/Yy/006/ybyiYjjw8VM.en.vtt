00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
now the highest level vehicle Toyota

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.630 
now the highest level vehicle Toyota
makes<00:00:25.449> the<00:00:25.660> Lexus<00:00:26.020> LFA<00:00:26.590> is<00:00:26.980> made<00:00:27.430> of<00:00:27.550> this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
makes the Lexus LFA is made of this

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.150 
makes the Lexus LFA is made of this
material<00:00:28.150> here<00:00:28.330> at<00:00:28.449> carbon-fiber<00:00:29.110> which<00:00:29.920> is

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
material here at carbon-fiber which is

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.390 
material here at carbon-fiber which is
well<00:00:30.880> this<00:00:31.029> is<00:00:31.150> what<00:00:31.300> it's<00:00:31.450> like<00:00:31.630> in<00:00:32.400> strands

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
well this is what it's like in strands

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.549 
well this is what it's like in strands
and<00:00:33.580> each<00:00:33.730> one<00:00:33.940> of<00:00:34.030> these<00:00:34.120> strands<00:00:34.559> 24,000

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
and each one of these strands 24,000

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.560 
and each one of these strands 24,000
strands<00:00:35.950> now<00:00:36.850> something<00:00:37.180> you<00:00:37.239> might<00:00:37.329> not<00:00:37.510> know

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
strands now something you might not know

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.840 
strands now something you might not know
is<00:00:37.960> that<00:00:38.230> Toyota<00:00:38.559> started<00:00:38.949> out<00:00:39.040> in<00:00:39.160> the<00:00:39.220> 1800s

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
is that Toyota started out in the 1800s

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.570 
is that Toyota started out in the 1800s
as<00:00:39.970> a<00:00:40.030> textile<00:00:40.690> manufacturer<00:00:41.470> so<00:00:41.920> weaving<00:00:42.430> is

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
as a textile manufacturer so weaving is

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.580 
as a textile manufacturer so weaving is
really<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:42.970> basis<00:00:43.300> of<00:00:43.390> what<00:00:43.570> they<00:00:43.720> do<00:00:43.780> which

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
really the basis of what they do which

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.650 
really the basis of what they do which
is<00:00:44.800> what<00:00:44.980> you<00:00:45.100> do<00:00:45.220> with<00:00:45.370> carbon<00:00:45.730> fiber<00:00:46.000> which

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
is what you do with carbon fiber which

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.860 
is what you do with carbon fiber which
becomes<00:00:47.080> that<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:48.070> basic<00:00:48.489> tub<00:00:48.760> of<00:00:49.239> a<00:00:49.449> Lexus

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
becomes that the basic tub of a Lexus

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.680 
becomes that the basic tub of a Lexus
LFA<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.710> it<00:00:51.160> weighs<00:00:51.430> less<00:00:51.879> than<00:00:52.180> 20<00:00:52.480> kilograms

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
LFA and it weighs less than 20 kilograms

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.410 
LFA and it weighs less than 20 kilograms
and<00:00:53.290> is<00:00:53.379> stronger<00:00:53.680> than<00:00:53.920> steel<00:00:54.220> let's<00:00:55.210> follow

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
and is stronger than steel let's follow

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:07.640 
and is stronger than steel let's follow
along<00:00:55.570> and<00:00:56.020> see<00:00:56.170> how<00:00:56.289> the<00:00:56.350> whole<00:00:56.559> car<00:00:56.829> is<00:00:56.860> built
