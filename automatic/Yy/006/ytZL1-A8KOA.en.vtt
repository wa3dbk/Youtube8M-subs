00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:20.630
 selected with great care 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.439
 according to players are part of the list of sources 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.470
 who will personally test city cleaner and more respectful 

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:31.640
 of the environment the actress 3 a hybrid model electricity and gasoline 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.640
 offered by toyota 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.059
 where the constructor does not come out almost 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.210
 however the options in order to strasbourg 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.890
 and we made an essential axis written black as part of the project namely 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.700
 and percent so suddenly I was very curious to try to see how 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.470
 it happens 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.940
 and for that this society is partypoker the lot so by chance of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.060
 to win 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.070
 and suddenly I'm here today 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.100
 the director by checking petrol car 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.740
 winner it's true that it really is not surprising at all 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.330
 I could not be very interested we are here to save money 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.960
 fuel because 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.100
 thanks to his turn on the fuel to his savings plan but it's better 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.290
 and then in terms of percentage of respect for the environment in the sense 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.680
 then a touch 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.400
 moreover michel must do more by driving the car every day not 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.360
 less than five employees who believed in me 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.520
 beyond these financial aspects for simon earned when the fuel 5% 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.770
 always more expensive 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.770
 go to the break everything falls back so we're a little 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.840
 Saturday that could interest me 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.950
 ap 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.060
 twenty-four short distance the vehicle rolls through 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.060
 electricity supplied by the battery 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.460
 press the 100 km-hour thermal motorization takes over 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.960
 yet the city's policy it aims rather the decongestion of 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.390
 motorized vehicles in the center for the benefit of the tramway 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.490
 walking bike we still see carsharing 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.310
 public transit can meet a certain type of 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.740
 applicants in particular 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.670
 gold in the city center serves areas of dense areas but it does not allow 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.990
 to meet all the needs of displacement so it is absolutely not 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.339
 contradictory with 8 1% 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.959
 the different the different modes the things just a new life 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.119
 to preserve a balance the different modes we have to go 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.669
 gradually two hours and individual vehicles that is more 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:23.719
 clean and more efficient 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:27.579
 the solutions of electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:28.869
 rechargeable 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:33.529
 that of its creator the fact that studying them reduce the impact 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.149
 environmental individual vehicles for
