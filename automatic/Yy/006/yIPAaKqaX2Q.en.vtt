course your cooling fan and your power
supply<00:02:06.469> let's<00:02:07.469> take<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> look<00:02:07.860> inside<00:02:08.039> see<00:02:08.459> what

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
supply let's take a look inside see what

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.199 
supply let's take a look inside see what
we<00:02:08.729> have

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
we have

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.059 
we have
this<00:02:09.539> machine<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.050> super<00:02:10.410> compact<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.979> you

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
this machine is super compact and you

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.240 
this machine is super compact and you
can<00:02:11.220> even<00:02:11.430> see<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.849> the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
can even see it in the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.670 
can even see it in the
inside<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.390> computer<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.260> have<00:02:14.470> your

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
inside the computer you have your

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.500 
inside the computer you have your
optical<00:02:15.130> drive<00:02:15.190> here<00:02:15.670> standing<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.330> right

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
optical drive here standing and right

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.060 
optical drive here standing and right
behind<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:17.050> is<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.380> hard<00:02:17.620> drive<00:02:17.800> so<00:02:17.920> you

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
behind it is the hard drive so you

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.220 
behind it is the hard drive so you
really<00:02:18.310> don't<00:02:18.460> have<00:02:18.580> much<00:02:18.880> more<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.660> add<00:02:19.810> on<00:02:19.840> as

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
really don't have much more to add on as

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.420 
really don't have much more to add on as
far<00:02:20.350> as<00:02:20.410> hard<00:02:20.650> drive<00:02:20.830> space<00:02:20.980> but<00:02:21.160> why<00:02:21.250> would

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
far as hard drive space but why would

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.940 
far as hard drive space but why would
you<00:02:21.550> want<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.910> have<00:02:21.940> 320<00:02:22.780> gigs<00:02:23.050> of<00:02:23.320> SATA<00:02:23.710> to

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
you want to you have 320 gigs of SATA to

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.030 
you want to you have 320 gigs of SATA to
hard<00:02:24.520> drive<00:02:24.760> space<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.270> also<00:02:25.420> have<00:02:25.780> your<00:02:26.320> ddr2

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
hard drive space you also have your ddr2

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.740 
hard drive space you also have your ddr2
memory<00:02:27.250> which<00:02:27.700> are<00:02:27.820> both<00:02:27.970> taken<00:02:28.360> up<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:28.630> that

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
memory which are both taken up so that

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.449 
memory which are both taken up so that
you<00:02:28.840> have<00:02:28.959> three<00:02:29.230> gigs<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.620> ram<00:02:29.800> in<00:02:30.070> this

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
you have three gigs of ram in this

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.220 
you have three gigs of ram in this
machine<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.120> then<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.600> course<00:02:31.630> your<00:02:32.020> heat

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
machine and then of course your heat

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.830 
machine and then of course your heat
sink<00:02:32.560> fan<00:02:32.770> it's<00:02:33.070> all<00:02:33.250> very<00:02:33.670> very<00:02:33.970> compact<00:02:34.540> this

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
sink fan it's all very very compact this

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.140 
sink fan it's all very very compact this
fan<00:02:35.050> is<00:02:35.080> actually<00:02:35.530> quite<00:02:35.770> big<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:36.610> do<00:02:36.970> get

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
fan is actually quite big so you do get

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.660 
fan is actually quite big so you do get
a<00:02:37.180> very<00:02:37.620> efficient<00:02:38.620> cooling<00:02:38.830> system<00:02:39.340> in<00:02:39.490> such

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
a very efficient cooling system in such

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.000 
a very efficient cooling system in such
a<00:02:39.700> compact<00:02:40.180> design<00:02:40.480> then<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.290> course<00:02:41.500> up<00:02:41.680> here

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
a compact design then of course up here

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.770 
a compact design then of course up here
you<00:02:42.400> have<00:02:42.430> your<00:02:42.610> expansion<00:02:43.360> slot<00:02:43.600> if<00:02:43.720> you

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
you have your expansion slot if you

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.750 
you have your expansion slot if you
wanted<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.170> add<00:02:44.290> another<00:02:44.320> little<00:02:44.800> mini<00:02:45.100> card

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
wanted to add another little mini card

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.210 
wanted to add another little mini card
to<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.390> machine<00:02:46.810> other<00:02:47.590> than<00:02:47.620> that<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.070> have

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
to the machine other than that you have

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.190 
to the machine other than that you have
your<00:02:48.370> power<00:02:48.520> supply<00:02:48.970> unit<00:02:49.360> down<00:02:49.600> here<00:02:49.630> and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
your power supply unit down here and

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.900 
your power supply unit down here and
with<00:02:50.380> this<00:02:50.560> one<00:02:50.800> central<00:02:51.250> fan<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.640> actually

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
with this one central fan it actually

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.290 
with this one central fan it actually
keeps<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.270> all<00:02:52.390> cool<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.900> then<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.350> course<00:02:53.380> the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
keeps it all cool and then of course the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.560 
keeps it all cool and then of course the
CPU<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.510> PSU<00:02:56.020> air<00:02:56.380> holes<00:02:56.739> on<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.160> side<00:02:57.570> one

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
CPU and PSU air holes on the side one

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.880 
CPU and PSU air holes on the side one
more<00:02:58.600> thing<00:02:59.050> I<00:02:59.140> wanted<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.410> show<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.620> before

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
more thing I wanted to show you before

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.090 
more thing I wanted to show you before
we're<00:03:00.640> done<00:03:00.910> is<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.420> PCI<00:03:01.900> slot<00:03:02.500> up<00:03:02.680> here<00:03:02.920> so

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
we're done is the PCI slot up here so

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.030 
we're done is the PCI slot up here so
you<00:03:03.160> do<00:03:03.400> have<00:03:03.430> PCI<00:03:04.390> slot<00:03:04.840> capabilities<00:03:05.680> for

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
you do have PCI slot capabilities for

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.620 
you do have PCI slot capabilities for
your<00:03:06.160> graphics<00:03:06.370> card<00:03:06.910> although<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.209> would<00:03:07.510> be

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
your graphics card although I would be

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.420 
your graphics card although I would be
careful<00:03:08.080> what<00:03:08.590> kind<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.800> graphics<00:03:08.860> card<00:03:09.340> you

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
careful what kind of graphics card you

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.830 
careful what kind of graphics card you
get<00:03:09.580> with<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:09.850> because<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.239> is<00:03:10.330> a<00:03:10.360> compact

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
get with this because it is a compact

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.320
