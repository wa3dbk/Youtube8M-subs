00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
day and and the Sun is intense and I

spot<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> center<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:02.039> back<00:01:02.309> would

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
spot in the center of my back would

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.940 
spot in the center of my back would
start<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.739> burn<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> niche<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.810> I<00:01:06.810> knew<00:01:07.740> that

start to to burn a niche and I knew that
something<00:01:08.220> was<00:01:08.460> wrong<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.909> didn't<00:01:09.270> I

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
something was wrong but I didn't I

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.320 
something was wrong but I didn't I
didn't<00:01:10.799> they<00:01:10.860> didn't<00:01:11.430> think<00:01:11.610> skin<00:01:11.880> cancer<00:01:12.180> was

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
didn't they didn't think skin cancer was

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
didn't they didn't think skin cancer was
a<00:01:12.360> big<00:01:12.600> deal<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.110> knew<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.500> thought<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.280> was

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
a big deal so I knew I thought I was

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.340 
a big deal so I knew I thought I was
just<00:01:14.670> prolonging<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.689> getting<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.140> spot

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
just prolonging just getting this spot

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.350 
just prolonging just getting this spot
taking<00:01:16.740> off<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.130> don't<00:01:17.310> ever<00:01:17.729> remember<00:01:17.970> seeing

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
taking off I don't ever remember seeing

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.280 
taking off I don't ever remember seeing
stories<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.890> people<00:01:20.280> losing<00:01:20.520> their<00:01:20.640> life

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
stories about people losing their life

to<00:01:22.290> skin<00:01:22.619> cancer<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.450> think<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.750> happens

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
to skin cancer and I think that happens

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.630 
to skin cancer and I think that happens
to<00:01:25.350> us<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.590> lot<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.890> times<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.310> don't<00:01:26.430> pay

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
to us a lot of times we don't pay

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.670
