the job that I love teaching these
students<00:02:00.900> about<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> subject<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.950> love

my<00:02:09.300> experience<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.080> not<00:02:10.259> science<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
my experience you have not science for a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.800 
my experience you have not science for a
long<00:02:11.100> time<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.640> perhaps<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.330> best<00:02:12.510> if<00:02:12.690> you

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
long time so perhaps it is best if you

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.300 
long time so perhaps it is best if you
switch<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.080> something<00:02:13.380> else<00:02:13.590> perhaps<00:02:14.160> a

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
switch to something else perhaps a

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.410 
switch to something else perhaps a
female<00:02:14.640> pursuit<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:16.670> could<00:02:17.670> never<00:02:17.820> not<00:02:18.120> love

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
female pursuit I could never not love

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.610 
female pursuit I could never not love
science<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:20.340> such<00:02:20.640> as<00:02:20.760> true<00:02:20.970> sir<00:02:21.620> science

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
science that such as true sir science

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.030 
science that such as true sir science
will<00:02:22.830> always<00:02:23.280> be<00:02:23.489> my<00:02:23.670> mr.<00:02:23.940> essence<00:02:25.040> so

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
will always be my mr. essence so

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.190 
will always be my mr. essence so
something<00:02:26.400> wonderful<00:02:26.910> about<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.330> it's<00:02:27.900> always

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
something wonderful about it it's always

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.720 
something wonderful about it it's always

right you can always sense is a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.570 
right you can always sense is a
