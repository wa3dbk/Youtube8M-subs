00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.680
 Welcome or welcome to this new 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.870
 video tutorial today we will learn how 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.850
 download and update all drivers 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.350
 from our computer for this 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.490
 we will use a program that is in 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.890
 totally free 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.869
 I also bring you a series of keys 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.539
 to be able to have this same program 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.530
 but investment to a professional let's see 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.530
 what is it about 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.690
 and I beat driver booster in pro 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.070
 keeping updated the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.930
 controllers guarantees the correct 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.330
 operation of the components of 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.340
 our computer as well as getting the 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.400
 best possible performance a driver 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.020
 booster greatly facilitates this task 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.970
 this program is responsible for analyzing 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.280
 all pc components and the 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.830
 installed drivers if one of those 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.010
 The booster driver is obsolete 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.940
 it gives us the option to update it 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.710
 automatically search files 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.170
 necessary and starts the process of 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.000
 installation also includes an option 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.940
 that allows you to create restore points 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.560
 before installing the drivers this 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.930
 option is very useful to leave again 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.729
 our pc as it was before a 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.570
 installation in case the new ones 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.220
 drivers do not work correctly 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.910
 let's start then with the first step of 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.910
 this video tutorial 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.120
 below this video in the description 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.740
 from the same you will find this link a 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.110
 Once everything is click on this link and you 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.150
 you go to a page like this from mediafire 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.500
 to which I have uploaded the program on 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.570
 name of the file is download and 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.180
 driver update and the weight so 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.650
 only 20 points is 28 megabytes for 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.450
 download it we're just going to click 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.400
 in this green box where it says 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.720
 downloads once the 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.369
 download as in my case in the 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.410
 desktop will be a file 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.850
 winrar like this one to unzip it 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.320
 we will simply select it with 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.820
 clean left now let's click 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.820
 right about him and we're going to give him 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.530
 extract here once already we are 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.330
 unzip this folder we pass 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.989
 then now with the second step of 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.989
 this video tutorial 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.200
 once we proceed to open the folder 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.180
 within the let's find a series 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.250
 of links between them the setup of 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.590
 program and a notebook where 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.180
 will come what are the cereals for 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.160
 can activate the program in version 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.690
 professional so let's start doing 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.910
 click on the installer which is 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.650
 llama driver brush ted se cap we're going to 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.490
 double click on it and we'll start 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.680
 with the installation 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.240
 well this first one unfolds 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.030
 window in which we are going to click on 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.990
 next let's click here where 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.880
 says accept 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.680
 in this option that appears to us we are going to 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.380
 click on this second option here 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.390
 and we're going to uncheck all these options 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.490
 since these are pure bars to be 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.010
 to install in our browser that in 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.870
 My opinion, they are not very recommendable 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.860
 so let's remove these options and 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.020
 let's click on install 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.910
 in the option that appears now in 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.190
 this time we are going to leave the route by 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.350
 defect let's click on next and 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.280
 let's create a desktop icon and 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.280
 we are going to click on next 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.440
 once the installation has been completed 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.510
 let's remove these options from here and 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.510
 let's click on finalize 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.290
 for its moment it is now what would be the 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.120
 third step to activate the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.120
 program in a professional version 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.760
 we are going to now execute the 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.710
 program we are going to double-click on 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.110
 the icon that appears in the 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.750
 desk and once we booted him 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.550
 will start scanning in this case has already 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.860
 scanned what are my drivers 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.680
 computer and it tells me that at this moment 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.990
 I have five obsolete drivers in 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.600
 what it tells me is that in the state it is 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.220
 that are quite old and if we 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.050
 we want to repair that simply or 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.150
 simply more electric that tells us 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.220
 update the whole interface is very 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.780
 simple but then let's put it 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.130
 this same program that is totally 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.170
 thanks to them is not working 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.190
 correctly but let's put it 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.900
 then in what is the version 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.640
 professional for that we are going to direct 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.460
 to this carrie option where it says free 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.930
 and then in this option that appears 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.810
 let's go here that tells us to enter 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.220
 license and we will choose any of 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.780
 licenses that I have left in the notebook 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.030
 of notes that we previously had 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.360
 downloaded in this case choose in the 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.150
 first let's copy it and we're going to 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.360
 paste here and let's give it that tells us 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.610
 activate now 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.099
 ok now they tell me that congratulations 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.919
 the license has been activated successfully and 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:50.439
 let's click on accept if we can 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.870
 appreciate at the top is going to say 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:55.210
 booster driver 1.3 version 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.360
 professional let's go now the 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.909
 part of here where it says more adjustments and 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.430
 we're going to go where it says about and 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:06.639
 it appears that the version 1.3 points 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.229
 0.2 172 that in this case is the version 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.990
 most recent that came out 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.599
 approximately three days ok then 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.860
 this program will allow us 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.120
 download and update all drivers 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.800
 that we have in our 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.629
 computer here in this case 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.150
 simply the only thing he will do is 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:23.319
 update everything very good thing that has 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.050
 is the program is that he automatically 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:27.520
 is a restoration point this if 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.409
 in some problem if at some point 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.879
 let's say some of the drivers that 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.020
 we unload 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.270
 generates conflict with the system 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.039
 operative we can restore it to a 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.680
 point where our computer was 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:40.240
 working totally fine then the 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.039
 Free version the program works 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.449
 correctly in this case we already have what 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.360
 that the professional version that is a 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.050
 more advanced version will allow us 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.539
 download the drivers 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.819
 fast official sites have 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.259
 a number of improvements and in this case 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.479
 you can invent in olesa you are the 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:56.680
 most recent version as always if 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.509
