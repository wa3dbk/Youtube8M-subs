00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.900
 today is aqua net tv on the northern 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.180
 border of brazil on the way to armor 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.449
 to take wild without a suitable 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:18.190
 boat and local knowledge leader would be so 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:20.390
 something in general in many areas 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.330
 the streets of amazon go down 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.810
 inevitably in waterways after all 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.589
 First, you have to know where you want to go 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.960
 local map material is essential 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:36.460
 first there is still a street and 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.460
 Signs indicate the direction 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.900
 with offers on the trailers we rumble 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.900
 by the counter rain forest river 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.670
 feeling it goes into the wet element and 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.780
 after loading the equipment it starts 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.780
 to the first goal 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:36.820
 This small sandy beach is the access 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:38.920
 get off at our first campsite 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.220
 and unloading the boats is now 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.220
 hip, trendy, popular 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.140
 Hammocks are the sleeping places for 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.820
 the next nights careful knots 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.170
 you do not want to be at night 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.600
 unexpectedly land on the ground 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.600
 Test sitting shows the knot hold 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.869
 we have not seen any fish yet but 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.000
 this pretty butterfly and this one 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.720
 mighty turtle are not 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.420
 take it and greet it properly 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.580
 Fish are not everything and they are not 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.930
 interested in natural history 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.930
 Here always at his expense 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.690
 Early the next morning we go to 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.760
 our first trip nets bags and 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.760
 cameras in the boat and off you go 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.920
 the first stop is a lagoon with 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.049
 sandy bottom and our leipziger 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.980
 Friends try their hand at ten 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:51.049
 meter trawl here in the moderate 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.409
 flow you can see the first tank 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:57.500
 It would already be through the water surface 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.390
 this one seems to be a corridor assam from 1 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.180
 to be 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.670
 Anyway, it's a long mustache 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:11.180
 here, too, a long mustache is not quite 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:13.519
 clearly who we are looking at 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:20.209
 Look at what the guys from Leipzig are 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:22.099
 with their net have captured there are 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.769
 the first panzer welse in the photo 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.799
 This chain is unique 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.739
 around corridors but base easy too 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.629
 recognize the long snout and the 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.510
 triangular black flank stain 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.389
 begins the evening the sort large in 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.099
 Stock bags cans and even one 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.840
 Children's wading pools need this 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.900
 serve 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.230
 second day trip in the middle of this 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.980
 huge boulders we have one 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.669
 promising job 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.980
 and are somewhat baffled about 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:57.409
 coarse gravel partly sharp-edged 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:03.230
 we discover every amount of corridor ass e 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:04.069
 news these are different from those 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.310
 from 1 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.859
 by a short snout length here in the 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.609
 shore area they grÃ¼ndeln undaunted 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.609
 between the scree 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.240
 a little further over a gritty one 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.510
 sandy section of corridor euro kansas 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.450
 another short schnauzer the most in 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.230
 Large groups on the go is pile of foliage 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.420
 have him particularly pleased 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.490
 here where the flow makes the foliage too big 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:49.780
 Apparently carrying heaps together comes 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:51.700
 also a lot of edible by the small ones 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.180
 collectors keep us in the picture 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:59.340
 Swim are astanas leopoldi the in 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.340
 strong currents at home are the 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.410
 First offspring of this beautiful 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.390
 armor versus already arrive in 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.050
 untreated Leipzig piped water 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.760
 eichenlaub with due respect of the circulation 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.250
 the first eggs were probably unnoticed 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.950
 stuck between the leaves 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.810
 and the boys were to be seen first 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.730
 the foliage heap with almost 2 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.730
 centimeters in size 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:31.510
 after sand gravel and gravel another 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:37.300
 unseen grown underground 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:39.340
 rock in front of us tried a hundred 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.520
 animals comprehensive group tear-off 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.090
 take and then remember one thing 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.430
 better 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.550
 They go about their main occupation 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.260
 and start after meal also muddy 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.560
 sections become foraging 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:57.390
 visited armor catfish appear on 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.390
 to be at home at all backgrounds 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.800
 after heimreise to Leipzig 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.050
 be careful now 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.540
 assorted different corridor types 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.540
 and divided between the friends 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.550
 logically wants from such a journey 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.390
 everyone also has a small cross-section 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.060
 take home 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.870
 The packaging is done individually in small 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.180
 bag 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.000
 this will prevent an individual 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:31.330
 possibly sick fish his colleagues 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.490
 infect could box in styrofoam 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.860
 neatly glued and packed in 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.970
 solid suitcases protected it goes on the 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.970
 Homeward journey to Germany 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.730
 the melancholy of farewell is made by the 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.800
 joy superimposed tomorrow this awesome 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.610
 armored catfish in its own aquarium 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.610
 to have a swim 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.630
 Okay, okay guys to the next one 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.630
 times
