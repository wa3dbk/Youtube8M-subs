00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
well let's um let's move through to the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.570 
well let's um let's move through to the
the<00:02:37.090> bedroom<00:02:37.540> area<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.720> large<00:02:41.110> room

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
the bedroom area this is a large room

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.450 
the bedroom area this is a large room
where<00:02:42.870> possibly<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.020> first<00:02:44.200> time<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.980> erect

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
where possibly the first time you erect

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.460 
where possibly the first time you erect
it<00:02:45.670> would<00:02:45.880> take<00:02:46.150> around<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.870> 10<00:02:47.140> minute<00:02:47.440> mark

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
it would take around the 10 minute mark

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.170 
it would take around the 10 minute mark
and<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.370> reason<00:02:48.940> being<00:02:49.150> is

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
and the reason being is

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.080 
and the reason being is
that<00:02:50.299> each<00:02:50.689> of<00:02:50.750> these<00:02:51.290> holes<00:02:51.859> is<00:02:52.370> actually

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
that each of these holes is actually

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.729 
that each of these holes is actually
stitched<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:53.840> as<00:02:54.170> part<00:02:54.739> of<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.129> change<00:02:56.019> so<00:02:57.019> all

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
stitched in as part of the change so all

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.369 
stitched in as part of the change so all
