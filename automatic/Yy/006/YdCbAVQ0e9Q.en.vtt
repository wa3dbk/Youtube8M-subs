00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
basically which is a pretty good place

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.229 
basically which is a pretty good place
to<00:00:46.780> start<00:00:47.080> you<00:00:47.440> can<00:00:47.680> just<00:00:48.370> try<00:00:48.550> by<00:00:48.730> alternating

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
to start you can just try by alternating

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.540 
to start you can just try by alternating
your<00:00:49.570> thumb<00:00:49.840> on<00:00:50.020> the<00:00:50.770> sixth<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.309> fourth

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
your thumb on the sixth and the fourth

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.490 
your thumb on the sixth and the fourth
string<00:00:51.940> and<00:00:52.150> you<00:00:52.510> can<00:00:52.629> get<00:00:52.809> this<00:00:52.960> sound

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.600 

and<00:00:58.500> once<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.710> get<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.860> feel<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.430> you

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
and once you get a feel for that you

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.190 
and once you get a feel for that you
might<00:00:59.760> want<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> include<00:01:00.120> your<00:01:00.480> fingers<00:01:00.900> one

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
might want to include your fingers one

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.650 
might want to include your fingers one
two<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.680> three<00:01:02.150> alternating<00:01:03.150> with<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> thumb

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
two and three alternating with the thumb

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.960 
two and three alternating with the thumb
and<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.899> sounds<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.229> this

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.420 

and<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.600> do<00:01:10.720> that<00:01:10.840> real<00:01:11.050> slow<00:01:11.410> it<00:01:11.620> goes<00:01:11.830> thumb

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
and to do that real slow it goes thumb

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.350 
and to do that real slow it goes thumb
one<00:01:13.060> thumb<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:14.530> thumb<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:16.000> thumb<00:01:16.720> three<00:01:17.590> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
one thumb to thumb one thumb three and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.880 
one thumb to thumb one thumb three and
if<00:01:19.360> you<00:01:19.510> get<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.660> handle<00:01:19.990> for<00:01:20.050> that<00:01:20.350> it's<00:01:20.830> a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
if you get a handle for that it's a

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.860 
if you get a handle for that it's a
beautiful<00:01:21.280> field<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.670> play<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.120> you<00:01:22.600> can<00:01:22.720> do

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
beautiful field to play and you can do

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.230 
beautiful field to play and you can do
it<00:01:22.990> in<00:01:23.170> all<00:01:23.860> styles<00:01:24.100> of<00:01:24.370> music<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:24.790> all<00:01:24.910> sorts

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
it in all styles of music and all sorts

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.610 
it in all styles of music and all sorts
of<00:01:25.300> songs<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.900> can<00:01:26.020> sound<00:01:26.140> really<00:01:26.500> nice

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
of songs and it can sound really nice

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:39.870 
of songs and it can sound really nice
like<00:01:26.890> this

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.330 

Oh

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:53.200 

or<00:01:44.340> maybe<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.060> style

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:11.630 

or<00:01:54.210> perhaps

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.010 

so<00:02:12.640> obviously<00:02:13.000> you're<00:02:13.150> very<00:02:13.390> things<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.810> should

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
so obviously you're very things I should

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.350 
so obviously you're very things I should
go<00:02:14.140> but<00:02:14.170> that's<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.800> basic<00:02:15.330> principle<00:02:16.330> behind

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
go but that's the basic principle behind

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.060 
go but that's the basic principle behind
the<00:02:16.810> alternating<00:02:17.290> thumb<00:02:17.320> method<00:02:17.860> on<00:02:17.950> the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
the alternating thumb method on the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.620 
the alternating thumb method on the
acoustic<00:02:18.250> guitar<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:18.940> give<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.210> plenty<00:02:19.420> of

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
acoustic guitar so give it plenty of

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:42.910 
acoustic guitar so give it plenty of
practice<00:02:19.990> and<00:02:20.770> see<00:02:21.010> how<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.220> go

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.190 

so<00:02:43.920> there<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.130> go
