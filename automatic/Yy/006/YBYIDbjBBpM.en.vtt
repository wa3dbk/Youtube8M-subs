00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.290
 hdmi in a in a bundesliga in 3 5 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.000
 In a nutshell, it's saying his job 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.200
 basic then you have them 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.730
 statins games that are in the process of 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.710
 scroll down so I invite you to put on 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.309
 pause or put back for good 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.320
 observe them 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.450
 so what can we say about mikit 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.800
 to riom inform version so I 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.660
 did not like the regular version 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.340
 I tried I really did not 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.360
 hooked to the regular version and the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.920
 all saints still change are 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.180
 still change before the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.970
 cages he really is he is really 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.320
 better he at 1.90 in finish although I 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.610
 did not put in more because ben 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.780
 a bit like higuain here a little 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.060
 as iguana I found that the finish 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.590
 that I did not feel it more than that 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.049
 a lot of hitting next to or two 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.700
 parades of the guardian kind tf1 you him 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.380
 requests to strike right in in 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.119
 full on the side he hits right on 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.350
 the goalkeeper so the finish I have not 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.970
 put in the teeth most nor in 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.409
 the least he has 90 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.450
 definition so I had trouble with 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.130
 this side there so I the minibar and more 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.109
 born in the east less so at the level of 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.740
 negatives of the mit that you have nothing so 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.909
 the price is good but even if I know 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.560
 very well that its price will drop dollar 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.859
 continues to drop the macle cowardice 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.270
 90000 will be sold 80 miles so here is the 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.119
 prices continue to fall this weekend 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.439
 it will be even lower but yeah I 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.090
 found that I found it expensive 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.829
 as it was quite expensive 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.539
 even if it's good I decided to put 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.289
 the price still in the teeth the 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.240
 negative points 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.709
 after at kicking 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.329
 stopped so the costs france serves 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:46.920
 absolutely nothing to make him shoot 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.420
 because he has a bad grade I have 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.549
 does pull post bac anyway for 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.369
 illustrate a little bit but he's at age 57 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.079
 do not like I go to 1.6357 I know more 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.490
 but there are no notes in pressure shot 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.079
 Frank that it's useless to make him 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.520
 shoot against corners and shots 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.130
 very good but I 'll come back 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.659
 after and after at the jump level I 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.520
 help you here it's bad it's bad 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.930
 it is bad of the head it is useless 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.640
 goals of the head or so of 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.989
 recover head balloons as 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.610
 I explained yesterday for mod 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.620
 I like when guys can then 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.790
 finally can can when the guys 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.019
 can recover balloons from the head 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.400
 unfortunately here it was not the 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.110
 case then in the positive points 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.879
 because you have the corner as 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.200
 I said I put a free kick I even 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.060
 corner I did not put in the east anymore 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.470
 but the corners he is sure really 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.970
 very very well then after that's true 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.980
 that I still have two of the players 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.390
 very very good of the head in the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.459
 repair surfaces I think of my 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.959
 age or kitsch to felipe santana so 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.230
 it inevitably helps on kicks 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.970
 arrested 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.069
 finally on corners on everything but 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.510
 here I decided to put the corner 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.220
 so the corners and pulls pretty well 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.290
 his pass quality is really his 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.590
 big plus a very very good quality of 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.930
 past 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.569
 so j minecraft catalyst quality of 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.549
 so goes really very very good that 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.489
 this is the lobed passes the passes in 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.970
 depth the passes pse 6th it's happening 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.340
 pretty good 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.900
 and after all that is long hot 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.970
 hitting power the ball goes 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.400
 really very strong even if there is this side 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.819
 this precision side that leaves a little to 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.129
 to desire 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.569
 I found that it pushes to ask 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.760
 problem and I found that sometimes 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.079
 is not the balloon you say to yourself 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.389
 that he will be framed but not his part in 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.920
 side or so you are face to face with 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.850
 logan and build right on the guardian 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.680
 that's problematic 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.660
 after technically it's really a 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.040
 treat four-star technical gestures 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.680
 so that's what it sees here it's already a big 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.060
 more but he is really very very strong 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.769
 in dribble so big speed 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.760
 running dribbles and that's 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.790
 really they do it's really 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.109
 that you will have to see the last 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.790
 the last goal with the last clip 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.980
 it's a simple little what gives them 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.209
 pretty cool after the 2 go it has the 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.190
 two feet including four bad stars 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.930
 foot so that's it's necessarily very 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.980
 useful for an offensive midfielder 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.980
 who like that he can make passes 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.930
 of the two feet then we have what else 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.400
 we have 100 positioning so in 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.900
 terms of positioning it's often 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.630
 well placed he makes good calls 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.340
 finally he's very offensive years and that's 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.510
 a player who goes up and 20 kg and motivates to 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.040
 which is very much in the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.200
 surfaces and makes calls sometimes 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.580
 as an attacker who are really 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.900
 very useful and 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.250
 I really liked it 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.410
 liked the day always well placed 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.970
 always where it should be like I said his 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.530
 pass quality so he does not have a stat 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.110
 and normand game vision yet but 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.880
 he has a he has a very very good 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.950
 pass quality so sending it on 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.380
 last the last goal with the species of 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.359
 small skillen pretty friendly 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.609
 so that was the last goal with you 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.260
 so go see the idle and after we 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.880
 will see the record of noon late a form 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.010
 so I know maybe I did not pronounce well 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.690
 his name is true but it does not matter 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.850
 it's complicated to say so militaria 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.640
 so inform in the positive points gmi 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.170
 and makes flying vision of the game the speed 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.460
 I did not talk about it but in 80 in 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.710
 speed so for an attacking midfielder 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.000
 it's really very very good physical 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.560
 physically that's true too 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.960
 I should have told you about it directly 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.300
 he really holds very very very very very 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.160
 well on his legs and ponds more 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.630
 it's a plus he has a stat and there 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.120
 stats balanced enough in strength 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.250
 he has in 73 I believe in force and after in 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.650
 term his stats agility balance etc 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.700
 it is rather in and ben I was I was 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.540
 relatively surprised because I 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.180
 did not expect what they hold 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.560
 also as well against 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.240
 david luiz companies of felipe 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.610
 santana and so he is very good at 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.870
 his legs long shot positioning 4 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.640
 and at the wrong foot strike power 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.169
 4 stars technical gesture and so in 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.910
 the negatives I like icf so the 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.590
 selfs it represents the frankest the 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.940
 price soe head game 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.620
 so you see the record with eight 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.060
 matches 5 goals 8 assists so 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.620
 a record really really very very good 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.290
 for offensive desires and so I 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.150
 put the rating of 16 out of 20 because it 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.490
 is he's good he's good but I do not 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.350
 do not know I did not find them 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.850
 numerically he deserves no more than 16 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.770
 here I preferred a sneijder by 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.210
 example honestly since I tested 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.190
 schnyder a cif 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.410
 I have trouble with words it's in the 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.890
 game tomorrow it will be the dimitri review 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.970
 payet 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.590
 in a word it is I do it joined a 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.130
 word is so I hope he goes to me 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.630
 to lie 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.590
 so that was all for the 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.760
 mikit magazine back a shape 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.440
