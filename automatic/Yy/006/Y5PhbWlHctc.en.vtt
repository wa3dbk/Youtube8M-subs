00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
wasn't great either and we look at

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520 
wasn't great either and we look at
Hardware<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.390> design<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.110> thing<00:01:22.350> was

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
Hardware the design of this thing was

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.219 
Hardware the design of this thing was
actually<00:01:22.920> really<00:01:23.189> quite<00:01:23.460> nice<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.689> felt<00:01:25.049> good

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
actually really quite nice it felt good

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.410 
actually really quite nice it felt good
in<00:01:25.409> hand<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.979> had<00:01:26.220> nice<00:01:26.490> curves<00:01:26.939> around<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
corners around the edges it fitted

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.520 
corners around the edges it fitted
comfortably<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:30.299> your<00:01:30.329> palm<00:01:30.840> which<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.290> guess

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
comfortably in your palm which I guess

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.649 
comfortably in your palm which I guess
kind<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.950> fits<00:01:32.220> considering<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> name<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
kind of fits considering the name of the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.069 
kind of fits considering the name of the

the<00:02:04.530> corner<00:02:04.890> kind<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.219> sticking<00:02:05.490> out<00:02:05.759> and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
the corner kind of sticking out and

anybody who was interested at the time
this<00:02:50.730> has<00:02:51.090> tons<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.720> potential<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:53.580> it<00:02:53.820> did

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
this has tons of potential and it did

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.150 
this has tons of potential and it did
it's<00:02:54.450> just<00:02:54.750> sad<00:02:54.960> that<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.290> never<00:02:55.500> really<00:02:55.830> lived

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
it's just sad that it never really lived

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.220 
it's just sad that it never really lived
up<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.640> potential<00:02:57.030> when<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:57.690> opened<00:02:58.110> up

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
up to that potential when you opened up

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.260 
up to that potential when you opened up
the<00:02:58.440> apps<00:02:58.590> drawer<00:02:58.860> you'd<00:02:59.220> get<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.430> nice<00:02:59.730> list<00:03:00.090> of

apps and icons that look beautiful you'd

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.760 
apps and icons that look beautiful you'd
also<00:03:02.520> more<00:03:03.360> importantly<00:03:03.960> when<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.260> open<00:03:04.650> an

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
also more importantly when you open an

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
of the other key hardware features that

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.890 
of the other key hardware features that
I<00:04:20.760> actually<00:04:20.940> really<00:04:21.330> liked<00:04:21.660> was<00:04:21.870> the

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
I actually really liked was the

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.840 
I actually really liked was the
trackball<00:04:22.470> at<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.800> bottom<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.280> had<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.460> really

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
trackball at the bottom it had a really

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.940 
trackball at the bottom it had a really
neat<00:04:24.060> pulsing<00:04:24.660> notification<00:04:25.500> LED

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
neat pulsing notification LED

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.530 
neat pulsing notification LED
underneath<00:04:26.310> it<00:04:26.640> so<00:04:26.820> whenever<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.270> get<00:04:27.480> a

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
underneath it so whenever you get a

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.840 
underneath it so whenever you get a
notification<00:04:27.960> your<00:04:28.950> trackball<00:04:29.460> on<00:04:29.670> the

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
notification your trackball on the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.730 
notification your trackball on the
device<00:04:30.120> would<00:04:30.390> actually<00:04:30.780> start<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.200> pulse<00:04:31.410> and

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
device would actually start to pulse and

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.650 
device would actually start to pulse and
light<00:04:31.920> up<00:04:32.160> until<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:32.670> read<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.360> notification

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
light up until you read the notification

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.410 
light up until you read the notification
but<00:04:34.410> you<00:04:34.500> could<00:04:34.650> also<00:04:34.830> use<00:04:35.220> it<00:04:35.370> as<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.910> gesture

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
but you could also use it as a gesture

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.600 
but you could also use it as a gesture
interface<00:04:37.020> so<00:04:37.350> if<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.680> wanted<00:04:37.980> to<00:04:38.100> go<00:04:38.220> left

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
interface so if you wanted to go left

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.480 
interface so if you wanted to go left
back<00:04:39.030> or<00:04:39.300> forwards<00:04:39.990> or<00:04:40.110> up<00:04:40.290> or<00:04:40.530> down<00:04:40.770> you<00:04:41.280> can

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
back or forwards or up or down you can

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.640 
back or forwards or up or down you can
do<00:04:41.670> so<00:04:41.910> with<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.510> trackball<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.350> it<00:04:43.440> also

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
do so with the trackball and it also

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.580 
do so with the trackball and it also
clicks<00:04:44.130> to<00:04:44.790> select<00:04:45.270> but<00:04:45.690> it<00:04:45.750> was<00:04:45.840> also<00:04:45.990> flanked

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
clicks to select but it was also flanked

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.010 
clicks to select but it was also flanked
by<00:04:46.620> two<00:04:46.800> other<00:04:47.370> lights<00:04:47.760> which<00:04:48.090> tells<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:48.810> that

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
by two other lights which tells you that

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.880 
by two other lights which tells you that
it<00:04:49.260> picked<00:04:49.680> up<00:04:49.920> a<00:04:50.330> gesture<00:04:51.380> and<00:04:52.380> that<00:04:52.560> was<00:04:52.710> one

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
it picked up a gesture and that was one

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.830 
it picked up a gesture and that was one
of<00:04:52.920> the<00:04:53.100> great<00:04:53.340> things<00:04:53.640> about<00:04:53.820> webOS<00:04:54.480> as<00:04:54.660> well

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
of the great things about webOS as well

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.600 
of the great things about webOS as well
is<00:04:54.960> that<00:04:54.990> everything<00:04:55.650> was<00:04:55.800> really<00:04:56.010> gesture

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
is that everything was really gesture

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.700 
is that everything was really gesture

whole page you go up or down or tried to

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.810 
swipe then you would see some inevitable
checkerboarding<00:05:22.530> and<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.950> 3.2<00:05:23.580> megapixel

camera didn't have autofocus it was
fixed<00:05:26.760> focus<00:05:27.240> so<00:05:27.420> that<00:05:27.450> meant<00:05:27.900> that<00:05:28.020> you<00:05:28.230> could

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
fixed focus so that meant that you could

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.160 
fixed focus so that meant that you could
only<00:05:28.740> take<00:05:29.070> a<00:05:29.100> picture<00:05:29.580> and<00:05:29.730> most<00:05:30.180> likely<00:05:30.660> it

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
only take a picture and most likely it

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.650 
only take a picture and most likely it

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
would be out of focus what's more if you

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.750 
would be out of focus what's more if you
actually<00:05:33.810> use<00:05:34.200> the<00:05:34.380> YouTube<00:05:34.830> app<00:05:35.040> the<00:05:35.400> screen
