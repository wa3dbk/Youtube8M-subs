for 11 maybe moussa sow is back and he's

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.890 
for 11 maybe moussa sow is back and he's
back<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.790> Turkish<00:02:33.300> league<00:02:33.510> there's<00:02:33.840> a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
back in the Turkish league there's a

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.350 
back in the Turkish league there's a
question<00:02:34.080> mark<00:02:34.290> over<00:02:34.590> his<00:02:35.010> final<00:02:35.850> position

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
question mark over his final position

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.750 
question mark over his final position
but<00:02:37.080> I'm<00:02:37.170> pretty<00:02:37.440> sure<00:02:37.560> he<00:02:38.370> used<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.640> be<00:02:38.730> a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
but I'm pretty sure he used to be a

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.000 
but I'm pretty sure he used to be a
striker<00:02:39.150> but<00:02:39.540> i<00:02:39.570> think<00:02:39.960> this<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.560> time<00:02:40.830> and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
striker but i think this this time and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.380 
striker but i think this this time and
be<00:02:41.160> 4i<00:02:41.430> think<00:02:41.490> he's<00:02:41.760> going<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:41.970> be<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> left

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
be 4i think he's going to be a left

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.000 
be 4i think he's going to be a left
winger<00:02:42.720> that's<00:02:43.140> what<00:02:43.320> most<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.800> comments

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
winger that's what most of the comments

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.790 
winger that's what most of the comments
on<00:02:44.280> Foothill<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.700> stuff<00:02:45.060> say<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:46.380> it'll

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
on Foothill and stuff say and so it'll

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.340 
on Foothill and stuff say and so it'll
be<00:02:46.830> interesting<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.430> see<00:02:47.550> but<00:02:47.910> anyway<00:02:48.210> 83<00:02:49.080> pace

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
be interesting to see but anyway 83 pace

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.430

card<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.770> really<00:02:53.220> good<00:02:53.430> he's<00:02:53.910> also<00:02:54.090> got<00:02:54.450> sort

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.570 
card is really good he's also got sort
of<00:02:54.750> 75<00:02:55.260> physical<00:02:55.710> which<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:55.980> think<00:02:56.220> should<00:02:56.280> be

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
of 75 physical which I think should be

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.120 
of 75 physical which I think should be
pretty<00:02:57.360> decent<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.200> reckon<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.710> reckon<00:02:59.040> he's

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
pretty decent and I reckon I reckon he's

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.070 
pretty decent and I reckon I reckon he's
going<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.340> be<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.460> good<00:02:59.640> link<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.030> Emenike<00:03:00.600> so

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
going to be a good link to Emenike so

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.720 
going to be a good link to Emenike so
that<00:03:01.230> should<00:03:01.380> be<00:03:01.410> an<00:03:01.560> interesting<00:03:01.770> one<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:02.640> in

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
that should be an interesting one but in
