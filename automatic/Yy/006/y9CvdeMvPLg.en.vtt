audience member you don't really see
anything<00:01:25.929> you<00:01:26.140> don't<00:01:26.170> already<00:01:26.409> know<00:01:26.799> it's

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
anything you don't already know it's

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.980 
anything you don't already know it's
just<00:01:27.429> that<00:01:27.670> you're<00:01:27.820> reminded<00:01:28.390> of<00:01:28.509> things<00:01:28.749> that

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990
