00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:08.870
 My name is as usual when I am a member of a group called Shido Seki Kananiate 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.849
 Start at the opening 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.209
 Norito yashima impersonate Mamiya manager decided Golden special number of this time tbs 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.619
 The 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:20.340
 In Papa Truly reorganization period that title and Hey patient begins 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.810
 Also the explanation of the contents 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:30.510
 I heard that and it is said that Roh Shido will meet at work until dad 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:37.680
 Wakasaka manager who plays Kakari Kanai clearly said that it is 9 years and 9 years of awareness souvenir year 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:40.329
 From it and whether such a dialogue is also then if there of much one Hanamura who impersonate you say you are looking at the special number 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.019
 The appearance of the family is inserted in places 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:49.390
 In this program storm I should have done, but I have already seen Shido 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:55.149
 It's also worth something to say that it's worth noting to watch on TV 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:56.579
 But after all it is a two-hour variety special number of a complete special edition 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:01.589
 It was 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:05.040
 Well hit something people became fun is I think Dora I will do anymore I sparkling 2 hours Ya and 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:09.689
 But I'm like was a bit anticlimactic so that feeling 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.830
 I also that of the way to come back home I was turned on television by big languid 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.570
 I'd thought shopping scene is not reflected in carefully, Hitoraera 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:23.830
 I thought to drama and my family 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:28.479
 Toka Na are similar is something carefully, Naa face and it was sloppy and actors Ya 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:35.350
 Such'm from the middle to watch while I feel this is drama Kappa 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:36.560
 I realized that if you think about it a person who thinks it is a drama and tries to be deceived 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.590
 Usually such a rose 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:48.590
 if the it special number was the one who does not see so much this is Well vases think of tbs 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:51.159
 Well who viewed Papua New Guinea movement also I'm so get sure to etc. buy a decent 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.350
 I guess it looks like 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:02:02.590
 Well, why has it happened like that? 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:08.530
 That's probably speculation, but this wasn't Johnny's side usage 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:11.180
 First and foremost, Golden Week has a negative TV rating 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.650
 Well this is a premise, but I go on a trip 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:20.750
 It's hard to say that you watch TV slowly at home. 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:25.430
 Even if it's close, I will be tired and hit when I come back playing for a day 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:31.170
 Or because other than drama Tteyuu want to see also Why would you pass 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:35.720
 Because it will be recorded and watched, the audience rating is the basics of being recorded 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:40.910
 I can't count and I get lower numbers than usual 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:43.940
 For example , the third episode of hitting the same tbs for this year 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:48.500
 April 29 broadcast 10.9 minutes 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:52.850
 It only falls back to 19 points 96.9 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.710
 By the way, Episode 4 May 6 days of Golden Week last day 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:02.130
 Pick up with 13.8 after this 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:04.920
 It had been returned to operation , so just because it is Golden Week, regardless of this content 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:10.770
 For saying that audience rating is bad 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.460
 Johnny's office thinks in various ways , that is to say, do not broadcast the drama at this time 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.700
 When 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:22.090
 Going out with before can stave off the audience that the fall of 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:23.260
 In that respect, the 2008 change may be May, especially for the drama starring Takuya Kimura 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.890
 12th 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.459
 2009 Mr. Blaine May 23 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.730
 Furthermore, the lover of May 2010 is also May 10 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.720
 With each of these broadcast start dates 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.010
 Although it is a drama of April cool 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:45.530
 What the first episode went into May so anyway 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:48.800
 It worked such intention Tteyuu do not want to broadcast the drama in the Golden Week period 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.880
 It's just a rumor 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:59.760
 I think in various ways 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:00.420
 In April until it's right I wonder if it is referred to as the dreadfulness of however Johnny's will through what 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.570
 Once or twice 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.530
 Wakene that must be surpassed by another program 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:10.870
 That's right I have no on junk this is a particularly organized 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:15.640
 Kimura Taku if it is enough to say such wagamama if you say 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:19.180
 I No wonder become you were usually in that I mean Ii' not something used 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:25.780
 Even so, I would like to make a drama starring Takuya Kimura 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:30.860
 We in the wind Tteyuu in the case of a particular month 9 were addressed by expanding the wife live in 2 hours 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:33.370
 That 's what Johnny's Side has done, so it's full entry 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.449
 That's right and also I 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:43.720
 So this is the start of the operation in April 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:48.910
 The whole story of drama by broadcasting the special feature which is not drama during Golden Week 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.600
 It was in the drama taste without flame and was not allowed to be counted in the audience 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.360
 but 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:59.710
 Paddling special because it is just a variety as a genre division 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:06.129
 The right side is always a self-destructing supermarket, too, because recent drums are just like subtitles 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:12.969
 There is no drama and there is no way to differentiate from being a variety. 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:17.800
 Well, in that sense this Padrader setting is the only thing that makes it so strange 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:22.779
 It's about the age of claiming that you can get rid of 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:26.150
 I will not say if you post various operations parents say in the numerical part 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:31.010
 The audience rating of the special edition is only dad shakes the result 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:35.300
 8.6 Not better than 8.1 in the previous episode 2 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:41.300
 Now is also a good tan a Well if capture this 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:44.030
 It's a number, but if it's just a two hour variety special, it's still 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.139
 A time zone of at least 2 digits 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:53.310
 a secret of A in it 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:56.040
 That's right when you think about Arashi-Chan's taking a rest, it's quite a strange figure 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:06:02.280
 Yes and I think we have become 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:05.540
 For now what the third episode of the audience is to say Rutte me to return to at least 2 digits now 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:09.710
 And have become very important 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:15.250
 Papadoru of Well Anyway more of the drama that the 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.250
 Yes, I would like also firmly Mitodoke future
