00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
originally I thought that the staircase

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.070 
originally I thought that the staircase
would<00:00:13.559> be<00:00:13.620> just<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.240> functional<00:00:15.240> way<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.599> get<00:00:15.929> up

well when we originally did the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.179 
well when we originally did the
staircase<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.080> wasn't<00:01:16.409> really<00:01:16.560> sure<00:01:16.799> exactly

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
staircase I wasn't really sure exactly

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.940 
staircase I wasn't really sure exactly
how<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:18.509> know<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.020> twist<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.770> was

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
how you know that the twist of this was

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.710 
how you know that the twist of this was
going<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.280> come<00:01:20.430> out<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.909> when<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.270> got<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.600> up

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
going to come out and when we got it up

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.570 
going to come out and when we got it up
I<00:01:21.900> realized<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.530> had<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.979> extra<00:01:23.159> room

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
I realized I had all this extra room

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.810 
I realized I had all this extra room
over<00:01:23.970> here<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.869> close<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.530> all<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.220> kitchen

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
over here was close to all the kitchen

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.179 
over here was close to all the kitchen
appliances<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.570> thought<00:01:27.780> he'll<00:01:27.960> need<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.979> have

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
appliances I thought he'll need to have

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
appliances I thought he'll need to have
a<00:01:29.430> shelf<00:01:29.729> could<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> couple<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.930> shelves

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
a shelf could we do a couple of shelves

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.370 
a shelf could we do a couple of shelves
and<00:01:32.540> Charlie<00:01:33.540> said<00:01:33.720> sure<00:01:33.900> why<00:01:34.140> not

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
and Charlie said sure why not

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.590 
and Charlie said sure why not
so<00:01:34.740> he<00:01:35.040> designed<00:01:35.280> these<00:01:35.729> shelves<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.299> fit<00:01:36.479> in

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
so he designed these shelves to fit in

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.170 
so he designed these shelves to fit in
perfectly<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.530> stairs<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.280> they're

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
perfectly with the stairs and they're

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.969 
perfectly with the stairs and they're
very<00:01:39.329> functional<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.530> look<00:01:40.710> good<00:01:40.920> and

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
very functional and they look good and

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.520 
very functional and they look good and
I'm<00:01:41.400> using<00:01:41.880> them<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> time<00:01:42.600> for<00:01:42.899> storage
