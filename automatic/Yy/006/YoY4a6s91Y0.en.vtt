as simple as unclipping that putting the

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.880 
as simple as unclipping that putting the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
clipping it back up again so it's

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.870 
clipping it back up again so it's
actually<00:01:41.290> easier<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.010> put<00:01:42.190> on<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.430> rucksack

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880

and also watertight on the inside so if

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.149 
and also watertight on the inside so if
you<00:02:54.329> if<00:02:54.629> I<00:02:54.780> show<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.019> on<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.349> inside<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.889> is<00:02:56.129> a

you if I show you on the inside it is a

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.039 
you if I show you on the inside it is a
very<00:02:56.489> basic<00:02:57.000> structure<00:02:57.329> bag<00:02:57.599> rather<00:02:57.900> than

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
very basic structure bag rather than

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.080 
very basic structure bag rather than
having<00:02:58.200> any<00:02:58.470> internal<00:02:59.069> pockets<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.579> is<00:02:59.639> quite

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
having any internal pockets it is quite

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.909 
having any internal pockets it is quite
literally<00:03:00.450> just<00:03:00.840> one<00:03:01.109> big<00:03:01.409> open<00:03:01.889> space

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
literally just one big open space

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.069 
literally just one big open space
obviously<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:03.030> helps<00:03:03.389> keep<00:03:03.629> everything<00:03:03.900> in

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
obviously this helps keep everything in

obviously this helps keep everything in
there<00:03:04.230> nice<00:03:04.409> and<00:03:04.439> dry<00:03:04.889> see<00:03:05.430> they're<00:03:05.579> less

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
there nice and dry see they're less

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.550 
there nice and dry see they're less
seams<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.299> less<00:03:06.450> leakage<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.109> the<00:03:07.379> less

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
seams the less leakage and the less

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.690 
seams the less leakage and the less
strain<00:03:07.859> that's<00:03:08.069> going<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.340> have<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.609> the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
strain that's going to have on the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.429 
strain that's going to have on the
material<00:03:09.150> on<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.329> outside<00:03:09.659> and<00:03:09.870> that's<00:03:10.290> going

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
material on the outside and that's going

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.559

to<00:03:10.500> keep<00:03:10.680> everything<00:03:10.980> on<00:03:11.189> the<00:03:11.250> inside<00:03:11.760> as<00:03:12.030> well

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
to keep everything on the inside as well

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
system and the fact that it is based on

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.670 
system and the fact that it is based on
a<00:04:07.680> rack<00:04:08.040> Sachs<00:04:08.430> design<00:04:09.329> so<00:04:10.109> let's<00:04:10.290> take<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.530> look

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
a rack Sachs design so let's take a look

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.319 
a rack Sachs design so let's take a look
at<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:10.889> top<00:04:11.099> pocket<00:04:11.310> shall<00:04:11.699> we<00:04:11.790> as<00:04:11.939> you<00:04:12.209> can

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
see it's based on a wax axe down so it's

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.849

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
part as well so if I show you the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.700 
part as well so if I show you the
ventilation<00:04:47.360> first<00:04:47.750> you<00:04:48.260> can<00:04:48.350> see<00:04:48.440> it's<00:04:48.590> not

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
ventilation first you can see it's not

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.800 
ventilation first you can see it's not
as<00:04:48.830> as<00:04:49.010> harsh<00:04:49.490> or<00:04:49.820> is<00:04:49.910> not<00:04:50.090> as<00:04:50.210> bowed<00:04:50.540> as

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
as as harsh or is not as bowed as

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.380 
as as harsh or is not as bowed as
previous<00:04:51.590> years<00:04:51.620> free<00:04:52.370> flow<00:04:52.610> designs<00:04:52.940> this

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
previous years free flow designs this

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.240 
previous years free flow designs this
means<00:04:53.660> it<00:04:53.840> gives<00:04:53.930> you<00:04:54.080> more<00:04:54.230> option<00:04:54.800> or<00:04:55.040> more

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
means it gives you more option or more

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.580 
means it gives you more option or more
optimal<00:04:55.700> room<00:04:55.940> actually<00:04:56.180> storing<00:04:56.960> away<00:04:57.110> in

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
optimal room actually storing away in

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.830 
optimal room actually storing away in
the<00:04:57.920> actual<00:04:58.160> pack<00:04:58.370> itself<00:04:58.760> but<00:04:59.210> as<00:04:59.630> you<00:04:59.750> can

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
the actual pack itself but as you can

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.750 
the actual pack itself but as you can
see<00:04:59.900> there's<00:05:00.590> a<00:05:00.710> good<00:05:00.860> bit<00:05:01.010> of<00:05:01.070> gap<00:05:01.340> there<00:05:01.580> so

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
see there's a good bit of gap there so

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.520 
see there's a good bit of gap there so
for<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.090> ventilation<00:05:02.570> it's<00:05:03.140> going<00:05:03.380> to<00:05:03.440> be

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
for the ventilation it's going to be

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.500 
for the ventilation it's going to be
nice<00:05:03.770> and<00:05:04.070> cool<00:05:04.370> for<00:05:04.700> you<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:04.910> shouldn't<00:05:05.420> you

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
nice and cool for you and shouldn't you

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.930 
nice and cool for you and shouldn't you
know<00:05:05.540> cause<00:05:05.870> any<00:05:06.050> any<00:05:06.350> sweat<00:05:06.950> sweaty<00:05:07.430> backs<00:05:07.700> or

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
know cause any any sweat sweaty backs or

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.550 
know cause any any sweat sweaty backs or
anything<00:05:08.150> like<00:05:08.360> that<00:05:08.450> so<00:05:08.780> it<00:05:09.080> still<00:05:09.350> works

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
anything like that so it still works

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.260 
anything like that so it still works
perfectly<00:05:09.860> but<00:05:10.640> as<00:05:10.730> I<00:05:10.820> said<00:05:10.940> they've<00:05:11.090> just

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
perfectly but as I said they've just

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.000 
perfectly but as I said they've just
tweaked<00:05:11.600> it<00:05:11.870> so<00:05:12.260> you<00:05:12.320> can<00:05:12.530> obviously<00:05:12.740> get<00:05:12.950> a

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
tweaked it so you can obviously get a

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.070 
tweaked it so you can obviously get a
little<00:05:13.280> bit<00:05:13.400> more<00:05:13.580> in<00:05:13.790> the<00:05:14.210> actual<00:05:14.540> storage<00:05:14.900> as

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
little bit more in the actual storage as

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.570 
little bit more in the actual storage as
well<00:05:15.110> it's<00:05:15.380> a<00:05:15.470> really<00:05:15.800> nice<00:05:15.920> feature<00:05:16.250> of<00:05:16.400> this

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
well it's a really nice feature of this

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.390 
well it's a really nice feature of this

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
year's work set obviously the way that

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.190 
year's work set obviously the way that
the<00:05:19.580> size<00:05:19.820> is<00:05:20.150> as<00:05:20.330> well<00:05:20.510> due<00:05:20.810> to<00:05:20.840> being<00:05:21.140> a

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
the size is as well due to being a

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.110 
the size is as well due to being a
theater<00:05:21.830> you<00:05:21.980> know<00:05:22.100> if<00:05:22.190> you<00:05:22.280> are<00:05:22.340> going<00:05:22.670> for<00:05:23.000> a
