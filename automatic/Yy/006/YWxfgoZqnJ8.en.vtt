00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.950
 today 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.769
 First, Felipe must be there. 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:19.109
 showing you how to put 16 32 or 64 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:23.300
 bits or remember boats in the bf2 neighborhood one 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.990
 file module error you do not extract 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:31.650
 He's going to visit the park is the archive. 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:35.969
 shall be contained therein ifaw 16 ae 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.430
 devote 32 to 64 ideal to like to teach 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.790
 you now how to install the poles for 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.489
 change the game on the occasion of changing 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.129
 your original game games 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.170
 the noise of the two to 64 another of 21 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.370
 than normal in 16 there do not think he 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.829
 it would be necessary 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.930
 You see here the directory is 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.070
 installed their game in the event that my 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.800
 to the sea that the source programs 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.049
 us 32 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.170
 you see br2 modes and here it will contain the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.450
 folder called ae 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.600
 it is contained in it 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.930
 the default file I'll demonstrate 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.100
 You do not want to say what I want here. 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.850
 64 bit in my game is what I get 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.140
 copied this file he will stay 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.750
 decided this way 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.880
 there is no 4.1 before even you 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.400
 make the change in this folder is the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.610
 you trust this original file 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.930
 and copy in a separate folder for case 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.490
 there is the system between the two is problem 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.070
 you go back copy 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.020
 but I did not give trouble, I hope 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.740
 You're not going to give it a problem. 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.590
 way 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.079
 you see here the ideal of 64 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.829
 This is the game here. This is the 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.530
 1616 original capacity of these players 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.950
 parks players in case either does 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.100
 players or body speaking players a case of 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:16.130
 six players you catch 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:20.960
 rb we 64 well rename you come here 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.450
 to pay 64 and leave there default point ae 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.800
 There he will talk since renaming to there. 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.580
 default point between the two parent goes 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.220
 stay like this 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:42.590
 get a car like you already copied these 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:45.020
 unique 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.880
 still 2.1 is missing and in this way 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.340
 it will not work the game 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.320
 5 you enter the game and fight there in 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:59.480
 boxes will enter popularity of 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:03:01.910
 here in the case here the fate of the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.080
 same way they were there in paute 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:11.090
 point there ready within two 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.200
 configured with 64 players one case and 104 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.390
 boxes 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.459
 then the staff asks when he there 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.420
 in the neighborhood of two supports in cd player 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.650
 installed 16 maps that supports 16 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.500
 players 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.590
 only in case when you enter this 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.860
 Is not this the one for the boats you go 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.500
 to enter the game you will click on 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.600
 any map will enter only from 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.489
 this map which is for capacity 16 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.549
 prisoners will have 64 players there for you 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.790
 playing on 64-player maps there is already 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:49.010
 different and is already configured with 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.500
 boxes for 64 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.200
 remembering if your computer is slow 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.480
 a good support does not have a good 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.769
 performance to avoid attacking the 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.160
 disengage your computer 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:05.079
 I ask you to boot default 32 and 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.040
 two players now to put the maps of 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.870
 64 players 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.850
 you are going to download this program that is 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:17.450
 called bed 2 to 64 version 1.0 step 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.760
 I'll be here, you're here for you. 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.039
 but I have already seen these two icons I will install 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.600
 here to demonstrate even with these 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:28.300
 two icons here 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:35.020
 only exclude even ready we will install 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:37.590
 here again yes ok next here is the 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:43.600
 destination where the game is installed 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:48.400
 next next quickly awaiting installation 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.710
 to him reminding me that this is me 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.780
 change in the game will not 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.850
 online performance in case you 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.070
 think hard because you'll catch up with 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.690
 file change in game but change 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.669
 it's a percent of the prize has nothing to do 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.850
 with multiplayer nothing to do with files 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.979
 that you will analyze and will entail 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.970
 as if it were the use of programs 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:13.810
 undue fish ready and as I said 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:17.830
 b2 at 64 br2 at 64 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:20.139
 that booty of which the 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.740
 function of it I was seeing some sites 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:27.400
 and you put some codes here at this 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.520
 code is to make the pot and see 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.900
 with increase his skill in case the 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:38.800
 ability is that they are one and it's them 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.050
 are type as the level more than the 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.210
 expert said that I was seeing I did not 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.060
 I know the codes and want something 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:50.200
 that way I can not remember right 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:53.050
 there after the installation is simple and 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.410
 remembering before making the default 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:00.130
 copy your original game file there 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:03.270
 a detail for you to play on maps in the 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.800
 maps contain less boss also nÃ© with 1 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.680
 64 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.210
 only b2 at 64 here you can only 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.400
 to play in the single player not the test 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:16.900
 online to play only the second player 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:21.490
 the maps of 5 and 16 of 2 64 for you 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.570
 to play in a case your b2 online 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.090
 original 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:28.270
 You come here in my case at the origin and 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.490
 click here is usually hopefully 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.710
 Did you like the video of the video? 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:37.530

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:42.380
