00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
pause the lesson to think about this and

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.080

resume<00:03:05.430> once<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.299> are<00:03:06.450> done

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.880 

when<00:03:10.180> we<00:03:10.330> add<00:03:10.480> bromine<00:03:11.019> water<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.680> aqueous

when we add bromine water to aqueous
potassium<00:03:12.340> chloride

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
potassium chloride

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.170 
potassium chloride
this<00:03:13.989> causes<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.920> solution<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.700> turn<00:03:15.849> reddish

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
this causes the solution to turn reddish

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.509 
this causes the solution to turn reddish
brown<00:03:16.450> but<00:03:17.110> no<00:03:17.379> displacement<00:03:17.739> reaction

brown but no displacement reaction

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.839 
brown but no displacement reaction
occurs<00:03:18.819> as<00:03:19.090> bromine<00:03:20.080> is<00:03:20.290> less<00:03:20.920> reactive<00:03:21.340> than

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
occurs as bromine is less reactive than

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.990 
occurs as bromine is less reactive than
chlorine

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.500 

no<00:03:25.990> reaction<00:03:26.200> occurs<00:03:26.800> when<00:03:27.520> bromine<00:03:27.970> water<00:03:28.240> is

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
as bromine is more reactive than iodine

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.230 
as bromine is more reactive than iodine
it<00:03:38.540> will<00:03:38.960> displace<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.800> liberate<00:03:40.460> iodine<00:03:41.030> in

it will displace and liberate iodine in

it will displace and liberate iodine in
