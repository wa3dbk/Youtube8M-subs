00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello to all today on around the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.910
 tutorial we'll see how to put in 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.900
 before an article on a wordpress blog 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.429
 or also called the ch'ti who post so 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.960
 if you come if you are a reader 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.670
 regular around judo you had to 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.869
 notice that to enter the page 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.720
 home so you have 3 3 items 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.140
 who turns everything in so do there the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.150
 google guide + the guide on twitter and 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.039
 finally the guide on wordpress hours in 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.149
 does so I compile them all my 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.860
 articles on on twitter wordpress 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.989
 google + so compiles each time 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.260
 in his craftsmen his articles there so 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.969
 to put forward all that there is 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.200
 a little option called the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.750
 ch'ti who post on wordpress 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.239
 so we will take a test block so 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.289
 my blog my blog test i'm going one 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.270
 dashboard and I will make you 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.649
 actually see how we're going to do all this 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.030
 so when you add you do it 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.030
 you have two ways to do it 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.449
 so when you added an article 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.010
 here so you get back the title is in 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.810
 visibility right 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.670
 when you click edit you 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.710
 have an option called putting this 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.930
 article forward on the page so in 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.520
 do the trick is that you 're going to have 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.520
 this article which will always be at the top 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.400
 this will be the first party item that 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.810
 will be visible to your readers I know 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.299
 only one to whom use it for example 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.799
 as I believe it is korben who uses 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.470
 of that actually to give a little bit 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.549
 news about his life and where he is 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.259
 always the first article 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.880
 we were in the lead because the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.680
 blog here is the thing of blogs is that 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.780
 each time the articles are compiled 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.649
 So bah that's pure and without 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.840
 found at the top 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.960
 so there that way you'll have 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.560
 always the same article at the top of the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.530
 home page 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.110
 so the second way also for the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.799
 put forward you click on all 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.479
 the articles 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.939
 and for example wanted to put an article 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.890
 is already created forward you can 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.270
 click on moody's then we will take 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.799
 a little bit more by taking that one 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.439
 there for example I'll click on 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.479
 quick change and you know the 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.280
 small option that is also here 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.560
 so put this content forward I 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.450
 click on update and you go 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.670

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.980

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.820
