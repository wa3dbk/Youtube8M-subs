00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.330
 and so friends today received a parcel with 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.769
 online store 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.040
 ordered a car inverter 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.809
 in other words converter 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.579
 current 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:42.450
 which are from a 12 volt battery 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:45.950
 converts 220 volts can 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.530
 connect there let's say drills and others 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:01:01.309
 Appliances 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:01:13.500
 let's see this for 2000 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:15.119
 further instruction on here 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.430
 such crocodiles to anyone 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:23.970
 connect to battery for 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.140
 cigarette lighter through the cigarette lighter is not 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.299
 recommended if you connect more 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.140
 powerful household 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.520
 better connect anyone directly 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.719
 battery 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.409
 what wanted to check really 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:51.649
 whether he possesses such power now we 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:51.649
 try this directly 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:02.250
 by crocodiles and see if 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:06.719
 you have the power well as stated 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:11.930
 the seller is power I think did not 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:15.799
 hide this power there 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:20.160
 the reality of the cache of this power 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:23.450
 Well, yes kilowatt kilowatt that is, a thousand 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:30.620
 watt as assured seller zone 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.620
 quite cope now on stage they 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:39.260
 true 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:39.260
 try to check serves actually 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:55.500
 and I also want to tell you one 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:03:00.080
 when talking to the seller of goods from me 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:05.190
 an explanation of what happens of this kind 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:09.270
 2000 watts inverter with sticker 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:14.280
 stuffing they have different go with two 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:21.120
 transformers like this model but in 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:25.140
 repair here if you say take off 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.400
 thyristors then is subject to repair a 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:32.630
 there is a model a little bit more expensive which 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.630
 worth 3 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.270
 transformer which is not subject 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.270
 repair 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:48.880
 and so first you need to connect it 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:04:00.400
 Now I â€™m not flying workers anywhere 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:04:04.920
 closed we will connect red black 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:09.820
 months we follow the instructions 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:12.390
 crocodile and see what we have 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.590
 will come out 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.220
 there is still 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:24.630
 Yusb output that is, you can connect 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:31.870
 well, there is a phone or know the different river more 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:37.950
 on so it turns on and you hear from 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.950
 fan earned try to connect 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.670
 so the program connect the drill 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:05:01.250
 power if you see thousands of 250 watts 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:01.250
 250 more times to see 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.990
 I will scream 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.540
 as we see 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.880
 1250 grip this device 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.310
 Cope now try to increase 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.630
 load 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:38.200
 connected workers by car while us 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:47.340
 there will be a Bulgarian 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:47.340
 but roll up 1,800 watt another 800 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.050
 We try to connect our grinder and 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:06.330
 Around to include sho we leave as 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:13.169
 see the barrels fails that is 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:21.240
 apparently starting current bulgar tech 1800 here 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:24.150
 possible but the future of appliances so soon 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:29.110
 the red light comes on he 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:39.360
 it turns off that is, this device is already 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:44.490
 does not pull 1250 cope large such 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:49.650
 I saw we tested the ball 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.650
 such if someone was helpful 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:07:00.840
 subscribe to the channel for a new video 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.840
 good luck
