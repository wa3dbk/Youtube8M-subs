this<00:01:04.729> again<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:06.020> still<00:01:07.020> shrugs<00:01:07.500> off<00:01:07.680> water<00:01:07.920> I

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
this again I still shrugs off water I

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.700 
this again I still shrugs off water I
think<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.720> only<00:01:09.840> thing<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.350> would<00:01:10.409> say

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
think the only thing that I would say

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.260 
think the only thing that I would say
which<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> negative<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.880> these<00:01:12.119> are

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
which is a negative is these are

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.750 
which is a negative is these are
supposed<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> tan<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.580> they're

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
actually still so oily that they are

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.330 
actually still so oily that they are

cup has really lost its shape this is

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.910 
cup has really lost its shape this is
quite<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> lot<00:03:49.080> of<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.440> knowing<00:03:49.620> there's<00:03:49.800> no

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
quite a lot of you knowing there's no

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.670 
quite a lot of you knowing there's no
structure<00:03:50.400> that's<00:03:50.610> all<00:03:50.820> it's<00:03:51.000> really<00:03:51.150> sloppy

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
structure that's all it's really sloppy

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.620 
structure that's all it's really sloppy
these<00:03:53.070> boots<00:03:53.250> are<00:03:53.430> come<00:03:53.580> a<00:03:53.820> little<00:03:54.150> bit<00:03:54.300> loose

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
these boots are come a little bit loose

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.770 
these boots are come a little bit loose
because<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.170> so<00:03:56.130> that's<00:03:56.280> really<00:03:56.780> yeah

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
because of that so that's really yeah

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.509 
because of that so that's really yeah
that<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.590> could<00:03:58.769> have<00:03:58.860> been<00:03:58.980> doing<00:03:59.340> with

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
that that could have been doing with

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.710 
that that could have been doing with
being<00:03:59.790> plastic<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.360> think<00:04:02.030> other<00:04:03.030> observations

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
being plastic I think other observations

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.870 
being plastic I think other observations
of<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:06.080> that<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.380> trim<00:04:07.860> around<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:09.269> top<00:04:09.540> here

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
of the that the trim around the top here

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.000 
of the that the trim around the top here
hopefully<00:04:11.880> you<00:04:11.970> can<00:04:12.030> see<00:04:12.239> it's<00:04:12.360> all<00:04:12.570> cracked

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
hopefully you can see it's all cracked

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.230 
hopefully you can see it's all cracked
and<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.070> happened<00:04:14.459> really<00:04:14.580> quickly<00:04:14.850> as<00:04:15.030> well

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
and that happened really quickly as well

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.199 
and that happened really quickly as well
I<00:04:15.890> mean<00:04:16.890> why<00:04:17.039> that<00:04:17.220> wasn't<00:04:17.400> nice<00:04:17.640> leather<00:04:17.940> why

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
I mean why that wasn't nice leather why

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.530 
I mean why that wasn't nice leather why
it's<00:04:18.390> this<00:04:18.510> sort<00:04:18.720> of

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
it's this sort of

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.130 
it's this sort of
for<00:04:19.840> plastic<00:04:20.200> piping<00:04:20.590> I<00:04:21.480> also<00:04:22.480> say<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:22.870> rain

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
for plastic piping I also say you rain

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.630 
for plastic piping I also say you rain
the<00:04:23.260> eyelets<00:04:23.620> you<00:04:23.800> can't<00:04:24.010> lessee<00:04:24.370> it<00:04:24.460> but

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
the eyelets you can't lessee it but

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.500 
the eyelets you can't lessee it but
they've<00:04:24.820> stretched

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
they've stretched

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.260 
they've stretched
quite<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:25.840> bit<00:04:26.080> so<00:04:26.380> you<00:04:27.370> can't<00:04:27.640> get<00:04:27.850> them<00:04:27.940> super

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
quite a bit so you can't get them super

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.720 
quite a bit so you can't get them super
super<00:04:28.540> tight<00:04:28.840> done<00:04:29.170> up<00:04:29.290> late<00:04:29.500> just<00:04:29.740> because

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
super tight done up late just because

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.990 
super tight done up late just because
there's<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:30.940> structural<00:04:31.390> way<00:04:31.600> in<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.780> shoe<00:04:33.000> but

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
there's a structural way in the shoe but

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.040 
there's a structural way in the shoe but
that's<00:04:34.120> probably<00:04:34.270> going<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.780> supple

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
that's probably going to the supple

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.840 
that's probably going to the supple
Lebanon<00:04:35.380> and<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:35.920> supple<00:04:36.280> leathers<00:04:36.580> still

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
Lebanon and the supple leathers still

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.970 
Lebanon and the supple leathers still
quite<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.180> strong<00:04:37.450> point<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.840> really<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:41.830> key

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
quite a strong point so really the key

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.470 
quite a strong point so really the key
thing<00:04:42.220> here<00:04:42.280> is<00:04:43.260> you<00:04:44.260> know<00:04:44.380> how<00:04:44.650> do<00:04:44.710> they<00:04:44.890> honor

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
thing here is you know how do they honor

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.210 
thing here is you know how do they honor
their<00:04:46.480> guarantee<00:04:47.470> you<00:04:47.680> know<00:04:47.770> I'm<00:04:47.890> gonna<00:04:48.040> send

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
their guarantee you know I'm gonna send
