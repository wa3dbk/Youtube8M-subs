00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
slash um yeah I just got to get the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.349 
slash um yeah I just got to get the
handling<00:00:26.340> from<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> Stampede<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.029> love<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
handling from the Stampede I love the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.689 
handling from the Stampede I love the
power<00:00:27.510> but<00:00:28.410> if<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.769> can't<00:00:29.010> put<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.310> power<00:00:29.460> to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
power but if I can't put the power to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.970 
power but if I can't put the power to
the<00:00:29.789> ground<00:00:30.109> without<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.529> flipping<00:00:31.859> over

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
the ground without it flipping over

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.709 
the ground without it flipping over
every<00:00:32.309> 10<00:00:32.489> seconds<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.300> really<00:00:33.660> really

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
every 10 seconds and I really really

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.700 
every 10 seconds and I really really
then<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.680> not<00:00:34.860> really<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.190> much<00:00:35.460> fun<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:37.380> um

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
then it's not really that much fun so um

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.610 
then it's not really that much fun so um
I<00:00:38.040> converted<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.700> into<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.910> slash<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:40.469> just

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
I converted it into a slash and it just

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.160 
I converted it into a slash and it just
made<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> lot<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.129> sense<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.430> me<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.020> as<00:00:43.020> you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
made a lot of sense for me and as you

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.569 
made a lot of sense for me and as you
can<00:00:43.290> see<00:00:43.320> i<00:00:45.710> did<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:46.800> some<00:00:47.010> new<00:00:47.129> Springs<00:00:47.460> for

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
can see i did get some new Springs for

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.020 
can see i did get some new Springs for
the<00:00:47.700> backs<00:00:47.879> some<00:00:48.420> red<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.809> tegi<00:00:49.200> springs<00:00:49.590> i

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
the backs some red and tegi springs i

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.020 
the backs some red and tegi springs i

box<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.979> did<00:01:14.250> use<00:01:14.880> my<00:01:15.090> old<00:01:15.479> timer<00:01:15.780> body<00:01:16.049> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
box and I did use my old timer body to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.700 
box and I did use my old timer body to
make<00:01:16.500> some<00:01:16.820> mud<00:01:17.820> flaps<00:01:18.090> over<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:18.710> nothing

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
fancy really just the normal / with just

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.960 
fancy really just the normal / with just
a<00:01:22.740> bunch<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.040> RPM<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.880> um<00:01:24.080> yeah<00:01:25.080> um<00:01:25.970> my

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
a bunch of RPM on it um yeah um my

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.760 
a bunch of RPM on it um yeah um my
electronics<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.689> though<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.470> honey<00:01:28.680> on

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
electronics are though all the honey on

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.330 
electronics are though all the honey on
the<00:01:29.630> spectrum<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.960> did<00:01:31.320> get<00:01:31.470> eternity<00:01:32.009> battery

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the spectrum I did get eternity battery

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.069 
the spectrum I did get eternity battery
like<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.670> said<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:34.610> what's<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.850> here<00:01:36.150> now

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
like I said I was and what's in here now

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.590 
like I said I was and what's in here now
that's<00:01:37.979> definitely<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> stock<00:01:39.030> traxxas

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
that's definitely not the stock traxxas

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.170 
that's definitely not the stock traxxas
because<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.470> very<00:01:40.500> short<00:01:41.070> antenna<00:01:41.340> what<00:01:42.060> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
because it is very short antenna what it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:52.270 
because it is very short antenna what it
is<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:43.220> this<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.420> my<00:01:45.450> FS<00:01:46.369> gt3<00:01:48.320> be<00:01:50.149> radio<00:01:51.149> arm

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
is is this it is my FS gt3 be radio arm

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.590 
is is this it is my FS gt3 be radio arm
basically<00:01:53.280> i<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.030> say<00:01:54.180> i<00:01:54.210> love<00:01:54.270> this

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
thing on the receivers tiny the antennas

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.590 
thing on the receivers tiny the antennas
perfect<00:01:57.299> um<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:58.850> mean<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.000> makes<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.509> much
