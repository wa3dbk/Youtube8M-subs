going to be in touch it's a twin display

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.440 
going to be in touch it's a twin display
so<00:02:33.800> your<00:02:34.160> top<00:02:34.430> screen<00:02:34.850> which<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.240> about

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
so your top screen which is about

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.480 
so your top screen which is about
roughly<00:02:35.870> about<00:02:35.959> eight<00:02:36.290> inches<00:02:36.440> be<00:02:37.280> for<00:02:37.430> your

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
roughly about eight inches be for your

roughly about eight inches be for your
navigation<00:02:38.120> system<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:39.170> bottom<00:02:39.470> screen

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
navigation system and the bottom screen

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.470

okay okay so what else what else is

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.680 
okay okay so what else what else is
going<00:02:48.220> on<00:02:48.370> well<00:02:49.000> there's<00:02:49.150> what's<00:02:49.360> called<00:02:49.450> a

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
going on well there's what's called a

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.960 
going on well there's what's called a
direct<00:02:50.200> adaptive<00:02:50.740> steering<00:02:51.250> system<00:02:51.820> which

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
direct adaptive steering system which

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.480 
direct adaptive steering system which
really<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> world<00:02:52.900> first<00:02:53.190> it's<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.340> an

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
really is a world first it's in an

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.250 
really is a world first it's in an
electronic<00:02:54.880> system<00:02:55.240> so<00:02:55.570> it's<00:02:55.720> not<00:02:55.870> electric

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
electronic system so it's not electric

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.230 
electronic system so it's not electric
assist<00:02:56.740> its<00:02:56.980> electric<00:02:57.490> steering<00:02:57.790> like<00:02:58.090> it's

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
assist its electric steering like it's

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.240 
assist its electric steering like it's
fly-by-wire<00:02:58.660> like<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.170> triple<00:02:59.380> seven<00:02:59.740> you<00:02:59.980> tell

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
fly-by-wire like a triple seven you tell

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.390 
fly-by-wire like a triple seven you tell
me<00:03:00.750> talk<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.810> me<00:03:02.020> okay<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:02.530> truth<00:03:02.770> be<00:03:02.950> told<00:03:02.980> I

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
me talk to me okay so truth be told I

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.490 
me talk to me okay so truth be told I
was<00:03:03.790> very<00:03:03.940> excited<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.390> come<00:03:04.510> see<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.720> so<00:03:05.470> I

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
was very excited to come see you so I

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.870 
was very excited to come see you so I
did<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.709> little<00:03:05.740> research<00:03:05.980> before<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.550> got<00:03:06.730> here

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
did a little research before I got here

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.300 
did a little research before I got here
okay<00:03:07.240> Cheryl<00:03:08.140> sent<00:03:08.350> me<00:03:08.440> some<00:03:08.620> stuff<00:03:08.830> I'm<00:03:09.070> all

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
okay Cheryl sent me some stuff I'm all

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.370 
okay Cheryl sent me some stuff I'm all
ears<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.180> turns<00:03:10.300> out<00:03:10.570> it's<00:03:10.810> an<00:03:10.930> electric

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
ears so it turns out it's an electric

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.530 
ears so it turns out it's an electric
steering<00:03:11.680> system<00:03:12.220> so<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.970> steering<00:03:13.360> wheel<00:03:13.510> is

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
steering system so the steering wheel is

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.510 
steering system so the steering wheel is
really<00:03:14.140> not<00:03:14.290> connected<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:14.950> wheels<00:03:15.190> kind

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
really not connected to the wheels kind

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.360 
really not connected to the wheels kind
