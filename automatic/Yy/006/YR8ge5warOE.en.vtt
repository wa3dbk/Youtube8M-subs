00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.350
 today 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.980
 today 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.250
 Renan 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.160
 Then you can see the difference that 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.000
 he stood in relation to the other there in the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.630
 corner 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.140
 Look how he stayed in my opinion. 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.029
 much more beautiful beast is you 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.029
 see here now that you have a component 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:37.140
 politician in front of him 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.949
 also the rear has gained 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.949
 leds 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:49.410
 let's see back here with a lot 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:52.770
 more in my opinion the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:59.210
 camera blurred here now you see the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:03.440
 row nerds method all it measures now 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.440
 the neat trick 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.790
 inside it has not changed much 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.430
 as you can see here only the values 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.790
 which start at 67,000 for the version 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.790
 manual 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:54.070
 it can reach up to 81 thousand reais 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.070
 I've tried 1 590 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.850
 If I'm not mistaken here, now is the light. 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.630
 one nÃ© that is already mandatory in europe there 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.630
 quite a long time
