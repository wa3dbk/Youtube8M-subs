we<00:02:01.290> formed<00:02:01.649> all<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.950> out<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.430> formed<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
we formed all this out and formed the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.249 
we formed all this out and formed the
steps<00:02:03.770> put<00:02:04.770> rebar<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.340> there<00:02:05.719> at<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.899> bottom

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
steps put rebar in there at the bottom

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.979 
steps put rebar in there at the bottom
down<00:02:07.380> there<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.710> see<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> pit<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.690> sump

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
down there you see a pit for the sump

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:10.800 
down there you see a pit for the sump
pump

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
pump

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.900 
pump
so<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.740> know<00:02:12.010> these<00:02:12.130> things<00:02:12.400> take<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.610> lot<00:02:12.790> of

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
so you know these things take a lot of

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.210 
so you know these things take a lot of
water<00:02:13.090> so<00:02:13.240> all<00:02:13.690> this<00:02:13.810> waters<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.830> know<00:02:14.920> came

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
water so all this waters you know came

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.130 
water so all this waters you know came
down<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.550> steps<00:02:15.819> all<00:02:16.030> goes<00:02:16.240> in<00:02:16.420> there<00:02:16.600> if<00:02:16.990> you

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
down the steps all goes in there if you

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.630 
down the steps all goes in there if you
look<00:02:17.290> off<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.680> side<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.190> bottom

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
look off to the side on the bottom

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.040 
look off to the side on the bottom
you're<00:02:19.180> going<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.330> see<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.660> electrical

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
you're going to see the electrical

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.940 
you're going to see the electrical
connections<00:02:20.530> for<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.910> sub<00:02:22.240> Punk<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:22.950> you

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
connections for that sub Punk so you

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.760 
connections for that sub Punk so you
know<00:02:24.040> it's<00:02:24.160> easy<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.520> get<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:26.260> all<00:02:26.380> that<00:02:26.590> so

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
know it's easy to get to and all that so

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.729 
know it's easy to get to and all that so
once<00:02:26.950> we<00:02:27.069> had<00:02:27.190> this<00:02:27.310> whole<00:02:27.520> thing<00:02:27.930> dug<00:02:28.930> out<00:02:29.170> and

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
once we had this whole thing dug out and

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.050 
once we had this whole thing dug out and
the<00:02:30.280> brick<00:02:30.489> was<00:02:30.640> up

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
the brick was up

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.309 
the brick was up
of<00:02:31.330> course<00:02:31.510> there's<00:02:31.660> inspections<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.260> we

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
of course there's inspections that we

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.680 
of course there's inspections that we
have<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.560> go<00:02:32.680> through<00:02:32.920> long<00:02:33.069> along<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.790> way<00:02:33.940> we

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
have to go through long along the way we

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.080 
have to go through long along the way we
then<00:02:34.870> poured<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.470> whole<00:02:35.620> thing<00:02:36.090> solid

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
then poured the whole thing solid

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.229 
then poured the whole thing solid
concrete<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.709> retaining<00:02:39.160> walls<00:02:39.459> we<00:02:40.150> had

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
concrete on the retaining walls we had

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.410 
concrete on the retaining walls we had
to<00:02:40.360> fill<00:02:40.600> these<00:02:40.780> cells<00:02:41.110> with<00:02:41.500> concrete<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:43.000> we

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
to fill these cells with concrete and we

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.000 
to fill these cells with concrete and we
built<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.750> distant<00:02:44.050> irregular<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.620> regular

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
built a distant irregular a regular

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.640 
built a distant irregular a regular
retaining<00:02:45.430> wall<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:46.420> it's<00:02:46.750> got<00:02:46.930> concrete<00:02:47.410> in

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
retaining wall so it's got concrete in

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.070 
retaining wall so it's got concrete in
the<00:02:47.890> cells<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.580> also<00:02:49.300> in<00:02:49.480> those<00:02:49.630> cells<00:02:49.930> are

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
the cells and also in those cells are

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.870 
the cells and also in those cells are
that<00:02:50.290> number<00:02:50.440> four<00:02:50.830> for<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.489> half-inch

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
that number four for that half-inch

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.180 
that number four for that half-inch
rebar<00:02:52.269> you<00:02:52.870> know<00:02:52.959> every<00:02:53.230> 16<00:02:53.680> inches<00:02:53.800> we<00:02:54.100> have

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
rebar you know every 16 inches we have

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.130 
rebar you know every 16 inches we have
to<00:02:54.280> have<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:55.060> rebar<00:02:55.420> little<00:02:55.780> all<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.019> way

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
to have that rebar little all the way

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.229 
to have that rebar little all the way
down<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:56.830> into<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.310> footer<00:02:57.550> ties<00:02:57.880> into<00:02:58.090> the

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
down and into the footer ties into the

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.570 
down and into the footer ties into the
pillar<00:02:58.450> system<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:59.739> we<00:02:59.920> do<00:03:00.069> all<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.400> make

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
pillar system so we do all that make

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.729 
pillar system so we do all that make
sure<00:03:00.700> we<00:03:00.790> have<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.060> good<00:03:01.300> strong<00:03:01.540> wall<00:03:01.870> but<00:03:02.650> you

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
sure we have a good strong wall but you

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:03.990 
sure we have a good strong wall but you
can<00:03:02.860> see<00:03:02.980> we've<00:03:03.130> parted<00:03:03.550> it<00:03:03.670> when<00:03:03.819> we<00:03:03.910> were

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
can see we've parted it when we were

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.410 
can see we've parted it when we were
done<00:03:04.209> part<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:04.959> means<00:03:05.200> simply<00:03:05.530> we<00:03:05.650> think

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
done part you means simply we think

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.840 
done part you means simply we think
mortar<00:03:07.420> concrete's<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.550> concrete<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:09.670> sand

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
mortar concrete's and concrete and sand

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.910 
mortar concrete's and concrete and sand
they<00:03:10.269> basically<00:03:10.690> put<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.959> nice<00:03:11.140> like<00:03:11.319> like<00:03:11.830> a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
they basically put a nice like like a

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.370 
they basically put a nice like like a
stucco<00:03:12.190> type<00:03:12.489> finish<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.120> we<00:03:14.110> could<00:03:14.290> be

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
stucco type finish on it we could be

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.930 
stucco type finish on it we could be
painted<00:03:14.620> or<00:03:14.829> stoned<00:03:15.250> up<00:03:15.430> or<00:03:15.579> whatever<00:03:15.730> you

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
painted or stoned up or whatever you

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.289 
painted or stoned up or whatever you
want<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.150> do<00:03:16.269> later<00:03:17.200> on<00:03:17.380> down<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.590> road<00:03:18.299> but

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
want to do later on down the road but

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.910 
want to do later on down the road but
once<00:03:19.480> we<00:03:19.600> had<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.870> big<00:03:19.989> hole<00:03:20.230> in<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.440> wall<00:03:20.530> or

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
once we had that big hole in the wall or

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.640 
once we had that big hole in the wall or
in<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.070> ground<00:03:21.310> we<00:03:21.970> then<00:03:22.150> come<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:22.870> with<00:03:22.900> and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
in the ground we then come in with and

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.110 
in the ground we then come in with and
cut<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:25.480> hole<00:03:25.989> in<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.470> in<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.860> foundation<00:03:27.670> wall

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
cut a hole in the in the foundation wall

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.270 
cut a hole in the in the foundation wall
so<00:03:28.720> obviously<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.200> hole<00:03:29.680> it<00:03:29.769> wasn't<00:03:30.130> there

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
so obviously that hole it wasn't there

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.550 
so obviously that hole it wasn't there
so<00:03:30.519> it's<00:03:31.420> a<00:03:31.480> pretty<00:03:31.660> big<00:03:31.870> job<00:03:31.900> cutting<00:03:32.470> all

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
so it's a pretty big job cutting all

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.710 
so it's a pretty big job cutting all
that<00:03:32.590> concrete<00:03:33.220> out<00:03:33.579> of<00:03:33.610> there<00:03:33.850> dropping<00:03:34.540> it

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
that concrete out of there dropping it

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.250 
that concrete out of there dropping it
to<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.900> ground

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
to the ground

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.590 
to the ground
busting<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:35.739> in<00:03:35.860> smaller<00:03:36.640> pieces<00:03:36.910> cutting<00:03:37.510> it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
busting it in smaller pieces cutting it

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.569 
busting it in smaller pieces cutting it
like<00:03:37.750> crazy<00:03:38.049> and<00:03:38.320> hauling<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.400> whole

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
like crazy and hauling that of the whole

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.759 
like crazy and hauling that of the whole
you<00:03:40.329> know<00:03:41.519> after<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.109> door<00:03:44.290> was<00:03:44.470> framed

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
you know after that the door was framed

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.160 
you know after that the door was framed
out<00:03:45.120> like<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.239> would<00:03:46.359> typically<00:03:46.660> frame<00:03:46.989> out

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
out like you would typically frame out

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.340 
out like you would typically frame out
you<00:03:47.410> know<00:03:47.500> any<00:03:47.680> any<00:03:48.120> application<00:03:49.120> but<00:03:49.810> realize

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
you know any any application but realize

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.710 
you know any any application but realize
that<00:03:50.620> this<00:03:51.280> is<00:03:51.430> weak<00:03:51.850> this<00:03:52.060> is<00:03:52.120> unusual<00:03:52.390> this

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
that this is weak this is unusual this

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.599 
that this is weak this is unusual this
particular<00:03:53.109> one<00:03:53.380> was<00:03:53.530> on<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.130> side<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.549> the

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
particular one was on the side of the

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.180 
particular one was on the side of the
house<00:03:54.790> so<00:03:55.540> this<00:03:55.720> is<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.870> non<00:03:56.170> load-bearing<00:03:56.560> wall

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
house so this is a non load-bearing wall

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.520 
house so this is a non load-bearing wall
but<00:03:58.150> that<00:03:58.390> did<00:03:58.570> that<00:03:58.750> as<00:03:59.109> far<00:03:59.290> as<00:03:59.380> we're

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
but that did that as far as we're

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.500 
but that did that as far as we're
concerned<00:03:59.560> we<00:03:59.980> built<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.579> as<00:04:00.700> if<00:04:00.850> it<00:04:00.970> was<00:04:01.209> a

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
concerned we built it as if it was a

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.479 
concerned we built it as if it was a
load-bearing<00:04:01.989> wall<00:04:02.200> so<00:04:02.950> we've<00:04:03.070> got<00:04:03.190> all<00:04:03.280> kind

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
load-bearing wall so we've got all kind

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.970 
load-bearing wall so we've got all kind
of<00:04:03.519> headers<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:03.970> such<00:04:04.180> underneath<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.859> on

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
of headers and such underneath on the on

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.520 
of headers and such underneath on the on
the<00:04:06.070> top<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.400> that<00:04:06.430> doorframe<00:04:07.260> once<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.350> door

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
the top of that doorframe once the door

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.060 
the top of that doorframe once the door
was<00:04:08.560> cut<00:04:08.859> out

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
was cut out

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.860 
was cut out
you<00:04:09.640> know<00:04:09.730> we<00:04:09.850> frame<00:04:10.150> it<00:04:10.269> up<00:04:10.359> these<00:04:10.570> you<00:04:10.780> know

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870

and

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.540 
and
yeah<00:04:20.319> I<00:04:20.349> was<00:04:20.499> again<00:04:20.680> we<00:04:21.099> install<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.549> door<00:04:22.020> and

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
yeah I was again we install the door and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.239 
yeah I was again we install the door and
that<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.759> exterior<00:04:25.419> perimeter<00:04:25.749> we<00:04:26.710> used<00:04:26.919> an

00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:27.249 
that the exterior perimeter we used an

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:30.179 
that the exterior perimeter we used an
ASIC<00:04:27.610> product<00:04:28.029> which<00:04:28.180> is<00:04:28.419> a<00:04:29.050> vinyl<00:04:29.710> product

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:30.189 
ASIC product which is a vinyl product

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:32.459 
ASIC product which is a vinyl product
that<00:04:30.310> looks<00:04:30.490> like<00:04:30.639> wood<00:04:30.909> so<00:04:31.659> you<00:04:32.020> know<00:04:32.139> looking

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:32.469 
that looks like wood so you know looking

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:33.989 
that looks like wood so you know looking
at<00:04:32.590> this<00:04:32.740> thing<00:04:32.979> you<00:04:33.189> would<00:04:33.580> think<00:04:33.729> that<00:04:33.819> the

00:04:33.989 --> 00:04:33.999 
at this thing you would think that the

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:36.480 
at this thing you would think that the
exterior<00:04:34.330> is<00:04:34.659> wood<00:04:34.930> but<00:04:35.800> in<00:04:35.919> fact<00:04:36.069> it's<00:04:36.310> vinyl

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
exterior is wood but in fact it's vinyl

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.429 
exterior is wood but in fact it's vinyl
so<00:04:36.759> it<00:04:36.819> will<00:04:36.939> never<00:04:36.999> rot<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:37.930> that<00:04:38.110> sort<00:04:38.409> of

00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:38.439 
so it will never rot and that sort of

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:41.939 
so it will never rot and that sort of
thing<00:04:38.620> we<00:04:39.580> then<00:04:39.960> put<00:04:40.960> some<00:04:41.110> handrails<00:04:41.529> on<00:04:41.740> here

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
thing we then put some handrails on here

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.149 
thing we then put some handrails on here
we<00:04:42.069> have<00:04:42.159> a<00:04:42.659> custom-made<00:04:43.659> steel<00:04:44.529> wrought<00:04:44.979> iron

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:45.159 
we have a custom-made steel wrought iron

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.360 
we have a custom-made steel wrought iron
pan<00:04:45.669> rails<00:04:45.939> that<00:04:46.599> we<00:04:46.689> bolt<00:04:46.960> into<00:04:47.259> the<00:04:47.349> wall<00:04:47.560> and

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
pan rails that we bolt into the wall and

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.089 
pan rails that we bolt into the wall and
these<00:04:48.490> things<00:04:48.669> are<00:04:48.879> on<00:04:49.749> there<00:04:49.900> pretty<00:04:50.080> good<00:04:50.169> we

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
these things are on there pretty good we

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.300 
these things are on there pretty good we
put<00:04:51.279> a<00:04:51.310> flagstone<00:04:52.210> cap<00:04:52.750> on<00:04:52.960> top<00:04:53.229> so<00:04:53.620> when<00:04:54.250> you

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
put a flagstone cap on top so when you

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.589 
put a flagstone cap on top so when you
look<00:04:54.460> at<00:04:54.520> this<00:04:54.669> thing<00:04:54.819> it's<00:04:54.939> all<00:04:55.060> ready<00:04:55.270> to<00:04:55.360> go

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
look at this thing it's all ready to go

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.480 
look at this thing it's all ready to go
if<00:04:56.169> they<00:04:56.379> want<00:04:56.409> to<00:04:56.620> put<00:04:56.740> stone<00:04:56.979> on<00:04:57.129> the<00:04:57.219> side

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
if they want to put stone on the side

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.149 
if they want to put stone on the side
and<00:04:57.909> that<00:04:58.210> sort<00:04:58.449> of<00:04:58.509> thing<00:04:58.710> once<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.830> job<00:04:59.979> was

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
and that sort of thing once the job was

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.420 
and that sort of thing once the job was
all<00:05:00.310> completed<00:05:00.789> the<00:05:01.779> client<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.349> know<00:05:02.469> came

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
all completed the client you know came

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.999 
all completed the client you know came
out<00:05:03.550> here<00:05:03.759> was<00:05:03.909> it<00:05:04.060> just<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.300> big<00:05:04.900> mud<00:05:05.050> pit<00:05:05.319> so<00:05:05.949> of

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
out here was it just a big mud pit so of

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:07.260 
out here was it just a big mud pit so of
course<00:05:06.129> it's<00:05:06.370> chances<00:05:06.729> to<00:05:06.879> pour<00:05:07.150> this

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
course it's chances to pour this

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.330 
course it's chances to pour this
concrete<00:05:07.479> so<00:05:08.469> we<00:05:08.620> ended<00:05:08.800> up<00:05:08.889> pouring<00:05:09.189> concrete

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
concrete so we ended up pouring concrete

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.029 
concrete so we ended up pouring concrete
back<00:05:09.789> here<00:05:10.060> from<00:05:10.270> on<00:05:10.930> the<00:05:11.020> other<00:05:11.169> side<00:05:11.409> and<00:05:11.949> you
