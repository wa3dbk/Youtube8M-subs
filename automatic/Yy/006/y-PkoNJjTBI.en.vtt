 based on kinect technology 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.760
 you know the game system without 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.399

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.450
 basketball champion basketball hoop 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.369
 Absolute shoes that make gps yes 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.810
 very discreet shoes with 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.250
 electro-luminescent diodes and then this 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.659
 which is nice is that it's always 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.610
 the trash that but we will have the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.720
 shoes him stable so here 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.670
 shoes with electro diodes 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.259
 luminescent right and left so 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.330
 you register you save the 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.560
 destination you want to go and then 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.850
 well when you're in the street 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.259
 when you have to turn right there are 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.520
 a light that lights on the right 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.490
 of the shoe when you have to turn 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.869
 left on the left of the shoe 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.280
 finally while disarming smile 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.479
 we almost had to go out 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.189
 his phone from his pocket what is 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.689
 still the small advantage and even the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.180
 bike helmets become smart 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.060
 here is a helmet that goes well 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.280
 recorded shocks and who will prevent 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.840
 help if you too have a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.820
 accident for example watching a little 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.590
 sensor on the back of the headset connected to 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.119
 your at your phone and look at it 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.470
 there is a courier a shock actually there is a 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.240
 little counter that gets set up and if 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.799
 you do not disable it we believe that 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.060
 you are in danger and it will send a 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.259
 backup sms and your GPS coordinates 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.259
 almost worrying because still 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.670
 6 and 15 seconds for the follies thought 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.780
 that's it when you think about it and v6 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.979
 so the shock must be when 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.580
 even pretty important so that's it 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.720
 still the line 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.310
 but you will be able to like that 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.720
 prevent the rescue so avoid 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.030
 accidents too serious I have no lighter 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.410
 a pen that draws in 3d yes it's my 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.400
 favorite invention but of those fifteen 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.900
 last days I think you'll see 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.190
 it's quite impressive a pen that 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.570
 draws in relief so you are you 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.300
 draw your little house and hop 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.890
 look awesome name to anything that's 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.110
 plastic makes it a plastic form 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.360
 ultra fast who knew himself very 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.770
 quickly coming out of this pen there is a 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.880
 small fan actually in the pen 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.800
 and you will be able to actually do 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.200
 all kinds of patterns drawn what 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.250
 you want I think children and 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.360
 the big kids I think will love 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.500
 so you can do little classes 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.060
 you can not have a child for them 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.440
 architects for architects aulas 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.880
 you will be able to make houses of 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.200
 little birds you go 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.340
 to be able to go around the Eiffel Tower if you 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.810
 so you want there is full full 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.610
 possible applications 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.959
 I find it pretty magical enough and I 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.240
 think that's the kind of thing that's going 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.740
 carton at next christmas for example this 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.920
 is not out yet but that the exit 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.090
 do not have it right now 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.090
 immediately if the pub thank you to all
