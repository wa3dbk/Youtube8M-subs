and try to get it with the releasing and

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.900 
and try to get it with the releasing and
bending<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:01.190> you<00:04:01.370> just<00:04:01.550> go<00:04:01.700> to<00:04:01.760> the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
bending and you just go to the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:10.940 
bending and you just go to the
fourteenth<00:04:02.300> fret<00:04:02.450> of<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:03.140> g<00:04:03.470> string

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.280 

and<00:04:11.950> you<00:04:12.100> hold<00:04:12.310> that<00:04:12.450> Roboto<00:04:13.450> for<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:14.080> really

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.279 

and<00:04:18.750> then<00:04:18.900> eventually<00:04:20.750> that's<00:04:21.750> just<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:22.049> bar

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
and then eventually that's just a bar

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.800 
and then eventually that's just a bar
over<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.710> 12th<00:04:23.009> fret<00:04:23.100> of<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.460> B<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:24.240> E<00:04:24.419> string

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
and then site open and then it goes into

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.510 
and then site open and then it goes into
this<00:04:31.380> little<00:04:31.530> riff<00:04:32.180> where<00:04:33.180> um<00:04:34.280> Couric<00:04:35.280> plays

this and you already know what that is

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:45.350 
this and you already know what that is
if<00:04:39.000> you<00:04:39.150> see<00:04:39.360> my<00:04:39.479> other<00:04:39.599> video<00:04:43.610> and<00:04:44.610> then<00:04:44.789> this

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
if you see my other video and then this

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.240 
if you see my other video and then this
part<00:04:45.599> I'm<00:04:45.810> really<00:04:46.080> not<00:04:46.199> sure<00:04:46.259> about<00:04:46.590> so<00:04:47.130> you're

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250
