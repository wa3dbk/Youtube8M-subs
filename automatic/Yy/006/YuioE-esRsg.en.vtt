00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
I think the guy i don't know probably

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.300 
I think the guy i don't know probably
walked<00:02:20.580> out<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.060> he<00:02:22.020> actually<00:02:22.170> gets<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.130> couple

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
walked out and he actually gets a couple

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.480 
walked out and he actually gets a couple
of<00:02:23.520> penalties<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.800> we're<00:02:26.010> gonna<00:02:26.100> check<00:02:26.340> it

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
out right now so the guy got actually

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.390

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
two flags right here gave me 10 yards i

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.949 
two flags right here gave me 10 yards i
don't<00:02:32.550> know<00:02:32.610> like<00:02:32.730> i<00:02:32.850> said<00:02:32.880> he<00:02:33.660> might<00:02:33.810> have

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
don't know like i said he might have

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.840 
don't know like i said he might have
maybe<00:02:34.440> done<00:02:34.590> something<00:02:35.400> he<00:02:35.459> was<00:02:35.610> doing

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
maybe done something he was doing

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.170 
maybe done something he was doing
something<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.390> he<00:02:36.959> left<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.230> game<00:02:37.260> running

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
something and he left the game running

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.900 
something and he left the game running
but<00:02:39.180> now<00:02:39.750> i<00:02:39.780> guess<00:02:40.080> he's<00:02:40.260> back<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:41.640> play<00:02:41.850> the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
but now i guess he's back to play the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.240 
but now i guess he's back to play the
actual<00:02:42.540> game<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:42.959> he<00:02:43.200> called<00:02:43.380> timeout<00:02:43.470> sees

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
actual game so he called timeout sees

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.000 
actual game so he called timeout sees
time<00:02:44.490> running<00:02:44.790> out<00:02:44.880> again<00:02:45.380> he's<00:02:46.380> gonna<00:02:46.530> adjust

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
time running out again he's gonna adjust

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.729 
time running out again he's gonna adjust
and<00:02:47.459> here<00:02:47.850> we<00:02:47.970> go<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:48.360> get<00:02:49.110> i<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.470> come<00:02:49.620> out
