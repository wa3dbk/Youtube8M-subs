one of these is a corresponding training

let's<00:01:49.860> look<00:01:50.009> at<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.159> first<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.640> escape<00:01:51.509> your

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
let's look at the first one escape your

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.670 
let's look at the first one escape your
dog<00:01:52.770> may<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.759> urge<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.030> escape<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:55.500> order

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
dog may have the urge to escape in order

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.340 
dog may have the urge to escape in order
to<00:01:55.860> get<00:01:56.130> something<00:01:56.430> explore<00:01:57.240> or<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:58.200> go

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
to get something explore or just go

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.959 
to get something explore or just go
somewhere<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.040> feel<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.310> vision<00:01:59.790> and

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
somewhere and just feel the vision and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.510 
somewhere and just feel the vision and
it's<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> very<00:02:00.450> common<00:02:00.869> scenario<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:02.130> biggest

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
it's a very common scenario the biggest

it's a very common scenario the biggest
hint<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:02.939> your<00:02:03.149> dog<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.360> digging<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.110> escape

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
hint that your dog is digging to escape

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.980 
hint that your dog is digging to escape
is<00:02:04.829> when<00:02:05.460> he<00:02:05.549> digs<00:02:05.759> along<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.119> fence<00:02:06.390> line<00:02:06.689> or

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
is when he digs along the fence line or

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.229 
is when he digs along the fence line or
under<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.409> fence<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.910> here<00:02:09.060> are<00:02:09.149> some

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
under the fence so here are some

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.420 
under the fence so here are some
recommendations<00:02:09.539> for<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.950> first<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.340> to

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
recommendations for that the first is to

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.250 
recommendations for that the first is to
install<00:02:11.730> chicken<00:02:12.120> wire<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.690> what<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.050> can<00:02:13.170> do

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
install chicken wire and what you can do

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.900 
install chicken wire and what you can do
is<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.440> can<00:02:13.560> line<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.040> bottom<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> fence

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
is you can line the bottom of the fence

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.240 
is you can line the bottom of the fence
with<00:02:15.180> chicken<00:02:15.510> wire<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:16.500> lays<00:02:16.739> about<00:02:16.980> two

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
with chicken wire that lays about two

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.250 
with chicken wire that lays about two
feet<00:02:17.520> from<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.849> fence<00:02:18.060> line<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.569> this<00:02:19.170> is

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
feet from the fence line and this is

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.380 
feet from the fence line and this is
gonna<00:02:19.379> stop<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.830> digging<00:02:20.160> in<00:02:20.310> no<00:02:20.520> time<00:02:20.760> your

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
gonna stop the digging in no time your

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.940 
gonna stop the digging in no time your
dog<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.840> going<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.020> be<00:02:22.140> deterred<00:02:22.560> by<00:02:22.590> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
dog is going to be deterred by the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.740 
dog is going to be deterred by the
feeling<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.520> chicken<00:02:23.879> wire<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.330> his<00:02:24.480> paws

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
feeling of the chicken wire on his paws

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.869 
feeling of the chicken wire on his paws
and<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.680> going<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.950> stop<00:02:26.160> him<00:02:26.370> before<00:02:26.459> any

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
and it's going to stop him before any

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.960 
and it's going to stop him before any
damage<00:02:27.209> is<00:02:27.569> done<00:02:27.840> now<00:02:28.770> initially<00:02:29.310> setting

this<00:02:30.120> up<00:02:30.300> will<00:02:30.540> take<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.810> few<00:02:30.989> hours<00:02:31.170> but<00:02:31.379> think

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
this up will take a few hours but think

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.530 
this up will take a few hours but think
of<00:02:32.459> all<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.640> time<00:02:32.849> you're<00:02:33.030> gonna<00:02:33.090> save<00:02:33.390> in

of all the time you're gonna save in

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.690 
of all the time you're gonna save in

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
ensure that the sharp edges of the wire

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.470 
ensure that the sharp edges of the wire
are<00:02:37.860> facing<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> opposite<00:02:39.030> side<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.300> the

next<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.769> want<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:52.950> try<00:02:53.099> burying<00:02:53.670> rocks<00:02:53.940> along

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
next you want to try burying rocks along

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.750 
next you want to try burying rocks along
the<00:02:54.480> base<00:02:54.660> line<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.170> fence<00:02:55.379> or<00:02:55.680> along<00:02:56.610> the

the base line of the fence or along the
ground<00:02:56.940> where<00:02:57.300> he's<00:02:57.599> digging<00:02:57.930> up<00:02:58.110> if<00:02:59.069> setting

ground where he's digging up if setting
up<00:02:59.610> chicken<00:02:59.909> wire<00:03:00.060> sounds<00:03:00.480> like<00:03:00.629> a<00:03:00.659> little<00:03:01.019> too

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
up chicken wire sounds like a little too

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.860 
up chicken wire sounds like a little too
much<00:03:01.290> work<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:02.430> just<00:03:02.610> implant<00:03:03.090> or<00:03:03.360> bury<00:03:03.540> rocks

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
much work you just implant or bury rocks

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.229 
much work you just implant or bury rocks
along<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.379> base<00:03:04.620> line<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.129> fence<00:03:05.400> your

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
along the base line of the fence your

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.210 
along the base line of the fence your
dog<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.599> going<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.870> give<00:03:06.989> up<00:03:07.140> quickly<00:03:07.470> when<00:03:08.129> he

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
dog is going to give up quickly when he

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.839 
dog is going to give up quickly when he
started<00:03:08.550> digging<00:03:08.879> right<00:03:09.330> into<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.659> rocks

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
started digging right into the rocks

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.309 
started digging right into the rocks
another<00:03:11.849> option<00:03:12.239> is<00:03:12.330> burying<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.870> fence<00:03:13.080> deep

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
another option is burying the fence deep

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.110 
another option is burying the fence deep
when<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.129> set<00:03:14.310> up<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.519> fence<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.909> want<00:03:15.060> to

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
when you set up the fence you want to

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.140 
when you set up the fence you want to
plant<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.569> base<00:03:15.750> two<00:03:16.260> feet<00:03:16.590> below<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.010> ground

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
plant the base two feet below the ground

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.000 
plant the base two feet below the ground
the<00:03:18.150> strategy<00:03:18.629> doesn't<00:03:18.930> necessarily<00:03:19.650> prevent

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
the strategy doesn't necessarily prevent
