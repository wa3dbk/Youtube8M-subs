00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300
 Ah ah ah 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.900
 How is that 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.820
 What is that 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:14.130
 I have many things to think about, but 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:17.250
 Hey, I have been told a lot of things recently, but separately 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:24.360
 I don't think who made music 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:26.360
 Oh, I really have a lot of pros and cons, but it's also good 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.650
 I think 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:36.650
 Though I think that I must not give you a lie, but I will not fall or fall a tree 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:39.310
 There is music there and there are a lot of people who are moved by listening to it 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.060
 Even though of course, it might have some people not it 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:46.410
 I think it might not be all but 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:51.810
 What does that mean-every day 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.960
 What in I think it would do not say things over there words to say wonder if there is to say 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.730
 you know 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.420
 There should be a lot of people who are really moved, but I think that's fine. 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.160
 but 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:08.860
 I wonder what that is like, but let me have something else to do with bread 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:12.980
 Like it is not young softening lie or horse a pretty good back and forth thing that would be another noisy 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:19.970
 Of course there is a part that says something or something, but 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:23.010
 Loch Ness and its music should be there if anyone else makes it and people should enjoy it 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:29.880
 I think it becomes 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:32.900
 The world is also the same of the present is not limited to Yappa Well again this is another song that you ever funny 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:41.330
 Stop talking and there are various worlds 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:43.640
 That's right, so I'm making entertainment, art, and various works. 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.170
 Many things are not 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.850
 I think it's good, though 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.100
 a 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:57.820
 That's why I think it's okay if you can't do that nesting 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:04.240
 That's what Golden Bomber is all about 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:06.930
 Do not fun people not sorry we have that out open up, is not it or monkfish 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.910
 Some do die of it all 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:14.420
 I think I'm sorry Namba 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:18.350
 It 's because every drama is beaten 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.980
 So that's why that 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:26.390
 I'm talking about 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:33.230
 I 'm playing I sing I'm singing I think I 'm going to go 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:38.180
 No , I think that the general public thinks that it is the correct answer if it is done because it is not this kind of thing at all 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.890
 Refrigerator's liked something recently Nea something nfl Ken Hey Oh Oh Oh half 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.739
 Time or anything at all 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:49.099
 Something I mean at all Ii' a it say I've done in the ah ah hand gesture 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:53.050
 It seems that I calculated it for entertainment . 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:58.840
 Say Now this is to say so I think Naa tiny 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.500
 I think in Do not become me if say I'm japanese so What specific 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.340
 Yeah 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:10.690
 I think it's cool, but I'll shake it along the side and do years from 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:16.540
 So, for example, the machine Datte with you I'm I eh of Good to flap softening 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:18.010
 There is nothing more to it if people can enjoy doing it by swinging it out more than selling it a lot 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.780
 I think 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:28.200
 However, we will never do it, but it is a commitment to say that it is a mouth pac 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:34.160
 Well, I think there are Erika and how to catch each one 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.160
 This is good if everyone can enjoy it, so I think it's important first
