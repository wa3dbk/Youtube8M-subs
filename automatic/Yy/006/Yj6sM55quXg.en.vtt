00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:15.320
 hello to all in this first video vi 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:18.289
 I will list the materials you need for 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.599
 start sewing as first thing I have 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.119
 always a re extension of at least 80 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.369
 centimeters and a team 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.610
 lari that the team serves for 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.099
 then draw the maximum moderates 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:35.180
 models to pack on any 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:38.059
 kind of thing bags but also garments of 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.270
 then fundamental a pair of clothing 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.300
 of fabric scissors then the scissors 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.630
 if I'm not here because of it 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.750
 door and from the grinder and mitchell e 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.579
 they want big and for fabric with le 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.110
 scissors for stefano we have to cut 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.230
 no other material 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.420
 so we must have a scissors 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.160
 pair of paper scissors for 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.129
 cut the model and a pair of scissors 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:09.259
 for the fabric with which we will speak only the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:13.280
 then fabric of the styles I put on 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:16.520
 this container with the speed 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.130
 there are various of various sizes are 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.979
 thinner ones for thin fabrics 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.209
 like a silk and normal spirits not 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.840
 for all other types of fabric 

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:28.789
 so vote from cotton to jeans then me 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.009
 I also bought the lazy portas this 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.649
 is from course you wear like a 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.579
 Bracelet and bet pins here 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:41.900
 practically all in plastic with the 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:47.000
 foam rubber support and inside there is a 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.430
 a polystyrene hemisphere then there is 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.110
 served adhesive tape 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.060
 I always have it because sometimes when 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.190
 the paper is not enough for the model 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.650
 I think that on the other hand it's not enough 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.990
 I have to attach a side piece then 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.130
 I always have the adhesive noses with me too 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.980
 adhesive tape looks like crap 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.610
 it takes the mat so what 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.320
 I show not that shiny one 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.620
 opaque for which we will be able to write 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.840
 above so if nasal will move between 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.000
 two pieces of paper and between two pieces of 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.920
 card any straight line must be drawn 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.930
 what can we write on this tape 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.000
 nothing on the tape the normal one no 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.040
 because nowadays it will undergo a district 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.070
 with dress to dress will be applied 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.350
 for making bows so if 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.720
 you just want to say change 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.990
 hinges do orly also to make of 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.070
 jordi can serve so it is always good 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.010
 having it also costs us very little 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.660
 it will cost t as euros already in several 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.140
 colors this is white but there is also 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.510
 I think pink and blue for this reason 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.830
 whites the sign of this is not 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.050
 would then see either the thread for basting or 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.470
 the coil spins this skein is 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.260
 slightly thinner and this the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.450
 spool but take for all this 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.190
 let's say it's better for fabrics 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.030
 thin as precisely and I told you before 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.430
 such as silk or always a 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.000
 a match to the master always for the 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.430
 clothing garment packaging 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.550
 or to give a quick check 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.070
 on the piece 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.900
 paper sell no dear we do not have 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.400
 behind the team because maybe 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.780
 bulky we measure with this thing the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.250
 via wife and children 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.610
 now here is only white fruits for 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.490
 in any case, heaven is made of cotton 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.020
 of synthetic these synthetic can 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.550
 a little more or more are much more 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.090
 resistant to mine I recommend you 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:52.760
 buy if these too I have 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:56.790
 always with me the braid of many colors 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.490
 and stylus is short let's say and I use this 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.530
 for this use terry small jobs ad 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.100
 example I have to stick a button here 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:08.160
 are all colors and thread already cut 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.290
 then obviously needles needles 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.020
 buy steel I recommend 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.880
 steel one hundred percent because i 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.450
 others who may buy that has less in the 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.850
 stores or 50 cents know less 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.180
 resistant and can be bent or 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:30.660
 break in hand and it's dangerous or me or 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:32.910
 she ltd 7 I use these to remove the 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.860
 Induction wire when the 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.470
 we baste and then cook over with the 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.780
 sewing machine the white thread this 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.690
 it is a clapping of hands in the midst of trust 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.910
 because being soft and separating 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.620
 then to remove it 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.390
 obviously Italian the segments and then or 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.810
 we take human from it very difficult 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.669
 because it intersects with the other wire 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.160
 or we have these tweezers can 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.630
 seduce or buy taken for 50 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.210
 cents and one euro 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:04.530
 in those stores that are selling 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:08.220
 let's just say then I'll do it 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.919
 see antonio porta war who has me 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:19.039
 gave my mommy potatoes 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:21.750
 padded and then opened it is pincushion 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:25.440
 castles and a small one small 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:31.949
 pocket slaughterhouse need and here is full 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:36.090
 of advice and then we need the 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:38.430
 fabrics I buy those for the odd jobs 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.340
 of home with proceeding to damage fabrics or 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.130
 ikea or from gs scampoli then 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.930
 meeting of the fabrics, let's say cotton 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:50.220
 100 percent to 45 euros per meter 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.440
 especially these of Ikea are a lot 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.909
 resistant so if we kill 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.389
 of the bags 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:59.849
 or shopping bags in 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:03.479
 anything I need 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:06.300
 resistance so maybe a bag for 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.849
 the expense is heavily loaded 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.159
 so precisely this summer here and always 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:14.580
 now I'll show you three that today 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:17.210
 the example below is this small e 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.210
 moline 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:34.669
 then I have this with the organs of the 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:39.039
 animals and the most beautiful with the baby and the 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:39.039
 viking that is below let's see if I can 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:49.059
 I'll make it here it may be you will fall 

00:06:45.859 --> 00:06:51.139
 because we will certainly do something 

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:53.899
 very important before starting to do 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:56.479
 any sewing work 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:58.489
 if you have natural fabrics then linen 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:01.639
 cotton you always have to wet the fabric 

00:06:58.489 --> 00:07:05.839
 first because it narrows therefore not 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:08.119
 maybe we want to spend some time for 

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:10.129
 escape a bag or anything else 

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:13.059
 and then once we have it yes 

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:15.979
 organize everything because the seams are 

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:18.199
 a certain distance then the fabric yes 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:19.879
 gets smaller then we take the 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:21.499
 verse we put in a basin 

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:22.749
 full of water 

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:26.599
 we can also put it 

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:29.029
 so quietly folded the 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:31.610
 we do well to soak the water 

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:33.589
 we leave five minutes and then we put it 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.559
 to spread once it is dry 

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:39.709
 we can begin to acquire what 

00:07:36.559 --> 00:07:42.889
 we want then for the moment it is everything 

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:45.289
 write me below comments such as 

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:48.409
 jobs you would like to see made by me 

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:53.149
 like changing a zipper to a corset a 

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:55.159
 trousers sew a model bag 

00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:56.299
 created by us based on ours 

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:58.879
 needs 

00:07:56.299 --> 00:08:00.259
 a post to cards maybe those casings i 

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:03.019
 supermarkets that we fail to 

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:03.679
 keep the wallet and many 

00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:06.679
 other things 

00:08:03.679 --> 00:08:08.179
 maybe yes what they reserve ask for 

00:08:06.679 --> 00:08:10.779
 moment is everything and see you at the next 

00:08:08.179 --> 00:08:10.779
 video
