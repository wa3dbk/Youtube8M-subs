00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.219 
it gets so messy and then when you run
out<00:02:02.920> of<00:02:03.070> snow<00:02:03.399> you<00:02:03.460> come<00:02:03.789> up<00:02:03.969> and<00:02:04.869> scoop<00:02:05.200> some

out of snow you come up and scoop some

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.330 
out of snow you come up and scoop some
more<00:02:05.590> again<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.500> you<00:02:08.560> add<00:02:08.769> a<00:02:08.799> little<00:02:09.070> more

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.750 
with condensed milk and it works so much
better<00:02:55.650> because<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.830> just<00:02:56.980> add<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.430> snow

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
better because you just add the snow

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
better because you just add the snow
with<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:59.850> condensed<00:03:00.850> milk<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.710> vanilla<00:03:02.710> so

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
with the condensed milk and vanilla so

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.910 
with the condensed milk and vanilla so
you<00:03:04.780> don't<00:03:04.960> have<00:03:05.020> that<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.410> milk<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.800> the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
you don't have that the milk and the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.840 
you don't have that the milk and the
sugar<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:08.440> basically<00:03:08.710> run<00:03:09.250> out<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.490> snow

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
sugar so I basically run out of snow

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.310 
sugar so I basically run out of snow
because<00:03:12.850> as<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.210> mix<00:03:13.510> it's<00:03:13.780> going<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.200> get

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
because as you mix it's going to get

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.350 
because as you mix it's going to get
smaller<00:03:14.650> they're<00:03:15.010> going<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.220> compact<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:19.180> once

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
smaller they're going to compact so once

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.440 
smaller they're going to compact so once
you're<00:03:19.450> done<00:03:19.600> mixing<00:03:19.860> add<00:03:20.860> your<00:03:21.730> milk<00:03:22.150> sorry

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
you're done mixing add your milk sorry

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.920 
you're done mixing add your milk sorry
now<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:27.730> just<00:03:27.880> get<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.270> to<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.540> consistency

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
now you just get it to the consistency

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.470 
now you just get it to the consistency
you<00:03:29.620> like<00:03:30.420> some<00:03:31.420> people<00:03:31.750> might<00:03:31.900> like<00:03:32.140> it

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
you like some people might like it

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.880 
you like some people might like it
wetter<00:03:34.480> um<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:36.810> actually<00:03:37.810> want<00:03:38.380> mine<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.860> be

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
wetter um I actually want mine to be

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:47.239 
wetter um I actually want mine to be
creamy

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:47.249 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:50.129 

so<00:03:48.249> you<00:03:48.340> know<00:03:48.700> if<00:03:48.819> I<00:03:48.969> like<00:03:49.209> pack<00:03:49.540> didn't<00:03:49.989> look

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
so you know if I like pack didn't look

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.119 
so you know if I like pack didn't look
at<00:03:50.319> that<00:03:50.530> coming<00:03:51.249> together<00:03:52.739> okay<00:03:53.739> like<00:03:53.920> the

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
at that coming together okay like the

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.330 
at that coming together okay like the
brown<00:03:54.340> spots<00:03:54.670> are<00:03:54.879> the<00:03:55.239> UM<00:03:56.129> vanilla

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
brown spots are the UM vanilla

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:08.780 
brown spots are the UM vanilla
I<00:03:57.579> can't<00:03:58.389> mix<00:03:58.569> this<00:03:58.719> very<00:03:58.780> well<00:03:59.290> one-handed

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.939 

and<00:04:09.790> then<00:04:10.389> take<00:04:10.629> a<00:04:10.659> cavity<00:04:13.169> mmm<00:04:14.609> perfect<00:04:15.690> and

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
and then take a cavity mmm perfect and

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.770 
and then take a cavity mmm perfect and
that's<00:04:17.949> how<00:04:18.160> you<00:04:18.220> make<00:04:18.519> snow<00:04:18.820> cream<00:04:19.120> now<00:04:19.389> so

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
that's how you make snow cream now so

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.089 
that's how you make snow cream now so
it's<00:04:19.900> all<00:04:20.019> mine<00:04:20.289> kind<00:04:20.590> of<00:04:20.620> compact<00:04:20.979> it

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
it's all mine kind of compact it

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.830
