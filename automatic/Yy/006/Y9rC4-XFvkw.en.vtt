from<00:00:47.309> watching<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.700> fire<00:00:48.030> crest<00:00:48.329> evolution

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
from watching the fire crest evolution

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.860 
from watching the fire crest evolution
videos<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.590> kind<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.950> website<00:00:50.480> also<00:00:51.480> some

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
videos on that kind of website also some

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.650 
videos on that kind of website also some
great<00:00:52.050> updates<00:00:52.440> for<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.070> hub<00:00:53.579> which<00:00:54.000> all<00:00:54.449> of

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
great updates for the hub which all of

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.380 
great updates for the hub which all of
the<00:00:54.750> wheels<00:00:54.899> will<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.390> Burien

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the wheels will get are the Burien

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.520 
the wheels will get are the Burien
placement<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:57.989> we've<00:00:58.079> done<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.410> we've

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
placement what we've done is we've

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.020 
placement what we've done is we've
actually<00:00:58.710> moved<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.370> non-drive<00:00:59.969> side

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
actually moved the non-drive side

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.330 
actually moved the non-drive side
bearing<00:01:00.629> out<00:01:00.870> seven<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> half<00:01:01.559> millimeters

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
bearing out seven and a half millimeters

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.950 
bearing out seven and a half millimeters
so<00:01:02.789> what<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.000> does<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.449> actually<00:01:03.539> gives<00:01:03.870> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
so what that does it actually gives you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.700 
so what that does it actually gives you
a<00:01:03.989> wider<00:01:04.320> more<00:01:04.710> stable<00:01:05.070> bracing<00:01:06.290> for<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> axle

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
a wider more stable bracing for the axle

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.160 
a wider more stable bracing for the axle
so<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.520> lot<00:01:08.880> wider<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.450> lot<00:01:09.600> stiffer<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.960> lot

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
so a lot wider or a lot stiffer a lot

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.109 
so a lot wider or a lot stiffer a lot
wider<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.560> well<00:01:10.740> also<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.610> sit<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
wider as well also we can sit in the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.179 
wider as well also we can sit in the
non-drive<00:01:12.659> side<00:01:12.720> spoke<00:01:13.350> angle<00:01:13.650> eight<00:01:13.830> degrees

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
non-drive side spoke angle eight degrees

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.890 
non-drive side spoke angle eight degrees
so<00:01:14.909> what<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.119> does<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> gives<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> better

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
so what that does it gives you a better

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.530 
so what that does it gives you a better
line<00:01:16.200> from<00:01:16.619> hub<00:01:16.950> flange<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> rim<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.270> more

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
line from hub flange to the rim so more

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.510 
line from hub flange to the rim so more
uniform<00:01:18.930> spoke<00:01:19.170> tension<00:01:19.409> over<00:01:20.189> all<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
uniform spoke tension over all the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.399 
uniform spoke tension over all the
wheels<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.000> we've<00:01:21.119> seen<00:01:21.299> over<00:01:21.540> seven

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
wheels that we've seen over seven

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.109 
wheels that we've seen over seven
percent<00:01:22.530> stiffness<00:01:23.369> gains<00:01:23.580> from<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
percent stiffness gains from the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.230 
percent stiffness gains from the
previous<00:01:24.810> generation<00:01:25.759> also<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.939> get<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
previous generation also you get the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.530 
previous generation also you get the
carbon<00:01:27.600> clincher<00:01:27.960> technology<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.860> which<00:01:29.100> is

also<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> particular<00:01:48.149> also<00:01:48.930> gets<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
also the particular also gets the the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.889 
also the particular also gets the the
fire<00:01:49.860> crest<00:01:50.189> from<00:01:50.280> shape<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:50.700> well<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.689> think

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
fire crest from shape as well so I think

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.240 
fire crest from shape as well so I think
a<00:01:52.140> lot<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.350> people<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.680> maybe<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
a lot of people have maybe the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.639 
a lot of people have maybe the
misconception<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.180> fire<00:01:55.020> crest<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.439> only

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
misconception that fire crest is only

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.800 
misconception that fire crest is only
for<00:01:56.159> carbon<00:01:56.549> clincher<00:01:56.909> fire<00:01:57.299> crest<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
for carbon clincher fire crest is the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.020 
for carbon clincher fire crest is the
room<00:01:57.960> shape<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.579> three<00:01:59.939> or

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
room shape so we have it on three or

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.899 
room shape so we have it on three or
three<00:02:00.090> carbons<00:02:00.540> Hunter<00:02:00.840> 303<00:02:01.829> tubular<00:02:02.310> four
