 public media but to see people as 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.740
 it is usually because we have 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.170
 surprises and we have explain 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.039
 special guests today are in 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.039
 several problems 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.800
 the day 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:43.590
 as it defends are the new look 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.600
 modalities eye attention of robberies in 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.490
 ATMs and cloning to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.470
 continuation the division staff of 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.170
 high tech police give the 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.240
 Peru gives us some important tips in 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.890
 these dates because there are too much broken 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.560
 It 's going to go one day 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.820
 until the cashier will take his balance and 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.710
 is going to realize that he is missing two thousand 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.700
 three thousand dollars three thousand soles 500 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.300
 Suns 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.920
 when he has been crowned without you 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.670
 has realized the night of the awards 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.360
 ahead 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.880
 ah 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.490
 new forms of theft in the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.790
 ATMs are working in front of 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.790
 our own face without realizing 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.430
 to you if I assure you that this 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.080
 device apparently so 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.090
 insignificant would be appropriating 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.090
 the key information of your card 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.300
 without silicone the criminal tries to 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.030
 manage to capture the 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.940
 information or that is light diffuser 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.010
 has inside a cell that 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.670
 record everything you do in the 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.860
 ATMs were also detected this type 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.790
 of devices that tried the same 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.610
 shape through this hole 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.260
 using this cell phone camera 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.240
 capture the information when one digital 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:15.140
 the key or the dni this supposedly 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.290
 in the teaching part it allows to illuminate the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.560
 exact cashier of this building a 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:28.770
 microcamera tried to adapt it to a 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:30.420
 cashier device this one is going to allow you 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.630
 create band information 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.560
 magnetic while in this we see a 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.150
 additional stake microcamera and that 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.159
 through this small hole 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.799
 will allow placed in the part 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:49.540
 top of the cashier observe when the 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.950
 client visit your key 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.069
 get comfortable and pay close attention 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.040
 because 'public enemies' does not search 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.500
 alarm but prevent you from being the 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.090
 next victim of the cloners of 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.939
 cards 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.950
 inside this plastic nozzle is 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:10.730
 added a magnetic stripe reader 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.159
 at the time of entering the card what 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.220
 is going to make this reader that is internal 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.720
 on the inside if it is to read all the 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.730
 information that is in this band 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.590
 magnetic and this memory will store 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.549
 the information this has an autonomy 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.829
 from a cell phone battery but this one 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.859
 device that acquires the information 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:33.769
 of the magnetic stripe on your card does not 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.379
 it's the only thing that criminals place 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.810
 in ATMs without the key of the 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.000
 card can not make any type 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.470
 of financial transaction and with the 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.909
 information of the magnetic strip that 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.730
 can do with the information of the 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.640
 magnetic stripe 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.810
 in the case of a debit card , nothing 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.569
 they use these cameras batteries 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.469
 recycled and any cell 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.180
 and what would become the microcamera 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:01.799
 should they try to additional in the 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.189
 top has to look for a 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:08.280
 cashier who does not have much vigilance that 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:11.129
 is somewhat remote that allows you in a 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.719
 un-public schedule in order to require 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:16.229
 of some time to add this 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:19.289
 paste this but there are also the 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.620
 skimmers know what the centers are 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:25.169
 commercials where generally 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.720
 these robberies happen in less than five 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:32.310
 seconds when someone is going to be a 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.740
 consumption in a restaurant in a 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.870
 personal disco that works on these 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.620
 establishments can be captured by 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.750
 these bands and deliver this to you 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.210
 knows with the name of corner that 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.110
 also captures information from the 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.660
 band 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.670
 it's easy to try a fake keyboard in 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.250
 this case the keyboard is at the level of 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.950
 cashier if it were a fake keyboard what 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.420
 let's find about the post 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.820
 High division staff 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.890
 police technology provides the 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.070
 following recommendations to avoid 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.730
 that you fall into the trap of these 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.800
 evildoers we reiterate the 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:14.250
 recommendations always cover with the 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.040
 another hand when we visit the key or the 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.500
 dni is more inclusive in this case the 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.040
 The nation's bank has added this 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.410
 which is fixed 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.990
 that will not allow all to be seen 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.850
 the numbers we see an ATM that he 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.610
 provides security because everything is 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.200
 integrated into the cashier there is nothing about 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.200
 the post your answer that you can 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.510
 move everything is fixed remember that the 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.670
 passengers are looking for new modalities 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:44.260
 to commit criminal acts since 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:48.480
 unfortunately these cloners 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.480
 cards do not go to prison 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.000
 very dangerous we have to take them 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.819
 all possible precautions do not have 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.039
 afraid to go into the cashier to check on 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:01.780
 see if there is a possible keyboard 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.780
 superimposed to look back the boarding school 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:09.759
 your password 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:12.550
 it seems impolite the key to winning and 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:14.470
 pay and cover the key I think it's part 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.940
 of metal was a consumer flip and 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.340
 saying that you are very close you can 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.669
 leave yourself a little if it only looks like 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.669
