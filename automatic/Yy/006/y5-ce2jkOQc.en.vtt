again we paid so much these bastards
that<00:06:14.370> I<00:06:14.669> think<00:06:15.479> that<00:06:15.630> we<00:06:15.750> could<00:06:15.930> be<00:06:17.030> plenty<00:06:18.030> of

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
that I think that we could be plenty of

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.090 
that I think that we could be plenty of
dead<00:06:18.300> people<00:06:18.539> I<00:06:21.289> honestly<00:06:22.289> don't<00:06:22.470> know<00:06:22.590> what

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
dead people I honestly don't know what

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.950 
dead people I honestly don't know what
is<00:06:23.220> happening<00:06:23.250> that<00:06:23.669> day<00:06:23.820> but<00:06:24.240> I'm<00:06:24.600> sure<00:06:24.840> they

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
is happening that day but I'm sure they

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:56.900 
is happening that day but I'm sure they
would<00:06:25.169> be<00:06:54.800> most<00:06:55.800> viable<00:06:56.039> firms<00:06:56.490> hate<00:06:56.760> each

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
would be most viable firms hate each

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.270 
would be most viable firms hate each
other<00:06:57.180> but<00:06:57.900> then<00:06:58.050> most<00:06:58.199> wobble<00:06:58.650> firms<00:06:58.919> haven't

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 
other but then most wobble firms haven't

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.620 
other but then most wobble firms haven't
been<00:06:59.400> to<00:06:59.580> war<00:07:01.940> the<00:07:02.940> memories<00:07:03.389> and<00:07:03.510> experiences

of that war are still fresh it was only
15<00:07:07.260> years<00:07:07.289> ago<00:07:07.680> so<00:07:08.430> I<00:07:08.490> can<00:07:08.639> understand<00:07:09.090> why

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
15 years ago so I can understand why

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.320 
15 years ago so I can understand why
feelings<00:07:09.750> of<00:07:09.870> hatred<00:07:10.080> remain<00:07:10.820> these<00:07:11.820> feelings
