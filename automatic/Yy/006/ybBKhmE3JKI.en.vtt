Sarah<00:00:48.840> b.net<00:00:49.399> which<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.850> use<00:00:51.390> all<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.660> time<00:00:52.520> and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
Sarah b.net which I use all the time and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.000 
Sarah b.net which I use all the time and
I<00:00:53.820> actually<00:00:53.940> use<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:55.020> most<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
I actually use that for most of the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.369 
I actually use that for most of the
video<00:00:56.370> um<00:00:59.149> but<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.829> route<00:01:02.129> 6<00:01:02.489> um<00:01:03.379> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
video um but it's it's in route 6 um and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.990 
video um but it's it's in route 6 um and
when<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.710> says<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.129> two<00:01:05.339> seem<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.610> get<00:01:05.850> along

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
when it says the two seem to get along

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.469 
when it says the two seem to get along
there's<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.080> very<00:01:07.320> high<00:01:07.409> chance<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:08.130> an<00:01:08.850> egg

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
there's a very high chance that an egg

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.710 
there's a very high chance that an egg
will<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.869> their<00:01:10.400> first<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.880> goodra<00:01:12.420> with

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
will be their first one is goodra with

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.710 
will be their first one is goodra with
poison<00:01:13.290> tail<00:01:13.700> I'm<00:01:14.700> kind<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> confused<00:01:15.240> why

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
poison tail I'm kind of confused why

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.710 
poison tail I'm kind of confused why
goodra<00:01:16.350> didn't<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.369> any<00:01:17.909> poison<00:01:18.479> moves

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
goodra didn't have any poison moves

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.260 
goodra didn't have any poison moves
because<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.470> know<00:01:19.500> all<00:01:19.909> slime<00:01:20.909> and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
because it's you know all slime and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.480 
because it's you know all slime and
stuff<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.680> you'd<00:01:23.100> get<00:01:23.400> him<00:01:23.670> from<00:01:23.909> skrelp

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
stuff but you'd get him from skrelp

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.140 
stuff but you'd get him from skrelp
number<00:01:26.490> nine<00:01:26.729> aurorus<00:01:27.600> discharge<00:01:28.759> it's<00:01:29.759> not

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
number nine aurorus discharge it's not

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.260 
number nine aurorus discharge it's not
as<00:01:30.450> useful<00:01:30.930> because<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.680> learn<00:01:32.270> electric

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
as useful because you can learn electric
