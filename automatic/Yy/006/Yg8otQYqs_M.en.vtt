00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
okay four apartments on the fourth floor

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.800 
okay four apartments on the fourth floor
but<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.640> elevator<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.120> broken<00:00:06.150> so<00:00:06.690> you're

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
but the elevator is broken so you're

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.150 
but the elevator is broken so you're
gonna<00:00:06.899> have<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.080> are<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.440> just<00:00:07.589> gonna<00:00:07.649> be<00:00:07.770> done

gonna have to are you just gonna be done

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.720 
gonna have to are you just gonna be done
okay<00:00:08.400> cool<00:00:08.820> thanks<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:10.340> guess<00:00:11.340> we'll<00:00:11.700> just

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
okay cool thanks I guess we'll just

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.010 
okay cool thanks I guess we'll just
bring<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.090> up<00:00:12.150> ourselves<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.750> hardly<00:00:13.500> think<00:00:13.860> so

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
bring it up ourselves I hardly think so

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.920 
bring it up ourselves I hardly think so
why<00:00:16.020> not<00:00:16.369> well<00:00:17.369> we<00:00:17.640> don't<00:00:17.820> have<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> dolly<00:00:18.510> or

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
why not well we don't have a dolly or

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.080 
why not well we don't have a dolly or

we<00:00:23.609> don't<00:00:23.760> need<00:00:23.910> strength<00:00:24.480> we're<00:00:24.779> physicists

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
we don't need strength we're physicists

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.710 
we don't need strength we're physicists
we<00:00:26.130> are<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.460> intellectual<00:00:26.939> descendants<00:00:27.599> of

we are the intellectual descendants of
Archimedes<00:00:28.170> give<00:00:28.560> me<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.680> fulcrum<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> lever

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
Archimedes give me a fulcrum the lever

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.830 
Archimedes give me a fulcrum the lever
and<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.670> can<00:00:29.699> move<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.210> earth<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.689> just

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and I can move the earth it's just

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.000 
and I can move the earth it's just
America<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.380> don't<00:00:31.560> have<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.920> love<00:00:32.099> that

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
America I don't have this I love that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:42.369 
America I don't have this I love that
Archimedes<00:00:35.010> would<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.640> proud

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.979 

do<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.590> any<00:00:43.710> ideas<00:00:44.480> yes<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:45.750> they<00:00:45.840> all

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
do you have any ideas yes but they all

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.270 
do you have any ideas yes but they all
involve<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.350> green<00:00:46.530> lantern<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> power<00:00:47.280> ring

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
involve a green lantern and a power ring

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:58.580 
involve a green lantern and a power ring
easy<00:00:50.809> easy<00:00:51.809> okay<00:00:56.809> now<00:00:57.809> we've<00:00:58.020> got<00:00:58.050> an<00:00:58.230> inclined

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
easy easy okay now we've got an inclined

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.619 
easy easy okay now we've got an inclined
plane<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.430> force<00:00:59.670> required<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.090> lift<00:01:00.300> is

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
plane the force required to lift is

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.029 
plane the force required to lift is
reduced<00:01:00.989> by<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.320> sine<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.739> angle<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
reduced by the sine of the angle the

reduced by the sine of the angle the
stairs<00:01:02.370> called<00:01:02.670> 30<00:01:02.879> degrees<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:03.719> half

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
stairs called 30 degrees so about half

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:15.520 
stairs called 30 degrees so about half
exactly<00:01:05.580> half<00:01:07.580> exactly<00:01:08.580> hit<00:01:10.130> let's<00:01:11.130> push<00:01:14.060> okay

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
exactly half exactly hit let's push okay

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.109 
exactly half exactly hit let's push okay
