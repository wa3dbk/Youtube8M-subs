00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello everyone you play and and if you 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.450
 watch this video means you somehow 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.790
 the wind blew gray on my channel 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.889
 abode and until you closed you saw i 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.130
 I will try to quickly explain what I 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.830
 I work on this my channel I work 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.930
 in two ways the first is gaming 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.930
 I do a review I do not review 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.019
 I do not do the passage I do not do the first 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.150
 impressions i do reviews in advance 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.080
 prepared text script as 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.090
 want to call 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.040
 important however you need to know two things 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.770
 first on my channel you will not meet 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.680
 reviews of games like call of duty and 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.450
 battlefield assassin's creed krayzis and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.270
 you get the idea why in the first place, I think 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.800
 that the internet is full of people without me 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.870
 which will decompose nicely 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.379
 bones these games will make it much 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.359
 faster than the second i'm not just 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.460
 I am not interested in telling them 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.019
 told and games which 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.590
 really catching something 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.100
 Mostly this either games which press 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.560
 bypasses either the press does not bypass 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.600
 their attention a lot of people most 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.520
 people still have them 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.240
 representations such that as my speaks 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.490
 friend, and this is again worth not shit playing 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.500
 yes I play my thread and shit here 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.110
 and so therefore this is my video 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.060
 watch 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.120
 In the future, in addition to reviews, I do not miss 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.530
 opportunity streams but look for 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.380
 you need to reach the audience first 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.060
 until it makes sense i wo n't play 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.700
 the direction here is finished second 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.970
 the direction is cry pistols themselves 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.710
 what's the idea do i take reject and famous 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.830
 kripipastu either hood 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.470
 author unknown more often everything on 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.350
 English translate into Russian and 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.600
 voiced add all sorts of special effects 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.690
 to sound atmospheric and spread 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.040
 after some such rejection let's say 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.090
 only on yu tuba 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.209
 because because Gladiolus in to 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.310
 rather certainly not very often you are whole 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.850
 krupskaya is not very often understandable 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.800
 reasons 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.870
 lining the story is released infrequently because 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.489
 that there is a mountain of mounting and need to find 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.709
 interesting really interesting 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.810
 the story 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.540
 review and because i'm reviewing on 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.060
 catchy games and catchy games sorry 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.770
 very few, respectively, and did a review 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.020
 and then when I find something about 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.110

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.459
