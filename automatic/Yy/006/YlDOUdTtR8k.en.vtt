00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
okay so this is Cateye SL LD 120 to get

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.440 
okay so this is Cateye SL LD 120 to get
this<00:00:10.050> bird<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.070> earth<00:00:11.190> like<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.580> just

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
this bird to the earth like this just

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.480 
this bird to the earth like this just
was<00:00:13.080> reminded<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.710> today<00:00:14.190> when<00:00:14.370> I

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
was reminded of today when I

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.129 
was reminded of today when I
accidentally<00:00:14.940> step<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.450> one<00:00:15.660> lane<00:00:15.870> of

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
accidentally step on one lane of

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.810 
accidentally step on one lane of
Florence<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.830> decided<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.310> take<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> look

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
Florence so I decided to take a look

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.580 
Florence so I decided to take a look
what's<00:00:18.449> inside<00:00:20.119> this<00:00:21.119> was<00:00:21.330> what's<00:00:21.570> inside<00:00:22.880> me

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
what's inside this was what's inside me

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.200 
what's inside this was what's inside me
so<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.890> casing<00:00:26.510> basically<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:28.439> just<00:00:29.210> this

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
so the casing basically is just this

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.410 
so the casing basically is just this
little<00:00:30.449> thing<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.980> cap<00:00:32.250> there's<00:00:33.059> no

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
little thing and the cap there's no

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.569 
little thing and the cap there's no
there's<00:00:34.200> no<00:00:34.260> thread<00:00:34.680> or<00:00:35.070> anything<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.550> just

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.319 

just<00:00:41.579> pull<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.600> off<00:00:43.610> and<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.640> hold<00:00:45.090> stock

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
just pull it off and just hold stock

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.920 
just pull it off and just hold stock
exchanges<00:00:50.510> but

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.750 

and<00:00:54.930> I'm<00:00:55.260> actually<00:00:55.440> surprised<00:00:56.070> by<00:00:56.309> how<00:00:56.520> much

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and I'm actually surprised by how much

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.779 
and I'm actually surprised by how much
batteries<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:57.539> there<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.079> was<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.350> I

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
batteries in here there it was like I

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.720 
batteries in here there it was like I
thought<00:00:59.789> there<00:01:00.000> would<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.559> one<00:01:01.559> tiny<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
thought there would be like one tiny and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.870 
thought there would be like one tiny and
battery<00:01:03.379> but<00:01:04.379> there<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.250> quite<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.580> bit<00:01:05.850> of

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
battery but there is quite a bit of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.270 
battery but there is quite a bit of
lithium<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.229> which<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.590> super<00:01:07.710> swell

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
lithium and in here which is super swell

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.410 
lithium and in here which is super swell
I<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:09.619> but<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.460> lasts<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.240> long

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
I like but you know this lasts a long

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.690 
I like but you know this lasts a long
time<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.720> never<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.350> replace<00:01:13.680> them<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.250> mean

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
time I never really replace them I mean

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.270 
time I never really replace them I mean
I<00:01:14.939> upgraded<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.659> whole<00:01:15.810> light<00:01:16.140> before<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.740> I

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
I upgraded the whole light before I I

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.920 
I upgraded the whole light before I I
mean<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.670> was<00:01:17.820> still<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> original<00:01:18.570> battery

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.620 

but<00:01:21.590> anyway<00:01:21.920> when<00:01:22.190> I<00:01:22.220> when<00:01:22.820> I<00:01:22.850> saw<00:01:23.150> this<00:01:23.360> this

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
but anyway when I when I saw this this

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.960 
but anyway when I when I saw this this
led<00:01:24.080> inside<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:24.860> I<00:01:24.890> realized<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.790> is

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
led inside that I realized that this is

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.540 
led inside that I realized that this is
a<00:01:26.050> good<00:01:27.050> opportunity<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.770> do<00:01:28.040> a<00:01:28.070> direct

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
a good opportunity to do a direct

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.310 
a good opportunity to do a direct
comparison<00:01:28.610> with<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.540> brightness<00:01:29.930> of<00:01:30.050> Mont

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
comparison with the brightness of Mont

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.000 
comparison with the brightness of Mont
collector<00:01:30.910> this<00:01:31.910> is<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.210> one<00:01:32.360> collection

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
collector this is the one collection

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.000 
collector this is the one collection
right<00:01:34.150> and<00:01:35.150> what<00:01:35.600> when<00:01:35.900> when<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.590> lights<00:01:36.800> hit

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
right and what when when the lights hit

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.790 
right and what when when the lights hit
that<00:01:37.750> this<00:01:38.750> G<00:01:39.020> song<00:01:39.380> right<00:01:40.190> with<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:40.880> reflector

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
that this G song right with a reflector

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.590 
that this G song right with a reflector
just<00:01:42.800> like<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.670> wouldn't<00:01:43.940> be<00:01:44.000> a<00:01:44.120> direct

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
just like it wouldn't be a direct

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.920 
just like it wouldn't be a direct
comparison<00:01:46.030> to<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.150> brightness<00:01:47.540> of<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.780> mine

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
comparison to the brightness of the mine

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.750 
comparison to the brightness of the mine
collection<00:01:48.440> because<00:01:48.680> we<00:01:48.890> would<00:01:49.040> be<00:01:49.190> comparing

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
collection because we would be comparing

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.340 
collection because we would be comparing
like<00:01:50.690> naked<00:01:51.560> LEDs<00:01:52.160> to<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.790> reflector<00:01:53.350> or

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
like naked LEDs to the reflector or

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.810 
like naked LEDs to the reflector or
rather<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.890> diffuser<00:01:56.530> but<00:01:57.530> since<00:01:58.250> it's<00:01:58.460> out

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
rather the diffuser but since it's out

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.200 
rather the diffuser but since it's out
here<00:01:59.300> we<00:02:00.200> can<00:02:00.380> compare<00:02:00.800> more<00:02:01.130> it's<00:02:01.640> okay<00:02:02.030> this

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
here we can compare more it's okay this

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:10.469 
here we can compare more it's okay this
is<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:03.220> low<00:02:06.009> this<00:02:07.009> is<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.399> high<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.830> I<00:02:09.830> mean

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
is a low this is the high and I mean

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.640 
is a low this is the high and I mean
probably<00:02:11.319> till<00:02:13.080> there's<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.170> pretty<00:02:14.409> big

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
probably till there's a pretty big

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.600 
probably till there's a pretty big
difference<00:02:15.549> in<00:02:16.060> violence<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:18.190> if<00:02:18.340> I'm<00:02:18.580> not

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
difference in violence and if I'm not

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.729 
difference in violence and if I'm not
how<00:02:19.090> they<00:02:19.450> managed<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.989> make<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.349> dim

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
how they managed to make it this dim

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.369 
how they managed to make it this dim
like<00:02:21.340> based<00:02:22.000> on<00:02:22.209> how<00:02:22.360> timidness<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.170> thought

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
like based on how timidness I thought

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.520 
like based on how timidness I thought
that<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.769> better<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.400> problem<00:02:24.760> much<00:02:24.970> more

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
that the better the problem much more

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:34.650 
that the better the problem much more
but<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:28.420> battery<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:30.010> like<00:02:33.239> should<00:02:34.239> be<00:02:34.390> enough

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
but the battery is like should be enough

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.100 
but the battery is like should be enough
to<00:02:35.019> make<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.230> bright<00:02:35.940> damn<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.410> mean<00:02:38.410> maybe<00:02:38.799> maybe

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
to make a bright damn I mean maybe maybe

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.880 
to make a bright damn I mean maybe maybe
it<00:02:41.110> was<00:02:41.290> brighter<00:02:41.620> than<00:02:41.799> you<00:02:43.140> but<00:02:44.140> doesn't

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
it was brighter than you but doesn't

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.970 
it was brighter than you but doesn't
show<00:02:45.069> any<00:02:45.310> indication<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:47.500> batteries

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
show any indication that the batteries

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.039 
show any indication that the batteries
run<00:02:48.220> down<00:02:48.250> like<00:02:48.879> how<00:02:49.090> would<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.390> know<00:02:49.629> that

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
run down like how would I know that

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.780 
run down like how would I know that
let's<00:02:50.920> say<00:02:51.099> if<00:02:51.370> this<00:02:51.579> is<00:02:51.810> sodium<00:02:53.579> because<00:02:54.579> the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
let's say if this is sodium because the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.680 
let's say if this is sodium because the
battery<00:02:55.239> fault

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
battery fault
