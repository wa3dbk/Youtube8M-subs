00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
was about a year ago I decided that I

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.640 
was about a year ago I decided that I
was<00:03:28.880> going<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.269> stop<00:03:29.510> doing<00:03:29.780> YouTube<00:03:30.260> for

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
pretty much forever and that was because

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.780 
pretty much forever and that was because
I<00:03:33.200> was<00:03:33.470> merely<00:03:33.650> posting<00:03:34.190> call<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.489> duty<00:03:34.760> and

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
I was merely posting call of duty and

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.420 
I was merely posting call of duty and
Grand<00:03:35.180> Theft<00:03:35.269> Auto<00:03:35.450> my<00:03:35.720> old<00:03:35.930> channel<00:03:36.250> but<00:03:37.250> i

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
was playing league a lot and i didn't

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.990

because I knew that if people started

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.130 
because I knew that if people started
watching<00:03:43.850> that<00:03:44.000> they<00:03:44.180> would<00:03:44.299> get<00:03:44.450> mad<00:03:44.690> saying

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
to go through the stress of reading all

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.039 
to go through the stress of reading all
those<00:03:52.549> comments<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:53.299> having<00:03:53.930> people

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
those comments and having people

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.229 
those comments and having people
unsubscribed<00:03:54.950> for<00:03:55.310> no<00:03:55.400> random<00:03:55.730> reason<00:03:55.880> just

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
unsubscribed for no random reason just

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.520 
unsubscribed for no random reason just
because<00:03:56.269> they<00:03:56.630> didn't<00:03:56.870> see<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.079> game<00:03:57.350> that

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
because they didn't see the game that

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.140 
because they didn't see the game that
they<00:03:57.620> wanted<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:58.010> see<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.430> so<00:03:58.820> I<00:03:58.850> stopped
