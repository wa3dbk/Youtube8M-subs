x3<00:00:04.560> here<00:00:04.920> i<00:00:04.950> got<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.160> pie<00:00:05.310> i<00:00:05.339> gotta<00:00:05.609> figure<00:00:05.970> out

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
x3 here i got a pie i gotta figure out

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.909 
x3 here i got a pie i gotta figure out
where<00:00:06.270> on<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.509> keyboard<00:00:06.899> save<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:07.890> load

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
where on the keyboard save and load

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.530 
where on the keyboard save and load
state<00:00:08.309> whatnot<00:00:08.639> are<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.849> guess<00:00:08.910> load<00:00:09.240> state<00:00:09.420> is

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
state whatnot are I guess load state is

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.730 
state whatnot are I guess load state is
f<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:09.929> something<00:00:10.200> like<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.410> move<00:00:10.679> the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
f for something like that move the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.940 
f for something like that move the
microphone<00:00:11.059> better<00:00:12.059> better<00:00:12.389> position

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
microphone better better position

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.529 
microphone better better position
alright<00:00:14.150> so<00:00:15.150> let's<00:00:15.870> just<00:00:16.080> um<00:00:17.090> should<00:00:18.090> we<00:00:18.119> yeah

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
it was good myself but I think it got a

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.460 
it was good myself but I think it got a
lot<00:01:01.579> of<00:01:01.640> criticism<00:01:02.680> for<00:01:03.680> just<00:01:04.250> for<00:01:05.000> just<00:01:05.030> being

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
lot of criticism for just for just being

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.469
