00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.130
 April 24 in many cities of Russia 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.950
 are public and political 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.960
 stocks and funeral evenings in Moscow 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.880
 in the morning at the invitation of the union of Armenians 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.070
 Russia gathered at the Turkish Embassy 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.590
 representatives of Armenian organizations 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.390
 the army is not Moscow since 1990 holds 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.130
 this principal picket near the walls to go 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.960
 representation of Turkey but with each 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.859
 the year to keep this tradition becomes 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.989
 all harder and harder and hindered 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.000
 cultural for Armenians of Russia 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.950
 it is crucial to have this 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.809
 picket Turkish diplomats in turn 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.059
 try their best to prevent 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.100
 organizing picket but still every time 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.079
 Union of Armenians of Russia manages to get 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.820
 official consent of the authorities to 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.450
 come here and demand from the Turks 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.450
 recognition of the genocide 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.640
 holding picket strictly 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.620
 regulated by law 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.660
 Russian Federation is prohibited here 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.640
 use sound amplifying equipment 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.320
 and so the picketers did not spare their 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.830
 class ligaments to convey to 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.720
 addressee your main message also 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.250
 picketers were actively discussing the message 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.409
 turkey prime minister on eve 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.210
 anniversary of the Armenians of Russia 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.729
 there is a clear position on this 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.009
 question political games that put 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.909
 doubt the fact of genocide is unacceptable and 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.070
 unacceptable popular position for 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.500
 we understand everything here we have 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.350
 absolutely clear evidence 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.130
 crimes and for us there is no need 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.049
 create 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.210
 one more it would be a commission in order 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.150
 to wind up from the question the day before 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.580
 anniversary century 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.580
 This commission let it is created in Turkey 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.670
 to the Turks themselves who understand you 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.740
 it organized it organized why 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.510
 they organized it here are some 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.670
 Turkish politicians say it was 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.620
 initiated by germany here let them 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.750
 themselves understand Armenian Turkish 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.090
 commission so much she absolutely 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.090
 meaningless to nafani acceptable 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.370
 my paternal grandparents 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.650
 lines were from corsa by maternal and 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.320
 called and where ever I live I remember that I 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.420
 son and grandson of Van medicals my Armenians 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.300
 children and grandchildren, too, must remember this and I 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.490
 I hope that we all Armenians will leave Moscow 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.950
 paris and new york to return to kars 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.560
 you and our other cities and villages science 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.780
 Once york from chong raven we are Armenians 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.580
 never forget the atrocities of the turks no 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.800
 words to describe their actions but i 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.600
 convinced that sooner or later they should 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.160
 recognize the genocide the Turks never 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.230
 will correct not change 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.260
 Anyway, Turkish politics 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.580
 why because their policies concern 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.360
 was built on blood on the foundation and 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.250
 made from coffee 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.540
 christian armenian greek so 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.150
 further and recognize the genocide of the armenians 12 others 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.250
 Christian nations is to recognize that 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.890
 your foundation is unreliable that it can 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.739
 any moment pour in therefore not in their 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.440
 interests recognized in my opinion very 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.130
 it is important that 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.220
 Turkish society understood networks 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.010
 was taken sins who committed 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.680
 in relation to other nations because 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.819
 recognition of their mistakes is the only 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.640
 the right way seems to me for the future on 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.439
 Turkish Turkish people bye youth 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.569

 occupied by the first world war and staged 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.080
 it's scary 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.020

 the crime still hasn't given the world 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.040
 appreciation although so many parliaments 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:39.030
