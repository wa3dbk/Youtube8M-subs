and then I got automatic pulse air so at

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.350 
and then I got automatic pulse air so at
every<00:00:37.050> 30<00:00:37.469> seconds<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.219> pulses<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.850> filter

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
every 30 seconds it pulses the filter
