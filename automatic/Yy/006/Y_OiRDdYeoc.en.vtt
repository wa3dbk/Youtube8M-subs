00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 in this opportunity we are going to solve a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.940
 division of a large number between a 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.650
 small number expressed in notation 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.150
 scientific for it we write this 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.150
 number in scientific notation 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:24.689
 7.74 by 10 as the coma has been put 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:26.910
 here we count 1 2 3 4 figures by 10 to the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.070
 quarter 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.560
 that we can also write about this 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.560
 mode between 3 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.930
 for 10 as the tenth comma we have 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:45.100
 put here we count 12 by 10 at least 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:52.180
 2 to effect this division then 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:57.820
 we divide these two numbers 7,74 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.850
 for 3-6 in this case if we 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.090
 we do online 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:08.060
 in the calculator the result comes out 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:11.780
 2 15 by 10 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.090
 here we apply the property of the laws 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:20.020
 of exponents of equal bases that says 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:23.750
 that the m / a the n is equal to the m - 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:29.810
 Then, as we have two bases 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:33.180
 same is 10 raised to 4 - minus 2 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:39.270
 What is all this 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:43.590
 then this will be 2 15 by 10 to the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:49.800
 fourth minus for less gives plus 2 so 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:53.610
 so much this will be 2.15 by 10 to the sixth and 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.280
 this is finally our result of 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.800
 multiply these two numbers one very 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.800
 big between another very small
