00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.939 
notice bad they already went through
like<00:04:30.310> this<00:04:30.970> card<00:04:31.270> or<00:04:31.539> whatever<00:04:31.770> because<00:04:32.770> it's

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
like this card or whatever because it's

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.640 
like this card or whatever because it's
in<00:04:33.099> the<00:04:33.250> context<00:04:33.910> of<00:04:34.030> two<00:04:34.210> cards<00:04:34.630> so<00:04:35.080> there's

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
in the context of two cards so there's

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.960 
in the context of two cards so there's
dolphin<00:04:36.070> attention<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.460> show<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.849> them

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
dolphin attention to show to them

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.990 
dolphin attention to show to them
quickly<00:04:37.180> like<00:04:37.419> this<00:04:37.599> is<00:04:37.720> current<00:04:38.080> no<00:04:38.440> okay<00:04:39.009> so

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
quickly like this is current no okay so

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.150 
quickly like this is current no okay so
now<00:04:40.150> you<00:04:40.570> have<00:04:40.780> these<00:04:41.849> pretty<00:04:42.849> much<00:04:43.650> if<00:04:44.650> you're

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
now you have these pretty much if you're

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.700 
now you have these pretty much if you're
hitting<00:04:45.460> it<00:04:45.580> like<00:04:45.990> way<00:04:46.990> too<00:04:47.050> hard<00:04:47.470> they'll

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
hitting it like way too hard they'll

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.930 
hitting it like way too hard they'll
fall<00:04:48.130> down<00:04:48.400> when<00:04:49.270> you<00:04:49.419> hold<00:04:49.690> it<00:04:49.810> like<00:04:49.840> this<00:04:49.960> but

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
fall down when you hold it like this but

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.170 
fall down when you hold it like this but
usually<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.120> last<00:04:52.360> card<00:04:53.160> will<00:04:54.160> stay<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.669> so

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
usually the last card will stay and so

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.540 
usually the last card will stay and so
