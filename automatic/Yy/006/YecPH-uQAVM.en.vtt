frying<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:58.610> guess<00:02:58.820> you<00:02:58.940> could<00:02:58.970> say<00:02:59.300> over

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
frying I guess you could say over

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.110

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
little bit more thoroughly and give it a

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.039

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
little bit of a charred flavor so you've

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.110
