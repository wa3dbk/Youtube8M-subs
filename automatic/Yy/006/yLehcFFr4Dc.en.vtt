00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.600
 hello kids that kind of welcome 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.269
 to a new tekken tag video 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.670
 tournament 2 good many of you 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.470
 you have always asked how I do 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.109
 electric according or how I take the 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.240
 command now I'm going to make a video with the 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.730
 command and then I'll do another one with the arcade 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.760
 but concretely good as the last 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.980
 video that uploaded played with command 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.809
 I will try to explain to you how I catch myself 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.539
 the command to start do not play with 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.329
 configuration because I do not like try 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:41.000
 to emulate let's say the arcade when by 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.430
 circumstances because I play with pad 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.829
 if you notice this is the position in the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.380
 that I take the command look at my hand my 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.640
 left hand holds the command by 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:55.340
 below and that's how I got it from 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.920
 agreement supported on my right knee and 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.460
 I do not play with a finger game with these 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.219
 two if you notice you tried to emulate let's say 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.680
 what is the arcade I will try 

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:09.200
 explain a little good I personally 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.210
 as I do the wing office according to the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.360
 electric I know that many of you do not 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.610
 you have problems to do it 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.610
 Well look, I'm going to fuck 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.070
 make yours and so for example 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.229
 I always try to make sure they are 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.390
 open stage when I go to practice 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.960
 unless you practice something very 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.960
 concrete 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.159
 and that's how I catch it guys you see me 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.659
 I support the command on the knee 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.659
 and that's how to eat 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.399
 I want you to know that I'm not 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.399
 lately very used to play with 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.640
 command and it may be because it fails a lot 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.680
 but still sure I was 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.049
 surprised with the ease then with the 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.490
 that the electric ones really come out with 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.490
 commanders of agreement come let's go there 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.489
 for example he has no more 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.020
 one 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.450
 fixed how easy it is guys I am very 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.090
 used to doing them is more than anything 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.430
 training does not require anything else 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.800
 according to ge hatch and it costs me a 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.800
 little more but 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.120
 today 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.299
 and well that's how I put the command 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.440
 guys was what I wanted him to see this 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.810
 agreement let's say 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.200
 take it rigidly because then 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.200
 we are locked to command for 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.020
 start i never take like that the command game 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.390
 with a finger I never did it when I was 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.030
 smaller when I started to play yes that 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.730
 I played like that with a finger 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.080
 but now for many years 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.080
 I hardly remember them 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.930
 Well, I play trying to emulate a bit 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.930
 well what is the arcade is like that 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.420
 simple never game we never play with the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.230
 analogically I specifically the changes 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.440
 I do with this according to this 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.230
 little joystick that we have here is 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.040
 as I do the controls of the changes 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.530
 it 's so simple there are people who 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.320
 has the changes in the trigger is something 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.780
 I will not recommend never remember me 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.870
 forever 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.500
 I do an electric and change with the 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.500
 joystick 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.000
 all right 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.000
 Y 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.220
 yes 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:33.669
 well this is the little demonstration 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.940
 I am sure that it will serve you 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.000
 help especially 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.280
 to know how to take control this is 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.470
 very important of guys if we put on 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.040
 engarrotados like a stick we are not going to 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.020
 get anything the electric 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.640
 practically let's say that its execution 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.070
 It is one of the fastest beats 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.070
 game because it requires a very 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.840
 quick of what is the crosshead but 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.840
 can really be done 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.590
 yes 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.110
 presentation 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.700
 yes 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.800
 how 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.620
 I do not like it very much because it moves me 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:47.080
 much the control of agreement because of course 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.080
 is used to the arcade 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.240
 yes 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.419
 or not 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.110
 do not 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.870
 you are 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.870
 yes 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.870
 one hour 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:53.499
 as you can see, good failure 

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:56.399
 very good, not many, but good 

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:56.399
 I have failures 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:02.849
 now 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:19.340
 and good kids then there you have the 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.790
 show of agreement I'm going to take the 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.490
 camera with your permission 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.380
 to say goodbye to all of you 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.210
 because I had to do here a 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.510
 invention as to teach 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:33.250
 stop with the arcade I will do the same but 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.560
 I ran faster because 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.150
 I really needed him to see is 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.650
 because sometimes an image is worth more than 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.570
 a thousand words that I sent six 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.880
 concretely, as eye control 

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.950
 to perform the electric and I hope 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.620
 so that this helps you not especially to 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.810
 relax to not take the command as 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.300
 something that they will steal because how much 

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.980
 more rigid we play so really worse 

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.480
 we do not and guasave sos all 

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.040
 remember to subscribe law comment 

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.450
 favorites share and see you the 

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.930
 next video a hug and until the 

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.930
 next chao
