00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello and welcome to this video 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.309
 today it's about the slider of slide 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.440
 camera and with a slider you can 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.750
 really a lot of movement in his 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.460
 bring videos and what exactly this 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.660
 copy here , I'll show you in 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.660
 this video a lot of fun 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.670
 first time to the slider itself 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.210
 taken this is namely the model 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.860
 since camera sp 1000 pro and one meter 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.400
 long enough for almost everyone 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.900
 should be 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.790
 It is almost completely made of aluminum 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.040
 built and inside are two 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.080
 stainless steel rails attached the whole 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.449
 like me three four kilos and one is 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.070
 maximum weight of camera equipment up to 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.110
 admitted to four kilograms 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.730
 but so much first of the data because 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.470
 if it was the first time unpacked 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.270
 It has an incredible amount 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.280
 good workmanship and material quality 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.380
 and above all the really blatant 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.120
 stability on the unfortunately already comes 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.010
 finished in an elongated cardboard box 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.600
 therefore and you have to either only 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.219
 still putting up these little legs or 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.089
 the whole thing on a tripod 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.860
 fix 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.500
 So from the construction that is really a 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.479
 simple thing but what do you need now 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.460
 exactly a slider and how is 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.350
 just this one very simple 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.700
 a second should help move 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.770
 to bring in the video in the form of 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.750
 camera rides or so called 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.369
 There are also different slides 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.560
 Variants that you can apply 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.420
 from a little later again show three 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.490
 Otherwise, the slider is in principle 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.200
 from two parts of a meter long 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.550
 rail and the cart on the one the 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.959
 camera then can attach 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.670
 By the way, the rail here is real 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.679
 just fantastically well built by time 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.869
 knows the surface is just 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.179
 normal smooth and even and that is at 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.830
 a slider really important on the right and 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.690
 left end are still so kind stopper off 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.770
 soft material attached to it 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.929
 do not dare directly against the aluminum 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.490
 By the way, there are still here 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.679
 the previously mentioned feet or legs 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.390
 Unfortunately, for example, too 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.800
 can put the ground and then from 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.959
 below and how cool camera rides 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.039
 can or can do so thanks to the legs 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.500
 one the slider in the height also 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.300
 vary and in very specific 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.280
 positions that you would like to set up 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.200
 and therefore are also separately as two strokes 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.729
 on the win detracted so that one 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.340
 can regulate everything even better and 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.869
 That's really the most important thing 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.550
 but then the director of the office is basically 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.770
 the carriage or sled on the 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.880
 slider because that's what you want at the end 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.099
 to do the suffering 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.930
 on this is a spirit level what 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.610
 pretty handy and of course that 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.950
 possibility to mount a camera or 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.630
 in the best case a tripod head like 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.700
 for example this one from manfrotto 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.260
 that's really pretty good 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.970
 thing and if you have one more way 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.280
 times but want to see the review writes 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.770
 comments then 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.910
 that's another thing on the car 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.380
 of course , a little in itself 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.430
 the whole thing 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.470
 can determine 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.300
 but unfortunately there is nothing around it 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.980
 to regulate resistance, so to speak, and 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.690
 that's missing a bit 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.370
 and then there is one more 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.340
 few win over other camera accessories 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.500
 how do i know microphones and so on 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.270
 to fix 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.340
 but how fluid is the slider now ? 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.319
 he is really fluent at all 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.840
 and just make fun of it 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.970
 Slides important fast go right 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.950
 good only slow slides make by hand 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.140
 sometimes a little problems as well 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.430
 really not as strong as that is 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.140
 start a lights not always quite 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.010
 fluid but you can behind here 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.330
 edit out 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.890
 but if you then in the cut program 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.930
 still a bit behind afterwards 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.280
 stabilized then the thing is too 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.900
 eaten and come in the end 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.250
 really cool recordings out 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.290
 Of course, a slider can also work 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.910
 We are used differently 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.040
 relatively flexible which also cool 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.780
 such a thing is a method would be for 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.550
 example the frontal drive up 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.140
 something that gives a nice effect 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.140
 make us relatively easy 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.459
 the second option is to 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.530
 just to cut something over 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.390
 that is also relatively cool and easy 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.390
 and yes, a good possibility 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.019
 and if you can do it a little more 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.640
 you can still have a slide out 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.650
 with a swivel of the tripod head 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.230
 combine and so for example to a 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.299
 product flying around, so to speak 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.220
 looks real in short of everything and 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.840
 brings a decent dynamic into the picture 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.880
 but there are a few others as well 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.829
 possibilities and with some creativity 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.549
 you can also do something neat 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.650
 rausholen 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.090
 I hang you there at the end of the video 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.709
 take a few more shots 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.359
 so that you do again a better image 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.340
 what can we do with us? 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.660
 I'm sure that some 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.390
 of you can do that even better than 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.100
 but what is even better than a good one ? 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.370
 built slider and a steady hand 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.020
 to a motor and I have too 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.620
 can have test here and I have to 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.080
 already say 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.450
 that's really incredible 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.680
 Fantastic the installation is very 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.720
 easy and with this remote control 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.500
 You can really do it all right then 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.180
 good control 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.250
 so you can really slow down really 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.099
 and quiet lights do however 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.050
 costs the more than 400 euros again 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.409
 insanity money and that can then 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.119
 probably only the professionals afford 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.189
 but as I said, such a motor is one 

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:50.879
 dream but the price is also in this 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:52.929
 slider the crack point hold fast 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.149
 441 euro costs the part 

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:57.039
 and that's really a lot 

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:59.139
 money, however, is the slider 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.360
 probably more to real professionals and in 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.550
 This area is almost cheap 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.909
 Because you have fast times just 1000 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.919
 euro and more area still just under 450 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:10.239
 Euros are anything but cheap and 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.289
 You really have to know if you are 

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:13.119
 that wants to spend 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.919
 otherwise I can attach the product though 

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:16.719
 really hardly complain everything is going 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.319
 Liquid and the processing is a 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:19.059
 dream 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.769
 Unfortunately, it is not a bag or something 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:22.869
 you have to do that again 

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:23.739
 to buy and at the price I want so 

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:25.659
 what to expect 

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:27.189
 that's it but also with this 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.409
 video thank you for the friendly to 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:31.839
 on the other hand, leave feedback 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.519
 in the comments or by like button 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:35.469
 and now there are still some recordings 

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:36.699
 I've made with the slider we 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:39.149
 See you next video again 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.149
 ciao
