00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.099
 the new aprilia rsv4 rr to so many 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.010
 improvements that I had to mark 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.620
 in order not to actually forget this is 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.970
 the rs version is even more advanced 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.790
 with ohlins suspensions forged rims 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.920
 a livery called superpole 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.309
 different from that of the rr version 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.329
 that the base but in common to all 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.730
 improvements 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:57.170
 look how wonderful this v4 engine is 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.320
 of 65 degrees between the cylinders passes the 200 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.750
 horses in 201 to be precise as 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.939
 they made them get shorter croissants 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.290
 from the varied geometry that varies in 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.960
 differently 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.380
 at the revised crankshaft at 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.590
 cleavers to the dynamics that limit the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.810
 losses due to friction but in short if you want 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.909
 the rr costs 18,300 rf which is this 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.159
 version with jerry ohlins suspension 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.390
 forgings 21.590 ex dealer 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.549
 all the improvements they made yes 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.689
 they solve this bike in one word 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.689
 it's a missile 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.659
 the could aprilia rsv4 for 2015 is 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.630
 available in two rr versions that already 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.940
 makes any biker happy 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.390
 from the sporty nature and rf with 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.369
 ohlins suspensions and details rendered 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.009
 specifically designed to remove the 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.760
 best time on the track at misano we have 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.200
 tried just the rf version 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.290
 recognizable by the superpole library 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.790
 with the words aprilia in grande and sulle 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.860
 hulls I say immediately 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.540
 it's a bike on the track 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.930
 expresses a potential it has 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.940
 of the incredible for a production bike 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.640
 certainly but also considering it one 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.239
 motorcycle racing would take the maximum of 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.340
 votes from any pilot to understand us in 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.220
 a track like silverstone on april at 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.630
 super stocks or directly derived 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.970
 from the production bike 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.269
 they ran on third row times 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.940
 noticeably more in the superbike 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.750
 powerful and expensive and developed for 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.030
 tie the secret of these performances 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.780
 the engine resides in the heart of the bike 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.720
 and the chassis the four-cylinder thousand a 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.110
 v of 65 degrees was further 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.040
 strengthened and now reaches the threshold of 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.870
 200 horses for 13,000 rounds of draw 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.260
 I pass the electronics that keep it underneath 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.900
 control was developed yes for 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.420
 guarantee the safety of the seated pilot 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.380
 on this bomb but above all the 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.180
 electronic brain of rsv4 rf 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.970
 manages the engine response for 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.120
 get maximum performance 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.250
 the v4 is an integral part of the chassis that 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.260
 therefore it reaches a rigidity that in 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.440
 soldoni translates into accuracy of 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.950
 driving stability and safety for the 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.860
 driver to go fast on the track must 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.470
 even brake hard and this is what i think 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.420
 giant front disks managed 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.570
 guess what from a system 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.680
 electronic the racing biesse but in 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.409
 practice all this what it means 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.260
 in practice we enter lightly in the 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.159
 bend of misano to over 260 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.950
 kilometers per hour 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.430
 climbing from the sixth to the fifth in a 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.159
 moment 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.590
 thanks to the change is now we understand each other 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:12.049
 electronically controlled allowing 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.659
 to climb and to go up a gear without 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.579
 use the clutch 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:19.880
 if to this we add the grip of the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.430
 pirelli diablo supercorsa in sc2 compound 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.610
 that average well if you are a pilot 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:30.820
 even just amateur know that the 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.820
 nirvana exists I am sitting on it
