Hari<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.470> pretty<00:01:46.860> sure<00:01:47.040> I'm<00:01:47.100> saying<00:01:47.369> that

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
Hari I'm pretty sure I'm saying that

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.120 
Hari I'm pretty sure I'm saying that
right<00:01:47.729> they<00:01:48.630> would<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:48.960> perfect<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.680> his<00:01:49.800> head

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
right they would be perfect for his head

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.170 
right they would be perfect for his head
but<00:01:50.490> instead<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:52.250> use<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.430> head<00:01:53.610> from<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
but instead I just use the head from the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.640 
but instead I just use the head from the
Atlantis<00:01:54.960> series<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.050> know<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.560> the<00:02:00.650> the

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
Atlantis series and I know that the the

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.990 
Atlantis series and I know that the the
headpiece<00:02:02.040> doesn't<00:02:02.370> match<00:02:02.490> perfectly

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
headpiece doesn't match perfectly

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.990 
headpiece doesn't match perfectly
because<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:04.170> kind<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.440> like<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> tan<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
because it's kind of like a tan in the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.080 
because it's kind of like a tan in the
shell<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:07.040> it's<00:02:08.040> pretty<00:02:08.429> much<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.760> basic

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
shell but it's pretty much the basic

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.759 
shell but it's pretty much the basic
shape<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.540> it<00:02:09.690> that's<00:02:09.959> why<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> used<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:12.769> all

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
shape of it that's why I used to all

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.130 
shape of it that's why I used to all
right<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.310> now<00:02:15.030> since<00:02:15.480> I'm<00:02:15.660> pretty<00:02:15.989> much

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
right so now since I'm pretty much

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.270 
right so now since I'm pretty much
finished<00:02:16.500> I'm<00:02:16.620> going<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.799> tell<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.070> what's
