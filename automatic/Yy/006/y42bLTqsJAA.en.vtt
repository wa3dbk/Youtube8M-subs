 switch scenes i hope you are happy 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.660
 today there's a yankee candle and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.110
 Although there is currently a giant excavator 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.059
 I know I'll stay tuned for 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.920
 all the candles sweet and maybe 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.820
 want a last minute present 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.820

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.270

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.750
 complained again by jörg hahnel click 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.140
 city ​​antalya online so also at 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.720
 google 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.720
 I was a bit crazy 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.000
 as a microphone but things like that 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.350
 incredibly artificial I do not have 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.629
 other than to beat 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.920
 The month was probably Christmas 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.840
 tokio my god that just smells 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.300
 So after cookies really prove 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.640
 that are as you can top in one 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.680
 fragrance lamp pure without water without 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.960
 sometime and then the and melt 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.120
 spread a really crass scent in 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.080
 I still have your flat in Berlin 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.630
 the high circle day and as a candle help 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.350
 You can see that this is right here 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.210
 blossomed 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.850
 one of my absolute favorites 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.729
 when I smelled it once I found 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.780
 it okay so yes has just smelled good 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.130
 when he was at my god i can give you 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.479
 do not describe how good is right 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.369
 smells a bit sweet 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.880
 probably the apple and then smells 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.829
 but also as fresh and soy as 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.020
 Pine cones somehow sweet as well 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.710
 So my absolute favorite topics 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.719
 many others then were allowed to join 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.229
 oranger yes that's right 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:54.090
 Fruity and still a bit 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.289
 good again heavy air very very good 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.710
 christoph an old classic of mine 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:02.200
 I like it very much 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.740
 that's such a mixture of fresh so 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.979
 why fresh air outside and become 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.479
 why comfort and warmth inside 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.190
 as I describe and then one 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:19.120
 absolute given god of fire 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.750
 street this is a fragrance he smells 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.130
 really cute and for example out and 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.990
 anyway it has something like that 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.800
 Smoky definitely only if you 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.280
 yes so than with but with the first candle 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.620
 on 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.500
 if this cat ever out of the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.440
 then I will go 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.030
 seriously be so sad i do not come 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.050
 over it when the way goes and indeed 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.730
 is the world 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.970
 my god it is the middle glass and 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.140
 there is or was it for 11 euros 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:01.290
 usually this glass costs you 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:04.800
 actually 23 that smells like cup cakes 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:09.360
 and after to that this frosting and 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.190
 after his and after sugar oh god now 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.770
 So I have to go a catch 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.780
 two now and I just dare 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:23.870
 not to burn them because of that 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.870
 wonderful big on 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:32.490
 but where in the bag this is one 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.390
 was smaller than it with a small glass 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:40.980
 one wick and I have for seven 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.470
 euro gets you when euro smells it 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.220
 just so gorgeous I did precisely 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.630
 already described 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:52.200
 and I do not know how many sick people 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:54.450
 trend is thus 198 so 200 grams yes 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.910
 good and yes so that that yes here 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.430
 I have become my new darling 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.720
 I'll wear it now 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.020
 yes, I will probably too 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.590
 but give away euro because I had to 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.590
 strike 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.550
 probably there are five days here 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.500
 not even another candle offer 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.050
 and was so huge 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.230
 it's burning right here in the back 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.970
 really big glass and the little one already 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.910
 since I think three weeks and that will 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.470
 somehow not less and that was here 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:38.060
 Also in the offer for I think ten euro 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:42.130
 euro that smells so early but not 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.750
 laterally disgusting but laterally sweet and 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.070
 so a bit fresh as a navi 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.630
 already very much like 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.520
 So you see it's worth it too 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.900
 really to go to the karstadt 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.910
 and sometimes the whole place 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.560
 should look and also because these 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.000
 I take all the offers we take with me 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.490
 hello is seven euros that's really so 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.310
 compared to 27 or so it is 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:10.220
 Of course, the advents do not really matter 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.790
 really nice for today 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.790
 the Kreisler and so a bit 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.790
 on top 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:30.170
 there is a load of uk in one of these 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:32.000
 really nice gray purple and then there 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.620
 it's another pack of these 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.630
 beautiful house on the ring I for 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.600
 you've got the situation is already 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.940
 times in a raffle and they are 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.940
 really many cranes and the cards have 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.130
 so freaky and gives very small 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.530
 sizes for here in front then just completely 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.919
 normal size do not think that serves that 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:56.660
 of nail polish really really good 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:58.340

 mccann of course I also 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.090
 you thought 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:07.070
 one of my theory is vanilla alone 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.140
 that's pretty cute but somehow too 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.160
 after the change a really right 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:15.320
