00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
a while so I'm going to be coming back

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.190 
a while so I'm going to be coming back
once<00:02:52.520> this<00:02:52.970> is<00:02:53.240> finished<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:55.400> stock-car<00:02:55.610> a<00:02:56.300> it

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
once this is finished and stock-car a it

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.920 
once this is finished and stock-car a it
is<00:02:58.000> starting<00:02:59.000> and<00:03:00.340> now<00:03:01.340> your<00:03:01.760> iPod<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.600> should

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
is starting and now your iPod it should

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.460 
is starting and now your iPod it should
be<00:03:03.470> going<00:03:03.770> like<00:03:03.890> this<00:03:03.920> it<00:03:05.080> should<00:03:06.080> take<00:03:06.320> around

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
be going like this it should take around

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.310 
be going like this it should take around
like<00:03:06.890> five<00:03:07.190> minutes<00:03:07.400> for<00:03:07.910> this<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:09.020> complete

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
like five minutes for this to complete

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.870 
like five minutes for this to complete
all<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:10.570> roughly<00:03:15.070> so<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:16.160> just<00:03:16.310> wait<00:03:16.489> for<00:03:16.730> it

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
all that roughly so you just wait for it

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.750 
all that roughly so you just wait for it
to<00:03:17.660> load<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.860> then<00:03:18.950> that's<00:03:19.220> penny<00:03:19.489> things

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
to load and then that's penny things

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.940 
to load and then that's penny things
happening<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.780> then<00:03:26.959> iTunes<00:03:27.440> will<00:03:27.739> be

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
happening and then iTunes will be

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.620 
happening and then iTunes will be
detecting<00:03:30.100> an<00:03:31.100> iPod<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:31.850> restoring<00:03:33.459> but<00:03:34.630> your

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
detecting an iPod and restoring but your

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.140 
detecting an iPod and restoring but your
iPods<00:03:35.930> not<00:03:36.049> restoring<00:03:36.500> right<00:03:37.430> now<00:03:40.000> so<00:03:41.000> then

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
iPods not restoring right now so then

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.009 
iPods not restoring right now so then
this<00:03:41.390> should<00:03:42.019> appear<00:03:42.350> up<00:03:42.560> there<00:03:43.540> meaning<00:03:44.540> that

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
this should appear up there meaning that

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.340 
this should appear up there meaning that
your<00:03:46.060> iPod<00:03:47.060> is<00:03:47.299> May<00:03:47.450> detected<00:03:48.110> on<00:03:48.320> the

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
your iPod is May detected on the

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.690 
your iPod is May detected on the
computer<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:49.360> now<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:51.680> should<00:03:52.220> be<00:03:52.310> done<00:03:52.459> you

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
computer and now it should be done you

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.960 
computer and now it should be done you
did<00:03:52.790> have<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.030> slide<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.330> and<00:03:54.820> you'd<00:03:55.820> have

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
did have to slide it and you'd have

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.180 
did have to slide it and you'd have
loader<00:03:58.329> which<00:03:59.329> then<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:00.620> just<00:04:00.860> download

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
loader which then you just download

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:21.910 
loader which then you just download
Cydia<00:04:01.489> from<00:04:03.730> then<00:04:04.730> once<00:04:05.120> that<00:04:05.360> is<00:04:05.510> finished

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.800 

there<00:04:22.550> it's<00:04:22.910> exist<00:04:23.390> it<00:04:23.930> success<00:04:24.790> then<00:04:25.790> I<00:04:26.390> think

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
there it's exist it success then I think

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.840 
there it's exist it success then I think
it'll<00:04:26.930> just<00:04:27.020> like<00:04:27.320> low<00:04:27.680> just<00:04:28.130> there<00:04:28.640> you<00:04:28.700> go

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
it'll just like low just there you go

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:41.080 
it'll just like low just there you go
splitting<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:31.400> then<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.780> will<00:04:33.110> be<00:04:40.090> moving

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
splitting and then it will be moving

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.520 
splitting and then it will be moving
again<00:04:41.510> and<00:04:41.950> respring<00:04:42.950> and<00:04:43.460> been<00:04:43.820> um<00:04:44.530> cydia

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
again and respring and been um cydia

00:04:45.530 --> 00:05:04.070 
again and respring and been um cydia
will<00:04:46.040> appear

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.580 

and<00:05:04.650> then<00:05:04.830> yeah<00:05:05.520> here<00:05:05.909> I<00:05:06.150> probably<00:05:06.810> detect<00:05:07.379> on

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
and then yeah here I probably detect on

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.460 
and then yeah here I probably detect on
the<00:05:07.710> computer<00:05:08.009> again

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:23.869 

and<00:05:13.800> that's<00:05:14.580> to<00:05:14.790> while

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:23.879 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.119 

and<00:05:24.449> then<00:05:24.599> once<00:05:24.779> that's<00:05:25.020> finished<00:05:25.319> you<00:05:25.800> would

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:26.129 
and then once that's finished you would

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:29.119 
and then once that's finished you would
go<00:05:26.309> and<00:05:26.849> then<00:05:27.330> their<00:05:27.689> obesity<00:05:28.080> out<00:05:28.319> so<00:05:28.949> that's

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:29.129 
go and then their obesity out so that's

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.529
