here<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:22.170> over<00:02:22.610> overconfidence<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.850> this

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
here the over overconfidence is this

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.810 
here the over overconfidence is this
thing's<00:02:24.270> ability<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.170> every<00:02:25.620> time<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.040> takes

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
thing's ability and every time it takes

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.930 
thing's ability and every time it takes
out<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.590> monster<00:02:28.590> or<00:02:28.830> no<00:02:28.980> monster<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:29.910> a

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
out a monster or no monster but a

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.280 
out a monster or no monster but a
pokemon<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:31.140> gains<00:02:31.500> an<00:02:31.800> attack<00:02:32.250> boost<00:02:32.930> now<00:02:33.930> if

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
pokemon it gains an attack boost now if

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.370 
pokemon it gains an attack boost now if
like<00:02:34.770> my<00:02:35.040> SAT<00:02:35.550> right<00:02:35.760> here<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.810> have<00:02:37.230> him

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
like my SAT right here is a I have him

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.130 
like my SAT right here is a I have him
to<00:02:37.500> scarf<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.270> if<00:02:39.480> he<00:02:39.600> kills<00:02:39.840> two<00:02:40.110> people

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
to scarf so like if he kills two people

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.740 
to scarf so like if he kills two people
he<00:02:40.709> has<00:02:40.890> like<00:02:41.070> basically<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.270> know<00:02:42.360> choice

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
he has like basically a you know choice

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.650 
he has like basically a you know choice
band<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.520> plus<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.550> choice<00:02:44.910> scarf<00:02:45.240> which<00:02:45.480> is

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.860 
it's fine i guess since it can be taken
out<00:02:51.959> easily<00:02:52.310> if<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:54.060> have<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.300> correct<00:02:54.510> wall

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
main counter that i could think of at

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.380 
main counter that i could think of at
this<00:04:49.080> point<00:04:49.200> of<00:04:49.470> time<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.760> revolution<00:04:50.910> is

another revolution so these data are

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.720 
another revolution so these data are
pretty<00:04:53.760> ridiculous<00:04:54.450> so<00:04:55.320> we're<00:04:55.980> pretty<00:04:56.670> sure

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
pretty ridiculous so we're pretty sure

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.070 
pretty ridiculous so we're pretty sure
we're<00:04:56.910> even<00:04:57.180> in<00:04:57.270> speed<00:04:57.540> so<00:04:57.810> we're<00:04:57.960> getting

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
we're even in speed so we're getting

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.420 
we're even in speed so we're getting
these<00:04:58.260> speed<00:04:58.590> ties<00:04:58.920> and<00:05:01.010> yeah<00:05:02.010> go<00:05:02.220> for<00:05:02.310> another

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
these speed ties and yeah go for another

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.870 
these speed ties and yeah go for another
