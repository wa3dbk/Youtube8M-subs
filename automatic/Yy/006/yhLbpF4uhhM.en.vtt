00:00:00.214 --> 00:00:03.332
"Questions Only"!

00:00:05.017 --> 00:00:11.086
Everybody plays.
Starting with Marcão and Elidio.

00:00:11.086 --> 00:00:13.477
They can only talk with questions.

00:00:13.477 --> 00:00:15.758
If they say anything
that's not a question,

00:00:15.758 --> 00:00:20.026
or if they take too long,
I'll ring the bell...

00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:25.846
The player is out and another one
gets in to resume the game.

00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:30.918
Let's do this: I wanna know something
that reminds you of your childhood.

00:00:30.965 --> 00:00:34.415
Something from your childhood
or something that reminds you of it.

00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:37.316
- You can take your time...
- Doll.

00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:41.636
Doll. That's the theme of our
"Questions Only", starting now!

00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:48.748
Do you want to be my friend?

00:00:48.978 --> 00:00:51.699
Why would I be your friend?

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.059
Don't you want to be friends
with a hugging doll?

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.290
Why would I need hugs
if I have Ken's car?

00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:06.671
Are you a bimbo doll?

00:01:13.783 --> 00:01:15.733
Low blow!

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:19.533
For God's sake, do you have
this one with another hair color?

00:01:20.743 --> 00:01:23.345
Can it be one from last year's sale?

00:01:23.345 --> 00:01:26.435
Don't you see that my daughter
asked for the other one?

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:28.185
What model does she want?

00:01:28.185 --> 00:01:32.264
Do you know the one
with straight short hair?

00:01:32.264 --> 00:01:34.025
The sporty Chanel?

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:35.495
Do you have it?

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.805
Can it be the last year's?

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:39.646
Do you think she's gonna notice?

00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:42.066
Don't you think it's worth the price?

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:44.617
Why is the package written in Chinese?

00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:48.257
Do you have something
against smuggling?

00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:57.916
The doll was asking!

00:01:57.916 --> 00:02:00.926
Fuck it, I don't speak Chinese!

00:02:01.176 --> 00:02:03.546
- Damn!
- I don't speak Chinese!

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:11.253
Are you alone in here, doll?

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:21.844
Could you make a move on me?

00:02:21.844 --> 00:02:25.938
What song do you want?

00:02:26.998 --> 00:02:31.508
Can't you see that I want
you to flirt with me?

00:02:31.788 --> 00:02:34.409
What is 'flirt'?

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.668
How old are you?

00:02:37.368 --> 00:02:40.069
Can't you see I'm 18?

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.880
I can.

00:02:51.642 --> 00:02:56.474
Are you having a good nap?

00:02:57.335 --> 00:03:01.514
Am I hearing someone talking?

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.884
Is this neck for me?

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:08.994
Am I hearing someone talking?

00:03:09.704 --> 00:03:12.807
Do you talk in your sleep?

00:03:13.216 --> 00:03:16.867
Am I hearing someone talking?

00:03:19.572 --> 00:03:22.204
Oh, you're cheating!

00:03:22.344 --> 00:03:25.474
Cheating?
I was asking questions!

00:03:25.474 --> 00:03:28.926
Yes!
They're all the same!

00:03:29.077 --> 00:03:30.937
Will he feel it?

00:03:32.727 --> 00:03:34.577
What is this pain?

00:03:34.997 --> 00:03:37.618
Could it be really working?

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:42.488
What happened?

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:44.830
Which body part should I hit?

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.781
What is this drum noise?

00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:48.880
Will he need this one?

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.270
What happened to me?

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.640
Will he be sorry to have left me?

00:04:02.203 --> 00:04:03.623
Enjoying?

00:04:03.623 --> 00:04:04.762
It was you?

00:04:04.762 --> 00:04:06.593
Don't you see the doll?

00:04:06.932 --> 00:04:08.592
You used 'voodoo'?

00:04:08.592 --> 00:04:11.573
Vooodoo shmoodoo!

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.671
- 'Voodoo shmoodoo'! - It's automatic,
if you hear 'voodoo', 'voodoo shmoodoo'!

00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:28.301
'Vooodoo shmoodoo'!

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:34.073
Elidio, you were cheating,
I wondered if you were smuggled.

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:37.212
Right, because
I wasn't asking questions.

00:04:37.212 --> 00:04:39.253
- No, it's...
- Read the game rules!

00:04:39.253 --> 00:04:40.823
- The problem is to ask the same...
- Read the game rules!

00:04:40.823 --> 00:04:44.012
- I don't care!
- Fight!

00:04:44.413 --> 00:04:47.313

00:04:49.314 --> 00:04:54.114
