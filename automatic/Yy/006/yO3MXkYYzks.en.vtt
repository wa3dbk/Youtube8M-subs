going to see how much it covers so we

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.530 
going to see how much it covers so we
want<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.100> do<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.340> first<00:03:00.640> because<00:03:01.030> maybe<00:03:01.150> you

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
maybe a little bit of shampoo but

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.680 
maybe a little bit of shampoo but
because<00:03:30.640> you're<00:03:30.760> using<00:03:30.910> something<00:03:31.269> that<00:03:31.540> has

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
because you're using something that has

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.780 
because you're using something that has
moisture<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:32.470> you<00:03:33.430> want<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.670> make<00:03:33.760> sure

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
moisture to it you want to make sure

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.569 
moisture to it you want to make sure
it's<00:03:34.269> bacteria<00:03:35.110> free<00:03:35.350> so<00:03:36.010> we're<00:03:36.160> gonna<00:03:36.250> start

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
it's bacteria free so we're gonna start

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.840 
it's bacteria free so we're gonna start
by<00:03:36.970> putting<00:03:37.709> foundation<00:03:38.709> through<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.549> middle

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
by putting foundation through the middle

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.039 
by putting foundation through the middle
of<00:03:40.120> Delphine's<00:03:40.510> face<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:42.220> start<00:03:42.579> and<00:03:43.019> then<00:03:44.019> I

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
kind of wiped the brush off because I

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.490 
kind of wiped the brush off because I
think<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:46.000> that's<00:03:46.209> enough<00:03:46.570> for<00:03:46.810> now<00:03:46.870> like<00:03:47.320> I

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.800 
think of painting a picture you're just
blending<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.660> so<00:04:26.080> that<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:26.680> get<00:04:26.920> a<00:04:27.160> really

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
blending it so that you get a really

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.700 
blending it so that you get a really
soft<00:04:28.950> pretty<00:04:30.030> feathered<00:04:31.030> but<00:04:31.750> totally<00:04:32.260> even

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
soft pretty feathered but totally even

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.510 
soft pretty feathered but totally even
effect<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:34.300> once<00:04:35.230> I've<00:04:35.560> gone<00:04:35.830> all<00:04:36.220> over<00:04:36.250> the

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
effect and once I've gone all over the

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.990 
effect and once I've gone all over the
face<00:04:37.050> I'll<00:04:38.050> go<00:04:38.320> back<00:04:38.500> with<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.550> little<00:04:39.580> bit

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
face I'll go back with a little bit

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.420 
face I'll go back with a little bit
bigger<00:04:40.300> strokes<00:04:40.810> just<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.350> work<00:04:41.500> it<00:04:41.680> into<00:04:42.100> the

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
bigger strokes just to work it into the

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.500 
bigger strokes just to work it into the
hairline<00:04:42.910> and<00:04:43.560> back<00:04:44.560> down<00:04:45.340> next<00:04:45.700> to<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.060> neck

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
hairline and back down next to the neck

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.130 
hairline and back down next to the neck
this<00:04:47.410> looks<00:04:47.800> really<00:04:48.070> even<00:04:48.580> but<00:04:49.060> I<00:04:49.450> think<00:04:49.690> that

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
this looks really even but I think that

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.810 
this looks really even but I think that
I<00:04:50.200> could<00:04:50.380> get<00:04:50.500> an<00:04:50.680> even<00:04:51.010> more<00:04:51.160> perfected

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
I could get an even more perfected

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.370 
I could get an even more perfected
finish<00:04:52.150> by<00:04:52.330> adding<00:04:52.660> a<00:04:52.750> little<00:04:52.870> bit<00:04:53.020> more<00:04:53.290> of

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
finish by adding a little bit more of

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.950 
finish by adding a little bit more of
that<00:04:53.410> Illumina<00:04:54.130> scene<00:04:54.880> cream<00:04:55.180> that<00:04:55.450> I<00:04:55.480> used<00:04:55.720> in

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
that Illumina scene cream that I used in

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.500 
that Illumina scene cream that I used in
the<00:04:56.050> beginning<00:04:56.470> so<00:04:57.100> I'm<00:04:57.670> gonna<00:04:57.850> go<00:04:58.060> back<00:04:58.300> with

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
the beginning so I'm gonna go back with

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.830 
the beginning so I'm gonna go back with
a<00:04:58.630> little<00:04:58.660> bit<00:04:58.960> more<00:04:59.290> of<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.530> strobe<00:04:59.920> cream

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
a little bit more of the strobe cream

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.390 
a little bit more of the strobe cream
which<00:05:01.840> it's<00:05:02.050> called<00:05:02.290> because<00:05:02.620> it<00:05:02.650> reflects

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
which it's called because it reflects

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.150 
which it's called because it reflects
light<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:04.660> give<00:05:04.870> her<00:05:05.350> a<00:05:05.590> little<00:05:05.830> bit<00:05:06.010> more

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
light to give her a little bit more

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.380 
light to give her a little bit more
dimension<00:05:06.400> to<00:05:06.640> her<00:05:06.970> face<00:05:07.240> without<00:05:07.810> contouring

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
dimension to her face without contouring

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.240 
dimension to her face without contouring
so<00:05:10.390> if<00:05:10.750> you<00:05:10.870> just<00:05:11.170> apply<00:05:11.710> with<00:05:11.980> the<00:05:12.070> same

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
so if you just apply with the same

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
the eye for your concealer because it is

the eye for your concealer because it is
a<00:06:09.840> Luminizer<00:06:10.840> so<00:06:11.200> it<00:06:11.320> will<00:06:11.470> make<00:06:11.650> sure<00:06:11.980> it's

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
a Luminizer so it will make sure it's

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.400 
a Luminizer so it will make sure it's
throwing<00:06:12.670> off<00:06:12.880> light<00:06:13.210> it's<00:06:13.540> not<00:06:13.600> shimmery<00:06:14.110> but

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
throwing off light it's not shimmery but

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.640 
throwing off light it's not shimmery but
it's<00:06:14.590> a<00:06:14.800> light<00:06:15.010> reflector<00:06:15.520> and<00:06:16.050> then<00:06:17.050> go<00:06:17.560> ahead

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
it's a light reflector and then go ahead

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.150 
it's a light reflector and then go ahead
and<00:06:17.740> blend<00:06:18.130> it<00:06:18.280> onto<00:06:18.790> the<00:06:19.210> clavicle<00:06:19.720> bone<00:06:20.160> so

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
and blend it onto the clavicle bone so

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.860 
and blend it onto the clavicle bone so
that<00:06:21.310> really<00:06:21.550> catches<00:06:22.030> beautiful<00:06:22.510> light<00:06:22.690> as

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
that really catches beautiful light as

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.400 
that really catches beautiful light as
well

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410 
well

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.810 
well
okay<00:06:25.410> so<00:06:25.470> those<00:06:25.710> are<00:06:25.770> the<00:06:25.920> basics<00:06:26.430> on<00:06:26.580> how<00:06:26.610> to

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
okay so those are the basics on how to

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.930 
okay so those are the basics on how to
