00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:07.940 

I<00:00:02.639> think<00:00:03.540> they<00:00:03.689> have<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:05.299> very<00:00:06.299> good<00:00:07.290> trio<00:00:07.710> of

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
I think they have a very good trio of

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.540 
I think they have a very good trio of
Claire's<00:00:08.220> any<00:00:08.580> attack<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.179> hauz<00:00:10.139> li<00:00:10.469> qu<00:00:11.070> miento

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
Claire's any attack in hauz li qu miento

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.330 
Claire's any attack in hauz li qu miento
and<00:00:11.990> Camilla<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.259> think<00:00:13.650> those<00:00:13.860> three<00:00:14.099> years

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
and Camilla I think those three years

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.029 
and Camilla I think those three years
good<00:00:14.580> as<00:00:14.900> any<00:00:15.900> three<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> leap<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.920> know

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
good as any three in the leap you know

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.769 
good as any three in the leap you know
and<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.460> think<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.850> at<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.300> point<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
and I think it at this point in the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.900 
and I think it at this point in the
season<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.500> team<00:00:19.800> that's<00:00:19.850> kind<00:00:20.850> of

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
season this is a team that's kind of

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.480 
season this is a team that's kind of
relaxed<00:00:21.420> they<00:00:21.750> can<00:00:21.960> they<00:00:22.859> can<00:00:22.890> come<00:00:23.160> out<00:00:23.189> and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
relaxed they can they can come out and

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.870 
relaxed they can they can come out and
play<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.019> take<00:00:25.019> some<00:00:25.230> chances<00:00:25.880> because

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
play and take some chances because

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.910 
play and take some chances because
realistically<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:28.140> know<00:00:28.260> they're<00:00:28.619> not<00:00:28.769> going

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
realistically you know they're not going

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.200 
realistically you know they're not going
to<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.250> playoff<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.939> they're

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
to be in a playoff so that they're

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.450 
to be in a playoff so that they're
playing<00:00:30.650> for<00:00:31.650> another<00:00:31.769> four<00:00:32.160> or<00:00:32.189> five<00:00:32.430> weeks

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
playing for another four or five weeks

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.330 
playing for another four or five weeks
and<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.969> point<00:00:33.180> for<00:00:33.329> their<00:00:33.420> jobs<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:34.340> think

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
and a point for their jobs I think

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.549 
and a point for their jobs I think
Vancouver<00:00:36.270> are<00:00:36.390> better<00:00:36.630> than<00:00:36.870> obviously

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
Vancouver are better than obviously

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.889 
Vancouver are better than obviously
their<00:00:37.770> position<00:00:38.190> shows<00:00:38.629> they're<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> tough

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
their position shows they're a tough

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.049 
their position shows they're a tough
team<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.410> saw<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.040> last<00:00:41.309> week<00:00:41.579> against<00:00:41.879> New

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
team you saw the last week against New

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.170 
team you saw the last week against New
York<00:00:42.300> 45<00:00:43.079> minutes<00:00:43.410> they<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:44.430> know<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:44.579> beat

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
York 45 minutes they you know they beat

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.540 
York 45 minutes they you know they beat
him<00:00:45.270> up<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.539> lot<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.039> we<00:00:47.039> know<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.430> be

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
him up a lot so we know it's going to be

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.799 
him up a lot so we know it's going to be
a<00:00:47.579> tough<00:00:47.760> game<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.270> know<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
a tough game we know it's going to be a

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.360 
a tough game we know it's going to be a
tougher<00:00:49.110> game<00:00:49.140> than<00:00:49.700> probably<00:00:50.700> people<00:00:51.199> think

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
tougher game than probably people think

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.479 
tougher game than probably people think
so<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> be<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.180> think<00:00:55.020> after

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
so we have to be on it think after

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.360 
so we have to be on it think after
obviously<00:00:56.489> loss<00:00:57.710> in<00:00:58.710> Mexico<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.129> always

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
obviously loss in Mexico is always

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.779 
obviously loss in Mexico is always
important<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.730> bounce<00:01:00.210> back<00:01:00.390> enough<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.789> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
important to bounce back enough so the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.520 
important to bounce back enough so the
games<00:01:03.000> at<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> game<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.539> crucial<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.320> that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
games at the game is crucial in that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.500 
games at the game is crucial in that
respect<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.640> get<00:01:05.760> back<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.000> winning<00:01:06.119> ways<00:01:06.270> you

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
respect to get back to winning ways you

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.660 
respect to get back to winning ways you
know<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.380> game<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.610> we're<00:01:08.610> looking

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
know so it's a game that we're looking

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.750 
know so it's a game that we're looking
forward<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> game<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.869> was<00:01:10.350> good

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
forward it's a game that I was good

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.710

football<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.790> always<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> game<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> few<00:01:12.540> days

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
football is always a game a few days

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.280 
football is always a game a few days
later<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.200> he<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.560> always<00:01:15.020> try<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.049> do<00:01:16.200> your

later so he can always try and do your

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.380 
later so he can always try and do your
best<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.710> hopefully<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> three

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
best and hopefully we can get the three

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.480 
best and hopefully we can get the three
points<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> poisoner<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.619> know<00:01:19.710> good<00:01:20.100> stable

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
points and poisoner you know good stable

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.399 
points and poisoner you know good stable
position<00:01:20.580> they're<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> team<00:01:21.750> that's<00:01:22.020> that's

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
position they're a team that's that's

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.359 
position they're a team that's that's
pretty<00:01:22.710> dangerous<00:01:22.860> actually<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:24.049> I<00:01:25.280> had<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
pretty dangerous actually and I had the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.490 
pretty dangerous actually and I had the
ability<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.820> watch<00:01:26.939> their<00:01:27.240> game<00:01:27.450> last<00:01:28.290> week

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
ability to watch their game last week

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.250 
ability to watch their game last week
against<00:01:28.860> New<00:01:28.979> York<00:01:29.189> and

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
against New York and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.180 
against New York and
at<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.280> minimum<00:01:31.520> their<00:01:32.560> top<00:01:33.560> for<00:01:33.860> attacking

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
at a minimum their top for attacking

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.240 
at a minimum their top for attacking
guys<00:01:34.520> are<00:01:34.790> really<00:01:34.970> good<00:01:35.290> now<00:01:36.290> they've<00:01:36.500> got<00:01:36.710> Jay

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
guys are really good now they've got Jay

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.550 
guys are really good now they've got Jay
back<00:01:37.490> in<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.330> back<00:01:38.510> end<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:38.870> think<00:01:38.900> he<00:01:39.290> helps

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
back in the back end I think he helps

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.180 
back in the back end I think he helps
solidify<00:01:39.680> their<00:01:40.100> backline<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:42.160> they're<00:01:43.160> a

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
solidify their backline so they're a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.150 
solidify their backline so they're a
good<00:01:43.400> team<00:01:43.430> going<00:01:44.000> forward<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.600> think<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:46.040> way

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
good team going forward I think the way

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.190 
good team going forward I think the way
jose<00:01:46.430> playing<00:01:46.760> they<00:01:46.970> can<00:01:47.120> always<00:01:47.300> pull<00:01:48.020> off<00:01:48.170> a

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
jose playing they can always pull off a

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.620 
jose playing they can always pull off a
result<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:48.890> we<00:01:49.790> need<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.090> make<00:01:50.210> sure<00:01:50.330> we're

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630

ready and that our energy is good and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.600
