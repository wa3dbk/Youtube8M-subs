00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.300
 but 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:15.770
 hello with him now we are going for 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:20.460
 autopsy for hacking the battery 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:24.410
 battery nickel cadmium non nickel 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.529
 magnesium up to nokia 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:33.350
 rather such a weighty thing in short he 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:37.550
 dead from served his survived out of his mind 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:42.630
 Naturally to open pretty 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:51.480
 strong thing as my hide the question 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:55.320
 Of course interesting try so not so 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:00.920
 gives nothing then to us to glance that 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.920
 there inside will have to make an effort 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:13.460
 so with him to apply more stringent 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.460
 measures for dissection it is all but sealed 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.689
 neatly quietly slowly to 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:32.729
 do not hurt 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:35.299
 details on lost interest broken 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.299
 parts 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.310
 loudly available 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:02:03.230
 so almost patience is served a little bit 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:22.200
 here went one hour we find out that there 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.200
 inside something could be inside 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:36.300
 batteries all sorts of different square 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.300
 probably square or stripes 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:46.570
 rubs does not want to succumb to it 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:54.730
 it is time to crack the head 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:03:00.150
 brutally break into four three two one 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.150
 and we opened it so we have here 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.970
 unpacked okay pick out our 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.200
 battery can one of them and the whole 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:27.730
 maybe two integers 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:36.720
 have glued on and surname marking what 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:36.720
 you can understand better here you will not understand 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:49.440
 connected as usual but here shemka there 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:54.300
 so do this open watch version 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.300
 62 wow 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.129
 region 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.640
 so something that I do not understand 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:13.150
 some parts are worth but then across 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:17.850
 visibility is needed in order to charger 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:21.039
 the device in the phone can determine 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.479
 I did nâ€™t charge yet 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:29.110
 give birth than not give birth 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:33.490
 Now let's move on and check out right now 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.699
 hikes and check it shows for a long time 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:42.310
 there did not look so shot at 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:53.099
 half a volt so we have here so here 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:05:01.710
 shows we have 0 6 volts so following 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:05:07.539
 here the same thing and here too 0 6 volts 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:11.080
 shorter than the pipe they can look what's there 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:13.830
 inside you need a tool 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.830
 helpers 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:23.530
 Okay, then on here on this all sorted out 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:25.289
 watched the show inside deeper 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:30.570
 the analysis will be later 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:33.520
