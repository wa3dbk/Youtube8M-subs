imagine<00:01:50.419> that<00:01:50.569> that's<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.899> area<00:01:51.229> we're<00:01:51.590> gonna

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
imagine that that's the area we're gonna

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.859 
imagine that that's the area we're gonna
place<00:01:51.950> that<00:01:51.979> waterfall<00:01:52.549> behind<00:01:52.729> us<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:53.359> then

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
place that waterfall behind us and then

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.199 
place that waterfall behind us and then
we'll<00:01:54.049> put<00:01:54.229> out<00:01:54.349> the<00:01:54.469> parameters<00:01:55.069> of<00:01:55.099> the<00:01:55.939> pond

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
we'll put out the parameters of the pond

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.899 
we'll put out the parameters of the pond
8<00:01:56.630> by<00:01:56.899> 11<00:01:56.929> now<00:01:57.859> we<00:01:57.919> want<00:01:58.279> to<00:01:58.340> be<00:01:58.399> careful<00:01:58.609> not<00:01:58.759> to

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
8 by 11 now we want to be careful not to

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.339 
8 by 11 now we want to be careful not to
put<00:01:59.059> any<00:01:59.179> lines<00:01:59.509> we<00:01:59.719> have<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.869> straight<00:02:00.139> line

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
put any lines we have a straight line

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.379 
put any lines we have a straight line
across<00:02:00.499> the<00:02:00.829> back<00:02:01.039> so<00:02:01.579> I'm<00:02:01.939> thinking<00:02:02.270> this

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:02.389 
across the back so I'm thinking this

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:03.969 
across the back so I'm thinking this
ponds<00:02:02.659> would<00:02:02.779> have<00:02:02.899> a<00:02:02.959> nice<00:02:03.139> curve<00:02:03.499> coming<00:02:03.799> out

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
ponds would have a nice curve coming out

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:04.419 
ponds would have a nice curve coming out
like<00:02:04.130> this

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
like this

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.269 
like this
I<00:02:04.669> want<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.209> avoid<00:02:05.509> lines<00:02:05.929> to<00:02:06.679> match<00:02:06.829> fence

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:07.279 
I want to avoid lines to match fence

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:09.130 
I want to avoid lines to match fence
lines<00:02:07.549> to<00:02:08.030> gives<00:02:08.239> a<00:02:08.330> lot<00:02:08.539> of<00:02:08.660> interest<00:02:09.050> in

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
lines to gives a lot of interest in

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.920 
lines to gives a lot of interest in
contour<00:02:09.649> in<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.829> yard

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.940 

okay<00:02:13.680> we're<00:02:13.829> gonna<00:02:13.920> set<00:02:14.189> this<00:02:14.370> waterfall<00:02:15.950> in

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
okay we're gonna set this waterfall in

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.610 
okay we're gonna set this waterfall in
the<00:02:17.400> prime<00:02:17.700> location<00:02:18.049> we're<00:02:19.049> gonna<00:02:19.140> angle<00:02:19.530> it

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
the prime location we're gonna angle it

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.460 
the prime location we're gonna angle it
towards<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.980> house<00:02:20.129> it<00:02:20.400> doesn't<00:02:20.670> have<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:20.970> be

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
towards the house it doesn't have to be

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.410 
towards the house it doesn't have to be
directly<00:02:22.470> towards<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.829> window<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:24.180> want<00:02:24.360> to

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
directly towards the window we want to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.300 
directly towards the window we want to
give<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.569> an<00:02:24.720> angle<00:02:25.049> maybe<00:02:25.260> at<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> window<00:02:25.860> here

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
give it an angle maybe at a window here

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.550 
give it an angle maybe at a window here
at<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.640> sliding<00:02:27.060> glass<00:02:27.150> door<00:02:27.510> there<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.500> you

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
at the sliding glass door there so you

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.860 
at the sliding glass door there so you
can<00:02:28.739> get<00:02:28.860> multiple<00:02:29.069> attractions<00:02:29.909> I<00:02:30.120> want<00:02:30.810> to

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
can get multiple attractions I want to

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.990 
can get multiple attractions I want to
set<00:02:31.049> it<00:02:31.079> off<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:31.590> fence<00:02:31.980> want<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.730> be<00:02:32.819> real

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
set it off this fence want to be real

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.880 
set it off this fence want to be real
careful<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> fact<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.900> we<00:02:34.590> don't<00:02:34.769> want

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
careful in the fact that we don't want

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.250 
careful in the fact that we don't want
to<00:02:34.950> throw<00:02:35.099> dirt<00:02:35.310> on<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.609> fence<00:02:35.819> because<00:02:36.299> it'll

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
to throw dirt on the fence because it'll

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.349 
to throw dirt on the fence because it'll
start<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.560> make<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.189> fence<00:02:38.400> deteriorate<00:02:39.209> and

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
start to make the fence deteriorate and

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.270 
start to make the fence deteriorate and
break<00:02:39.450> down<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.650> we're<00:02:40.859> probably<00:02:40.950> going<00:02:41.129> to

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
break down so we're probably going to

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.039 
break down so we're probably going to
put<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.430> small<00:02:41.790> retaining<00:02:42.180> wall<00:02:42.450> black<00:02:42.689> here

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
put a small retaining wall black here

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.819 
put a small retaining wall black here
and<00:02:43.319> we're<00:02:44.129> gonna<00:02:44.220> set<00:02:44.489> this<00:02:44.609> off<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:44.819> enough

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
and we're gonna set this off just enough

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.949 
and we're gonna set this off just enough
waterfall<00:02:46.829> placements<00:02:47.370> real<00:02:47.579> critical<00:02:48.030> once

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
waterfall placements real critical once

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.839 
waterfall placements real critical once
you<00:02:49.049> get<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.260> waterfall<00:02:49.680> placed<00:02:49.980> we're<00:02:50.760> gonna

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
you get the waterfall placed we're gonna

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.089 
you get the waterfall placed we're gonna
grab<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> garden<00:02:51.690> hose<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.260> we're<00:02:52.709> gonna<00:02:52.829> lay

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
grab a garden hose and we're gonna lay

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.369 
grab a garden hose and we're gonna lay
out<00:02:53.129> an<00:02:53.579> interesting<00:02:54.269> shape<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.840> then<00:02:55.260> you

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
out an interesting shape and then you

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.809 
out an interesting shape and then you
can<00:02:55.500> kind<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.739> reflect<00:02:56.129> on<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> little<00:02:56.609> bit

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
can kind of reflect on that a little bit

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.670 
can kind of reflect on that a little bit
we'll<00:02:56.940> spray<00:02:57.269> paint<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.689> and<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.260> can<00:02:58.409> see<00:02:58.590> how

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
we'll spray paint it and you can see how

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.470 
we'll spray paint it and you can see how
it's<00:02:58.859> gonna<00:02:58.980> look<00:02:59.099> before<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.579> start<00:02:59.700> digging

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.420 

okay<00:03:03.480> so<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.930> don't<00:03:04.260> want<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:04.680> line<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.250> this

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
okay so I don't want this line of this

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.369 
okay so I don't want this line of this
side<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.209> pond<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.720> be<00:03:06.810> right<00:03:07.019> at<00:03:07.139> the<00:03:07.170> edge

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
side of the pond to be right at the edge

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.720 
side of the pond to be right at the edge
of<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.650> waterfall<00:03:08.069> I<00:03:08.099> want<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.340> have<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.549> come

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
of the waterfall I want to have it come

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.819 
of the waterfall I want to have it come
past<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.209> little<00:03:09.450> bit<00:03:09.569> so<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.349> will<00:03:10.500> be<00:03:10.590> one<00:03:10.739> of

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
past a little bit so this will be one of

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:16.250 
past a little bit so this will be one of
the<00:03:11.659> the<00:03:12.659> parameters<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.439> my<00:03:14.280> shape<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.359> what

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
the the parameters of my shape and what

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:24.550 
the the parameters of my shape and what
I'll<00:03:16.379> do<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:16.799> I'll<00:03:17.699> mark<00:03:18.150> out<00:03:18.329> my<00:03:18.540> 11<00:03:18.959> foot<00:03:19.230> run

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.869 

there's<00:03:25.560> 11<00:03:26.010> feet<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:27.260> then<00:03:28.260> I'll<00:03:28.379> establish

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
there's 11 feet and then I'll establish

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.039 
there's 11 feet and then I'll establish
this<00:03:29.879> side<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.389> pond<00:03:31.609> where<00:03:33.049> we'll

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
this side of the pond where we'll

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.780 
this side of the pond where we'll
probably<00:03:34.260> have<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:34.769> be<00:03:35.099> part<00:03:35.129> of<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.549> line

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
probably have this be part of the line

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.830 
probably have this be part of the line
and<00:03:36.500> then<00:03:37.500> what<00:03:37.829> I'll<00:03:37.980> do<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:38.430> I'll<00:03:39.389> mark<00:03:39.690> this

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
and then what I'll do is I'll mark this

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:51.020 
and then what I'll do is I'll mark this
side<00:03:40.280> of<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.459> pond<00:03:41.639> as<00:03:41.819> well

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.460 

okay<00:03:52.030> for<00:03:52.210> starters<00:03:52.660> what<00:03:52.840> I've<00:03:52.960> done<00:03:53.110> is<00:03:53.320> I've

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
okay for starters what I've done is I've

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.930 
okay for starters what I've done is I've
put<00:03:53.830> a<00:03:53.890> little<00:03:54.100> bit<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.340> paint<00:03:54.550> on<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.820> ground

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
put a little bit of paint on the ground

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.270 
put a little bit of paint on the ground
and<00:03:55.270> these<00:03:55.360> locations<00:03:55.990> what<00:03:56.650> I<00:03:56.680> have<00:03:56.890> is<00:03:57.010> 8

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
and these locations what I have is 8

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.910 
and these locations what I have is 8
foot<00:03:57.550> by<00:03:57.940> 11<00:03:58.390> foot<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:59.200> can<00:03:59.410> see<00:03:59.650> pretty

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
foot by 11 foot and I can see pretty

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.950 
foot by 11 foot and I can see pretty
much<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.310> rectangle<00:04:00.910> that's<00:04:01.030> there<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:01.630> now

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
much the rectangle that's there and now

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.900 
much the rectangle that's there and now
what<00:04:02.140> I'll<00:04:02.260> do<00:04:02.440> is<00:04:02.470> I'll<00:04:02.890> grab<00:04:03.220> a<00:04:03.250> garden<00:04:03.730> hose

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
what I'll do is I'll grab a garden hose

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.430 
what I'll do is I'll grab a garden hose
and<00:04:03.940> we'll<00:04:04.360> create<00:04:04.690> an<00:04:04.780> interesting<00:04:04.990> shape

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
and we'll create an interesting shape

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:26.189 
and we'll create an interesting shape
inside<00:04:06.250> this<00:04:06.840> parameter

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.409 

it's<00:04:26.919> a<00:04:26.979> nice<00:04:27.129> interesting<00:04:27.460> shape<00:04:27.879> of<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.150> big

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
it's a nice interesting shape of the big

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.209 
it's a nice interesting shape of the big
opening<00:04:28.840> for<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.199> waterfall<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.740> spill<00:04:30.009> into

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:30.219 
opening for the waterfall to spill into

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:32.730 
opening for the waterfall to spill into
and<00:04:30.669> then<00:04:31.479> we'll<00:04:31.659> put<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:31.960> skimmer<00:04:32.289> on<00:04:32.590> the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
and then we'll put the skimmer on the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.129 
and then we'll put the skimmer on the
opposite<00:04:33.099> side<00:04:33.340> of<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:33.749> our<00:04:34.749> skimmer<00:04:34.990> is

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
opposite side of that our skimmer is

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.290 
opposite side of that our skimmer is
going<00:04:35.259> to<00:04:35.319> be<00:04:35.409> located<00:04:35.800> on<00:04:36.129> the<00:04:36.729> opposite<00:04:37.120> side

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
going to be located on the opposite side

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.540 
going to be located on the opposite side
of<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.479> waterfall<00:04:37.749> and<00:04:38.379> then<00:04:39.099> we<00:04:39.219> can<00:04:39.370> pull

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
of the waterfall and then we can pull

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.879 
of the waterfall and then we can pull
these<00:04:39.729> curves<00:04:39.969> around<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:41.319> get<00:04:41.469> it<00:04:41.590> just<00:04:41.800> the

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
these curves around to get it just the

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.550 
these curves around to get it just the
way<00:04:42.009> we<00:04:42.159> want<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:44.110> make<00:04:44.259> for<00:04:44.469> an

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
way we want to to make for an

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.709 
way we want to to make for an
interesting<00:04:44.979> shape<00:04:45.219> inside<00:04:45.999> the<00:04:46.180> parameters

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:46.719 
interesting shape inside the parameters

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.409 
interesting shape inside the parameters
there<00:04:46.990> now<00:04:47.919> once<00:04:48.219> the<00:04:48.430> hose<00:04:48.639> is<00:04:48.879> set<00:04:49.060> in<00:04:49.180> place

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
there now once the hose is set in place

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.499 
there now once the hose is set in place
I<00:04:50.310> would<00:04:51.310> advise<00:04:51.550> you<00:04:51.729> that<00:04:51.879> you<00:04:51.939> stand<00:04:52.270> back

I would advise you that you stand back

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.830 
I would advise you that you stand back
at<00:04:52.659> the<00:04:52.749> destination<00:04:53.349> area<00:04:54.569> evaluate<00:04:55.569> it<00:04:55.689> make

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
at the destination area evaluate it make

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.879 
at the destination area evaluate it make
sure<00:04:55.990> you're<00:04:56.139> really<00:04:56.259> going<00:04:56.439> to<00:04:56.499> fall<00:04:56.650> in<00:04:56.770> love

sure you're really going to fall in love
with<00:04:57.039> that<00:04:57.129> shape<00:04:57.400> then<00:04:58.270> we're<00:04:58.419> going<00:04:58.539> to

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
with that shape then we're going to

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.510 
with that shape then we're going to
spray<00:04:58.870> paint<00:04:59.080> that<00:04:59.229> line<00:04:59.560> and<00:04:59.830> then<00:05:00.250> we<00:05:00.370> would

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
spray paint that line and then we would

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:07.320 
spray paint that line and then we would
begin<00:05:00.639> excavation<00:05:05.909> so<00:05:06.909> we're<00:05:07.029> gonna<00:05:07.120> place

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
begin excavation so we're gonna place

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.760 
begin excavation so we're gonna place
the<00:05:07.479> skimmer<00:05:07.779> at<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.050> opposite<00:05:08.439> end<00:05:08.620> of<00:05:08.710> the

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
the skimmer at the opposite end of the

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.490 
the skimmer at the opposite end of the
waterfall<00:05:09.250> on<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:09.699> pond<00:05:09.969> and<00:05:10.270> I<00:05:11.050> want<00:05:11.349> you<00:05:11.409> to

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
the shape we set the skimmer in place

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.369 
the shape we set the skimmer in place
we're<00:05:18.849> gonna<00:05:18.969> spray-paint<00:05:19.360> this<00:05:19.810> out<00:05:20.050> and

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:20.379 
we're gonna spray-paint this out and

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:23.070 
we're gonna spray-paint this out and
before<00:05:21.339> we<00:05:21.520> do<00:05:21.699> excavation<00:05:22.389> we're<00:05:22.900> going<00:05:23.020> to

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
before we do excavation we're going to

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.260 
before we do excavation we're going to
plumb<00:05:23.349> that<00:05:23.529> waterfall<00:05:24.099> filter<00:05:24.460> so<00:05:24.939> that<00:05:24.969> way

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
plumb that waterfall filter so that way

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.390 
plumb that waterfall filter so that way
when<00:05:25.449> we<00:05:25.539> take<00:05:25.749> this<00:05:25.930> dirt<00:05:26.319> everyone<00:05:27.189> thinks

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
when we take this dirt everyone thinks

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.409 
when we take this dirt everyone thinks
that<00:05:27.430> they<00:05:27.580> start<00:05:27.819> with<00:05:27.939> the<00:05:27.999> excavation

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
that they start with the excavation

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:29.969 
that they start with the excavation
first<00:05:28.870> but<00:05:29.050> it's<00:05:29.169> really<00:05:29.319> important<00:05:29.889> we're

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
first but it's really important we're

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.279 
first but it's really important we're
going<00:05:30.009> to<00:05:30.159> set<00:05:30.849> that<00:05:31.000> waterfall<00:05:31.539> put<00:05:32.050> all<00:05:32.169> the

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
going to set that waterfall put all the

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.709 
going to set that waterfall put all the
plumbing<00:05:32.650> in<00:05:32.770> it<00:05:32.889> and<00:05:33.099> as<00:05:33.430> we<00:05:33.639> dig<00:05:33.969> we<00:05:34.330> can<00:05:34.599> be

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:34.719 
plumbing in it and as we dig we can be

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:36.749 
plumbing in it and as we dig we can be
burying<00:05:35.169> the<00:05:35.319> plumbing<00:05:35.740> and<00:05:35.889> burying<00:05:36.669> the

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 
burying the plumbing and burying the

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.909 
burying the plumbing and burying the
waterfall<00:05:37.240> filter<00:05:37.599> as<00:05:37.810> we<00:05:38.409> do<00:05:38.560> it<00:05:38.680> it's<00:05:38.830> gonna

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
waterfall filter as we do it it's gonna

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.290 
waterfall filter as we do it it's gonna
save<00:05:39.189> you<00:05:39.310> a<00:05:39.339> lot<00:05:39.520> of<00:05:39.580> time<00:05:39.849> and<00:05:40.060> a<00:05:40.089> lot<00:05:40.270> of
