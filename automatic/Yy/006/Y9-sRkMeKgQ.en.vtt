it couldn't start a worse that's for
sure<00:00:40.140> any<00:00:40.590> time<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.550> give<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> team<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.890> goal

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
sure any time you give a team a goal

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.650 
sure any time you give a team a goal
advantage<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> first<00:00:44.880> few<00:00:45.030> minutes<00:00:45.150> it's

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
advantage in the first few minutes it's

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.850 
advantage in the first few minutes it's
going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:45.960> tough<00:00:46.140> especially<00:00:46.380> as<00:00:46.830> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
going to be tough especially as a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.400 
going to be tough especially as a
visiting<00:00:47.310> team<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.620> we<00:00:49.620> made<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.830> harder<00:00:50.250> by

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
visiting team and we made it harder by

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.540 
visiting team and we made it harder by
allowing<00:00:52.410> them<00:00:52.650> to<00:00:52.770> score<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> second<00:00:53.430> goal

allowing them to score the second goal

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.970 
allowing them to score the second goal
and<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.880> that<00:00:54.210> dictated<00:00:54.900> the<00:00:55.080> game<00:00:55.260> they

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980
