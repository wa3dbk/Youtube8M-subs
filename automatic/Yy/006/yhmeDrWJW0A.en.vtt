00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
it's a good time to think about you know

it's a good time to think about you know
spring<00:00:18.040> cleaning<00:00:18.310> we<00:00:18.550> do<00:00:18.700> it<00:00:18.790> with<00:00:18.910> our

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
spring cleaning we do it with our

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.179 
spring cleaning we do it with our
wardrobe<00:00:19.480> so<00:00:19.689> let's<00:00:19.930> extend<00:00:20.320> that<00:00:20.500> into<00:00:20.739> our

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
wardrobe so let's extend that into our

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.069 
wardrobe so let's extend that into our
beauty<00:00:21.880> routine<00:00:22.239> and<00:00:22.480> with<00:00:22.630> the<00:00:22.720> change<00:00:22.960> of

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:23.079 
beauty routine and with the change of

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.839 
beauty routine and with the change of
every<00:00:23.320> season<00:00:23.500> is<00:00:23.800> usually<00:00:24.160> a<00:00:24.189> good<00:00:24.430> time<00:00:24.669> to

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
every season is usually a good time to

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.330 
every season is usually a good time to
think<00:00:25.000> about<00:00:25.119> giving<00:00:25.930> your<00:00:26.200> brushes<00:00:26.649> a<00:00:26.890> rinse

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
think about giving your brushes a rinse

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.569 
think about giving your brushes a rinse
because<00:00:27.849> dirty<00:00:28.599> brushes<00:00:29.099> collect<00:00:30.099> all<00:00:30.309> kinds

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
because dirty brushes collect all kinds

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.450 
because dirty brushes collect all kinds
of<00:00:30.849> makeup<00:00:31.630> and<00:00:31.750> bacteria<00:00:32.410> and<00:00:32.800> it's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
of makeup and bacteria and it's

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.860 
of makeup and bacteria and it's
something<00:00:33.850> that<00:00:34.120> we<00:00:34.239> don't<00:00:34.420> want<00:00:34.540> to<00:00:34.750> be

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
something that we don't want to be

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.779 
something that we don't want to be
putting<00:00:35.320> on<00:00:35.440> our<00:00:35.559> face<00:00:35.800> over<00:00:36.250> and<00:00:36.399> over<00:00:36.519> again

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789 
putting on our face over and over again

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.779 
putting on our face over and over again
so<00:00:37.449> i'm<00:00:37.629> starting<00:00:38.019> with<00:00:38.410> some<00:00:38.980> of<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.429> brushes

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
so i'm starting with some of the brushes

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.580 
so i'm starting with some of the brushes
that<00:00:39.820> I<00:00:40.120> use<00:00:40.570> most<00:00:40.899> I'm<00:00:41.199> going<00:00:41.379> to<00:00:41.440> use<00:00:41.559> my

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
that I use most I'm going to use my

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.579 
that I use most I'm going to use my
blush<00:00:41.980> brush<00:00:42.250> as<00:00:42.489> an<00:00:42.760> example<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:43.539> I<00:00:44.260> found

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
blush brush as an example and I found

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.919 
blush brush as an example and I found
this<00:00:44.829> great<00:00:45.100> little<00:00:45.399> kit<00:00:45.789> it's<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.629> brush

guard cleaning kit that I think it just
makes<00:00:49.570> it<00:00:49.749> easy<00:00:49.989> because<00:00:50.109> it<00:00:50.440> comes<00:00:50.620> with

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
don't like to put in the effort or think

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.919 
don't like to put in the effort or think
about<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.149> ahead<00:00:55.239> of<00:00:55.390> time<00:00:55.480> this<00:00:55.809> is
