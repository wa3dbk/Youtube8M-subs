come<00:00:33.510> across<00:00:33.780> very<00:00:33.960> well<00:00:34.079> now<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.680> it

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
come across very well now we have it

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.290 
come across very well now we have it

quick product tour here we see on the
top<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.149> device<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.350> where<00:00:46.649> you'll

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
top of the device this is where you'll

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.040 
top of the device this is where you'll
actually<00:00:47.520> control<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.450> move<00:00:48.719> through<00:00:48.930> your

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you look on the bottom of the device you

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.890 
you look on the bottom of the device you
see<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.210> an<00:01:18.420> infrared<00:01:18.659> receiver

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
see here this is an infrared receiver

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.600 
see here this is an infrared receiver
we'll<00:01:19.320> talk<00:01:19.470> about<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.920> second<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.400> as

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
we'll talk about that in a second to as

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.740 
we'll talk about that in a second to as
well<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.630> simple<00:01:22.439> on-off<00:01:22.799> switch

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
well as it's just a simple on-off switch

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.030 
well as it's just a simple on-off switch
on<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> other<00:01:24.960> side<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.590> micro<00:01:25.920> SD

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
on the other side we have a micro SD

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.240 
on the other side we have a micro SD
card<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.840> other<00:01:28.020> speaker<00:01:28.560> as<00:01:28.710> well<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.220> a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
card in the other speaker as well as a

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.910 
card in the other speaker as well as a
micro<00:01:29.579> or<00:01:29.729> mini<00:01:29.880> B<00:01:30.119> USB<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> DC<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.710> here

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
micro or mini B USB and the DC in here

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.590 
micro or mini B USB and the DC in here
so<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.040> mentioned<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.340> IR<00:01:35.700> port<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.180> does<00:01:36.360> come

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
so we mentioned the IR port it does come

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.690 
so we mentioned the IR port it does come
with<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:37.170> simple<00:01:37.680> remote<00:01:38.009> control<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
with this simple remote control in the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.090 
with this simple remote control in the
box<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:39.930> we<00:01:40.079> put<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.409> down<00:01:40.560> here<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:40.950> can

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
box so if we put it down here we can

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.289 
box so if we put it down here we can
actually<00:01:41.369> navigate<00:01:41.579> through<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.060> menu

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
actually navigate through the menu

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.740 
actually navigate through the menu
systems<00:01:44.060> so<00:01:45.060> we'll<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.360> look<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.600> our

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
systems so we'll have a look on our

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.120 
systems so we'll have a look on our
local<00:01:45.930> disk<00:01:46.259> there's<00:01:46.530> eight<00:01:46.649> gigabytes<00:01:47.009> of

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
local disk there's eight gigabytes of

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.429 
local disk there's eight gigabytes of
storage<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.729> mentioned<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.229> can<00:01:49.350> have

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
storage like we mentioned so we can have

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.660 
storage like we mentioned so we can have
a<00:01:49.470> look<00:01:49.619> at<00:01:49.710> some<00:01:49.860> movies<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.549> in

this here you can use the headphone port
with<00:03:04.560> this<00:03:05.040> RCA<00:03:05.520> cable<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.080> is<00:03:07.580> 3.5

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
with this RCA cable so this is 3.5

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.540 
with this RCA cable so this is 3.5
millimeter<00:03:08.820> audio<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.960> RCA<00:03:10.370> now<00:03:11.370> also

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
millimeter audio to RCA now also

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.370 
millimeter audio to RCA now also
included<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.180> box<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.660> this<00:03:12.750> composite

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
included in the box is this composite

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.920 
included in the box is this composite
cable<00:03:13.830> which<00:03:14.400> uses<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.820> HDTV<00:03:15.330> port<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:15.840> we

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
cable which uses the HDTV port that we

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.660 
cable which uses the HDTV port that we
mentioned<00:03:16.050> previously<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.310> plug<00:03:17.490> this

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
mentioned previously so you plug this

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.990 
mentioned previously so you plug this
end<00:03:17.880> into<00:03:18.239> your<00:03:18.530> player<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:20.400> plug<00:03:20.640> these

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
end into your player and you plug these

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.050 
end into your player and you plug these
three<00:03:21.480> composites<00:03:22.080> into<00:03:22.650> your<00:03:23.100> HDTV<00:03:23.820> and

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
three composites into your HDTV and

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.150 
three composites into your HDTV and
that'll<00:03:24.780> allow<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.170> output<00:03:25.500> at<00:03:25.620> 720p

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
that'll allow you to output at 720p

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.010 
that'll allow you to output at 720p
resolution<00:03:26.459> now<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.300> will<00:03:27.480> need<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.690> use<00:03:27.720> both

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
resolution now you will need to use both

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.750 
resolution now you will need to use both
of<00:03:28.050> these<00:03:28.260> cables<00:03:28.709> in<00:03:28.890> conjunction<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:29.610> you'll

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760

fundamental issue we found with this
device<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.000> slow<00:03:39.300> transfer<00:03:39.840> speed<00:03:40.140> we<00:03:40.590> found

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
device is a slow transfer speed we found

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.410 
device is a slow transfer speed we found
it<00:03:40.950> looks<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.459> be<00:03:41.550> about<00:03:41.640> two<00:03:41.910> megabytes<00:03:42.150> a

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
it looks to be about two megabytes a

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.420 
it looks to be about two megabytes a
second<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.290> seven<00:03:43.650> hundred<00:03:43.709> megabyte<00:03:44.190> file

second so a seven hundred megabyte file

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.160 
second so a seven hundred megabyte file
took<00:03:44.760> almost<00:03:44.970> six<00:03:45.300> minutes<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.600> transfer<00:03:46.020> on
