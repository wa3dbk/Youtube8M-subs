00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
took me about a week to make after

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.130 
took me about a week to make after
seeing<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.410> slime<00:00:22.710> blocks<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:24.140> the

seeing the slime blocks and the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.900 
seeing the slime blocks and the
minecraft<00:00:25.560> snapshot<00:00:26.269> 14w<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.900> earliest<00:00:28.910> 1.8

minecraft snapshot 14w the earliest 1.8
snapshot<00:00:30.390> i<00:00:30.420> believe<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.750> was<00:00:30.840> 14<00:00:31.170> wo<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:32.030> be

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
snapshot i believe that was 14 wo to be

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.430 
snapshot i believe that was 14 wo to be
I<00:00:33.739> decided<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.160> know<00:00:36.000> what<00:00:36.120> I'm<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.410> to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
I decided you know what I'm going to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.430 
I decided you know what I'm going to
make<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> parkour<00:00:38.010> map<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.510> so<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
make a parkour map and so this is the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.530 
make a parkour map and so this is the
result<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.219> idea<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.969> actually<00:00:42.149> got<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
result of that idea I actually got the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.950 
result of that idea I actually got the
idea<00:00:42.780> from<00:00:43.050> my<00:00:43.290> friend<00:00:43.620> your<00:00:43.800> nola<00:00:43.980> he<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
idea from my friend your nola he is a

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.209 
idea from my friend your nola he is a
founder<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> real<00:00:46.230> mega<00:00:46.440> miners<00:00:46.829> he<00:00:47.039> said

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
founder of the real mega miners he said

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.290 
founder of the real mega miners he said
you<00:00:47.309> know<00:00:47.399> why<00:00:47.520> don't<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> make<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.910> parkour

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
you know why don't you make a parkour

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.880 
you know why don't you make a parkour
map<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.690> would<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:48.840> kind<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.050> epic<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
map it would be kind of epic and so I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.779 
map it would be kind of epic and so I
did<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> result<00:00:52.219> this<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.460> spawn

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
did and this is a result this is a spawn

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.670 
did and this is a result this is a spawn
and<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.480> could<00:00:54.600> see<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:54.960> creative<00:00:55.530> i'm

one point snapshot is released that is
very<00:01:32.310> important<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.540> you're<00:01:33.689> watching

don't use bucket it's very important I
will<00:01:41.579> probably<00:01:42.060> be<00:01:42.210> adding<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.530> list

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
will probably be adding that to the list

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.649 
will probably be adding that to the list
of<00:01:44.549> signs<00:01:45.180> here<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.930> haven't<00:01:46.590> I'm<00:01:46.770> not<00:01:47.040> sure<00:01:47.100> oh

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
of signs here I haven't I'm not sure oh

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.690 
of signs here I haven't I'm not sure oh
I<00:01:48.770> will<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.890> adding<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.460> case<00:01:50.579> I

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
I will be adding that but in case I

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.990 
I will be adding that but in case I
don't<00:01:50.759> arm<00:01:52.130> please<00:01:53.130> make<00:01:53.340> sure<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.700> don't<00:01:53.850> use

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
don't arm please make sure you don't use

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.520 
don't arm please make sure you don't use
bucket<00:01:54.390> because<00:01:54.570> then<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> commands<00:01:55.290> won't

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
bucket because then the commands won't

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.620 
bucket because then the commands won't
work<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> practice<00:01:57.240> parkour

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
work so this is the practice parkour

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.090 
work so this is the practice parkour
there<00:01:57.840> was<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> little<00:01:58.259> bit<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.439> confusion<00:01:58.619> when

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
there was a little bit of confusion when

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.370 
there was a little bit of confusion when
I<00:01:59.159> was<00:01:59.280> beta<00:01:59.490> testing<00:01:59.909> with<00:02:00.000> my<00:02:00.119> friends<00:02:00.600> too

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
I was beta testing with my friends too

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.260 
I was beta testing with my friends too
they<00:02:01.890> were<00:02:01.950> having<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.369> bit<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.549> confusion<00:02:02.759> on

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
they were having a bit of confusion on

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.330 
they were having a bit of confusion on
what<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.659> was<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.290> I'm<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.649> doing<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:04.950> part

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
what it was so I'm just doing this part

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.580 
what it was so I'm just doing this part
this<00:02:05.579> video<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.479> guys<00:02:06.750> don't<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.320> that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
this video so you guys don't have that

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.190 
this video so you guys don't have that
confusion<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.940> slime<00:02:09.209> blocks<00:02:09.509> one<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.989> key

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
confusion so slime blocks one of the key

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.320 
confusion so slime blocks one of the key
things<00:02:10.500> when<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.039> jump<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> slime<00:02:11.730> block<00:02:12.030> as

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
things when you jump on a slime block as

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.910 
things when you jump on a slime block as
you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.629> see<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:12.989> right<00:02:13.200> here<00:02:13.260> is

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
you can see this right here is

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.580 
you can see this right here is
block<00:02:14.280> right<00:02:15.209> there<00:02:15.240> I'll<00:02:15.569> show<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:16.050> slime

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
block right there I'll show you to slime

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
block right there I'll show you to slime
block<00:02:16.830> arm<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.290> realize<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.650> slime

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
block arm you have to realize that slime

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.610 
block arm you have to realize that slime
blocks<00:02:20.970> on<00:02:22.970> will<00:02:23.970> not<00:02:24.209> retain<00:02:24.810> your<00:02:25.020> momentum

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
blocks on will not retain your momentum

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.640 
blocks on will not retain your momentum
if<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:26.099> hit<00:02:26.310> space<00:02:26.760> while<00:02:27.120> you're<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.810> so

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
if you hit space while you're on it so

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.770 
if you hit space while you're on it so
like<00:02:28.800> if<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.220> jump<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.730> I'm<00:02:29.849> holding<00:02:30.030> space<00:02:30.480> as

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
like if I jump and I'm holding space as

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.410 
like if I jump and I'm holding space as
I<00:02:31.200> hit<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.590> oops<00:02:31.920> imma<00:02:32.370> set<00:02:32.610> as<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:33.120> hit<00:02:33.330> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
I hit the oops imma set as I hit the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.770 
I hit the oops imma set as I hit the
slime<00:02:33.660> block<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:35.190> hold<00:02:35.340> space<00:02:35.670> I'm<00:02:35.970> holding

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
slime block and I hold space I'm holding

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.690 
slime block and I hold space I'm holding
space<00:02:36.959> right<00:02:37.230> now<00:02:37.380> as<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:38.069> can<00:02:38.190> see<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.370> mean

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
space right now as you can see I mean

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.030 
space right now as you can see I mean
constantly<00:02:39.209> jumping<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:39.870> not<00:02:40.560> going<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
constantly jumping it's not going to

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.110 
constantly jumping it's not going to
give<00:02:41.190> me<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.430> much<00:02:41.640> it's<00:02:41.910> going<00:02:42.060> to

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
give me that much it's going to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.270 
give me that much it's going to
completely<00:02:42.390> stop<00:02:42.930> my<00:02:43.110> momentum<00:02:43.440> I'm<00:02:44.040> not<00:02:44.190> sure

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
completely stop my momentum I'm not sure

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.790 
completely stop my momentum I'm not sure
why<00:02:44.640> but<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.150> does<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.989> don't<00:02:46.319> hold<00:02:46.470> space

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
why but it just does so don't hold space

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.210 
why but it just does so don't hold space
so<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.790> jump<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.739> you're<00:02:49.739> trying<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.980> hit<00:02:50.130> the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
so you jump and you're trying to hit the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.009 
so you jump and you're trying to hit the
goal<00:02:50.370> block<00:02:50.670> in<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.940> tutorial<00:02:51.269> that's<00:02:51.750> that's

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
goal block in the tutorial that's that's

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.050 
goal block in the tutorial that's that's
the<00:02:52.200> whole<00:02:52.319> key<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.920> hid<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.160> gold<00:02:53.280> blocks<00:02:53.750> so

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
the whole key you hid the gold blocks so

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.259 
the whole key you hid the gold blocks so
this<00:02:57.060> part<00:02:57.540> right<00:02:57.600> here<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.110> show<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:59.269> yes

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
this part right here is to show that yes

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.780 
this part right here is to show that yes
this<00:03:00.780> looks<00:03:00.840> possible<00:03:01.350> where<00:03:02.040> me<00:03:02.340> jumping

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
this looks possible where me jumping

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.660 
this looks possible where me jumping
from<00:03:02.940> there<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.569> goal<00:03:03.810> platform<00:03:04.670> does

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
from there to that goal platform does

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.600 
from there to that goal platform does
look<00:03:05.910> like<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.239> possibly<00:03:06.989> could<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.370> fact

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
look like it possibly could but the fact

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.370 
look like it possibly could but the fact
of<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.760> matter<00:03:08.819> is<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.299> it's<00:03:09.480> not<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.930> have<00:03:10.230> to

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
of the matter is is it's not I have to

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.740 
of the matter is is it's not I have to
use<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.530> slime<00:03:10.950> blocks<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.790> that's<00:03:12.000> what<00:03:12.209> I'm

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
use the slime blocks and that's what I'm

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.630 
use the slime blocks and that's what I'm
trying<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.260> teach<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.709> player<00:03:13.890> without<00:03:14.340> using

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
trying to teach the player without using

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.300 
trying to teach the player without using
a<00:03:14.819> bunch<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.180> signs<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.930> know<00:03:16.049> to<00:03:16.650> distract

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
a bunch of signs you know to distract

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.729 
a bunch of signs you know to distract
you<00:03:17.519> it's<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.780> can't<00:03:19.049> reach<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.380> unless<00:03:19.470> you

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
you it's you can't reach it unless you

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.259 
you it's you can't reach it unless you
use<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.010> slime<00:03:20.220> blocks<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:20.820> every<00:03:21.090> time<00:03:21.120> you

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
use the slime blocks so every time you

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.479 
use the slime blocks so every time you
see<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.630> slime<00:03:21.900> block<00:03:22.200> pad<00:03:22.680> this<00:03:23.190> is<00:03:23.340> what

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
see of a slime block pad this is what

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.420 
see of a slime block pad this is what
these<00:03:23.670> things<00:03:23.700> are<00:03:24.260> use<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:26.100> it's

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
these things are use it it's it's

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.800 
these things are use it it's it's
necessary<00:03:27.950> there<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.040> go<00:03:29.160> now<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.120> use<00:03:30.480> command

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
necessary there you go now I use command

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.360 
necessary there you go now I use command
blocks<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.200> get<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.380> places<00:03:31.590> quickly<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.340> you

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
blocks to get to places quickly so you

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.890 
blocks to get to places quickly so you
don't<00:03:32.549> have<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:32.760> climb<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> bunch<00:03:33.480> of<00:03:33.570> ladders

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
don't have to climb a bunch of ladders

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.289 
don't have to climb a bunch of ladders
or<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.410> courses<00:03:34.799> don't<00:03:35.010> become<00:03:35.370> unbearably

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
or the courses don't become unbearably

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.770 
or the courses don't become unbearably
long<00:03:36.739> so<00:03:37.739> there<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:37.980> go<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.450> this<00:03:39.450> shows<00:03:39.750> that

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
long so there you go and this shows that

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.560 
long so there you go and this shows that
again<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.859> looks<00:03:41.130> like<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.430> can<00:03:41.549> reach<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:42.000> but

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
again it looks like it can reach it but

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.190 
again it looks like it can reach it but
you<00:03:42.810> have<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.109> use<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.350> slime<00:03:43.590> block<00:03:44.489> pad<00:03:44.850> on

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
you have to use the slime block pad on

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.710 
you have to use the slime block pad on
so<00:03:46.200> if<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.380> try<00:03:46.680> as<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:47.820> can<00:03:48.060> see<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.209> can't<00:03:48.510> reach

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
so if I try as you can see I can't reach

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.690 
so if I try as you can see I can't reach
it<00:03:48.930> now<00:03:49.500> I'm<00:03:49.620> not<00:03:49.680> going<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:49.980> die<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.579> then

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
blocks as you can see I easily made it

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.759 
blocks as you can see I easily made it
there<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:09.690> another<00:04:09.930> command<00:04:10.319> block<00:04:10.530> to

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
there so another command block to

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.180 
there so another command block to
teleport<00:04:11.549> us<00:04:11.700> up<00:04:12.000> here<00:04:12.420> now<00:04:13.139> this<00:04:13.500> is<00:04:13.560> just<00:04:13.920> the

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
teleport us up here now this is just the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.920 
teleport us up here now this is just the
double<00:04:14.489> jump<00:04:14.700> tutorial<00:04:15.180> basically<00:04:15.750> what<00:04:15.900> a

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
double jump tutorial basically what a

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.770 
double jump tutorial basically what a
double<00:04:16.200> jump<00:04:16.560> is<00:04:16.799> is<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:18.209> jump<00:04:18.479> from<00:04:18.630> one

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
double jump is is you jump from one

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.599 
double jump is is you jump from one
point<00:04:19.139> and<00:04:19.350> you're<00:04:19.500> hitting<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.979> slime<00:04:20.310> pads

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
point and you're hitting to slime pads

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.730 
point and you're hitting to slime pads
and<00:04:20.940> it's<00:04:21.120> necessary<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.140> hit<00:04:22.349> those<00:04:22.500> two

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
and it's necessary to hit those two

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.070 
and it's necessary to hit those two
flying<00:04:23.039> pads<00:04:23.310> in<00:04:23.640> order<00:04:24.539> to<00:04:24.599> get<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.900> next

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
flying pads in order to get to the next

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.320 
flying pads in order to get to the next
one<00:04:25.380> now<00:04:25.710> this<00:04:25.919> is<00:04:25.979> necessary<00:04:26.669> this<00:04:27.150> is

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
one now this is necessary this is

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.420 
just oh it's okay you know I recommend
you<00:04:30.629> this<00:04:30.990> is<00:04:31.169> necessary<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:31.860> that's<00:04:32.220> why<00:04:32.400> I

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
you this is necessary and that's why I

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.059 
you this is necessary and that's why I
made<00:04:32.669> it<00:04:32.759> necessary<00:04:32.879> so<00:04:33.599> when<00:04:34.319> you<00:04:34.439> encounter

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
this in them in one of the maps you will

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:42.320 
this in them in one of the maps you will
need<00:04:38.789> to<00:04:39.000> have<00:04:39.150> practice<00:04:39.449> this<00:04:40.789> so<00:04:41.789> as<00:04:42.060> you<00:04:42.240> can

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
see it's quite simple actually just keep

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.939 
see it's quite simple actually just keep
pressing<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.449> forward<00:04:45.930> key<00:04:46.169> until<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:46.800> get

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
pressing the forward key until you get

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.709 
pressing the forward key until you get
to<00:04:47.039> the<00:04:47.069> block<00:04:47.340> arm<00:04:49.909> so<00:04:50.909> yeah<00:04:51.210> that's<00:04:51.449> the

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:51.719 
to the block arm so yeah that's the

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.529 
to the block arm so yeah that's the
double<00:04:51.960> jump<00:04:52.139> and<00:04:52.319> this<00:04:53.219> is<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.550> wall<00:04:53.879> run<00:04:54.150> now

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
double jump and this is the wall run now

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.629 
double jump and this is the wall run now

more<00:05:41.610> fun<00:05:41.909> to<00:05:42.180> do<00:05:42.330> that<00:05:42.509> because<00:05:42.659> you<00:05:42.870> just

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
more fun to do that because you just

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.219 
more fun to do that because you just
fall<00:05:43.349> and<00:05:43.379> you<00:05:43.680> drop<00:05:43.919> and<00:05:44.159> you<00:05:44.279> land<00:05:44.669> on<00:05:44.819> there

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
fall and you drop and you land on there

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.800 
fall and you drop and you land on there
so<00:05:46.229> climb<00:05:46.589> this<00:05:46.800> ladder<00:05:47.300> now<00:05:48.300> I<00:05:48.330> put<00:05:48.659> this

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
so climb this ladder now I put this

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.839 
so climb this ladder now I put this
ladder<00:05:49.080> in<00:05:49.349> here<00:05:49.529> to<00:05:49.919> show<00:05:50.190> that<00:05:50.400> you<00:05:50.580> will

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
ladder in here to show that you will

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.490 
ladder in here to show that you will
have<00:05:51.000> to<00:05:51.210> climb<00:05:51.419> some<00:05:51.690> ladders<00:05:52.080> it's<00:05:52.319> not

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
have to climb some ladders it's not

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.829 
have to climb some ladders it's not
always<00:05:52.710> going<00:05:52.919> to<00:05:53.009> be<00:05:53.069> teleporting<00:05:53.879> up<00:05:54.539> and

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:54.839 
always going to be teleporting up and

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:57.019 
always going to be teleporting up and
down<00:05:54.990> but<00:05:55.259> you<00:05:55.289> won't<00:05:55.589> have<00:05:55.770> to<00:05:55.860> climb<00:05:56.099> usually

00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:57.029 
down but you won't have to climb usually

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:58.850 
down but you won't have to climb usually
more<00:05:57.330> than<00:05:57.629> about<00:05:57.900> this<00:05:58.289> height<00:05:58.500> so<00:05:58.680> it's<00:05:58.770> not

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
more than about this height so it's not

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.519 
more than about this height so it's not
a<00:05:59.009> I'm<00:05:59.159> bearable<00:05:59.789> own<00:05:59.990> so<00:06:00.990> this<00:06:01.169> is<00:06:01.289> the<00:06:01.379> leap

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:01.529 
a I'm bearable own so this is the leap

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.550 
a I'm bearable own so this is the leap
of<00:06:01.680> faith<00:06:02.000> now<00:06:03.000> technically<00:06:03.539> I<00:06:03.779> can<00:06:04.199> make<00:06:04.409> it

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
of faith now technically I can make it

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.230 
of faith now technically I can make it
to<00:06:04.680> that<00:06:04.800> gold<00:06:05.099> block<00:06:05.370> pad<00:06:05.639> down<00:06:05.849> there<00:06:06.060> it's

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
to that gold block pad down there it's

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.140 
to that gold block pad down there it's
very<00:06:06.509> simple<00:06:06.770> but<00:06:07.770> i'll<00:06:08.039> die<00:06:08.339> if<00:06:08.370> i'm<00:06:09.029> an

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
very simple but i'll die if i'm an

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.459 
very simple but i'll die if i'm an
adventure<00:06:09.539> mode<00:06:09.690> I'll<00:06:09.930> die<00:06:10.409> if<00:06:10.879> there's<00:06:11.879> no

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:12.469 
adventure mode I'll die if there's no

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:15.050 
adventure mode I'll die if there's no
two<00:06:13.469> ways<00:06:13.500> about<00:06:13.830> it<00:06:13.979> if<00:06:14.550> you<00:06:14.729> go<00:06:14.909> into

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
two ways about it if you go into

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.209 
two ways about it if you go into
adventure<00:06:15.389> mode<00:06:15.810> which<00:06:16.469> I'll<00:06:16.620> do<00:06:16.800> so<00:06:16.979> real

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
adventure mode which I'll do so real

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:19.189 
adventure mode which I'll do so real
quick<00:06:17.430> you<00:06:18.000> see<00:06:18.120> have<00:06:18.240> a<00:06:18.300> regeneration<00:06:18.779> three

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
quick you see have a regeneration three

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:21.019 
quick you see have a regeneration three
and<00:06:19.409> it's<00:06:19.620> a<00:06:19.680> brief<00:06:20.009> second<00:06:20.490> but<00:06:20.639> i<00:06:20.729> will<00:06:20.879> get

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
and it's a brief second but i will get

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:23.300 
and it's a brief second but i will get
saturation<00:06:21.750> as<00:06:21.900> well<00:06:22.110> this<00:06:22.770> prevents<00:06:23.219> the

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
saturation as well this prevents the

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.159 
saturation as well this prevents the
players<00:06:23.580> from<00:06:23.969> get<00:06:24.210> it<00:06:24.330> going<00:06:24.599> hungry<00:06:24.779> or

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
players from get it going hungry or

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.670 
players from get it going hungry or
dying<00:06:25.589> in<00:06:25.949> case<00:06:26.219> I'm<00:06:26.969> you<00:06:27.330> jump<00:06:27.659> and<00:06:27.870> you<00:06:28.500> just

dying in case I'm you jump and you just

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.309 
dying in case I'm you jump and you just
you<00:06:28.830> basically<00:06:29.190> stop<00:06:29.520> losing<00:06:29.940> health<00:06:30.120> or<00:06:30.419> if

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
to get on there sometimes it doesn't

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.209

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.309 
jump now those would look terrifying at
first<00:06:55.919> but<00:06:56.460> don't<00:06:56.759> worry<00:06:56.969> every<00:06:57.210> single<00:06:57.839> leap

00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319
