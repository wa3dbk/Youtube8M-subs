00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 the Argentine Olympic and the change of 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.400
 epoch and if the change of epoch is 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.710
 developer before our athletes 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.440
 they received almost no support before what you 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.760
 stop thinking gives you a bit of anger 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.160
 how much can be done so that 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.080
 we can train more calm and not 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.600
 it's always silver I could teach 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.710
 lamps of light today is going to be technical 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.199
 3 o'clock in the afternoon because at five o'clock 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.869
 as in sending us we could not see there was no 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.880
 Lamparitas had one in garrocho up 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.760
 the pit on the floor where I have here 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.120
 the right one can not see I did not have the bulb 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.120
 of light 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:45.110
 exactly the same the machines are 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.420
 broken for two years 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.449
 and the posture all the people that we 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.329
 they supported or the people of the Olympic committee 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.059
 Argentine who does not let us miss anything the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.160
 people who have supported us to make a 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.469
 preparation in the best way and the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.300
 determinant for the future of the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.549
 Argentine sport can qualify to 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.300
 four years or six years that did not previously 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.770
 there was 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.500
 the support to the secretariat also of 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.330
 sports before and I think this is the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.550
 better reflection that today have these 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.120
 olympic games of an argentina that does not 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.670
 has all the support you need up to 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.180
 that often we do not say there either 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.660
 do not get with the situation that is the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.000
 country I wish I did not have more support but but 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:35.070
 good is better and the best to the lionesses 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.050
 they receive a salary an income for being 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:44.280
 training on the clean team and not 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:46.620
 talking about sport and lennar that the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.150
 It's true that this also helps you 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.490
 you can make the decision and say 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.380
 I'm staying here, I'm dedicated to this or 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.110
 I am perhaps to me has passed me 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.120
 I worked all my life the last two 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.240
 years I could not work and dedicate myself a hundred 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.360
 percent to that 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.880
 this gentleman did not bring the tacho that is 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.649
 taxi driver he is there but of the five 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.470
 years besides being a taxi driver that those now 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.290
 it's judo like to separate over time 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.660
 between the taxi and it's difficult because the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.000
 Amateur sport life already implies 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.209
 also part that studies working 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.170
 because a sport we do not live 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.780
 specifically what we gain in the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.170
 sport because I do not put money in the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.330
 sport the support said now federico vos 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.069
 You can with the scholarships that you receive live from 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.569
 swimming or you have to dedicate yourself to 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.270
 another secondary thing 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.700
 and let's say 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.480
 I tell sports and scholarships in 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.570
 week 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:49.520
 2010 pretty much fill the secretary 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:51.870
 sport and never 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.780
 in precarious conditions what of you 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.560
 it was a feat without support without money like 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.560
 we spain 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.310
 there was little money 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.040
 the support of now have policy 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.950
 sports have scholarships have poetry 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.360
 to point to brazil silos and manage it and 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.739
 the money reaches the athletes 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.720
 as it is now appears all indicate 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.920
 they are very well they are happy and you 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.840
 talk to them because what do we do 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.580
 us next night they are 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.830
 paying in term is fine what you 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.769
 dan can live with this while there are 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.090
 that support them then they are very well and 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.459
 point to four years ahead 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.870
 we can of the nation look sir 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.510
 indications is not now a job to 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.810
 conscience that deserves to be evaluated and 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.850
 congratulated good here they have it before me 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.950
 I think it's pullback it's the fault of not 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.360
 We have a structure to buy 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.690
 the olympic games and bowling then he 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.000
 you put structures at disposal we have 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.010
 many more possibilities the support of 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.360
 now and now to be inar because 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.880
 as well 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.370
 gives the economic support of this sport 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.900
 it is good to train with a clear head 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.790
 this towards that competition that you're going to 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.330
 have the money to go and that what is 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.460
 well before in the Olympics we did not 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.370
 is following well as well as to dictate 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.110
 it's not more or less that you can not 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.550
 invest in sports without investing before 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.989
 in health and education as a 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:20.220
 consequence and put it said now 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.220
 We are a very good preparation 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.210
 after dinner that and so little time 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.210
 he made so many changes
