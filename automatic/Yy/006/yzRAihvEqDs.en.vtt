 and it is also that he stopped some releases 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.850
 in this area the series x of her that is also 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.930
 nostalgic or thinking camera face 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.690
 old 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.620
 the two of them have this kind of 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.050
 appearance or important cameras and 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:59.810
 also has nothing like that in the most 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.250
 in that 50 140 28 which is a 56 millimeter 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.130
 1.2 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.850
 the Nikkei but the canon also released this 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.650
 list that is a hd in the clouds nor alienou 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.560
 inside the internet so must have a 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.010
 server here they made this server 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.840
 to know the abbey and to put you 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.370
 your photos there right? 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.870
 if you save the images as such with 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.590
 sure you have to pay, right? 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.739
 grace you get 10 gigas of space and get 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:35.480
 It was worth 50 gigs and the prize was lifeless. 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.609
 then you have to pay and as it stands 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.940
 internet a server 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:44.120
 this is very dangerous these spaces 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.269
 of stock within the internet so they 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.609
 are very easy to focus on they have 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.590
 many facilities so to break 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.470
 these coins so very few people 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:59.209
 trust it today and we saw it in the 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:02.660
 year to apple you here aaron the passwords 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.819
 there Dodo and Claudio took all the 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.219
 celebrity photos 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.099
 they were naked or will also know by 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:12.829
 Someone puts some very 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:15.079
 her private use within the 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.079
 inside the internet you have to know that 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:22.940
 extremely insecure that it is also the 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:28.030
 canon here launch this 404 otto en 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:32.240
 monde letter reads and this 2465 here plus one 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.889
 2428 here sony also released these 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.240
 lenses here that alpha 7s that too né 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.300
 and sony has invested heavily 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.389
 in this type of lens that is controlled by 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.110
 this smartphone days you download an app 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:50.810
 that sony and he controls these lenses 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.699
 no this lens she has sensors here 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.190
 inside it works like a camera but 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:58.070
 does not have an lcd or anything then the lcd 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.080
 ends up turning your smartphone over 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.690
 like na or pro is the same thing too 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.210
 you can not download an app for yourself 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.789
 It controls the camera did not serve him 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.880
 is filming by the smartphone 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.979
 and this type of lens here from Sony is 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.009
 exactly in it you can even 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:18.349
 join on the smartphone is to stay 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.330
 hanging on your smartphone as you can 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.729
 leave this lens hidden in some 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.690
 place because it works the athlete then 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:29.180
 it does still work out for whatever 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.729
 which is the maximum distance of the blade but 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.740
 up to about 10 15 meters for sure he 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.990
 works fine then the lens can 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.030
 stay hidden and you somewhere else 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.220
 controlling this lens is not 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.440
 this network brand that is also what makes 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.789
 camcorders also launched this network 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:49.430
 dragon aqsiq movie on 6 carla does 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:53.080
 second frames per second in resolution 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:56.330
 maximum than in 1966 pixels on lone then 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.240
 no images per second in quality 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:04.070
 This is quite a lot and he has 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.750
 this six-khaki video and probably 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:11.690
 Face the fuck this here is not that 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:13.669
 He does not have any price here. 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.250
 which is priceless but at least is very 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.840
 expensive and a camera has quite beautiful and 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.070
 it's quite different 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:24.320
 here she is with 24 70 of the good canon 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.590
 This is all for a camera. 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.900
 of this type so do video on 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.639
 4k at least this already has to have a 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.320
 computer with enough memory to 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:37.690
 enough memory to video card and 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.570
 enough ram and a processor 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:44.120
 so i7 core is fast and good to eat 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:48.770
 fast even because otherwise not enough to 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:52.070
 to be able to use the file that this type of 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.849
 camera produce and the rest think it's just 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.880
 that 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:57.860
 otherwise there was no 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.240
 very different 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:03.770
 nothing had none at launch 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.110
 who made everyone stay silent 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.930
 open but several cameras have been launched 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.000
 with a few improvements right? 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.969
 the government still has something else 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.339
 because it closes only on the 21st is and may 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:18.650
 be that there is still some other 

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:20.719
 type of release is difficult but can 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.000
 to appear in some other type of 

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:24.529
 camera the news there then that 's it 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.930
