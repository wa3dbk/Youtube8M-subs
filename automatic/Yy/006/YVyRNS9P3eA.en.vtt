slides into the back and they form a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.729 
slides into the back and they form a
fairly<00:00:33.480> complete<00:00:33.719> jet<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.590> like

jet<00:00:37.829> mode<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.610> because<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.879> fills<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.239> that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
jet mode just because it fills in that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.200 
jet mode just because it fills in that
spacious<00:00:40.440> back<00:00:40.649> area<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:42.000> pull

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
spacious back area and you pull

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.450

the<00:00:47.760> wings<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.379> reason<00:00:49.620> why<00:00:49.739> is

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the wings up like that the reason why is

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.400 
the wings up like that the reason why is
because<00:00:49.890> he<00:00:50.190> has<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.460> kind<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.620> tank<00:00:52.620> mode<00:00:52.890> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
gun around to the top like this and then

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.930 
gun around to the top like this and then
press<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.780> button<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.680> back<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.879> that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
will spring out the tank treads and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.090 
will spring out the tank treads and
really<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.869> tank<00:01:10.080> trends<00:01:10.350> look<00:01:10.470> very<00:01:10.710> flat

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100

really the tank trends look very flat
and<00:01:11.490> fake<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.810> he<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> triple<00:01:14.880> changer<00:01:15.180> I

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
and fake so he is a triple changer I

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.359 
and fake so he is a triple changer I
won't<00:01:17.610> say<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.909> looks<00:01:18.119> horrible<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:19.790> it<00:01:20.790> does

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369

of<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.439> set<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.720> done<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> smoke<00:01:28.200> can

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
of this set is done in the smoke can

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.060 
of this set is done in the smoke can
hang<00:01:30.270> all<00:01:30.600> around<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.530> nice<00:01:31.740> it's

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
and then to transform into robot mode

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.010 
and then to transform into robot mode
just<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.850> my<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> way<00:01:42.210> put<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> wings<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
side you will pull a DS up and rotate

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.800 
side you will pull a DS up and rotate
them<00:01:50.430> down<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.180> will<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.479> them<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.780> of

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
them down and this will get them out of

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.370 
them down and this will get them out of
the<00:01:51.930> way<00:01:53.210> you<00:01:54.210> will<00:01:54.360> fold<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.810> panel<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:56.299> fold

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
the way you will fold this panel up fold

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.209 
the way you will fold this panel up fold
you<00:01:58.380> gone<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.890> and<00:02:00.320> fold<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.439> up<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.920> get

you gone in and fold it up like that get

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.469 
you gone in and fold it up like that get
out<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.549> way<00:02:03.170> fold<00:02:04.170> up<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.439> tank<00:02:04.649> treads

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
out of the way fold up the tank treads

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.960 
out of the way fold up the tank treads
pull<00:02:06.479> down<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.020> toes<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.520> tank<00:02:08.729> tracks

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
down the toes pull these out and

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.810 
down the toes pull these out and
down<00:02:14.660> Alton<00:02:15.660> down<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.580> then<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.700> won't

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
down Alton down and then you won't

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.760 
down Alton down and then you won't
rotate<00:02:18.030> them<00:02:18.480> into<00:02:19.230> place<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.560> they<00:02:19.650> will

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
rotate them into place and they will

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.980 
rotate them into place and they will
snap<00:02:20.070> in<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:21.420> that's<00:02:21.600> actually<00:02:21.750> pretty

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
snap in and that's actually pretty

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.450 
snap in and that's actually pretty
clever<00:02:22.230> i<00:02:22.410> like<00:02:22.620> how<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.830> legs<00:02:23.100> fell<00:02:23.370> into

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
clever i like how the legs fell into

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.010 
clever i like how the legs fell into
place<00:02:23.610> especially<00:02:23.910> since<00:02:24.300> alex<00:02:24.630> have<00:02:24.750> quite<00:02:24.990> a

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
place especially since alex have quite a

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.830 
place especially since alex have quite a
bit<00:02:25.200> pose<00:02:25.380> ability<00:02:26.270> but<00:02:28.220> well<00:02:29.220> anyway<00:02:29.840> you

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840

hard<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.530> get<00:02:37.740> honestly<00:02:38.520> it's<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:38.730> easier<00:02:39.180> to

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
hard to get honestly it's just easier to

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.440 
hard to get honestly it's just easier to
pull<00:02:40.260> them<00:02:40.410> out<00:02:40.500> yourself<00:02:41.210> especially<00:02:42.210> if<00:02:42.270> you

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
pull them out yourself especially if you

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.660 
pull them out yourself especially if you
I<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:44.540> make<00:02:45.540> monster<00:02:45.960> hands<00:02:46.170> like<00:02:46.380> either

and then rotate this chest section down

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.140 
and then rotate this chest section down
and<00:02:49.860> while<00:02:49.980> you're<00:02:50.100> doing<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.400> fold<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:50.790> head

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
and while you're doing it fold this head

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.610 
and while you're doing it fold this head
out<00:02:51.300> here<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:53.570> then<00:02:54.570> pull<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.140> arms<00:02:55.440> out<00:02:55.590> to

out here and then pull the arms out to

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.460 
out here and then pull the arms out to
the<00:02:55.770> side<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:57.150> pull<00:02:57.450> these<00:02:57.690> panels<00:02:59.180> out<00:03:00.470> while

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
being careful not to pull them off is

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.760 
being careful not to pull them off is
mechanism<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.080> they<00:03:04.200> use<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.440> UM<00:03:05.240> slide<00:03:06.240> out

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
mechanism that they use to UM slide out

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.640 
mechanism that they use to UM slide out
also<00:03:07.770> lets<00:03:07.980> them<00:03:08.220> come<00:03:08.430> off<00:03:09.410> although<00:03:10.410> if<00:03:10.530> you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
also lets them come off although if you
