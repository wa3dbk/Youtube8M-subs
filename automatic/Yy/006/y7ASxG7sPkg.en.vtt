00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
you have to be careful for now next I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.839 
you have to be careful for now next I
want<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.080> talk<00:02:24.260> about<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:25.010> technical<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:25.760> is

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
want to talk about the technical this is

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.330 
want to talk about the technical this is
the<00:02:25.940> Karen<00:02:26.269> technical<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:26.989> I<00:02:27.650> find<00:02:28.069> that<00:02:28.160> the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
the Karen technical and I find that the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.910 
the Karen technical and I find that the
fire<00:02:28.580> rate<00:02:28.819> is<00:02:28.849> a<00:02:29.030> little<00:02:29.390> bit<00:02:29.480> lower<00:02:29.750> this<00:02:30.680> I

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
fire rate is a little bit lower this I

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.360 
fire rate is a little bit lower this I
do<00:02:30.980> believe<00:02:31.550> is<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.819> 50<00:02:32.300> Cal<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:33.370> resemblance

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
do believe is a 50 Cal this resemblance

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.540 
do believe is a 50 Cal this resemblance
to<00:02:34.580> 50<00:02:34.880> Cal<00:02:35.120> anti-air<00:02:35.989> guns<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:37.250> were
