no<00:03:35.250> doubt<00:03:36.380> but<00:03:37.380> yeah<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.190> would<00:03:38.790> have<00:03:38.880> felt

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
no doubt but yeah I I would have felt

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.070 
no doubt but yeah I I would have felt
bad<00:03:39.090> about<00:03:39.210> that<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.940> process<00:03:42.390> has<00:03:42.420> been<00:03:42.780> very

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
bad about that the process has been very

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.990 
bad about that the process has been very
rewarding<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.680> I'd<00:03:43.950> say<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.310> transformation

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
rewarding and I'd say the transformation

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.680 
rewarding and I'd say the transformation
has<00:03:45.120> been<00:03:45.300> successful<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:48.360> most<00:03:48.540> difficult

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
has been successful the most difficult

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.830 
has been successful the most difficult
part<00:03:48.990> was<00:03:49.200> taking<00:03:49.650> away<00:03:49.770> his<00:03:49.920> need<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.160> sleep

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
part was taking away his need to sleep

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.590 
part was taking away his need to sleep
eat<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:54.800> mate<00:03:55.800> as<00:03:56.070> those<00:03:56.730> are<00:03:56.880> all<00:03:57.030> primal

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
eat and mate as those are all primal

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:08.120 
eat and mate as those are all primal
urges<00:03:57.840> hardwired<00:03:58.620> into<00:03:58.950> our<00:03:58.980> DNA<00:03:59.070> as<00:03:59.550> mammals

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.850 

you<00:04:08.790> may<00:04:08.940> look<00:04:09.270> and<00:04:09.570> sound<00:04:10.020> like<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.440> old<00:04:10.590> chip
