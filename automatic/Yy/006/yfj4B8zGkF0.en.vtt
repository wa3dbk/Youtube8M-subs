00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
two times a week I think that's

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.720 
two times a week I think that's
depending<00:02:22.830> on<00:02:22.920> like<00:02:23.099> your<00:02:23.250> skin<00:02:23.430> like<00:02:23.580> if

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
depending on like your skin like if

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.370 
depending on like your skin like if
you're<00:02:23.819> really<00:02:24.030> oily<00:02:24.180> or<00:02:24.599> have<00:02:24.750> like<00:02:24.959> lots<00:02:25.290> of

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
you're really oily or have like lots of

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.710 
you're really oily or have like lots of
blackheads<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:26.280> dryer<00:02:26.580> skins<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.330> probably

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
blackheads for dryer skins I probably

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.270 
blackheads for dryer skins I probably
wouldn't<00:02:27.989> recommend<00:02:28.230> more<00:02:28.709> than<00:02:28.860> once<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.160> week

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
wouldn't recommend more than once a week

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.130 
wouldn't recommend more than once a week

could have enough so I could really see
if<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:46.980> liked<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.810> loved<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.139> don't<00:03:49.650> like<00:03:49.680> um

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
if I liked it I loved it I don't like um

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.240 
if I liked it I loved it I don't like um
it<00:03:51.120> smoothes<00:03:51.900> out<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:52.380> whole<00:03:52.709> entire<00:03:53.010> area

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
it smoothes out the whole entire area

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.330 
it smoothes out the whole entire area
that<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:54.150> put<00:03:54.450> on<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:55.139> Butthead<00:03:55.829> remover<00:03:56.160> and

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
that you put on the Butthead remover and

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.879 
that you put on the Butthead remover and
it<00:03:57.090> really<00:03:57.420> does<00:03:57.569> draw<00:03:58.079> out<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.560> blackheads

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
it really does draw out the blackheads

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.789 
it really does draw out the blackheads
and<00:03:59.160> I've<00:03:59.850> noticed<00:04:00.120> my<00:04:00.389> chin<00:04:01.109> sometimes<00:04:01.680> it

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
and I've noticed my chin sometimes it

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.759 
and I've noticed my chin sometimes it
doesn't<00:04:01.950> like<00:04:02.160> get<00:04:02.340> all<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.609> blackheads<00:04:02.819> out

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
doesn't like get all the blackheads out

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.590 
doesn't like get all the blackheads out
but<00:04:04.769> it<00:04:05.160> does<00:04:05.700> bring<00:04:05.910> them<00:04:06.150> more<00:04:06.389> to<00:04:06.510> the

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
but it does bring them more to the

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.140 
but it does bring them more to the
surface<00:04:06.959> so<00:04:07.079> you<00:04:07.109> can<00:04:07.410> extract<00:04:07.859> them<00:04:08.150> so

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
surface so you can extract them so

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.660 
surface so you can extract them so
that's<00:04:10.049> awesome<00:04:10.290> even<00:04:10.920> though<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.430> hate

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
that's awesome even though I hate

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.229 
that's awesome even though I hate
extracting<00:04:12.569> blackheads<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:14.010> all<00:04:14.819> that

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
extracting blackheads and all that

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.420 
extracting blackheads and all that
craziness<00:04:15.569> and<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:15.840> go<00:04:15.959> but<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.799> actually<00:04:16.979> takes

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
craziness and I go but it actually takes

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.360 
craziness and I go but it actually takes
takes<00:04:18.239> out<00:04:18.479> blackheads<00:04:18.959> way<00:04:19.380> more<00:04:19.739> than<00:04:20.100> other
