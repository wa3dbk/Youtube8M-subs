couldn't<00:00:40.840> even<00:00:40.899> tell<00:00:41.110> you<00:00:41.230> what<00:00:41.789> what<00:00:42.789> it<00:00:42.910> is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
couldn't even tell you what what it is

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.610 
couldn't even tell you what what it is
but<00:00:43.180> there<00:00:43.329> will<00:00:43.420> be<00:00:43.480> a<00:00:43.539> link<00:00:43.809> in<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.110> blog<00:00:44.260> or

description<00:00:45.690> for<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.780> motor<00:00:47.379> controller<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
description for the motor controller and

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.930 
description for the motor controller and
it<00:00:49.090> controls<00:00:49.480> all<00:00:49.780> there's<00:00:50.170> four<00:00:50.649> motors<00:00:51.129> on

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
it controls all there's four motors on

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.049 
it controls all there's four motors on
one<00:00:52.480> for<00:00:52.780> each<00:00:52.840> corner<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:54.309> each<00:00:54.730> size

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
one for each corner and each size

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.619 
one for each corner and each size
controlled<00:00:56.129> exactly<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.280> same<00:00:57.609> so<00:00:58.210> I<00:00:58.239> didn't

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
controlled exactly the same so I didn't

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.400 
controlled exactly the same so I didn't
need<00:01:00.359> essentially<00:01:01.359> for<00:01:01.600> motor<00:01:01.870> controllers

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
need essentially for motor controllers

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.009 
need essentially for motor controllers
this<00:01:02.590> one<00:01:02.829> can<00:01:03.250> shoot<00:01:03.460> control<00:01:03.940> too<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.930> I

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
this one can shoot control too and I

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.420 
this one can shoot control too and I
just<00:01:05.229> split<00:01:05.830> each<00:01:06.040> motor<00:01:06.880> into<00:01:07.270> two<00:01:07.479> motors

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
just split each motor into two motors

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.940 
just split each motor into two motors
for<00:01:09.430> each<00:01:09.490> side<00:01:10.409> let's<00:01:11.409> take<00:01:11.500> a<00:01:11.560> look<00:01:11.830> at

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
for each side let's take a look at

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.920 
for each side let's take a look at
what's<00:01:12.130> going<00:01:12.369> on<00:01:12.490> soft<00:01:12.939> to<00:01:13.210> software<00:01:14.049> wide

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
what's going on soft to software wide

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.440 
what's going on soft to software wide
okay<00:01:16.930> four<00:01:17.799> numbers<00:01:18.130> are<00:01:18.280> being<00:01:18.400> showed<00:01:18.850> right

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
okay four numbers are being showed right

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
okay four numbers are being showed right
there<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:21.570> depending<00:01:22.570> on<00:01:22.689> how<00:01:23.020> I<00:01:23.049> move<00:01:23.409> a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
there and depending on how I move a

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:32.880 
there and depending on how I move a
joystick<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:29.590> will<00:01:31.170> will<00:01:32.170> change<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.590> numbers

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
joystick it will will change the numbers

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.800 
joystick it will will change the numbers
on<00:01:33.040> there<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:35.020> so<00:01:35.740> there's<00:01:35.979> a<00:01:36.040> laptop<00:01:36.610> where<00:01:37.600> to

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
on there so so there's a laptop where to

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.850 
on there so so there's a laptop where to
the<00:01:37.930> joystick<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.990> is<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:43.860> being

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
the joystick and this is just being

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.459 
the joystick and this is just being
controlled<00:01:45.219> by<00:01:45.280> bluetooth<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:49.140> if<00:01:50.140> we<00:01:50.229> can<00:01:50.350> get

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469 
controlled by bluetooth so if we can get

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:59.430 
controlled by bluetooth so if we can get
everything<00:01:50.619> in<00:01:50.979> here

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.230 

so<00:02:00.440> yeah<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.770> can<00:02:00.950> see<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.160> can<00:02:01.400> be<00:02:02.440> controlled

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
so yeah you can see it can be controlled

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.570 
so yeah you can see it can be controlled
wirelessly<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:06.790> can't<00:02:07.790> really<00:02:09.280> show<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.340> both

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
wirelessly I can't really show you both

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:27.780 
wirelessly I can't really show you both
but<00:02:10.850> I<00:02:10.940> can<00:02:12.460> put<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.550> controller<00:02:13.820> down<00:02:15.100> and

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.420 

having<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.820> lot<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.090> trouble<00:02:29.570> there<00:02:30.070> one<00:02:31.070> track

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
having a lot of trouble there one track

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.750 
having a lot of trouble there one track
is<00:02:31.640> coming<00:02:32.330> off<00:02:32.450> every<00:02:32.690> time<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:32.960> go<00:02:33.110> anywhere

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
is coming off every time I go anywhere

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.680 
is coming off every time I go anywhere
not<00:02:34.760> sure<00:02:34.970> what's<00:02:35.120> up<00:02:35.240> with<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.390> i'm<00:02:35.570> going

not sure what's up with that i'm going
to<00:02:35.750> try<00:02:35.900> adjusting<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.470> tracks<00:02:36.770> maybe<00:02:37.130> there

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
to try adjusting the tracks maybe there

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.360 
to try adjusting the tracks maybe there
there<00:02:37.970> little<00:02:38.090> boat<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.960> or<00:02:39.560> out<00:02:39.740> or<00:02:39.980> something

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
the track so i'm not sure what what

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.270 
the track so i'm not sure what what
that's<00:02:46.850> doing<00:02:47.180> but<00:02:47.510> yeah<00:02:47.690> using<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.830> logitech

the retreat all the information and from
there<00:03:21.530> goes<00:03:21.800> out<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.820> motor<00:03:23.060> controller

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
there goes out to the motor controller

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.400 
there goes out to the motor controller
depending<00:03:24.140> on<00:03:24.260> what<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.130> inputs<00:03:25.520> are<00:03:25.700> and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
depending on what the inputs are and

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.890 
depending on what the inputs are and
that<00:03:27.410> controls<00:03:28.480> controls<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.900> motor<00:03:30.110> so<00:03:31.900> i'll

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
that controls controls the motor so i'll

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:51.880 
that controls controls the motor so i'll
just<00:03:32.930> drive<00:03:33.320> her<00:03:33.470> a<00:03:33.500> little<00:03:33.680> bit<00:03:33.860> here<00:03:34.070> for<00:03:34.340> you

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:04:00.920 

it's<00:03:52.890> uh<00:03:53.190> it's<00:03:54.110> pretty<00:03:55.110> cool<00:03:59.600> working<00:04:00.600> pretty

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
it's uh it's pretty cool working pretty

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.630 
it's uh it's pretty cool working pretty
well<00:04:01.050> very<00:04:01.740> responsive<00:04:03.530> as<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:04.740> can<00:04:04.920> see

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.710 

definitely<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.670> fun<00:04:08.790> project<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.300> think<00:04:09.330> next

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
definitely a fun project I think next

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.160 
definitely a fun project I think next
I'm<00:04:09.870> going<00:04:09.990> to<00:04:10.050> try<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.290> make<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:12.080> look<00:04:13.080> a

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
I'm going to try to make it look a

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.560 
I'm going to try to make it look a
little<00:04:13.260> nicer<00:04:13.530> it's<00:04:14.370> quite<00:04:14.850> a<00:04:14.880> mess<00:04:15.210> right<00:04:15.510> now

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
little nicer it's quite a mess right now

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.280 
little nicer it's quite a mess right now
but<00:04:16.250> it's<00:04:17.250> all<00:04:17.400> because<00:04:17.640> i'm<00:04:17.760> using<00:04:17.790> this

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
but it's all because i'm using this

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.620 
but it's all because i'm using this
prototyping<00:04:19.290> board<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.769> as<00:04:20.160> soon<00:04:20.340> as<00:04:20.489> i<00:04:20.640> can

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
prototyping board and as soon as i can

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.570 
prototyping board and as soon as i can
start<00:04:21.870> soldering<00:04:22.109> some<00:04:22.620> actual<00:04:23.100> components

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
start soldering some actual components

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.450 
start soldering some actual components
in<00:04:23.940> will<00:04:24.360> be<00:04:24.540> able<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:24.860> reduce<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.010> size<00:04:26.220> and

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
in will be able to reduce the size and

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.510 
in will be able to reduce the size and
maybe<00:04:26.850> even<00:04:27.000> get<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.420> in<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:28.400> inside<00:04:29.400> the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
maybe even get it in the inside the

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.410 
maybe even get it in the inside the
bottom<00:04:29.880> pan<00:04:30.620> mm<00:04:31.620> but<00:04:31.770> yeah<00:04:31.920> that's<00:04:32.150> that's<00:04:33.150> the

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
bottom pan mm but yeah that's that's the

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.330 
bottom pan mm but yeah that's that's the
rundown<00:04:34.820> thanks<00:04:35.820> for<00:04:35.970> watching
