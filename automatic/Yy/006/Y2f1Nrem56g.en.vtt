00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.780
 good afternoon then we are going to 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.360
 bet then how to access the bases of 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.619
 data from the atlantic university we're going 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.160
 first then to the page of the 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:21.000
 university university of atlantic 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.430
 it's an atlantic dot.com that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.170
 so we find on the main page 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.440
 the main memory to choose the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.720
 first option campus cite shows up 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.500
 the start transaction option 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.199
 safe on our campus and here then 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.690
 we wrote our bar and password a 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.879
 Once inside we have two icons 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.859
 leading one in the management area and 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.530
 another in the service area we do 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.659
 click on the service area that we 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.520
 refers to the virtual libraries of 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:54.370
 the university the atlantic 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.110
 here we find all the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.980
 databases to the extra university 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.780
 it is subscribed or has access 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.700
 so to be able to enter these bases 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.090
 of data we have to take into account two 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.400
 important items in local access a 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.659
 remote access to databases the 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.640
 access to channels when only 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.680
 we can access the databases 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.560
 within a computer in the network of the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.729
 university the remote access is when 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.340
 we can do from any 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.800
 computer as long as we do 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.160
 access to the campus 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.830
 that corresponds to us we see then that 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.110
 of local access can only be in 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.030
 university computers and access 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.250
 remote can be from our 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.730
 computers as we know then 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.920
 when it is local or remote access 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.070
 and we found the column type of access 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.900
 where each one of the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.810
 Accesses available for each of the 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.330
 database options are to be 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.190
 local and remote or that is only local 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.850
 or remote 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.610
 We also emphasize two aspects 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.160
 important the databases that are 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.740
 by subscription, which are the ones 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.229
 university pays a membership so that 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.630
 we can have access to them and 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.330
 the free access databases that 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.490
 are the ones that we can consult 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.420
 any time at any time without 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.680
 that there is some truth in 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.860
 Our university does not have to pay 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.820
 no money let's have an example 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.340
 we access the base proposed this base 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.470
 of data has more than 27 bases of 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.610
 annexed data and has 99 thematic areas 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.030
 we choose science and technology 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.690
 it feels does not guide us refers to 9 base 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.030
 of data specifically for this area 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.800
 true here we can see it we can do 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.990
 a search only because having in 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.720
 account keywords we are going to look for 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.260
 and we found a whole list of 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.550
 results more than 900 results according to 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.970
 tell us the search engine 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.890
 let's click to see in this in this 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.450
 Article 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.580
 we click 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.650
 once we click we have the title 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.440
 complete the authors 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.250
 we have the summary and we have the text 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.250
 full article 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.640
 on the page 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.430
 of internet we have here all the 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.190
 article all its extension 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.310
 if we want to save in the computer 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.380
 we will save as pdf 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.319
 here we have an important city that 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.569
 is that we can include appointments 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.819
 bibliographic and we can quote 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.670
 depending on what our standard is 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.370
 use we have the rules to for 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.940
 chicago standards the standards of the 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.530
 Institute technical standards from Brazil 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.510
 we have made them 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.300
 let's work with the apas this time we are going to 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.710
 continue a pop-up window comes up 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.110
 where simply it will be downloaded 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.340
 our file tells us where we want 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.490
 save it 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.440
 we go to desks 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.800
 we save the file 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.650
 we click on the pdf file and 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.620
 we found this pdf that is the article 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.629
 as such but 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.409
 still retains the same format as 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:32.689
 we have on the internet how can you see 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:37.879
 also the title of the authors comes out 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:40.710
 the full text that are 17 pages 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:43.910
 we see here of speed 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.680
 and finally the bibliography comes out 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.710
 taking into account the layers norms that 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.930
 causes currents now if we want the 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.630
 original article 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.300
 in the right box to exit option 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.000
 pdf we click 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.599
 and then we click on the option 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.500
 open with the pdf reader is the 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:10.320
 option to save with again we are going to 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:13.020
 desk and we keep 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.540
 we click on a pdf and we have 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.770
 access to the original version of the 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.110
 Article 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.650
 true with the graphic with 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.840
 with the tables that he originally manages 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.840
 the article true 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.610
 here along we go seeing and 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.020
 we also find the bibliography that 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.479
 used to make this article 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.770
 remember that for this to exist 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.080
 option 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.629
 download 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.370
 of the original article has to exist 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:48.240
 in the right box the option to 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.840
 full texts pdf 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.310
 well we can go back to quote for 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.980
 quote 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.650
 we can choose any of the 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.500
 previously mentioned standards 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:05.520
 we simply update the standard 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:08.889
 we go to where it says change and the basis of 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.499
 data immediately generates us 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.280
 the appointment taking into account the style that 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:16.770
 we 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.770
 we can copy open word 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.430
 and paste and we have the appointment taking 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.580
 consider the style to stop this 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.400
 edition that was the one that we chose already 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.320
 we can work without complicating the 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.450
 life both with and quote 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.730
 here is the example of ISO standards that 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.070
 they referred like this with text first surnames 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:40.100
 in uppercase and we can copy 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.760
 as well 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.970
 work with different standards 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.970
 we go back to 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.770
 the results page 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.840
 and we can go see amount of 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.529
 articles that refer to the words 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.689
 keys that we visit have 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:00.029
 there are many more than 10 results 

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:02.639
 pages with with results that refer 

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:05.819
 to articles of magazines articles 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:07.229
 scientists and simply because this is 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:10.469
 one of the databases that we wanted 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:13.439
 show him so they can see that yes 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:16.139
 exist and if they serve the database of 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:18.349
 the university so third we close 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:22.009
 fields on a university page 

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:22.009
 well thank you very much
