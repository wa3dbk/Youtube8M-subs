00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
see these a lot different the colors a

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.690 
see these a lot different the colors a
little<00:02:06.470> bit<00:02:06.650> different<00:02:07.100> than<00:02:07.189> what<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.400> seen

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
little bit different than what you seen

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.380 
little bit different than what you seen
in<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:07.909> photo<00:02:08.239> because<00:02:09.940> copper<00:02:10.940> naturally

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
in the photo because copper naturally

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.930 
in the photo because copper naturally
oxidizes<00:02:12.080> when<00:02:12.260> it's<00:02:12.410> like<00:02:12.620> exposed<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.760> any

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
oxidizes when it's like exposed to any

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.270 
oxidizes when it's like exposed to any
type<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.209> like<00:02:14.570> natural<00:02:15.019> air<00:02:15.470> or<00:02:15.769> oxygen<00:02:15.920> or

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
type of like natural air or oxygen or

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.550 
type of like natural air or oxygen or
whatever<00:02:16.549> so<00:02:17.239> it<00:02:17.510> will<00:02:17.840> change<00:02:18.080> color<00:02:18.170> that's

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
whatever so it will change color that's

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.979 
whatever so it will change color that's
the<00:02:18.739> thing<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.070> makes<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.400> copper<00:02:20.150> unique

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
the thing that makes a copper unique

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.050 
the thing that makes a copper unique
because<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.590> off<00:02:21.920> stars<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.519> mix<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.850> has<00:02:23.030> a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
because it off stars in the mix it has a

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.410 
because it off stars in the mix it has a
nice<00:02:23.780> like<00:02:23.989> aged<00:02:24.260> type<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.820> look<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:26.329> it

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
nice like aged type of look to it so it

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.970 
nice like aged type of look to it so it
almost<00:02:26.600> looks<00:02:26.810> like<00:02:26.870> like<00:02:27.170> antique<00:02:27.680> what<00:02:27.860> it's
