00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.099
 here comes here to tutorial or today 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.480
 Only one explanation for virtual dj 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.469
 the free edition she is 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.910
 probably most of you 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.410
 have downloaded today the job com 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.289
 or in the mac app store for the mac 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.289
 delete djs for mac and used ones 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:29.519
 usable comes with a stripped down 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.800
 version in the free version and thus 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.710
 a surface with the beginner first 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.710
 work can already be played here 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.610
 it is not my case but for the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.780
 most of it is really one 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.719
 program with which you get in very well 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.920
 can 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.230
 Today I want to make no tutorial 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.170
 but just explain what 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.980
 specialities what it is in german songs 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.510
 and what can I do the first time ? 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:08.549
 starts the free version you have one 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.659
 Deck two deck and a mixer then mix 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.790
 You can end up in the middle 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.080
 cut through metric so it reflects 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.040
 here once for dakar 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.060
 what we see the color blue for this 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.900
 deck b here again the the master 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.890
 go or master output here the game 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:37.890
 for the dfb and here in skane 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:42.420
 for the dkv the level resp 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:48.479
 to have the gang for the ko for the crew 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.299
 here only 33 channel corner quieter or too 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.240
 three signposts with remedies and go 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.490
 here's one level meter one more 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.070
 penalty 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:04.229
 crosstrainer leinfelder the whole one too 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.350
 Normally always built up to the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:12.920
 We have two decks here 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:16.190
 one is again a virtual account 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.610
 action with 110 button play pause button 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.860
 drove a loop station in the button 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:28.520
 Clubs can apply from 1 to 6 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.380
 32 in out everything here have one 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.840
 a series of effects that I can use 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.020
 set sharply if I want 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.610
 just needs to press in and out 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.069
 then activated accordingly for 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.690
 the same goes for the track 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.800
 we already sampled some samplers here 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:52.519
 in it based saxophone and whip 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.930
 dealer bomb that is funny though 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.140
 one now, for example, comes off or so 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.700
 then you can take that too 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.700
 shorten or lengthen or cut 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.709
 So all very funny you have now 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.420
 small to heavy 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.810
 Here you can see the invited track 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.489
 here the name of the track the model of 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.769
 duration 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.180
 with Trojans original mix like them 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.769
 even the time already played 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.739
 has been 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.209
 once the time is still to run 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.900
 but then I have your one pizza 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.280
 display 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.329
 as you can see then changes 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.070
 accordingly here also the uniform 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.540
 then with a click of a light 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.130
 activate that was very long again 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.220
 back is a very funny 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.230
 history can do all this here too 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.000
 change the button at the touch of a button 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:54.220
 then it produces again what we have 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.239
 should invite to the bpm soundtrack 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:01.510
 and I think it knows them 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.390
 you can see that here like every child 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.900
 once here in our mini way from resp 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:12.290
 on our surface and afterwards 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:16.100
 He then bpm number for it all over 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.350
 you had to be useful yourself, you are me 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.739
 that works young as I said the 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.350
 track which one also still 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:30.920
 or four stages 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:34.260
 yes and here practically infinitely 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.260
 virtual dj completely in the browser in that 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.710
 i here once my my system 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.820
 then I can only scan 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:48.150
 porto itunes folder readings tracks can 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.240
 I then just pull with and so per 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.340
 drag and drop just pull over only 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.540
 This is the first overview of 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:01.020
 virtual dj individual tutorials on this 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.470
 free program which is 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.510
 of course also in a pro version there 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.820
 it will be on our youtube-channel too 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.300
 give on our site dj tutorial 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.970
 Of course, probably not 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.070
 Bad program for now 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.140
 look if you ever for station 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.240
 made is whether there further interest 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.640
 or not 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.190
 the refurbishment still a cpu utilization 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.720
 time could be the setting 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.660
 You can go in here different 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.420
 set skins 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:36.000
 in the end, actually everything can 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.710
 switch to four decks here as well 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.090
 looks a bit dumb now 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.700
 the resolution probably also 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.970
 somehow that's fine with me 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.200
 looks 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:55.380
 that should ultimately synonymous 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:57.860
 first fit as well so that's in 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:04.230
 the effect you first of our 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:07.980
 dj tutorial would have been nice here 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:11.190
 I look at four decks then at 1 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:15.440
 4 channel mixer with corresponding three 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:17.760
 way eco quieter oil fields level meter 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.110
 with the corresponding except when I am 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.740
 activate now 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.660
 which decks have which 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.330
 wanted to be controlled and one 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.250
 crossfader as you would expect from a 4 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.870
 channel mixer or folds nothing recognizes 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:35.100
 then, of course, changes here too 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:38.340
 above the settings in the distance 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:41.970
 gmx or the crew on the 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:44.169
 to be on the headphones 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.759
 The arrangement changes a bit 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:51.240
 in the end , but everything is the same 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:57.190
 every now and then back here 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:59.349
 we can in virtual dj free so 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:03.009
 which of these the home edition we can 

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:05.440
 do not work with external devices 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:06.610
 that means we can not know any timecode 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.090
 none 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.380
 dj controller etc use with 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.330
 hang laundry service 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.949
 It is a pure software with which you 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.949
 then over the mouse and keyboard 

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:19.080
 shortcuts will be on ours too 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:22.810
 give website 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:25.570
