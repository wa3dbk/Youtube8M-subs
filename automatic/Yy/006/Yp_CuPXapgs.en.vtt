you the correct techniques for writing

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.470 
you the correct techniques for writing
drop-offs<00:00:19.640> there<00:00:20.640> are<00:00:20.759> a<00:00:20.820> number<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.180> steps

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
drop-offs there are a number of steps

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.200 
drop-offs there are a number of steps
involved<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.169> writing<00:00:22.349> up<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.590> drop-off<00:00:23.210> you

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
involved in writing up a drop-off you

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.429 
involved in writing up a drop-off you
need<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.509> be<00:00:24.570> able<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.840> lift<00:00:24.989> the<00:00:25.140> front<00:00:25.380> wheel

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
need to be able to lift the front wheel

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.589 
need to be able to lift the front wheel
and<00:00:25.770> hold<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.250> up<00:00:26.369> until<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> back<00:00:27.210> wheel<00:00:27.390> goes

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and hold it up until the back wheel goes

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.919 
and hold it up until the back wheel goes
over<00:00:27.929> the<00:00:28.019> drop<00:00:29.210> progression<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.359> teach<00:00:30.660> is

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
over the drop progression we teach is

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.439 
over the drop progression we teach is
front<00:00:31.349> wheel<00:00:31.410> lift<00:00:31.769> then<00:00:32.730> two<00:00:32.879> small<00:00:33.030> drops

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
front wheel lift then two small drops

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.220 
front wheel lift then two small drops
and<00:00:33.720> then<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> larger<00:00:34.260> drops<00:00:35.930> to<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
and then on to larger drops to do the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.540 
and then on to larger drops to do the
lift<00:00:37.470> you<00:00:37.710> start<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.160> short<00:00:38.430> sharp

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
lift you start with short sharp

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.360 
lift you start with short sharp
compression<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.510> forks<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.860> allows<00:00:41.159> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
compression of the forks this allows the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.610 
compression of the forks this allows the
rebound<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.909> help<00:00:42.150> lift<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> wheel<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:43.440> also

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
rebound to help lift the wheel but also

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.910 
rebound to help lift the wheel but also
helps<00:00:44.039> with<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.219> timing<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:44.820> exercise<00:00:45.300> as

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
helps with the timing of the exercise as

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.860 
helps with the timing of the exercise as
the<00:00:46.920> forks<00:00:47.219> rebound<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.969> move<00:00:48.510> your<00:00:48.690> weight

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the forks rebound you move your weight

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.580 
the forks rebound you move your weight
back<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.410> lift<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> front<00:00:50.399> wheel<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:52.260> aim<00:00:52.410> is

to keep this as smooth and fluid as

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.779 
to keep this as smooth and fluid as
possible<00:00:54.649> you<00:00:55.649> need<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.920> keep<00:00:56.070> practicing<00:00:56.309> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
possible you need to keep practicing it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.630 
possible you need to keep practicing it
until<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.570> smoothly<00:00:58.430> once<00:00:59.430> you

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
until you can do it smoothly once you

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.670 
until you can do it smoothly once you
can<00:00:59.820> do<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> front<00:01:00.180> wheel<00:01:00.420> lift<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.230> next<00:01:01.500> step

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
can do a front wheel lift the next step

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.529 
can do a front wheel lift the next step
is<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.980> put<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.160> stick<00:01:02.460> down<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.879> lift<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
is to put a stick down and lift the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.320 
is to put a stick down and lift the
front<00:01:03.780> wheel<00:01:03.929> over<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.880> you<00:01:05.880> need<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.149> be<00:01:06.240> able
