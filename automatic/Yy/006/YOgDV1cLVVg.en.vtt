00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:40.690 

at<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:36.400> went<00:03:37.400> with<00:03:37.550> a<00:03:38.770> LC<00:03:39.770> 1<00:03:39.950> kept<00:03:40.459> having

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
at the went with a LC 1 kept having

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.800 
at the went with a LC 1 kept having
problems<00:03:41.090> with<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:42.010> so<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.040> went<00:03:43.250> with<00:03:43.370> a

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
problems with it so I went with a

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.900 
problems with it so I went with a
autometer<00:03:44.810> system<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.630> seems<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:47.930> be<00:03:48.080> a

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
autometer system and it seems to be a

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.590 
autometer system and it seems to be a
lot<00:03:49.910> better<00:03:49.970> from<00:03:50.360> what<00:03:50.480> I<00:03:50.540> can<00:03:50.630> see<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.110> far<00:03:52.600> at

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
lot better from what I can see so far at

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.190 
lot better from what I can see so far at
to<00:03:54.170> LC<00:03:54.860> 1<00:03:55.069> units<00:03:55.400> go<00:03:55.610> out<00:03:55.790> within<00:03:56.150> a<00:03:56.660> couple

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
to LC 1 units go out within a couple

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.520 
to LC 1 units go out within a couple
months<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.620> each<00:03:57.709> other<00:03:57.830> so<00:03:59.620> i<00:04:00.620> got<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:02.530> Plain

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
months of each other so i got the Plain
