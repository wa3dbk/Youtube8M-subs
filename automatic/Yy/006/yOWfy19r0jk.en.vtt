mobile networks tab now on this
particular<00:01:11.110> device<00:01:11.560> we<00:01:12.010> all<00:01:12.130> have<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.460> 3g<00:01:12.970> but

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
particular device we all have the 3g but

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.360 
particular device we all have the 3g but
on<00:01:13.600> other<00:01:13.780> devices<00:01:14.020> they<00:01:14.860> should<00:01:15.100> come<00:01:15.250> up

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
on other devices they should come up

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.970 
on other devices they should come up
with<00:01:15.430> a<00:01:15.580> mobile<00:01:15.730> networks<00:01:16.240> are<00:01:16.450> standard<00:01:16.980> case

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
with a mobile networks are standard case

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.940 
with a mobile networks are standard case
in<00:01:18.159> point<00:01:18.369> if<00:01:18.579> you<00:01:18.670> don't<00:01:18.700> see<00:01:19.240> this<00:01:19.540> tab<00:01:19.840> here

in point if you don't see this tab here

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.800 
in point if you don't see this tab here
then<00:01:20.950> your<00:01:21.159> tablet<00:01:21.579> is<00:01:21.670> most<00:01:21.880> likely<00:01:22.090> not<00:01:22.240> 3g

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
then your tablet is most likely not 3g

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.410 
then your tablet is most likely not 3g
so<00:01:23.590> once<00:01:23.829> you<00:01:24.040> have<00:01:24.159> a<00:01:24.189> 3g<00:01:24.670> tab<00:01:24.880> you<00:01:25.060> click<00:01:25.299> this

so once you have a 3g tab you click this

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.620 
so once you have a 3g tab you click this
option<00:01:25.570> here<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:27.119> then<00:01:28.119> you've<00:01:28.270> got<00:01:28.390> a<00:01:28.420> range

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
option here and then you've got a range

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.380 
option here and then you've got a range
of<00:01:28.750> options<00:01:29.189> now<00:01:30.189> at<00:01:30.310> this<00:01:30.460> point<00:01:30.790> otherwise

it's done that it will show you 3g icon

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.170 
it's done that it will show you 3g icon
now<00:05:29.620> this<00:05:29.919> can't<00:05:30.250> this<00:05:30.490> process<00:05:30.910> can<00:05:31.120> take

now this can't this process can take

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.330 
now this can't this process can take
probably<00:05:31.660> a<00:05:31.990> minute<00:05:32.380> or<00:05:32.500> two<00:05:32.740> so<00:05:33.070> it's<00:05:33.190> best

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
probably a minute or two so it's best

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.400 
probably a minute or two so it's best
just<00:05:33.460> give<00:05:33.760> it<00:05:33.880> its<00:05:34.000> time<00:05:36.690> ok<00:05:37.690> so<00:05:37.750> once<00:05:38.139> you've

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
just give it its time ok so once you've

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.590 
just give it its time ok so once you've
given<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:38.889> probably<00:05:39.400> two<00:05:39.970> or<00:05:40.000> three<00:05:40.210> minutes

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600
