00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.040
 I'm very good that there are triple map here 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.389
 who have shown it 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.300
 wilson second day of after mad 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.580
 battlefield 3 and today we bring you this 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.140
 gameplay with the crossbow we have rescued 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.430
 some clips we made a game and it's 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.050
 very good with the crossbow even 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.520
 we have a clip of 9 casualties in a row 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.829
 we will be at the end of the video so that 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.060
 enjoy but let's take this 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.279
 video as I say to make a small 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.009
 review a little analysis of what is 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.150
 this weapon the crossbow in battlefield 3 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.489
 As you can see, it comes equipped with the 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.050
 Look Cobra In principle there are two 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.579
 crossbows which is comes with this look 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.590
 the two comes with the telescopic sight the 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.510
 look sniper but for now 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.129
 we are using the cobra that is 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.800
 unlock by winning three games of 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.719
 scavenger you have to win three games 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.000
 in this new way that comes with after 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.500
 man and it's pretty simple and when 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.149
 you win, then you can unlock the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.070
 crossbow in any of the four 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.929
 classes in any of the four kits 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.809
 if you want to use it in the kit 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:02.329
 assault you will have to sacrifice the 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.070
 first aid kit if you want to use it in the kit 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.030
 of engineer you will have to stop 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.670
 use or mine with the blowtorch 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.310
 if you want to use it in the mode of 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.890
 support you will have to remove the laws more than 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.560
 4 mortars and finally if you want 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.250
 use it in sniper mode 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.550
 2000 mode for the remembered mode 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.610
 you have to sacrifice the sensor 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.790
 movement which gives many 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.229
 possibilities to the crossbow because we 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.460
 we dedicate a lot of room for maneuver with 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.500
 any of the classes 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.110
 It should be noted that the crossbow is not a 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.810
 primary or secondary weapon as ya 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.380
 I have commented so that its function is not 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.780
 all right 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.219
 no no it is not a becoming a weapon that 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.450
 let's say it can be around giving 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.219
 turns and pretend makes a good 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.470
 heading here we do not know that many people 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.899
 decent but more than anything because 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.810
 we were trying to make a video 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.450
 of this is a review but not as I say 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.100
 It is not a weapon that can bring here not 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.470
 it's a weapon rather than you have to 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.899
 use as a complement as if it were 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.819
 an ecological throwing knife is 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.319
 a mortal in principle killed a touch 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.209
 but you know already I advance you that no 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.170
 you will have already seen along this 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.690
 video some hit market 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.550
 so it does not kill a 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.680
 apart it is distant could the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.600
 head the arrow if you want me to kill 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.890
 short distance if you hit her foot 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.540
 I'm very sure that you do not see here either 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.460
 a long short that I do to the driver 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.460
 of the truck is 340 points for him for the 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.470
 shot to the head 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.910
 We believe that if you shoot him in the chest 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.610
 as I say you are not going to kill long 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.130
 distance another of the things he has is 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.010
 that fall is rather short fall 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.720
 that has the mustache itself 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.640
 I personally was going to be 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.129
 greater by the way here you are going to read a 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.989
 double bass I thought I was going to be older 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.569
 the fall but it is not what is not 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.120
 a quite pretty little fall that yes 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.099
 the time it takes to get the video t 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.540
 the objective is quite considerable if 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.310
 you see a movement goal you will have 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.110
 that overtaking a bit looks at it if 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.460
 you want to give 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.250
 already last before leaving them with the 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.570
 clip I would like to comment that we are going to 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.910
 keep uploading some more videos of 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.740
 battlefield but not enough is the tonic 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.030
 let's say we upload a couple of more videos by 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.130
 meet a little with after more but 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.990
 neither the truth that gives us too much 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.730
 I play that I mean there's no two like me 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.680
 I personally thought that we are going to try 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.880
 a little parked aftermath from 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.930
 tomorrow morning tomorrow and we will return a 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.490
 little the zombies that we also have 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.770
 quite interesting videos many 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.630
 covered any little thing we want 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.150
 share with you then you 're nothing 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.100
 a bit the race I for today of the 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.230
 crossbow if you can hit the like for 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.820
 please help us a lot and nothing this 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.070
 it has been for today a greeting we left with the 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.070
 clip 9 low with the crossbow until later 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.100
 the attention that the objective has taken 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.100
 change 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.690
 ah 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.570
 we have lost 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.050
 what 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.310
 to work
