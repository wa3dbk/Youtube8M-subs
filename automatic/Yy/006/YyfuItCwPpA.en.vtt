00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.309
 very good and you are welcome again 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.310
 to the corner of china a new video here 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.800
 I'm raul, I'm going to talk a little bit about 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.230
 of the make x4 pro I've had it already 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.390
 weeks I've been running testing 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.840
 hundreds of different types of camera tests 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.340
 to the screen everything and I've left 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.009
 amazed is the best smartphone that 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.980
 we can acquire today its price in 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.320
 base the 16 gb for example are about 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.260
 how much $ 40 in this case is the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.090
 32 and it's a spectacular model has a 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.980
 finished in aluminum to strong points that 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.070
 This terminal has already know layer 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 custom meizu the fly 4.1 in 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.180
 this case the flying and it depends on the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.490
 recusal that we want to pronounce is 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.130
 super fluid super easy to use very 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.670
 basic is very simple very much like 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.590
 Android as not based on Android 4.4 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.510
 kitkat and you see here that they do not have 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.659
 any delay will fluide and gap 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.299
 the truth that I did not find any fault 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.299
 at no delay no the k follows 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.490
 noteworthy to comment is already a lot 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.719
 time and none of the other points 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.230
 strong that I was talking about before is 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.880
 its premium finish top 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.580
 in aluminum all rounded edges 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.690
 the back is plastic but it's 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.520
 interchangeable we can tell 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.020
 easily in the Asian market but 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.230
 its finish is one of the points that most 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.350
 I liked besides that screen that 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.950
 Now let's see 5.5 inches one 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.950
 quad hd screen is one of the best 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.380
 some tones is spectacular a 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.360
 super high resolution its allowed other 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.760
 of the things that I like most that you are going to 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.340
 see here is the fingerprint reader that 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.900
 it works tremendously well only 0.5 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.150
 seconds even at least with I think 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.830
 because you should already know here you can 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.170
 save different tracks and unlock 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.120
 with the finger they remain kultur of 1,147 thousand 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.910
 points a bestial score for 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.300
 surprise the 8-core tacos with their 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.040
 three other strong big points that 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.140
 they have this terminal is its powerful 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.210
 sony camera a camera of 20.7 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.520
 inches of a very powerful led flash 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.470
 that in low light conditions you go to 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.910
 make some amazing photos you'll see 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.680
 If you have had an opportunity in the 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.150
 reality and in the Chinese channel os 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.010
 I recommend that you read because the photos 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.750
 that you have are very good that makes 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.440
 you see here all the personalization of the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.730
 cottage 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.500
 that carries the menu we have many filters 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.590
 ability to put different sizes of 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.560
 photo 16 megapixels 20 between the 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.740
 relations in 4k in 720 1080 and so on 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.120
 etc. Panoramic mode even have 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.090
 many options that we will 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.380
 facilitate our recording mode in 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.850
 the settings you're going to see is going to be a 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.510
 little different from what is shown 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.860
 on android 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.860
 we can create our frank account 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.300
 for the cloud the options change a 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.010
 little about what we are 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.110
 controlling pure android parameters 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.260
 to unlock while the screen has 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.040
 paid the phone boosting twice 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.590
 store our fingerprints 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.620
 for being able to unblock the with 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.430
 other than 270 etc. you can see that 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.410
 to be very simple very easy to use 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.210
 which is practically the same as 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.280
 revolution of videos you are not going to have 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.380
 no doubt and it will be the best 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.590
 strong points that you are going to have with this 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.220
 mail as well as its 4h screen 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.830
 5.5 inches are going to have also with the 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.210
 option of retinas to just one 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.310
 sound is spectacular 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.070
 own has cataloged me that sound 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.530
 well with retina sound another of the things 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.630
 what I like the most is its the gps the gps 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.880
 it works too fast you should know 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.260
 here we are going to try it simply 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.020
 we plugged in the gps that I have it 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.300
 deactivated if I find it around here 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.800
 we activate it and you will see that the 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.040
 satellites already practically 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.800
 they connect in a tremendous way very 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.690
 fast you take them all you see here 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.970
 says the location of where we are 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.140
 works great the gps navigate to 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.970
 our social networks 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.700
 here for example in the corner of china 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.840
 it's going to be all very fluid between any 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.460
 neither problem when playing 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.590
 your games are not going to have any 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.780
 side no the Greek is important it 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.400
 tried many games also and of 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.320
 true that I have not had any delay 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.330
 the one of attract two for example that are from 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.460
 the games that I always try and that 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.140
 they also pull a lot of resources has not 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.910
 had no delay of a can you see it 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.880
 also in the channel in the review that 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.030
 I did before and I tried is the game 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.490
 in fact and some other as well as the total 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.620
 racing 3 some so you do not have to have 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.940
 no problem now playing your 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.470
 free games in addition with its great 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:45.890
 screen you will see very well another 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.500
 which the best thing you have not tried is 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.610
 the tone of the calls when to pick up 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.260
 a call or made a call 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.210
 it is also quite elevated it is quite 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.120
 well I am very good unlike with 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.990
 other terminals of lower or higher range 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.640
 half 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.650
 you hear very well very clearly it 's one thing 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.660
 I really like people and others 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.480
 Also, remember that we have the 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.169
 bands 3g 900 and 2,100 for Spain and 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.569
 the 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:12.139
 and also that it will be useful for us 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:14.180
 our 4g connectivity here simply 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.919
 in the youtube channel here in a 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.599
 technology and the official page of 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.129
 facebook dotcom bar the corner of 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.840
