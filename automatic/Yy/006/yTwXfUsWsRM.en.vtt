00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.280
 and hello to everyone as I promised to tell 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:16.500
 more about the clock was like with them 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.439
 a day for money was not enough 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.439
 that we have a power button here 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.570
 off button selection button changed by 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.580
 the idea is not very happy because you can 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.570
 everything 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:35.370
 sensory choose here is our nest 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.230
 to charge the microphone and speaker here it is 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.649
 the hole I did not understand why this is possible 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.960
 also the microphone is our iron here 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.329
 everywhere plastic this cap tried 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:53.899
 take off she is not removed so let's 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:56.640
 turn on look so I will turn off 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.770
 turn out the light so that it is obvious to you 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.910
 so phone 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.710
 watch connected as bluetooth 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.490
 device as a bluetooth headset 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.430
 that is, here it is shown as 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.030
 headphones show here we can 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.939
 to manage 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.570
 Well, that is, connect to bluetooth 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.619
 to the phone and about such a background and connected the same 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.310
 still copy pl 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.540
 like this in the menu we have a pedometer well 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.030
 here everything reset is not started so 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.970
 there is a phone so we can call 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.060
 for example, I dial our favorite 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.880
 hundreds here and he calls that is here you are 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.899
 see here the number is the only one 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.079
 that from this speaker there will be sound and 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.700
 so the microphone will be talking over 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.700
 now it will get through or not 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:02:01.049
 sources of something like that somewhere 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.119
 loudly became well, in general, the whole conversation 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.729
 goes through this speaker and through this 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.619
 microphone so we still have here 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.509
 interesting and contacts i don't 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.700
 synchronized but in theory there are contacts 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.170
 the camera he constantly asks me 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.500
 install some kind of smart 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.780
 I did not find on for iphone 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.810
 this smartwatch maybe it is on 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.310
 android here but alarms that is too 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.910
 nothing so interesting and 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:32.170
 unusual stopwatch too i think not 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.860
 very interesting for answers too 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.810
 smartwatch 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.370
 what kind of application can be someone 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:47.380
 knows tell me well, rather, if there is 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:51.010
 such an application for iPhone like this 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:55.239
 so so we have music what about 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.950
 music music you can run and she 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.829
 will go play again from this your 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:05.379
 dynamics i mean i can stop her 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.810
 from iphone i can run iphone she 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:12.160
 that's all that's playing from here 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:15.099
 perceived parts as bluetooth 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.410
 headset here it does not show but 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.410
 Look, but on the iPhone it shows 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:31.480
 the charge of the clock is what else is interesting 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:34.299
 we are here so well who does not work here 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.430
 she works here in the main menu we 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.560
 we can click and go to the selection menu 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.810
 either we can call it in the middle and 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.790
 go well, that is , you need it if you 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.799
 for example, such a watch 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.569
 I have nowhere to press. By the way, there is only 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.109
 in the middle yes you can live either way i can 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:54.190
 press her choose to scroll all three 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:58.480
 desktops that is 12 to get 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:03.310

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.549

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:29.320
 that is, under his arm sweats well 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.540

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.240
