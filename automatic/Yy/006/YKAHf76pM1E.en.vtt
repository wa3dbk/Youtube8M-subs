00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
band members I don't know any other way

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.560 
band members I don't know any other way
to<00:01:55.010> express<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.550> other<00:01:55.880> than<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.150> fact<00:01:56.330> that<00:01:56.479> a

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
to express it other than the fact that a

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.850 
to express it other than the fact that a
lot<00:01:56.810> of<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:56.990> things<00:01:57.170> they<00:01:57.320> talked<00:01:57.500> about<00:01:57.530> just

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
lot of the things they talked about just

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.610 
lot of the things they talked about just
revolve<00:01:58.310> around<00:01:58.490> women<00:01:59.150> and<00:01:59.450> sex<00:01:59.780> like<00:02:00.290> I<00:02:00.409> said

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
revolve around women and sex like I said

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.830 
revolve around women and sex like I said
right<00:02:00.860> action<00:02:01.370> is<00:02:01.580> just<00:02:01.970> very<00:02:02.150> catchy

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
right action is just very catchy

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.750 
right action is just very catchy
and<00:02:03.020> they're<00:02:03.560> very<00:02:03.710> subtle<00:02:04.070> sometimes

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
and they're very subtle sometimes

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.390 
and they're very subtle sometimes
sometimes<00:02:05.360> more<00:02:05.659> so<00:02:05.870> than<00:02:06.110> others<00:02:06.380> but<00:02:07.010> this

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
sometimes more so than others but this

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.339 
sometimes more so than others but this
time<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:08.299> way<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.690> when<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:08.869> pick<00:02:09.049> up<00:02:09.200> girls

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
time the way that when I pick up girls

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.740 
time the way that when I pick up girls
they're<00:02:10.129> kind<00:02:10.549> of<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.819> little<00:02:11.150> bit<00:02:11.299> more<00:02:11.330> subtle

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
they're kind of a little bit more subtle

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.540 
they're kind of a little bit more subtle
about<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.200> here<00:02:12.379> on<00:02:12.530> right<00:02:12.800> action<00:02:13.280> but

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
about it here on right action but

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.550 
about it here on right action but
basically<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.330> think<00:02:14.780> what<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.290> song<00:02:15.530> is

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
basically I think what this song is

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.330 
basically I think what this song is
saying<00:02:15.950> and

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
saying and

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.309 
saying and
if<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:16.970> do<00:02:17.150> things<00:02:17.450> right<00:02:17.599> if<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.020> play<00:02:18.200> your

if you do things right if you play your
cards<00:02:18.709> right<00:02:18.800> you're<00:02:19.520> gonna<00:02:19.670> get<00:02:19.849> in<00:02:20.000> there

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
cards right you're gonna get in there

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.830 
cards right you're gonna get in there

that you know it's not gonna get out of

that you know it's not gonna get out of
your<00:02:25.400> head<00:02:25.640> for<00:02:25.849> quite<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.270> while<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.020> could

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
your head for quite a while and I could

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.740 
your head for quite a while and I could
say<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.470> same<00:02:27.680> thing<00:02:27.980> for<00:02:28.010> parts<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.390> next

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
say the same thing for parts of the next

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.870 
say the same thing for parts of the next
single<00:02:30.080> love<00:02:30.440> elimination<00:02:31.220> which<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.610> would

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
single love elimination which I would

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.910 
single love elimination which I would
have<00:02:31.970> probably<00:02:32.270> picked<00:02:32.870> if<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.230> was<00:02:33.349> if<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.830> was

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
have probably picked if it was if it was

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.410 
have probably picked if it was if it was
me<00:02:34.099> I<00:02:34.310> probably<00:02:34.760> would<00:02:34.910> have<00:02:35.000> picked<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.269> is

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
me I probably would have picked it is

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.910 
me I probably would have picked it is
the<00:02:35.569> first<00:02:35.810> single<00:02:36.080> off<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.349> this<00:02:36.530> album<00:02:36.769> just

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
the first single off of this album just

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.300 
the first single off of this album just
because<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.519> like<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:38.450> much<00:02:38.480> but<00:02:39.310> honestly

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
because I like it that much but honestly

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.089 
because I like it that much but honestly
I<00:02:40.580> can<00:02:41.390> understand<00:02:41.840> why<00:02:42.110> right<00:02:42.410> action<00:02:42.860> is

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
I can understand why right action is

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.190 
I can understand why right action is
because<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.819> kind<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.209> sticks<00:02:44.630> with<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.959> theme

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
because it kind of sticks with the theme

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.050 
because it kind of sticks with the theme
and<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.560> title<00:02:45.920> off<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.220> record<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:46.849> I

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
and the title off the record so I

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.360 
and the title off the record so I
understand<00:02:47.569> why<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.110> was<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.890> first<00:02:49.130> single

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
understand why that was the first single

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.130 
understand why that was the first single
