it's<00:03:12.120> actually<00:03:12.180> faster<00:03:12.770> faster<00:03:13.770> I<00:03:15.020> get<00:03:16.020> the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
it's actually faster faster I get the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.040 
it's actually faster faster I get the
first<00:03:16.440> kill<00:03:16.740> in<00:03:17.040> not<00:03:17.550> at<00:03:17.910> nine<00:03:18.150> minutes<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.630> 56

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.170 
first kill in not at nine minutes and 56
seconds<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.740> I<00:03:19.920> get<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.310> last<00:03:20.520> kill<00:03:20.790> at<00:03:20.940> six

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
seconds and I get the last kill at six

seconds and I get the last kill at six
minutes<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.660> forty<00:03:21.959> 40<00:03:22.800> seconds<00:03:23.220> 41<00:03:23.580> seconds

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
minutes and forty 40 seconds 41 seconds

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.680 
minutes and forty 40 seconds 41 seconds
so<00:03:24.709> if<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.800> do<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.070> math<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:27.030> is<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.240> format

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
so if you do the math that is a format

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.190 
so if you do the math that is a format
in<00:03:27.810> 15<00:03:28.170> second<00:03:28.560> nuke<00:03:28.680> without<00:03:28.890> killstreaks

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200
