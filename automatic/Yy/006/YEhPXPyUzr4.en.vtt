the difference between the advanced wave
and<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:34.020> basic<00:00:34.410> wave<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> advanced

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and the basic wave is that the advanced

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.560 
and the basic wave is that the advanced
wave<00:00:36.420> pays<00:00:36.870> very<00:00:37.829> close<00:00:38.160> attention<00:00:38.570> to

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
wave pays very close attention to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.869 
wave pays very close attention to
specifics<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.590> keeping<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.190> hand<00:00:41.370> flex<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
specifics like keeping the hand flex the

specifics like keeping the hand flex the
entire<00:00:42.239> time<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.530> keeping<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> where<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.399> is

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
entire time and keeping it where it is

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.619
