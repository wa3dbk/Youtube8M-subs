00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hello everybody this is titi lemon and

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.390 
hello everybody this is titi lemon and
what<00:00:03.000> we<00:00:03.149> have<00:00:03.360> here<00:00:03.659> today<00:00:03.959> is<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.500> range<00:00:04.920> of

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
what we have here today is a range of

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.450 
what we have here today is a range of
pulse<00:00:06.330> length<00:00:06.569> cleaners<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:07.200> apologize<00:00:08.130> for<00:00:08.340> my

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
pulse length cleaners I apologize for my

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.799 
pulse length cleaners I apologize for my
quite<00:00:08.820> long<00:00:09.000> absence

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
quite long absence

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.259 
quite long absence
here<00:00:10.080> are<00:00:10.170> some<00:00:10.260> excuses<00:00:12.230> and<00:00:14.179> to<00:00:15.179> the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
here are some excuses and to the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.230 
here are some excuses and to the
redstone<00:00:15.830> so<00:00:16.830> these<00:00:17.220> designs<00:00:17.580> here<00:00:17.910> range

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
redstone so these designs here range

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.550 
redstone so these designs here range
from<00:00:18.890> really<00:00:19.890> really<00:00:20.400> really<00:00:20.609> compact<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.810> not

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
from really really really compact to not

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.330 
from really really really compact to not
quite<00:00:22.830> really<00:00:23.100> really<00:00:23.340> compact<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.240> silent

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
quite really really compact but silent

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.580 
quite really really compact but silent
so<00:00:26.340> all<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.300> these<00:00:27.449> designs<00:00:27.840> were<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.230> this

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
so all of these designs were like this

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.769 
so all of these designs were like this
RS<00:00:29.310> nor<00:00:29.550> latch<00:00:29.609> design<00:00:30.090> they<00:00:30.359> came<00:00:30.599> up<00:00:30.750> with

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
RS nor latch design they came up with

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.209 
RS nor latch design they came up with
here<00:00:31.080> which<00:00:31.230> I'll<00:00:31.500> explain<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.189> minute

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
here which I'll explain in a minute

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.139 
here which I'll explain in a minute
after<00:00:32.579> I've<00:00:33.030> shown<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.270> these<00:00:33.510> designs

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
after I've shown you these designs

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.010 
after I've shown you these designs
search<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.390> see<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:36.750> we've<00:00:36.840> got<00:00:36.960> a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
search you can see here we've got a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.900 
search you can see here we've got a
posts<00:00:37.800> lengthen<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.460> can<00:00:38.550> see<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> style

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
posts lengthen and you can see the style

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.850 
posts lengthen and you can see the style
components<00:00:39.510> got<00:00:39.690> most<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:40.379> pistons

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
components got most in like pistons

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.880 
components got most in like pistons
redstone<00:00:40.920> blocks<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.730> hoppers<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.300> course<00:00:42.890> so

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
redstone blocks and hoppers of course so

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.860 
redstone blocks and hoppers of course so
we're<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> press<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> button<00:00:44.910> we're

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
we're going to press the button we're

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.630 
we're going to press the button we're
gonna<00:00:46.020> deep<00:00:46.320> how<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.829> torch<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.399> going<00:00:47.460> to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
gonna deep how this torch is going to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.610 
gonna deep how this torch is going to
bring<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.000> turn<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:48.960> redstone<00:00:49.289> off<00:00:49.410> bring

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
bring this turn this redstone off bring

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.439 
bring this turn this redstone off bring
this<00:00:49.739> piston<00:00:50.100> back<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.520> allow<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.879> redstone

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
this piston back and allow the redstone

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.590 
this piston back and allow the redstone
items<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.500> items<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.890> move<00:00:52.949> up<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.610> flow

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
items the items to move up here and flow

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.090 
items the items to move up here and flow
into<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.899> hopper<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.350> now<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.739> will<00:00:58.920> start

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
into this hopper so now this will start

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.670 
into this hopper so now this will start
to<00:00:59.160> fill<00:00:59.370> up<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.699> when<00:00:59.850> this<00:00:59.969> gets<00:01:00.120> empty<00:01:00.680> this

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
to fill up and when this gets empty this

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.270 
to fill up and when this gets empty this
comparator<00:01:02.309> turns<00:01:02.640> off<00:01:03.710> which<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:05.129> affects

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
comparator turns off which then affects

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.760 
comparator turns off which then affects
this<00:01:05.640> torch<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.540> resets<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> device<00:01:07.439> and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
this torch and resets the device and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.500 
this torch and resets the device and
then<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:07.950> allows<00:01:08.310> all<00:01:08.580> those<00:01:08.760> items<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.390> were

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
then it allows all those items that were

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.920 
then it allows all those items that were
in<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.990> flow<00:01:10.170> back<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> RS

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
in here to flow back so this is the RS

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.230 
in here to flow back so this is the RS
nor<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:14.790> at<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.909> moment<00:01:15.000> this

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
nor so as you can see at the moment this

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.870 
nor so as you can see at the moment this
how<00:01:15.450> isn't<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.869> standard<00:01:16.140> state<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:17.460> torch

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
how isn't it standard state this torch

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.480 
how isn't it standard state this torch
is<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.140> also<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.710> input<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.340> on

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
is on here but also this input is on

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.130 
is on here but also this input is on
which<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> bit<00:01:21.150> counterintuitive<00:01:21.479> but

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
which is a bit counterintuitive but

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.520 
which is a bit counterintuitive but
you'll<00:01:22.920> see<00:01:23.070> how<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.280> works<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> set<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you'll see how it works so to set the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.310 
you'll see how it works so to set the
latch<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:26.520> I'm<00:01:26.580> gonna<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.060> is

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
latch what I'm gonna have to do is

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.170 
latch what I'm gonna have to do is
deepal<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.619> torch<00:01:28.950> we're<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.030> going<00:01:30.150> to

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
deepal this torch we're just going to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.060 
deepal this torch we're just going to
turn<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.509> off<00:01:30.720> which<00:01:31.020> will<00:01:31.259> let<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.680> signal

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
turn this off which will let this signal

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.340 
turn this off which will let this signal
come<00:01:32.310> through<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.729> comparator<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.540> then

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
come through the comparator and then

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.120 
come through the comparator and then
keep<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.770> torch<00:01:35.009> turned<00:01:35.340> off<00:01:36.619> like<00:01:37.619> that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
keep the torch turned off like that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.190 
keep the torch turned off like that
so<00:01:39.119> pretty<00:01:39.630> simple<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.740> now<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:42.049> unset<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
so pretty simple and now to unset the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.069 
so pretty simple and now to unset the
latch<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.920> would<00:01:44.450> we<00:01:45.450> need<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.720> depower

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
latch as you would we need to depower

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.480 
latch as you would we need to depower
this<00:01:46.290> torch<00:01:46.619> which<00:01:46.979> will<00:01:47.189> turn<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
this torch which will turn the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.490 
this torch which will turn the
comparator<00:01:48.210> off<00:01:48.450> which<00:01:48.899> will<00:01:49.049> let<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> torch

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
comparator off which will let the torch

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.359 
comparator off which will let the torch
come<00:01:49.740> back<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:50.180> lock<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:52.350> important<00:01:53.159> site

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
come back on lock this important site

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.420 
come back on lock this important site
hit<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.119> can't<00:01:54.360> turn<00:01:54.630> back<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.920> then<00:01:56.310> by

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
hit so it can't turn back on and then by

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.090 
hit so it can't turn back on and then by
the<00:01:56.490> time<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.969> torch<00:01:57.270> come<00:01:57.540> back<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:58.100> this

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the time this torch come back on this

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.690 
the time this torch come back on this
redstone<00:01:59.820> here<00:01:59.850> will<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.680> like<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.979> so

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
redstone here will be on like that so

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.429 
redstone here will be on like that so
this<00:02:02.880> torch<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.240> no<00:02:03.390> effects<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.899> subtract

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
this torch is no effects in subtract

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.530 
this torch is no effects in subtract
mode<00:02:04.649> there's<00:02:04.890> 15<00:02:05.280> signal<00:02:05.670> struck<00:02:05.850> here<00:02:06.030> 15<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
mode there's 15 signal struck here 15 to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.339 
mode there's 15 signal struck here 15 to
2%<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:07.320> 15<00:02:08.069> -<00:02:08.250> 15<00:02:08.340> 0<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.869> torch<00:02:10.170> isn't

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
2% here 15 - 15 0 so this torch isn't

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.070 
2% here 15 - 15 0 so this torch isn't
going<00:02:10.619> anywhere

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
going anywhere

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.110 
going anywhere
and<00:02:11.710> that's<00:02:11.890> basically<00:02:12.280> how<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.580> works<00:02:12.790> and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
and that's basically how it works and

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.240 
and that's basically how it works and
how<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.480> works<00:02:13.750> now<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.680> will<00:02:14.860> work<00:02:14.890> off

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
how this works now this will work off

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.060 
how this works now this will work off
that<00:02:15.280> exact<00:02:15.880> same<00:02:16.120> principle<00:02:16.690> but<00:02:17.070> they've

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
that exact same principle but they've

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.970 
that exact same principle but they've
just<00:02:18.100> different<00:02:18.490> configurations<00:02:19.350> this<00:02:20.350> so

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
just different configurations this so

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.800 
just different configurations this so
this<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.370> smallest<00:02:21.760> one<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.120> know<00:02:22.240> of<00:02:22.570> this

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
this is the smallest one I know of this

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.040 
this is the smallest one I know of this
is<00:02:23.020> 2<00:02:23.530> by<00:02:23.560> 3<00:02:23.740> by<00:02:24.130> 3<00:02:24.430> which<00:02:24.670> is<00:02:24.700> 18<00:02:25.180> blocks<00:02:25.690> in

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
is 2 by 3 by 3 which is 18 blocks in

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.910 
is 2 by 3 by 3 which is 18 blocks in
total<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.280> really<00:02:27.610> really<00:02:27.760> recom<00:02:28.150> packed<00:02:28.920> got

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
total so really really recom packed got

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.770 
total so really really recom packed got
this<00:02:30.040> one<00:02:30.250> here<00:02:30.550> which<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.300> same<00:02:31.570> thing

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
this one here which is the same thing

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.150 
this one here which is the same thing
but<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:31.960> its<00:02:32.140> side<00:02:32.380> it's<00:02:32.650> still<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.980> same

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
but on its side it's still the same

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.610 
but on its side it's still the same
dimensions<00:02:33.670> 18<00:02:34.000> blocks<00:02:34.240> in<00:02:34.420> total<00:02:34.840> excluding

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
dimensions 18 blocks in total excluding

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.320 
dimensions 18 blocks in total excluding
your<00:02:35.740> output<00:02:36.190> here<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:37.530> this<00:02:38.530> one<00:02:38.740> works

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
your output here and this one works

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.350 
your output here and this one works
similarly<00:02:40.330> but<00:02:40.540> as<00:02:41.110> power<00:02:41.440> differently<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.940> my

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
similarly but as power differently so my

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.420 
similarly but as power differently so my
inputs<00:02:43.660> here<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.170> instead<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.040> having<00:02:45.250> a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
inputs here and instead of having a

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.460 
inputs here and instead of having a
torch<00:02:45.760> turning<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:46.810> road<00:02:46.990> so<00:02:47.170> I'm<00:02:47.320> actually

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
torch turning this road so I'm actually

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.590 
torch turning this road so I'm actually
reusing<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.430> redstone<00:02:48.820> block<00:02:49.060> here<00:02:49.450> as

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
reusing the redstone block here as

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.120 
reusing the redstone block here as
inverter<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.640> when<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.790> press<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.150> button<00:02:53.130> it

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
inverter so when I press the button it

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.680 
inverter so when I press the button it
will<00:02:54.220> push<00:02:54.460> the<00:02:54.640> piston<00:02:54.790> using<00:02:55.240> this<00:02:55.330> red

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
will push the piston using this red

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.930 
will push the piston using this red
surface<00:02:55.930> here<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:56.560> push<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.430> out<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:57.730> turn

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
surface here and push that out and turn

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.510 
surface here and push that out and turn
the<00:02:58.030> Redstone<00:02:58.420> off<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:58.900> now<00:02:59.650> when<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.160> turns

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
the Redstone off and now when that turns

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.340 
the Redstone off and now when that turns
off<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.090> same<00:03:01.300> things<00:03:01.540> will<00:03:01.750> happen<00:03:01.930> again

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
off the same things will happen again

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.640 
off the same things will happen again
and<00:03:04.680> also<00:03:05.680> instead<00:03:06.160> of<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:07.390> piston<00:03:07.870> here

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
and also instead of the piston here

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.360 
and also instead of the piston here
holding<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:10.170> hopper<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.560> just<00:03:11.890> want<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.250> bit

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
holding this hopper so I just want a bit

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.190 
holding this hopper so I just want a bit
actually<00:03:12.610> have<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:12.850> torch<00:03:13.180> here<00:03:13.540> which<00:03:14.020> is

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
actually have a torch here which is

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.560 
actually have a torch here which is
affected<00:03:14.620> by<00:03:14.710> the<00:03:14.770> RS<00:03:15.430> nor<00:03:15.580> latch<00:03:15.700> as<00:03:16.330> you'll

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
affected by the RS nor latch as you'll

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.560 
affected by the RS nor latch as you'll
see<00:03:16.720> this<00:03:16.900> keeps<00:03:17.170> getting<00:03:17.350> grounded<00:03:18.570> so

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
see this keeps getting grounded so

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.330 
see this keeps getting grounded so
there's<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.870> if<00:03:20.080> you<00:03:20.230> need<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.739> Y<00:03:20.950> designs

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
there's that if you need to Y designs

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.300 
there's that if you need to Y designs
shame<00:03:21.880> isn't<00:03:22.270> too<00:03:22.570> white<00:03:22.750> ilvl<00:03:23.350> but<00:03:23.560> not

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
shame isn't too white ilvl but not

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.190 
shame isn't too white ilvl but not
really<00:03:24.489> sure<00:03:24.760> why<00:03:24.940> you'd<00:03:25.180> need<00:03:25.270> a<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.720> Y<00:03:25.900> trial

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
really sure why you'd need a to Y trial

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.280 
really sure why you'd need a to Y trial
we'll<00:03:26.350> both<00:03:26.500> links<00:03:26.830> on<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.540> now<00:03:28.570> next<00:03:29.050> here

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
we'll both links on it now next here

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.800 
we'll both links on it now next here
we've<00:03:30.070> got<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.580> really<00:03:30.910> simple<00:03:31.270> one<00:03:31.630> to

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
we've got a really simple one to

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.960 
we've got a really simple one to
understand<00:03:32.380> it's<00:03:32.770> basically<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.400> RS<00:03:33.790> nor

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
understand it's basically that RS nor

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.449 
understand it's basically that RS nor
latch<00:03:34.030> over<00:03:34.480> here<00:03:34.860> but<00:03:35.860> with<00:03:35.980> some<00:03:36.130> hoppers<00:03:36.280> on

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
latch over here but with some hoppers on

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.620 
latch over here but with some hoppers on
the<00:03:36.580> end<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:38.290> these<00:03:38.800> hoppers<00:03:39.130> are<00:03:39.520> like<00:03:40.330> with

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
the end so these hoppers are like with

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.630 
the end so these hoppers are like with
the<00:03:40.750> eight<00:03:40.840> items<00:03:41.020> in<00:03:41.470> represent<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.400> dark

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
the eight items in represent the dark

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.670 
the eight items in represent the dark
green<00:03:42.910> block<00:03:43.120> over<00:03:43.390> there<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.810> like<00:03:44.410> green

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
green block over there and like green

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.580 
green block over there and like green
input<00:03:45.070> block<00:03:45.250> is<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.610> same<00:03:45.790> as<00:03:45.910> over<00:03:46.150> there<00:03:46.590> so

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
input block is the same as over there so

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.510 
input block is the same as over there so
again<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.280> press<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.970> button<00:03:49.420> input<00:03:50.260> off

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
again and press the button input off

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.880 
again and press the button input off
allows<00:03:51.520> the<00:03:52.450> signal<00:03:53.230> strength<00:03:53.470> from<00:03:53.709> this

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
allows the signal strength from this

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.280 
allows the signal strength from this
eight<00:03:54.100> redstone<00:03:54.580> to<00:03:55.209> come<00:03:55.480> through<00:03:56.050> this

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
eight redstone to come through this

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.729 
eight redstone to come through this
comparator<00:03:56.860> and<00:03:57.040> hold<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.489> torch<00:03:57.700> off<00:03:57.970> and

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
comparator and hold the torch off and

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.020 
comparator and hold the torch off and
then<00:03:59.739> this<00:04:00.100> stuff<00:04:00.400> is<00:04:00.489> going<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:00.670> turn<00:04:00.880> off

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
then this stuff is going to turn off

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.699 
then this stuff is going to turn off
here<00:04:01.239> which<00:04:01.450> will<00:04:01.630> allow<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.900> items<00:04:02.320> to<00:04:02.500> flow

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
here which will allow the items to flow

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.850 
here which will allow the items to flow
out<00:04:02.890> and<00:04:03.390> this<00:04:04.390> torch<00:04:04.690> is<00:04:04.780> going<00:04:05.170> to<00:04:05.260> keep<00:04:05.620> your

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
out and this torch is going to keep your

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.819 
out and this torch is going to keep your
items<00:04:05.920> holding<00:04:06.459> here

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.410 

now<00:04:09.829> when<00:04:10.129> this<00:04:10.340> hop<00:04:10.519> is<00:04:10.670> eventually<00:04:11.030> empty

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
now when this hop is eventually empty

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.330 
now when this hop is eventually empty
that's<00:04:11.719> going<00:04:11.930> to<00:04:11.989> turn<00:04:12.200> off<00:04:12.409> reset<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.159> latch

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
that's going to turn off reset the latch

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.409 
that's going to turn off reset the latch
it's<00:04:14.299> going<00:04:14.569> to<00:04:14.659> stop<00:04:14.840> holding<00:04:15.170> items<00:04:15.290> in<00:04:15.680> here

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
it's going to stop holding items in here

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.930 
it's going to stop holding items in here
then<00:04:17.419> this<00:04:17.539> is<00:04:17.660> going<00:04:17.810> to<00:04:17.900> turn<00:04:18.079> back<00:04:18.109> on<00:04:18.440> and

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
then this is going to turn back on and

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.390 
then this is going to turn back on and
all<00:04:19.940> that<00:04:20.289> now<00:04:21.289> you<00:04:21.350> may<00:04:21.590> have<00:04:21.680> noticed<00:04:22.160> with

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
all that now you may have noticed with

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.770 
all that now you may have noticed with
these<00:04:22.580> that<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:24.759> once<00:04:25.759> this<00:04:26.030> circuit<00:04:26.509> turns

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
these that the once this circuit turns

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.749 
these that the once this circuit turns
off<00:04:26.990> this<00:04:27.380> actually<00:04:27.800> stays<00:04:28.070> on<00:04:28.250> for<00:04:28.310> twice<00:04:28.729> as

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
off this actually stays on for twice as

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.620 
off this actually stays on for twice as
long<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.720> lambdas<00:04:30.169> and<00:04:30.410> that's<00:04:31.130> because<00:04:31.630> the

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
long the lambdas and that's because the

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.969 
long the lambdas and that's because the
Irish<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.050> all<00:04:33.139> that<00:04:33.289> jury<00:04:33.470> stays<00:04:33.650> on<00:04:33.830> for<00:04:33.860> as

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
Irish and all that jury stays on for as

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.379 
Irish and all that jury stays on for as

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
long as it takes their items to come out

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.439 
long as it takes their items to come out
of<00:04:35.570> this<00:04:35.690> hopper<00:04:35.960> into<00:04:36.349> this<00:04:36.710> hopper<00:04:37.330> but<00:04:38.330> the

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
of this hopper into this hopper but the

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.510 
of this hopper into this hopper but the
lamp<00:04:38.660> will<00:04:38.840> stay<00:04:39.080> on<00:04:39.259> for<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.830> time<00:04:40.070> what<00:04:40.340> it

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
lamp will stay on for the time what it

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.249 
lamp will stay on for the time what it
takes<00:04:40.729> items<00:04:41.000> come<00:04:41.210> from<00:04:41.479> this<00:04:41.660> hopper<00:04:41.870> into

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
takes items come from this hopper into

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.159 
takes items come from this hopper into
here<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:42.710> then<00:04:43.280> back<00:04:43.550> again<00:04:43.729> so<00:04:44.570> depending

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
here and then back again so depending

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.360 
here and then back again so depending
how<00:04:45.289> you<00:04:45.320> boil<00:04:45.530> your<00:04:45.560> input<00:04:46.070> you<00:04:46.220> could

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
how you boil your input you could

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.589 
how you boil your input you could
actually<00:04:46.460> not<00:04:46.669> use<00:04:46.849> this<00:04:47.030> input<00:04:47.210> if<00:04:47.509> you

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
actually not use this input if you

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.779 
actually not use this input if you
wanted<00:04:47.810> half<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.289> length<00:04:48.500> you<00:04:49.220> could<00:04:49.400> take<00:04:49.639> it

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
wanted half the length you could take it

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.409 
wanted half the length you could take it
off<00:04:49.910> here<00:04:50.120> or<00:04:50.389> this<00:04:50.630> torch<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.940> just<00:04:53.240> have<00:04:53.389> a

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
off here or this torch and I just have a

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.310 
off here or this torch and I just have a
squashed<00:04:53.900> up<00:04:54.169> version<00:04:54.530> of<00:04:54.590> that<00:04:54.740> one<00:04:55.009> here<00:04:55.370> and

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
squashed up version of that one here and

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.600 
squashed up version of that one here and
I<00:04:57.320> made<00:04:57.500> a<00:04:57.530> bit<00:04:57.680> more<00:04:57.800> comparator<00:04:58.280> took<00:04:58.460> out

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
I made a bit more comparator took out

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.670 
I made a bit more comparator took out
this<00:04:58.729> block<00:04:59.060> that<00:04:59.900> the<00:04:59.990> same<00:05:00.199> hatter<00:05:00.470> I've

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
this block that the same hatter I've

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.189 
this block that the same hatter I've
taken<00:05:00.919> the<00:05:01.009> register<00:05:01.370> up<00:05:01.580> here<00:05:01.940> just<00:05:02.780> exactly

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
taken the register up here just exactly

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.770 
taken the register up here just exactly
the<00:05:03.470> same<00:05:03.740> so<00:05:04.639> there's<00:05:05.000> one<00:05:05.150> taller<00:05:05.419> so<00:05:05.690> it's

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
the same so there's one taller so it's

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.360 
the same so there's one taller so it's
not<00:05:05.870> actually<00:05:06.289> as<00:05:06.380> compact<00:05:06.800> as<00:05:06.949> that<00:05:07.130> sign

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
not actually as compact as that sign

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.550 
not actually as compact as that sign
over<00:05:07.610> here<00:05:07.849> which<00:05:08.599> isn't<00:05:08.780> a<00:05:08.900> practice<00:05:09.349> those

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
over here which isn't a practice those

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.620 
over here which isn't a practice those
but<00:05:09.949> the<00:05:10.669> difference<00:05:11.150> really<00:05:11.539> about

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
but the difference really about

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.719 
but the difference really about
noticeable<00:05:12.229> and<00:05:13.159> I<00:05:13.220> think<00:05:13.400> this<00:05:13.520> is<00:05:13.699> a

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
noticeable and I think this is a

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.879 
noticeable and I think this is a
20-block<00:05:14.479> role<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:14.930> compared<00:05:15.199> to<00:05:15.229> that<00:05:15.320> 18

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
20-block role and compared to that 18

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.089 
20-block role and compared to that 18
but<00:05:16.580> these<00:05:16.789> designs<00:05:16.940> are<00:05:17.419> silent<00:05:17.990> so<00:05:18.590> and<00:05:18.949> that

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
but these designs are silent so and that

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.939 
but these designs are silent so and that
may<00:05:19.250> be<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.430> bonus<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.120> you<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:21.380> now<00:05:21.560> I'm<00:05:21.770> going

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
may be a bonus to you and now I'm going

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.710 
may be a bonus to you and now I'm going
to<00:05:22.039> show<00:05:22.310> you<00:05:22.340> how<00:05:22.669> to<00:05:22.729> build<00:05:23.060> all<00:05:23.300> different

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
to show you how to build all different

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.200 
to show you how to build all different
designs<00:05:23.840> of<00:05:24.259> showing<00:05:24.530> down<00:05:24.680> there<00:05:24.889> below<00:05:25.210> so

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
designs of showing down there below so

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.360 
designs of showing down there below so
the<00:05:26.449> first<00:05:26.720> design<00:05:27.080> with<00:05:27.320> a<00:05:27.349> piston<00:05:27.860> we're

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
the first design with a piston we're

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.980 
the first design with a piston we're
gonna<00:05:28.460> have<00:05:28.610> our<00:05:28.699> input<00:05:28.880> here<00:05:29.330> with<00:05:29.570> a<00:05:29.599> button

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
gonna have our input here with a button

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.950 
gonna have our input here with a button
on<00:05:30.080> it<00:05:31.000> and<00:05:32.000> we're<00:05:32.240> going<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.449> build<00:05:32.630> out<00:05:32.780> like

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
on it and we're going to build out like

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.040 
on it and we're going to build out like
this<00:05:33.550> think<00:05:34.550> that<00:05:34.669> block<00:05:34.880> torch<00:05:35.479> redstone

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
this think that block torch redstone

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.439 
this think that block torch redstone
register<00:05:36.620> like<00:05:36.800> that<00:05:37.070> I'm<00:05:37.880> gonna<00:05:38.150> play<00:05:38.270> some

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
register like that I'm gonna play some

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:39.850 
register like that I'm gonna play some
clips<00:05:38.539> in<00:05:38.810> there<00:05:38.960> with<00:05:39.110> a<00:05:39.139> redstone<00:05:39.380> block<00:05:39.620> on

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
clips in there with a redstone block on

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.710 
clips in there with a redstone block on
the<00:05:39.949> end<00:05:40.180> then<00:05:41.180> I'm<00:05:41.240> going<00:05:41.389> to<00:05:41.449> place<00:05:41.690> some

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
the end then I'm going to place some

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.899 
the end then I'm going to place some
hoppers<00:05:42.169> facing<00:05:42.740> into<00:05:43.250> each<00:05:43.370> other<00:05:43.669> like<00:05:43.880> that

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
hoppers facing into each other like that

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.089 
hoppers facing into each other like that
I<00:05:44.449> need<00:05:44.930> to<00:05:45.020> make<00:05:45.139> sure<00:05:45.289> they<00:05:45.440> are<00:05:45.530> facing<00:05:45.800> into

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.099 
I need to make sure they are facing into

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:47.499 
I need to make sure they are facing into
each<00:05:46.220> other<00:05:46.400> so<00:05:46.759> they're<00:05:47.000> touching<00:05:47.150> like<00:05:47.479> that

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
each other so they're touching like that

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.050 
each other so they're touching like that
and<00:05:48.139> then<00:05:49.009> right<00:05:49.310> here<00:05:49.580> we're<00:05:49.789> going<00:05:49.909> to<00:05:49.969> have

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
and then right here we're going to have

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.050 
and then right here we're going to have
a<00:05:50.090> comparative<00:05:50.659> facing<00:05:51.229> inwards<00:05:51.590> like<00:05:51.650> that

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
a comparative facing inwards like that

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.839 
a comparative facing inwards like that
in<00:05:53.060> subtract<00:05:53.509> vote<00:05:53.949> now<00:05:54.949> the<00:05:55.009> input<00:05:55.400> on<00:05:55.699> this

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
in subtract vote now the input on this

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.469 
in subtract vote now the input on this
it<00:05:56.719> only<00:05:56.930> has<00:05:57.169> to<00:05:57.380> be<00:05:57.409> a<00:05:57.610> minimal<00:05:58.610> redstone

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
it only has to be a minimal redstone

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.149 
it only has to be a minimal redstone
signal<00:05:59.750> strengths<00:06:00.320> turn<00:06:00.530> this<00:06:00.650> off<00:06:00.860> and<00:06:00.889> it

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
signal strengths turn this off and it

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:02.800 
signal strengths turn this off and it
can<00:06:01.280> go<00:06:01.430> into<00:06:01.580> either<00:06:01.849> side<00:06:02.150> of<00:06:02.180> the<00:06:02.360> block<00:06:02.539> or

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
can go into either side of the block or

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.350 
can go into either side of the block or
on<00:06:03.199> the<00:06:03.560> top<00:06:03.800> on<00:06:04.009> the<00:06:04.099> bottom<00:06:04.250> hub<00:06:04.759> you<00:06:04.940> want<00:06:05.150> it

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
on the top on the bottom hub you want it

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.700 
on the top on the bottom hub you want it
and<00:06:05.570> then<00:06:05.630> our<00:06:06.560> output<00:06:07.130> clap<00:06:07.430> here

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
and then our output clap here

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
and then our output clap here
now<00:06:09.160> to<00:06:09.970> test<00:06:10.750> for<00:06:11.440> how<00:06:11.740> long<00:06:12.070> this<00:06:12.460> is<00:06:12.580> going

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
now to test for how long this is going

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.370 
now to test for how long this is going
to<00:06:12.790> stay<00:06:13.000> on<00:06:13.030> you're<00:06:13.750> going<00:06:13.840> to<00:06:13.930> put<00:06:14.110> a<00:06:14.140> certain

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
to stay on you're going to put a certain

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.570 
to stay on you're going to put a certain
amount<00:06:14.470> of<00:06:14.680> whites<00:06:14.920> from<00:06:15.160> here<00:06:15.430> you

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
amount of whites from here you

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.670 
amount of whites from here you
completely<00:06:15.940> fill<00:06:16.270> it<00:06:16.450> or<00:06:16.780> just<00:06:17.080> have<00:06:17.260> one<00:06:17.470> in

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
completely fill it or just have one in

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.390 
completely fill it or just have one in
if<00:06:17.830> that's<00:06:18.070> what<00:06:18.640> floats<00:06:18.670> your<00:06:19.120> boat<00:06:19.740> I<00:06:20.740> will

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
if that's what floats your boat I will

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.310 
if that's what floats your boat I will
provide<00:06:21.580> a<00:06:21.700> guide<00:06:21.970> in<00:06:22.270> the<00:06:22.510> description<00:06:23.200> of

provide a guide in the description of

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.170 
provide a guide in the description of
the<00:06:23.410> video<00:06:23.500> how<00:06:23.860> to<00:06:23.890> calculate<00:06:24.550> how<00:06:24.730> long<00:06:25.000> that

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
the video how to calculate how long that

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.300 
the video how to calculate how long that
will<00:06:25.300> last<00:06:25.360> out<00:06:25.900> this<00:06:26.110> output<00:06:27.030> no<00:06:28.030> next<00:06:28.840> sign

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.340 
will last out this output no next sign
we<00:06:30.310> gonna<00:06:30.490> place<00:06:30.700> redstone<00:06:31.660> on<00:06:32.020> top<00:06:32.050> of<00:06:32.290> that

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
we gonna place redstone on top of that

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.760 
we gonna place redstone on top of that
block<00:06:32.560> like<00:06:32.740> that<00:06:33.690> piston<00:06:34.690> redstone<00:06:35.200> block

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
block like that piston redstone block

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.500 
block like that piston redstone block
and<00:06:36.520> then<00:06:36.700> underneath<00:06:37.150> that<00:06:39.030> block<00:06:40.030> redstone

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
and then underneath that block redstone

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.320 
and then underneath that block redstone
on<00:06:40.690> comparator<00:06:41.260> facing<00:06:41.560> into<00:06:41.800> the<00:06:41.830> input<00:06:42.330> with

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
on comparator facing into the input with

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.510 
on comparator facing into the input with
the<00:06:43.720> torch<00:06:44.170> turned<00:06:44.440> on<00:06:44.590> for<00:06:44.830> subtract<00:06:45.250> mode

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
the torch turned on for subtract mode

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.090 
the torch turned on for subtract mode
and<00:06:45.760> then<00:06:46.630> we're<00:06:47.140> going<00:06:47.290> to<00:06:47.320> place<00:06:47.500> block<00:06:47.800> here

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
and then we're going to place block here

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.230 
and then we're going to place block here
there's<00:06:48.820> a<00:06:48.880> torch<00:06:49.210> on<00:06:49.450> it<00:06:50.460> to<00:06:51.460> go<00:06:51.880> into<00:06:52.030> this

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
there's a torch on it to go into this

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.480 
there's a torch on it to go into this
hopper<00:06:52.510> here<00:06:52.900> and<00:06:53.380> these<00:06:53.890> have<00:06:54.070> to<00:06:54.160> be<00:06:54.220> facing

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
hopper here and these have to be facing

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.910 
hopper here and these have to be facing
into<00:06:54.820> each<00:06:54.940> other<00:06:55.120> as<00:06:55.360> always<00:06:55.750> and<00:06:56.170> that's

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
into each other as always and that's

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.070 
into each other as always and that's
that<00:06:57.160> sign<00:06:57.400> done<00:06:57.640> and<00:06:57.940> again<00:06:58.690> we're<00:06:58.900> going<00:06:58.990> to

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
that sign done and again we're going to

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.360 
that sign done and again we're going to
have<00:06:59.170> to<00:06:59.230> place<00:06:59.380> our<00:06:59.530> items<00:06:59.920> in<00:07:00.190> there<00:07:02.310> now<00:07:03.310> the

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.370 
have to place our items in there now the

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.800 
have to place our items in there now the
next<00:07:03.730> sign<00:07:05.730> which<00:07:06.730> is<00:07:06.760> the<00:07:07.120> silent<00:07:07.510> design

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810 
next sign which is the silent design

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.650 
next sign which is the silent design
we're<00:07:08.350> gonna<00:07:08.440> place<00:07:08.740> the<00:07:09.210> comparator<00:07:10.240> fitting

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660 
we're gonna place the comparator fitting

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.470 
we're gonna place the comparator fitting
into<00:07:10.750> the<00:07:10.900> input<00:07:11.200> like<00:07:11.380> that<00:07:12.060> block<00:07:13.060> up<00:07:13.270> like

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:13.480 
into the input like that block up like

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.110 
into the input like that block up like
that<00:07:13.720> and<00:07:14.410> then<00:07:14.650> two<00:07:15.130> hoppers<00:07:15.550> facing<00:07:15.790> each

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 
that and then two hoppers facing each

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.050 
that and then two hoppers facing each
other<00:07:16.240> behind<00:07:16.510> it<00:07:17.280> now<00:07:18.280> we're<00:07:18.550> going<00:07:18.670> to<00:07:18.730> take

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060 
other behind it now we're going to take

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.990 
other behind it now we're going to take
the<00:07:19.510> torch<00:07:19.810> out<00:07:20.050> of<00:07:20.170> the<00:07:20.290> input<00:07:20.590> which<00:07:21.580> is<00:07:21.640> in

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 
the torch out of the input which is in

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.120 
the torch out of the input which is in
and<00:07:22.120> go<00:07:22.270> background<00:07:22.750> into<00:07:22.930> here<00:07:23.140> and<00:07:23.950> then

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.130 
and go background into here and then

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.520 
and go background into here and then
let's<00:07:24.370> go<00:07:24.520> and<00:07:24.610> run<00:07:24.760> along<00:07:24.910> here<00:07:25.200> and<00:07:26.200> into<00:07:26.500> a

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.530 
let's go and run along here and into a

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.730 
let's go and run along here and into a
box<00:07:26.770> or<00:07:27.340> torch<00:07:27.610> on<00:07:27.790> it<00:07:28.050> and<00:07:29.050> let's<00:07:29.230> know<00:07:29.410> if<00:07:29.470> you

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:29.740 
box or torch on it and let's know if you

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.400 
box or torch on it and let's know if you
want<00:07:30.250> to<00:07:30.280> see<00:07:30.430> that<00:07:30.720> now<00:07:31.720> the<00:07:31.780> next<00:07:32.140> one<00:07:32.290> is

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:32.410 
want to see that now the next one is

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.220 
want to see that now the next one is
just<00:07:32.440> a<00:07:32.740> zactly<00:07:33.010> the<00:07:33.160> same<00:07:33.370> as<00:07:33.550> that<00:07:33.700> but

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.230 
just a zactly the same as that but

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.200 
just a zactly the same as that but
slightly<00:07:35.230> stubby<00:07:35.620> version<00:07:36.130> but<00:07:36.760> it's<00:07:36.940> a<00:07:37.060> bit

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.210 
slightly stubby version but it's a bit

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.670 
slightly stubby version but it's a bit
bigger<00:07:37.570> because<00:07:37.930> you<00:07:38.170> have<00:07:38.320> to<00:07:38.470> run<00:07:38.620> a

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680 
bigger because you have to run a

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.240 
bigger because you have to run a
register<00:07:38.830> on<00:07:39.130> redstone<00:07:39.850> line<00:07:40.060> at<00:07:40.330> the<00:07:40.510> top<00:07:41.250> now

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.250 
register on redstone line at the top now

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.060 
register on redstone line at the top now
this<00:07:42.460> one<00:07:42.730> again<00:07:43.590> comparator<00:07:44.590> or<00:07:44.620> subtract

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.070 
this one again comparator or subtract

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.310 
this one again comparator or subtract
mode<00:07:45.280> going<00:07:45.640> into<00:07:45.880> the<00:07:45.970> input<00:07:46.330> but<00:07:46.960> this<00:07:47.080> time

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:47.320
