anything else you open up the door and

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.439 
anything else you open up the door and
it's<00:04:58.710> simply<00:04:59.070> it<00:04:59.400> might<00:04:59.639> just<00:04:59.760> be<00:04:59.970> one<00:05:00.180> lock

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
it's simply it might just be one lock

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.080 
it's simply it might just be one lock
one<00:05:00.930> hook<00:05:01.530> at<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.770> end<00:05:02.100> if<00:05:02.550> you're<00:05:02.729> lucky<00:05:02.880> to

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
one hook at the end if you're lucky to

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.990 
one hook at the end if you're lucky to
put<00:05:03.900> your<00:05:04.110> knapsack<00:05:04.800> or<00:05:05.039> your<00:05:05.190> your<00:05:05.490> jacket

put your knapsack or your your jacket
but<00:05:06.570> that<00:05:06.690> doesn't<00:05:06.780> seem<00:05:07.050> to<00:05:07.169> be<00:05:07.289> any<00:05:07.440> shelving

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
but that doesn't seem to be any shelving

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.800 
but that doesn't seem to be any shelving
now<00:05:08.580> not<00:05:08.760> all<00:05:08.910> schools<00:05:09.180> have<00:05:09.449> that<00:05:09.630> some

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
now not all schools have that some

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.180 
now not all schools have that some
schools<00:05:09.930> you<00:05:10.590> know<00:05:10.620> have<00:05:10.889> the<00:05:11.010> additional

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
schools you know have the additional

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.189 
schools you know have the additional
shelving<00:05:11.729> in<00:05:11.880> your<00:05:12.000> locker<00:05:12.210> but<00:05:12.690> I<00:05:12.870> mean<00:05:13.139> this

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
shelving in your locker but I mean this

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.920 
shelving in your locker but I mean this
would<00:05:13.380> be<00:05:13.470> a<00:05:13.500> good<00:05:13.949> idea<00:05:14.180> even<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.360> when<00:05:15.840> you

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
would be a good idea even the when you

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.230 
would be a good idea even the when you
open<00:05:16.260> up<00:05:16.350> your<00:05:16.410> locker<00:05:16.770> some<00:05:17.430> of<00:05:17.639> the<00:05:17.880> top

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
open up your locker some of the top

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
open up your locker some of the top
sections<00:05:18.870> are<00:05:19.020> fairly<00:05:19.860> fairly<00:05:20.639> deep<00:05:21.060> and<00:05:21.330> a

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
sections are fairly fairly deep and a

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.750 
sections are fairly fairly deep and a
good<00:05:22.470> way<00:05:22.620> to<00:05:22.650> do<00:05:22.889> it<00:05:23.039> is<00:05:23.190> if<00:05:23.370> you<00:05:23.460> have<00:05:23.490> a

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
good way to do it is if you have a

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.820 
good way to do it is if you have a
locker<00:05:24.180> shelf<00:05:24.510> you<00:05:25.080> can<00:05:25.260> put<00:05:25.470> that<00:05:25.620> inside

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
locker shelf you can put that inside

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.129 
locker shelf you can put that inside
that<00:05:26.400> top<00:05:26.729> section<00:05:27.330> of<00:05:27.419> the<00:05:27.539> locker<00:05:27.750> and

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
that top section of the locker and

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.010 
that top section of the locker and
you've<00:05:28.620> still<00:05:28.979> kind<00:05:29.220> of<00:05:29.280> got<00:05:29.490> a<00:05:29.699> clay<00:05:30.120> area<00:05:30.630> you

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
you've still kind of got a clay area you

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.330 
you've still kind of got a clay area you
can<00:05:31.169> put<00:05:31.289> your<00:05:31.349> books<00:05:31.530> up<00:05:31.710> here<00:05:31.979> you<00:05:32.070> can<00:05:32.130> put
