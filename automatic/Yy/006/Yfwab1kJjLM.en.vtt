00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.700
 No one laughs about it today 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.040
 because the motorcycles from the current 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.230
 Cinema movie expendables three all come from 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.020

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.430
 have a second phone call and a mail 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.470

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.770
 stallone really have our motorcycle 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.750

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.440
 handing over the motorcycle his ring 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.540

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.060

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.229

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.149
 handmade 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.909
 At the moment the boys are working on one 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.090
 motorcycle symbolizing an eagle 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.090
 should 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.080
 b 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.300
 we build this motorcycle for the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.090
 President of besiktas istanbul 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.550
 he wanted a motorcycle in eagle from us 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.140
 So form a motorcycle that the logo of 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.330
 sent that shows one 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.959
 exceptionality of the motorcycle it

 consists of 1903 items like that 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.390
 founding year of the association still 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.550
 more extraordinary is probably the medusa 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.380
 which at first glance looks like a piece 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.750
 Scrap out of the museum looks like 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.120
 one of the most expensive motorcycles in the world 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.190
 worth over one million euros 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.440
 reason for the price many hundreds 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.440
 working hours and pure gold 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.950
 See these two snakeheads 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.960
 eyes of the two snakes consist of 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.820
 More files the whole motorcycle was without 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.390
 A drop of color completely made of gold 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.190
 manufactured 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.780
 We have white gold and yellow gold 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.910
 used at the same time we have him 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.840
 given an old look so it's antique 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.610
 looks like the owner of medusa is 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.740
 jeweler and did not want that 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.020
 motorcycle shines but he embittered 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.250
 That's why kelly has the gold 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.070
 extra with different chemicals 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:19.420
