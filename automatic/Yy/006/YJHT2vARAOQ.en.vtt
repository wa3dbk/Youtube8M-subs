all these big refactorings figure out

all these big refactorings figure out
the<00:00:45.420> frameworks<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.960> use<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.350> all<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.829> was

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
the frameworks to use and all that I was

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.069 
the frameworks to use and all that I was
thinking<00:00:47.730> would<00:00:48.239> there<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.600> better<00:00:48.750> way<00:00:48.899> to

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
thinking would there be a better way to

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.880 
thinking would there be a better way to
write<00:00:49.350> software

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
write software

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.369

I<00:00:50.010> started<00:00:50.670> browsing<00:00:51.120> around<00:00:51.690> reading

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
I started browsing around reading

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.500 
I started browsing around reading
research<00:00:52.739> papers<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.520> eventually<00:00:54.480> I

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
research papers and eventually I

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
research papers and eventually I
stumbled<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.140> flow-based<00:00:55.739> programming

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
stumbled on flow-based programming

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.069 
stumbled on flow-based programming
I<00:00:56.550> read<00:00:57.480> Paul<00:00:57.719> Morrison's<00:00:58.140> book<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> and

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
I read Paul Morrison's book on it and

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.630 
I read Paul Morrison's book on it and
started<00:01:01.079> thinking<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.980> actually<00:01:02.399> makes<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
started thinking this actually makes a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.620 
started thinking this actually makes a
lot<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.789> sense<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.979> started<00:01:04.979> writing<00:01:05.159> code

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
lot of sense and started writing code

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.539 
lot of sense and started writing code
the<00:01:06.630> first<00:01:06.869> version<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.260> no-flow<00:01:07.740> came<00:01:08.340> about

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the first version of no-flow came about

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.469 
the first version of no-flow came about
in<00:01:08.850> about<00:01:09.240> one<00:01:09.540> evening<00:01:10.909> didn't<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.060> much<00:01:12.210> but

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
in about one evening didn't do much but

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.160 
in about one evening didn't do much but
already<00:01:12.720> showed<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.710> basic<00:01:14.010> ideas<00:01:15.020> with<00:01:16.020> no

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
already showed the basic ideas with no

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.740 
already showed the basic ideas with no
flow<00:01:16.409> with<00:01:16.619> flow-based<00:01:16.830> programming<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:18.600> big

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
flow with flow-based programming the big

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.870 
flow with flow-based programming the big
benefit<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.590> logic<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.640> graph

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
benefit is that logic is in the graph

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
benefit is that logic is in the graph
it's<00:01:21.810> all<00:01:22.049> inherently<00:01:23.090> multi-threaded<00:01:24.119> it

and that just feels right now if you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.170 
and that just feels right now if you
think<00:01:51.650> about<00:01:51.890> how<00:01:52.520> software<00:01:52.970> is<00:01:53.030> usually

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180

instead you have to go through all these
hundreds<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:19.910> text<00:02:20.240> files<00:02:20.480> followed<00:02:20.990> the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
with no flow that's not the case because

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.550 
with no flow that's not the case because
the<00:02:27.890> graph<00:02:28.130> is<00:02:28.430> actually<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.750> light<00:02:29.930> logic<00:02:30.380> of

with<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.620> world<00:03:30.739> because<00:03:31.250> each<00:03:31.580> component<00:03:32.239> is

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
with the world because each component is

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.110 
with the world because each component is
always<00:03:33.350> reusable<00:03:34.220> because<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.550> logic<00:03:34.880> is<00:03:35.060> not

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
always reusable because the logic is not

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.030 
always reusable because the logic is not
in<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.630> component<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.140> logic<00:03:36.410> is<00:03:36.500> in<00:03:36.620> the

in the component the logic is in the

in the component the logic is in the
component<00:03:37.459> just<00:03:37.580> does<00:03:37.850> with<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.060> one<00:03:38.360> thing

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
component just does with that one thing

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.199 
component just does with that one thing
so<00:03:39.470> I've<00:03:39.560> been<00:03:39.650> amazed<00:03:39.920> at<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.190> reception<00:03:40.640> of

so I've been amazed at the reception of

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.970 
so I've been amazed at the reception of
there's<00:03:41.599> been<00:03:41.750> researchers<00:03:42.290> doing<00:03:42.739> their

there's been researchers doing their

there's been researchers doing their
work<00:03:43.129> in<00:03:43.340> there's<00:03:44.120> been<00:03:44.209> people<00:03:44.480> automating

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
work in there's been people automating

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.770 
work in there's been people automating
all<00:03:45.290> kinds<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.680> grunt<00:03:45.920> work

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
all kinds of grunt work

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.149 
all kinds of grunt work

and<00:03:55.450> that's<00:03:56.450> actually<00:03:56.659> what<00:03:56.900> we're<00:03:57.049> doing

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
and that's actually what we're doing

and that's actually what we're doing
here<00:03:57.709> -<00:03:57.889> we're<00:03:58.310> building<00:03:58.609> something<00:03:58.790> pretty

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
here - we're building something pretty

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.809 
here - we're building something pretty
interesting<00:03:59.389> pretty<00:04:00.170> amazing<00:04:00.680> but<00:04:00.889> that

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
interesting pretty amazing but that
