00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:05.840 

so<00:00:04.319> basically<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:04.920> thought<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.490> best<00:00:05.520> approach

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
so basically I thought the best approach

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.360 
so basically I thought the best approach
would<00:00:06.120> be<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.540> repeat<00:00:07.259> exactly<00:00:07.560> what<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.189> told

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
would be to repeat exactly what you told

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.370 
would be to repeat exactly what you told
me<00:00:08.490> in<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.730> first<00:00:08.910> call<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.570> shovel<00:00:10.320> the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
me in the first call and shovel the

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.940 
me in the first call and shovel the
words<00:00:10.559> around<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.920> bit<00:00:11.990> Wow<00:00:12.990> if<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.590> wasn't<00:00:13.769> such

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
