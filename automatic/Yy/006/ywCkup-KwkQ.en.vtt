of a threat he missed a few chances that

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.550 
of a threat he missed a few chances that
he<00:02:32.520> probably<00:02:32.940> should<00:02:33.150> have<00:02:33.210> converter<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.690> but

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
he probably should have converter on but

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.620 
he probably should have converter on but
the<00:02:35.280> defense<00:02:35.640> overall<00:02:35.940> was<00:02:36.060> good<00:02:36.240> after<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
the defense overall was good after the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.600 
the defense overall was good after the
after<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.170> glow<00:02:37.530> fronter<00:02:37.920> up<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.250> think<00:02:38.490> you

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
after that glow fronter up I think you

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.490 
after that glow fronter up I think you
know<00:02:38.730> not<00:02:39.450> by<00:02:39.600> turning<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.900> around<00:02:40.020> very<00:02:40.440> well

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
know not by turning it around very well

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.110 
know not by turning it around very well
that<00:02:41.280> was<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.550> seventh<00:02:41.850> minute<00:02:41.910> from

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
that was in the seventh minute from

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.700 
that was in the seventh minute from
trapped<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.600> then<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.930> 11th<00:02:43.380> minute<00:02:43.500> i

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
trapped and then the 11th minute i

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.680 
trapped and then the 11th minute i
believe<00:02:43.980> for<00:02:44.250> antler<00:02:44.610> i'm<00:02:44.880> just<00:02:45.480> going<00:02:45.600> to

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
believe for antler i'm just going to

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.420 
believe for antler i'm just going to
check<00:02:45.810> really<00:02:46.020> quick<00:02:46.110> he<00:02:46.440> he<00:02:46.710> hits<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.040> goal<00:02:47.220> i

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
check really quick he he hits a goal i

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.100 
check really quick he he hits a goal i
think<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.060> took<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.210> little<00:02:48.360> deflection<00:02:48.870> he<00:02:48.990> was

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
think it took a little deflection he was

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.050 
think it took a little deflection he was
kind<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.410> far<00:02:49.650> out<00:02:49.830> was<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.220> long-range<00:02:50.610> goal<00:02:50.880> I

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
kind of far out was a long-range goal I

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.430 
kind of far out was a long-range goal I
mean<00:02:51.210> most<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.720> schools<00:02:51.960> come<00:02:52.140> from<00:02:52.290> long

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
mean most of schools come from long

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.230 
mean most of schools come from long
range<00:02:52.470> anyways<00:02:52.980> nonetheless<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.940> think<00:02:53.970> it

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
range anyways nonetheless I think it

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.640 
range anyways nonetheless I think it
took<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.480> little<00:02:54.630> deflection<00:02:55.110> was<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.320> beautiful

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
took a little deflection was a beautiful

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
quicker today he looked like he was

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.290 
quicker today he looked like he was
making<00:03:58.260> sharp<00:03:58.560> as<00:03:58.709> passes<00:03:59.250> he<00:03:59.400> had<00:03:59.610> to<00:04:00.150> make

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
making sharp as passes he had to make

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.540

which<00:04:02.970> I'll<00:04:03.120> get<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.300> in<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.570> second<00:04:03.959> but<00:04:04.890> coming

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
which I'll get to in a second but coming

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.310 
which I'll get to in a second but coming
out<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.400> second<00:04:05.700> half<00:04:06.020> Napoli<00:04:07.020> picked<00:04:07.230> it

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
out of the second half Napoli picked it

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.080 
out of the second half Napoli picked it
up<00:04:07.350> again<00:04:07.560> in<00:04:07.860> Milan<00:04:08.160> they<00:04:08.370> really<00:04:08.850> put<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.030> lot

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
up again in Milan they really put a lot

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.430 
up again in Milan they really put a lot
of<00:04:09.180> pressure<00:04:09.390> on<00:04:09.480> me<00:04:09.630> lon<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.780> think<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.290> they

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
of pressure on me lon I think that they

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.110 
of pressure on me lon I think that they
forced<00:04:10.739> me<00:04:10.800> lon<00:04:11.040> into<00:04:11.340> their<00:04:11.489> own<00:04:11.580> half<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.940> lot

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
forced me lon into their own half a lot

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.610 
forced me lon into their own half a lot
the<00:04:12.330> second<00:04:12.660> half<00:04:12.750> more<00:04:13.019> than<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.230> first<00:04:13.410> half

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
the second half more than the first half

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.770 
the second half more than the first half
but<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.250> think<00:04:14.489> it<00:04:14.610> was<00:04:14.700> really<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:15.150> dominating

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
but I think it was really a dominating

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.420 
but I think it was really a dominating
game<00:04:15.989> for<00:04:16.169> Napoli<00:04:16.440> besides<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.010> chances<00:04:17.370> you

game for Napoli besides the chances you

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.120 
game for Napoli besides the chances you
know<00:04:17.600> Milan<00:04:18.600> scared<00:04:19.019> Napoli<00:04:19.440> sometimes<00:04:19.799> Pepe

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
know Milan scared Napoli sometimes Pepe

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.650 
know Milan scared Napoli sometimes Pepe
Reina<00:04:20.340> had<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.640> come<00:04:20.760> out<00:04:20.850> a<00:04:20.910> lot<00:04:21.060> he<00:04:21.239> almost

think every year was injured but Gulen

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.559 
think every year was injured but Gulen
played<00:05:43.949> a<00:05:43.979> great<00:05:44.279> game<00:05:44.400> you<00:05:45.240> know<00:05:45.300> I<00:05:45.360> didn't

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569

even<00:05:45.599> know<00:05:45.750> he<00:05:45.870> takes<00:05:46.050> corner<00:05:46.379> kicks<00:05:46.589> but<00:05:46.830> he

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 
even know he takes corner kicks but he

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:48.920

fantastic<00:05:49.589> i<00:05:49.680> think<00:05:49.860> his<00:05:49.919> defense<00:05:50.250> was<00:05:50.310> on

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490
