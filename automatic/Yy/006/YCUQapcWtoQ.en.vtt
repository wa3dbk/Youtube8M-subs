good job on it and everything is
controlled<00:01:15.990> by<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.710> ring<00:01:16.950> right<00:01:17.130> here<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.700> no

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
controlled by this ring right here so no

controlled<00:01:22.020> by<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.500> ring<00:01:23.009> there's<00:01:23.850> your

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
controlled by this ring there's your

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.109 
controlled by this ring there's your
LEDs<00:01:24.930> down<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.259> there<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.439> three<00:01:26.009> Cree<00:01:26.340> XML<00:01:26.880> LZ

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
LEDs down in there so three Cree XML LZ

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.630 
LEDs down in there so three Cree XML LZ
s<00:01:27.420> smooth<00:01:28.200> reflectors<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.070> you're<00:01:29.400> gonna<00:01:29.490> get

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
s smooth reflectors so you're gonna get

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.219 
s smooth reflectors so you're gonna get
pretty<00:01:29.880> decent<00:01:30.150> distance<00:01:30.720> out<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.049> one

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
pretty decent distance out of this one

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.510 
pretty decent distance out of this one
you'll<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.710> better<00:01:31.920> when<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.369> go

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
you'll see that better when we go

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.550 
you'll see that better when we go
outside<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.750> independent

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
outside but you have independent

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.429 
outside but you have independent
reflectors<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:34.979> each<00:01:35.220> LED<00:01:35.640> three<00:01:36.270> LEDs<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.930> lot

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
reflectors for each LED three LEDs a lot

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.929 
reflectors for each LED three LEDs a lot
of<00:01:37.590> power<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.159> them<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.640> you've<00:01:38.790> got<00:01:38.909> a

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
of power going to them so you've got a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.910 
of power going to them so you've got a
lot<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.150> material<00:01:39.600> here<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> big<00:01:40.290> fins<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
lot of material here and the big fins a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.499 
lot of material here and the big fins a
lot<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> surface<00:01:41.610> area<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.939> helps<00:01:42.210> dissipate

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
lot of surface area that helps dissipate

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.210 
lot of surface area that helps dissipate
all<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.930> heat<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.229> those<00:01:43.439> LEDs<00:01:44.070> are

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
all that heat that those LEDs are

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.740 
all that heat that those LEDs are
getting<00:01:44.430> generating<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> light<00:01:45.720> is

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
getting generating so the light is

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.859 
getting generating so the light is
powered<00:01:46.320> by<00:01:46.590> three<00:01:46.860> 8650<00:01:47.759> batteries<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.750> when

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
powered by three 8650 batteries so when

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.420 
powered by three 8650 batteries so when
I<00:01:48.899> open<00:01:49.140> up<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> end<00:01:49.500> stick<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> few<00:01:50.100> batteries

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
I open up the end stick a few batteries

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.219 
I open up the end stick a few batteries
in<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.540> I'll<00:01:51.630> show<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> interface

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
in here and I'll show you the interface

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.859 
in here and I'll show you the interface
and<00:01:52.530> everything<00:01:53.119> but<00:01:54.119> here's<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> tail<00:01:54.630> cap

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and everything but here's the tail cap

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.929 
and everything but here's the tail cap
off<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.799> here's<00:01:56.009> your<00:01:56.130> contacts<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.820> those

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
off so here's your contacts and those

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.359 
off so here's your contacts and those
actually<00:01:57.439> rotate<00:01:58.439> independently<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.189> tail

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
actually rotate independently the tail

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.550 
actually rotate independently the tail
cap<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.759> pretty<00:02:00.060> cool<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:01.140> we're<00:02:01.229> gonna<00:02:01.320> take

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
cap is pretty cool so we're gonna take

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.399 
cap is pretty cool so we're gonna take
the<00:02:01.710> batteries<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.750> they're<00:02:03.750> all<00:02:03.899> gonna<00:02:04.110> go

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
the batteries and they're all gonna go

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.350 
the batteries and they're all gonna go
you<00:02:05.340> can<00:02:05.460> actually<00:02:05.579> look<00:02:05.939> there's<00:02:06.240> no

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
you can actually look there's no

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.029 
you can actually look there's no
markings<00:02:06.719> or<00:02:06.869> anything<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:07.920> you

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
markings or anything like that if you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.320 
markings or anything like that if you
look<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> instructions<00:02:08.849> they<00:02:09.000> all<00:02:09.119> go

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
look in the instructions they all go

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.170 
look in the instructions they all go
positive<00:02:09.989> end<00:02:10.440> down<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.489> positive<00:02:12.030> end

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
positive end down so positive end

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.700 
positive end down so positive end
towards<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
towards the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.970 
towards the
head<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.130> then<00:02:13.580> stick<00:02:13.850> find<00:02:14.750> that<00:02:14.900> back<00:02:15.080> up

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.560 

tighten<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.160> on<00:02:19.280> down<00:02:21.220> get<00:02:22.220> all<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.610> way<00:02:22.790> and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
tighten it on down get all the way and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.880 
tighten it on down get all the way and
then<00:02:23.780> we'll<00:02:23.900> show<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.200> operation<00:02:24.830> of

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
then we'll show you the operation of

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.440 
then we'll show you the operation of
this<00:02:25.040> thing<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.820> have<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.000> reading<00:02:26.240> here

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
this thing so you have a reading here

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.420 
this thing so you have a reading here
you<00:02:26.540> have<00:02:26.690> an<00:02:26.810> arrow<00:02:27.050> engraved<00:02:27.950> on<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.250> ring

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
you have an arrow engraved on the ring

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.320 
you have an arrow engraved on the ring
hi

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
hi

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.530 
hi
strobe<00:02:29.660> SOS<00:02:30.490> preset<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:31.730> select<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:32.270> way<00:02:32.480> so

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
strobe SOS preset and select this way so

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.010 
strobe SOS preset and select this way so
we'll<00:02:32.750> talk<00:02:32.870> about<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.230> preset<00:02:33.680> modes<00:02:33.920> first

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
we'll talk about the preset modes first

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.450 
we'll talk about the preset modes first
it<00:02:36.020> says<00:02:36.230> preset<00:02:36.680> but<00:02:36.830> this<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.040> actually<00:02:37.160> what

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
it says preset but this is actually what

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.070 
it says preset but this is actually what
you<00:02:37.490> program<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.420> ones<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.810> can't

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
you program so the ones that you can't

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.580 
you program so the ones that you can't
change<00:02:39.350> are<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.250> left<00:02:40.460> so<00:02:41.120> first<00:02:42.110> one<00:02:42.350> is

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
change are to the left so first one is

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.290 
change are to the left so first one is
high<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.280> that's<00:02:43.490> going<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.670> be<00:02:43.790> max<00:02:44.060> output

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
high and that's going to be max output

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.710 
high and that's going to be max output
of<00:02:44.630> all<00:02:44.780> three<00:02:45.110> LEDs<00:02:45.530> they<00:02:46.070> rated<00:02:46.280> at<00:02:46.490> 2000<00:02:47.060> 350

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
of all three LEDs they rated at 2000 350

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.720 
of all three LEDs they rated at 2000 350
lumens<00:02:48.050> whole<00:02:48.830> heck<00:02:49.190> of<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.370> lot<00:02:49.490> of<00:02:49.610> light

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
lumens whole heck of a lot of light

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.820 
lumens whole heck of a lot of light
coming<00:02:49.760> out<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.270> thing

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
coming out of this thing

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.120 
coming out of this thing
strobe<00:02:52.810> SOS<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:54.350> one<00:02:54.590> that's<00:02:54.680> all<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:54.890> way<00:02:55.010> to

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
strobe SOS is one that's all the way to

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.640 
strobe SOS is one that's all the way to
the<00:02:55.250> left<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:56.000> then<00:02:56.150> back<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.450> strobe<00:02:56.750> back<00:02:57.500> to

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
the left and then back to strobe back to

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.090 
the left and then back to strobe back to
the<00:02:57.740> high<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.220> then<00:02:58.940> back<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.330> off<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.930> know<00:03:00.920> it

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
the high and then back to off I know it

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.440 
the high and then back to off I know it
about<00:03:01.160> off<00:03:01.490> it<00:03:01.730> is<00:03:01.850> actually<00:03:02.180> going<00:03:02.240> to<00:03:02.360> be

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
about off it is actually going to be

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.500 
about off it is actually going to be
drawing<00:03:02.630> a<00:03:02.870> very<00:03:03.080> tiny<00:03:03.470> itty-bitty<00:03:03.920> bit<00:03:04.340> of

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
drawing a very tiny itty-bitty bit of

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.180 
drawing a very tiny itty-bitty bit of
power<00:03:05.510> from<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.930> batteries<00:03:06.350> it's<00:03:06.950> going<00:03:07.130> to

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
power from the batteries it's going to

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.590 
power from the batteries it's going to
last<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.490> long<00:03:07.610> time<00:03:07.910> but<00:03:08.090> if<00:03:08.210> you're<00:03:08.330> concerned

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
last a long time but if you're concerned

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.240 
last a long time but if you're concerned
about<00:03:08.690> that<00:03:08.840> what<00:03:09.590> you<00:03:09.740> can<00:03:09.860> do<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.070> make<00:03:10.220> sure

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
about that what you can do to make sure

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.940 
about that what you can do to make sure
it's<00:03:10.550> actually<00:03:10.850> off<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.270> turn<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.470> high<00:03:12.620> and

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
it's actually off is turn it to high and

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.100 
it's actually off is turn it to high and
then<00:03:13.370> loosen<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.850> tail<00:03:14.060> cap<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.870> point

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
then loosen the tail cap to the point

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.420 
then loosen the tail cap to the point
where<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.440> turns<00:03:15.650> off<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.100> you'll<00:03:16.220> see<00:03:16.340> it

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
where it turns off and you'll see it

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.040 
where it turns off and you'll see it
actually<00:03:16.550> power<00:03:16.880> off<00:03:17.120> even<00:03:17.810> though<00:03:17.930> it's

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
actually power off even though it's

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.900 
actually power off even though it's
still<00:03:18.230> on<00:03:18.380> high<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.920> then<00:03:19.460> you<00:03:19.550> can<00:03:19.670> switch<00:03:19.820> it

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
still on high and then you can switch it

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.190 
still on high and then you can switch it
back<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.240> off<00:03:20.390> just<00:03:20.600> for<00:03:20.750> further<00:03:21.020> assurance

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
back to off just for further assurance

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.050 
back to off just for further assurance
just<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.130> make<00:03:22.250> sure<00:03:22.280> it's<00:03:22.490> not<00:03:22.580> drawing<00:03:22.820> any

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
just to make sure it's not drawing any

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.060 
just to make sure it's not drawing any
power<00:03:23.270> at<00:03:23.540> all<00:03:23.660> but<00:03:24.380> even<00:03:24.530> if<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:24.770> do<00:03:24.860> have<00:03:25.040> it

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
power at all but even if you do have it

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.280 
power at all but even if you do have it
tightened<00:03:25.490> on<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.750> have<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.020> in<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.170> off

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
tightened on and you have it in the off

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.630 
tightened on and you have it in the off
position<00:03:27.320> it's<00:03:27.890> good<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.070> be<00:03:28.130> drawing<00:03:28.310> very

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
position it's good to be drawing very

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.830 
position it's good to be drawing very
minimal<00:03:29.000> power<00:03:29.180> it's<00:03:29.420> not<00:03:29.450> something<00:03:29.780> you

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
minimal power it's not something you

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.210 
minimal power it's not something you
have<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:29.990> worry<00:03:30.200> about<00:03:30.260> draining<00:03:31.130> your

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
have to worry about draining your

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.500 
have to worry about draining your
batteries<00:03:31.580> overnight<00:03:31.970> or<00:03:32.180> anything<00:03:32.330> like

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
batteries overnight or anything like

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.380 
batteries overnight or anything like
that<00:03:32.570> so<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.590> preset<00:03:34.040> is<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.910> first<00:03:35.120> one<00:03:35.270> to

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
that so the preset is the first one to

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.420 
that so the preset is the first one to
the<00:03:35.420> right<00:03:35.600> of<00:03:35.660> off<00:03:35.960> and<00:03:36.230> this<00:03:36.920> is<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.250> mode

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
the right of off and this is the mode

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.400 
the right of off and this is the mode
that<00:03:37.640> you<00:03:37.820> can<00:03:38.000> actually<00:03:38.180> set<00:03:38.600> and<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.230> way<00:03:39.350> to

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
that you can actually set and the way to

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.620 
that you can actually set and the way to
set<00:03:39.680> that<00:03:39.860> is<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.520> turn<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.850> over<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.300> select

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
set that is to turn it over to select

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.650 
set that is to turn it over to select
and<00:03:41.930> what<00:03:42.920> you'll<00:03:43.100> see<00:03:43.160> is<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:44.150> light<00:03:44.300> ramp

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
and what you'll see is the light ramp

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.940 
and what you'll see is the light ramp
through<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.020> different<00:03:45.320> outputs<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:45.890> it

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
through the different outputs and it

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.710 
through the different outputs and it
does<00:03:46.100> it<00:03:46.280> very<00:03:46.400> very<00:03:46.700> slowly<00:03:47.120> which<00:03:47.420> is<00:03:47.540> kind

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
does it very very slowly which is kind

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.850 
does it very very slowly which is kind
of<00:03:47.780> nice<00:03:47.900> because<00:03:48.110> you<00:03:48.320> set<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.650> very

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
of nice because you set it very

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.130 
of nice because you set it very
precisely<00:03:49.100> to<00:03:49.550> exactly<00:03:50.120> what<00:03:50.270> you<00:03:50.390> want<00:03:50.600> and

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
precisely to exactly what you want and

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.600 
precisely to exactly what you want and
it<00:03:51.260> goes<00:03:51.410> down<00:03:51.620> really<00:03:51.800> low<00:03:51.950> goes<00:03:52.370> down<00:03:52.520> to

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
it goes down really low goes down to

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.670 
it goes down really low goes down to
something<00:03:52.790> like<00:03:52.970> 15<00:03:53.420> lumens<00:03:53.630> all<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:54.470> way<00:03:54.560> up

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
something like 15 lumens all the way up

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.790 
something like 15 lumens all the way up
to<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:54.860> full<00:03:55.070> output<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.670> the<00:03:56.440> 2,350<00:03:57.440> lumens

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
to the full output of the 2,350 lumens

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.590 
to the full output of the 2,350 lumens
and<00:03:58.010> it'll<00:03:58.250> stop<00:03:58.550> at<00:03:58.820> a<00:03:58.880> couple<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.270> points

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
and it'll stop at a couple of points

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.840 
and it'll stop at a couple of points
just<00:04:00.230> so<00:04:00.320> you<00:04:00.380> can<00:04:00.500> set<00:04:00.710> it<00:04:00.860> to<00:04:01.010> exactly<00:04:01.550> what

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
just so you can set it to exactly what

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.400 
just so you can set it to exactly what
you<00:04:01.940> want<00:04:01.970> see<00:04:02.300> you<00:04:02.330> see<00:04:02.510> how<00:04:02.540> low<00:04:02.810> it'll<00:04:02.960> go<00:04:03.170> if

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
you want see you see how low it'll go if

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.620 
you want see you see how low it'll go if
we<00:04:03.590> just<00:04:03.770> go<00:04:03.890> right<00:04:03.920> back<00:04:04.250> over<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:04.610> preset<00:04:05.060> and

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
we just go right back over to preset and

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.810 
we just go right back over to preset and
we<00:04:05.720> have<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:06.020> set<00:04:06.230> to<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:06.740> it's<00:04:07.670> not

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
we have it set to that and it's not

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.160 
we have it set to that and it's not
going<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.030> change<00:04:08.090> until<00:04:08.600> you<00:04:08.690> go<00:04:08.840> back<00:04:09.020> to

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
going to change until you go back to

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.200 
going to change until you go back to
select<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:10.160> if<00:04:10.220> we<00:04:10.340> turn<00:04:10.490> it<00:04:10.550> off<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:10.970> turn<00:04:11.180> it

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
select so if we turn it off and turn it

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.150 
select so if we turn it off and turn it
back<00:04:11.300> to<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.600> preset<00:04:12.020> it's<00:04:12.710> gonna<00:04:12.830> always<00:04:13.040> be

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
back to the preset it's gonna always be

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.340 
back to the preset it's gonna always be
and<00:04:13.670> then<00:04:14.120> output<00:04:14.450> that<00:04:14.540> we<00:04:14.630> set<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:14.960> and

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
and then output that we set it to and

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.780 
and then output that we set it to and
it's<00:04:15.620> not<00:04:15.710> going<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:15.950> change<00:04:16.190> until<00:04:16.430> we<00:04:16.670> go

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
it's not going to change until we go

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.460

interface<00:04:18.859> on<00:04:19.010> this<00:04:19.160> so<00:04:19.370> you<00:04:19.430> have<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.700> off

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850

the right of that is preset which is the

the right of that is preset which is the

mode that

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.589 
mode that
you<00:04:25.979> can<00:04:26.129> set<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.909> way<00:04:26.999> to<00:04:27.060> set<00:04:27.300> that<00:04:27.449> is

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
you can set and the way to set that is

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.149 
you can set and the way to set that is
to<00:04:27.749> go<00:04:27.870> into<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.259> select<00:04:28.560> mode<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.039> I'll

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:29.159 
to go into the select mode and I'll

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:30.619 
to go into the select mode and I'll
start<00:04:29.370> wrapping<00:04:29.759> through<00:04:30.030> all<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.449> different

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:30.629 
start wrapping through all the different

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:32.659 
start wrapping through all the different
outputs<00:04:31.080> so<00:04:31.860> that's<00:04:32.009> the<00:04:32.099> interface<00:04:32.340> and

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
outputs so that's the interface and

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.999 
outputs so that's the interface and
everything<00:04:33.090> of<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.330> X<00:04:33.599> star<00:04:33.870> s<00:04:34.080> 1<00:04:34.229> we're<00:04:34.860> gonna

everything of the X star s 1 we're gonna

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.230 
everything of the X star s 1 we're gonna
go<00:04:35.099> ahead<00:04:35.159> take<00:04:35.370> this<00:04:35.460> outside<00:04:35.669> and<00:04:35.909> we'll

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
go ahead take this outside and we'll

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.529 
go ahead take this outside and we'll
show<00:04:36.389> you<00:04:36.419> how<00:04:36.509> this<00:04:36.719> guy<00:04:36.840> does<00:04:36.900> outside<00:04:38.479> ok<00:04:39.479> so

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
the scale on it even out of the hundred

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.290 
the scale on it even out of the hundred
feet<00:05:28.499> to<00:05:28.680> spill<00:05:28.919> alone<00:05:29.219> is<00:05:29.909> gonna<00:05:30.060> light<00:05:30.270> up

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
feet to spill alone is gonna light up

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.140 
feet to spill alone is gonna light up
that<00:05:30.449> see<00:05:30.750> just<00:05:31.289> fine<00:05:31.560> it's<00:05:32.219> still<00:05:32.430> alone<00:05:32.699> it's

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
that see just fine it's still alone it's

that see just fine it's still alone it's
putting<00:05:33.330> out<00:05:33.449> so<00:05:33.629> much<00:05:33.750> like<00:05:34.050> that<00:05:34.620> you<00:05:35.159> can

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
putting out so much like that you can

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.439 
putting out so much like that you can
see<00:05:35.400> everything<00:05:35.639> out<00:05:35.849> there<00:05:36.029> really<00:05:36.210> really

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
see everything out there really really

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.179 
see everything out there really really
well<00:05:36.629> so<00:05:37.020> this<00:05:37.139> is<00:05:37.199> why<00:05:37.469> I<00:05:37.500> said<00:05:37.979> this<00:05:38.069> before

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:38.189 
well so this is why I said this before

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:39.469 
well so this is why I said this before
but<00:05:38.490> this<00:05:38.580> is<00:05:38.699> why<00:05:38.819> I<00:05:38.849> really<00:05:39.060> like<00:05:39.270> pre

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
but this is why I really like pre

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.510 
but this is why I really like pre
focused<00:05:39.839> reflectors<00:05:40.289> get<00:05:40.979> the<00:05:41.039> hot<00:05:41.159> spot<00:05:41.399> in

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
focused reflectors get the hot spot in

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.920 
focused reflectors get the hot spot in
the<00:05:41.580> center<00:05:41.849> so<00:05:42.089> you<00:05:42.149> can<00:05:42.270> light<00:05:42.509> up<00:05:42.539> with<00:05:42.810> the

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
the center so you can light up with the

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.839 
the center so you can light up with the
pointing<00:05:43.229> that<00:05:43.379> but<00:05:44.009> you<00:05:44.099> also<00:05:44.219> get<00:05:44.430> the<00:05:44.550> spill

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
pointing that but you also get the spill

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.159 
pointing that but you also get the spill
around<00:05:45.360> it<00:05:45.539> which<00:05:45.719> is<00:05:45.839> gonna<00:05:45.960> light<00:05:46.139> up

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
around it which is gonna light up

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.290 
around it which is gonna light up
everything<00:05:46.500> around<00:05:46.710> it<00:05:47.009> very<00:05:47.219> very<00:05:47.789> easy<00:05:48.029> beam

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
everything around it very very easy beam

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.659 
everything around it very very easy beam
pattern<00:05:48.620> so<00:05:49.620> you<00:05:49.680> don't<00:05:50.250> have<00:05:50.339> it<00:05:50.520> on<00:05:50.580> the

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
pattern so you don't have it on the

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.279 
pattern so you don't have it on the
lowest<00:05:50.819> setting<00:05:51.149> seems<00:05:51.539> even<00:05:51.960> on<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.110> lowest

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
lowest setting seems even on the lowest

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.820 
lowest setting seems even on the lowest
setting<00:05:52.669> still<00:05:53.669> very<00:05:53.879> useful<00:05:54.289> up<00:05:55.289> close<00:05:55.589> kind

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
setting still very useful up close kind

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.240 
setting still very useful up close kind
of<00:05:55.919> stuff<00:05:56.360> and<00:05:57.360> but<00:05:58.169> on<00:05:58.289> high<00:05:58.469> is<00:05:58.919> obviously

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
of stuff and but on high is obviously

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.089 
of stuff and but on high is obviously
where<00:05:59.520> this<00:05:59.639> thing<00:05:59.879> really<00:06:00.479> shines<00:06:00.810> uh-huh

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
where this thing really shines uh-huh

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:03.619 
where this thing really shines uh-huh

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
try on some water distance so I could

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:09.730 
try on some water distance so I could
show<00:06:07.469> you<00:06:07.500> how<00:06:07.620> this<00:06:07.770> thing<00:06:07.830> really<00:06:08.099> performs

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
show you how this thing really performs

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.600 
show you how this thing really performs
all<00:06:10.740> right<00:06:10.889> we've<00:06:10.979> got<00:06:11.099> some<00:06:11.219> more<00:06:11.399> distance

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
all right we've got some more distance

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.899 
all right we've got some more distance
for<00:06:12.089> the<00:06:12.240> X<00:06:12.389> star<00:06:12.689> to<00:06:12.930> work<00:06:13.080> with<00:06:13.370> big<00:06:14.370> 40<00:06:14.729> mag

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
for the X star to work with big 40 mag

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:16.550 
for the X star to work with big 40 mag
like<00:06:15.149> that<00:06:15.300> I<00:06:15.389> always<00:06:15.569> use<00:06:15.930> we're<00:06:16.289> gonna<00:06:16.439> try

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
like that I always use we're gonna try

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.809 
like that I always use we're gonna try
out<00:06:16.680> the<00:06:16.770> mag<00:06:16.949> light<00:06:17.099> first<00:06:17.370> and<00:06:17.610> then<00:06:17.699> we'll

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819 
out the mag light first and then we'll

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.369 
out the mag light first and then we'll
try<00:06:17.969> out<00:06:18.089> the<00:06:18.180> X<00:06:18.330> star<00:06:18.710> okay<00:06:20.750> there<00:06:21.750> is<00:06:21.960> the<00:06:21.990> top

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:22.379 
try out the X star okay there is the top

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:25.459 
try out the X star okay there is the top
of<00:06:22.529> my<00:06:22.620> chimney<00:06:22.889> at<00:06:23.250> about<00:06:23.430> 25<00:06:23.849> yards<00:06:24.319> trees<00:06:25.319> in

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:25.469 
of my chimney at about 25 yards trees in

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:26.749 
of my chimney at about 25 yards trees in
my<00:06:25.529> neighbor's<00:06:25.830> yard<00:06:25.860> and<00:06:26.310> about<00:06:26.580> a<00:06:26.610> hundred

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
my neighbor's yard and about a hundred

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:29.749 
my neighbor's yard and about a hundred
yards<00:06:28.099> doesn't<00:06:29.099> really<00:06:29.219> make<00:06:29.339> it<00:06:29.370> out<00:06:29.580> to<00:06:29.669> the

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
yards doesn't really make it out to the

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.579 
yards doesn't really make it out to the
trees<00:06:29.939> all<00:06:30.089> that<00:06:30.240> well<00:06:30.389> let's<00:06:31.080> try<00:06:31.199> out<00:06:31.349> the<00:06:31.439> X

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:31.589 
trees all that well let's try out the X

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:34.699 
trees all that well let's try out the X
star<00:06:31.800> see<00:06:32.069> how<00:06:32.189> it<00:06:32.339> does<00:06:33.259> so<00:06:34.259> there<00:06:34.440> is<00:06:34.589> the

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:34.709 
star see how it does so there is the

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:36.949 
star see how it does so there is the
chimney<00:06:34.949> 25<00:06:35.759> yards<00:06:36.149> and<00:06:36.360> actually<00:06:36.750> you<00:06:36.839> can

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:36.959 
chimney 25 yards and actually you can

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:39.050 
chimney 25 yards and actually you can
already<00:06:37.080> see<00:06:37.319> lights<00:06:38.069> up<00:06:38.339> the

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
already see lights up the

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.530 
already see lights up the
he's<00:06:39.270> beyond<00:06:39.600> that<00:06:39.840> very<00:06:40.830> very<00:06:41.070> well<00:06:41.540> it

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
he's beyond that very very well it

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.670 
he's beyond that very very well it
wasn't<00:06:42.720> even<00:06:42.960> just<00:06:43.139> so<00:06:43.290> you<00:06:43.380> can<00:06:43.470> see

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
wasn't even just so you can see

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.980 
wasn't even just so you can see
everything's<00:06:44.639> lit<00:06:44.850> up<00:06:44.970> extremely<00:06:45.270> well<00:06:45.540> no

out there even lights up lights up the
star<00:06:49.919> in<00:06:50.040> the<00:06:50.130> background<00:06:51.200> that's<00:06:52.200> kind<00:06:52.410> of

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
star in the background that's kind of

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:52.760

cool
a<00:06:52.800> little<00:06:53.400> start<00:06:53.610> poking<00:06:53.910> through<00:06:54.000> all<00:06:54.690> right

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
a little start poking through all right

but you can see great throwing this one
great<00:06:59.520> distance<00:06:59.970> and<00:07:00.180> we'll<00:07:00.810> do<00:07:00.900> a<00:07:00.930> distance

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 
great distance and we'll do a distance

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.570 
great distance and we'll do a distance
comparison<00:07:01.889> where<00:07:02.010> we<00:07:02.100> go<00:07:02.220> out<00:07:02.310> with<00:07:02.460> even

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 
comparison where we go out with even

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.550 
comparison where we go out with even
more<00:07:02.850> distance<00:07:03.180> pretty<00:07:03.389> soon<00:07:03.600> but<00:07:04.230> you<00:07:04.380> see
