00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.700
 hello ladies and gentlemen with you again 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.899
 with bregman and the next video on the channel 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.820
 dedicated to the next new build 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.530
 the computer will not go deep 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.410
 like the last video who are interested 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.420
 just look a little bit of accessories 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.500
 today we decided with a colleague with ours 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.100
 build a computer 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.960
 so as not cheap good 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.070
 fast speed but actually why 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.500
 let's start the wellton case so big 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.050
 I will not show much volume 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.510
 last video we have in principle 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.090
 likewise there was a corpus similar to this one 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.910
 that there is not much to say good 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.980
 robust durable large case 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.140
 that's what our base will be based on 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.780
 platform as always motherboard 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.930
 from gigabyte apt-85 order hd 3 series 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.760
 not very expensive two memory slots but 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.379
 in principle, your money is worth running 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.230
 fast naturally proprietary utility 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.510
 dual bios of course 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.340
 shawl with built-in but 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.670
 actually on it we will collect 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.560
 socket 1150 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.510
 the processor will be installed on it 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:17.040
 and the third is bark and 340 150 s 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.750
 clock frequency of 3 and 5 it turns out this 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.909
 CPU we will install here 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.530
 here lies such a standard radiator 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:33.020
 from zalmana good thin aluminum 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:34.799
 ribs easy mounting mounts but here 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.460
 RAM will be with us 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.130
 installed such a low die 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.530
 memory so that the radiator does not rest 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.130
 from corsair ie vengeance memory from 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.439
 corsair 8 gigabytes get 1 die 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.840
 8 gigabytes respectively clock 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.670
 a frequency of 1600 go to the supply part of 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.960
 us as always power supply zalman on 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.420
 500 watts in principle for this system 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.090
 quite naturally enough with 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.890
 jet stream palit 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.030
 670 cards are very good fast but 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.510
 low power consumption 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.599
 therefore, in principle, will take all 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.720
 It will be great even from the power reserve 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:24.780
 the card is 256 bits and 2 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.220
 gigabytes of graphics memory on board 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.879
 Here is such a big beautiful card 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:37.110
 box like a monitor almost 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:39.239
 here or from a laptop like what's next on 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.540
 what we have everything will be stored under 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.140
 we will have ssd installed 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.329
 new drive such a new line 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.209
 will turn away 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.849
 it turns out that sized 450 vertex 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.540
 it turns out pretty good 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.799
 Of course there are a lot of bad reviews but 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.140
 set try anyway will 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.870
 quickly and very quickly spinning all the same 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.610
 good drives this drive y 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.480
 we have already been made so heavy 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.790
 form factor like a case so hard 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.720
 all as it should complete course 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.940
 There is a plate for mounting 35 for hard 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.910
 drives for mounting in conventional cube casing 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.250
 how would stress on nakleechka but all 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.930
 such a 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.329
 under file storage we will and 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.870
 naturally used seagate drive 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:35.280
 barracuda 1 terabyte will go with us 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:38.220
 drive d so to speak 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.709
 the rest of samsung 9p's drive 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.620
 Well, as always, we will have a military 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:48.540
 module used to connect with 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.160
 Internet d-link dwa-525 that is 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.109
 such here we will have an assembly 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.109
 further installation will show after 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.690
 Here they installed him a motherboard 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.579
 put the video card hooked front 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.139
 years hdd indicators 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:09.959
 and the cook turns out to be the cook here with us 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:13.549
 will connect installed ddt 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.100
 installed ssd installed drive 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.530
 respectively 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:22.330
 so here it all looks like it turns out 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.520
 sata we have 012 respectively connected 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.110
 all right here so that's it 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.220
 looks so small 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.750
 cable management installation from these all 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.740
 males 4 usb ports on the front panel 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.750
 accordingly, the sound is everything else 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:43.210
 now how would we install the block 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:46.030
 already final assembly a little later well 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.910
 here are ladies and gentlemen ready assembly 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.430
 given so far here we have collected so here 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.500
 it all looks like it looks like a cable we 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.890
 begin everything fixed hard to 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.080
 Well, that is, well, two words I can 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.840
 say what is the landing here 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.900
 front and rear seats for fans 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.510
 for the so-called cooling tx 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.940
 as she calls immediately make a reservation 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.670
 useless thing absolutely do not sculpt 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.830
 the fans are not here not here 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.470
 this is extra noise extra dust 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.200
 accordingly, they will not cool you down 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.300
 the processor is not a video card that is, if u 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.700
 you on the processor can not cope 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.500
 cooling change to more improved 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.930
 radiator that is cooler horse more expensive 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.090
 take if not cope on the card 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.520
 cooling well there over time can be 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.710
 then you can upgrade something there 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.590
 put more fan but if like 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.500
 would have the possibility of all this nothing then 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.720
 there is a fan no need to do that is 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.580
 its cooling system handle 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.830
 main large computer case 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.320
 put up from the floor and away from 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.180
 carpets and more to get out the house you do not 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.000
 there will be no inheritance and no computer 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.350
 turn into a vacuum cleaner respectively 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.170
 such recommendations 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.650
 Well, as if all of this assembly all 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.650
 thank
