recently<00:00:02.700> some<00:00:02.939> friends<00:00:03.210> of<00:00:03.300> mine<00:00:03.419> went<00:00:03.659> to

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
recently some friends of mine went to

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.990 
recently some friends of mine went to
the<00:00:03.870> Gordon<00:00:04.230> dam<00:00:04.440> in<00:00:04.680> Tasmania<00:00:05.279> which<00:00:05.819> is<00:00:05.970> a

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
the Gordon dam in Tasmania which is a

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.820 
the Gordon dam in Tasmania which is a
hundred<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.450> twenty<00:00:06.750> six<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.170> half<00:00:07.319> meters

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
hundred and twenty six and a half meters

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.990 
hundred and twenty six and a half meters
or<00:00:08.330> 415<00:00:09.330> feet<00:00:09.660> high<00:00:10.050> then<00:00:11.010> they<00:00:11.429> dropped<00:00:11.820> a

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
or 415 feet high then they dropped a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.589 
or 415 feet high then they dropped a
basketball<00:00:12.690> over<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.410> edge<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:14.269> can<00:00:15.269> see

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
basketball over the edge you can see

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.269 
basketball over the edge you can see
that<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.929> basketball<00:00:16.379> gets<00:00:16.560> pushed<00:00:16.800> around<00:00:16.980> a

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
that the basketball gets pushed around a

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.370 
that the basketball gets pushed around a
bit<00:00:17.400> by<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.609> breeze<00:00:17.880> but<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.660> lands<00:00:18.869> basically

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
bit by the breeze but it lands basically

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.890 
bit by the breeze but it lands basically
right<00:00:19.560> below<00:00:19.590> where<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.220> was<00:00:20.340> dropped<00:00:20.900> now

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
right below where it was dropped now

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.060 
right below where it was dropped now
watch<00:00:22.170> what<00:00:22.350> happens<00:00:22.410> when<00:00:22.800> they<00:00:22.890> drop

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
watch what happens when they drop

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.070 
watch what happens when they drop
another<00:00:23.340> basketball<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.480> time<00:00:24.720> with<00:00:25.050> a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
another basketball but this time with a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:35.540 
another basketball but this time with a
bit<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.350> backspin<00:00:25.830> oh<00:00:27.529> let<00:00:28.529> go<00:00:33.860> you<00:00:34.860> one<00:00:35.370> place

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
bit of backspin oh let go you one place

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.630 
bit of backspin oh let go you one place
to<00:00:35.820> get<00:00:35.969> back<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.300> water<00:00:36.480> here<00:00:37.489> this<00:00:38.489> is

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
to get back in the water here this is

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.330 
to get back in the water here this is
Brett<00:00:38.850> who<00:00:38.969> drew<00:00:39.120> through<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.980> literally<00:00:40.980> just

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
Brett who drew through I literally just

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.520 
Brett who drew through I literally just
dropped<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> bit<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.870> spin<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.410> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
dropped it with a bit of spin like I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.590 
dropped it with a bit of spin like I
didn't<00:00:43.950> even<00:00:44.040> throw<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.090> took<00:00:45.360> off

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
didn't even throw and I just took off

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.360 
didn't even throw and I just took off
like<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.110> no<00:00:46.379> idea<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:47.070> was<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:47.280> to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
like we have no idea that was going to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.540 
like we have no idea that was going to
do<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.200> where<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.469> come<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
do that and this is where I come in the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.220 
do that and this is where I come in the
basketball<00:00:51.090> was<00:00:51.270> subject<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.870> Magnus

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
basketball was subject to the Magnus

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.200 
basketball was subject to the Magnus
effect<00:00:52.350> which<00:00:52.800> affects<00:00:53.129> all<00:00:53.309> rotating<00:00:53.879> balls

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
effect which affects all rotating balls

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.850 
effect which affects all rotating balls
or<00:00:54.480> cylinders<00:00:54.899> as<00:00:55.050> they<00:00:55.199> fly<00:00:55.440> through<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> air

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
or cylinders as they fly through the air

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.220 
or cylinders as they fly through the air
and<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.670> works<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.079> basketball

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
and it works like this as the basketball

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.799 
and it works like this as the basketball
picks<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:59.010> speed<00:00:59.160> err<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.300> front<00:01:00.570> side<00:01:00.780> of

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
picks up speed err on the front side of

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:01.970 
picks up speed err on the front side of
the<00:01:00.930> ball<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> same<00:01:01.920> direction

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the ball is going in the same direction

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.520 
the ball is going in the same direction
as<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.879> spin<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.539> therefore<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.379> gets

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
as it's spin and therefore it gets

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
as it's spin and therefore it gets
dragged<00:01:04.979> along<00:01:05.189> with<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.640> ball<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
dragged along with the ball and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.870 
dragged along with the ball and
deflected<00:01:06.630> back<00:01:06.869> err<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.250> other<00:01:08.400> side<00:01:08.700> is

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
deflected back err on the other side is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.789 
deflected back err on the other side is
moving<00:01:09.150> opposite<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> ball<00:01:09.990> spin<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
moving opposite to the ball spin so the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.679 
moving opposite to the ball spin so the
flow<00:01:11.100> separates<00:01:11.610> from<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> ball<00:01:12.060> instead<00:01:12.450> of

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
flow separates from the ball instead of

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.109 
flow separates from the ball instead of
getting<00:01:13.170> deflected<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.369> net<00:01:14.549> result<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
getting deflected the net result is the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.390 
getting deflected the net result is the
ball<00:01:15.450> pushes<00:01:15.840> air<00:01:16.049> one<00:01:16.380> way<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> air

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
ball pushes air one way so the air

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.520 
ball pushes air one way so the air
applies<00:01:17.939> an<00:01:18.180> equal<00:01:18.570> force<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> ball<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
applies an equal force on the ball the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.130 
applies an equal force on the ball the
other<00:01:19.560> way<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.210> known<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
other way and this is known as the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.990 
other way and this is known as the
Magnus<00:01:22.439> effect<00:01:22.560> named<00:01:23.159> after<00:01:23.430> Heinrich

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
Magnus effect named after Heinrich

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.749 
Magnus effect named after Heinrich
Gustav<00:01:24.570> Magnus<00:01:25.080> who<00:01:25.229> described<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.950> 1852

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
Gustav Magnus who described it in 1852

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.390 
Gustav Magnus who described it in 1852
of<00:01:27.180> course<00:01:27.900> Isaac<00:01:28.380> Newton<00:01:28.710> beat<00:01:28.890> him<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.280> by

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
of course Isaac Newton beat him to it by

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.640 
of course Isaac Newton beat him to it by
nearly<00:01:29.670> 200<00:01:30.150> years<00:01:30.350> describing<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> flight

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
nearly 200 years describing the flight

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.100 
nearly 200 years describing the flight
of<00:01:31.799> tennis<00:01:32.100> balls<00:01:32.340> at<00:01:32.520> Cambridge<00:01:32.939> College<00:01:33.360> but

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
of tennis balls at Cambridge College but

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.050 
of tennis balls at Cambridge College but
you<00:01:34.409> know<00:01:34.560> he's<00:01:34.950> got<00:01:35.340> enough<00:01:35.549> stuff<00:01:35.759> named

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
you know he's got enough stuff named

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.330 
you know he's got enough stuff named
after<00:01:36.299> him<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:37.020> effect<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.650> very<00:01:37.829> important

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
after him this effect is very important

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.520 
after him this effect is very important
in<00:01:38.460> sports<00:01:38.850> like<00:01:39.060> tennis<00:01:39.299> soccer<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.290> golf

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
in sports like tennis soccer and golf

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.370 
in sports like tennis soccer and golf
but<00:01:41.369> could<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:42.000> non-sport<00:01:42.750> applications

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
but could it have non-sport applications

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.330 
but could it have non-sport applications
perhaps<00:01:44.570> this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.899> sailboat<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.890> know<00:01:47.159> it

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
perhaps this is a sailboat I know it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.980 
perhaps this is a sailboat I know it
doesn't<00:01:47.490> look<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.939> sailboat<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.630> those

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
doesn't look like a sailboat but those

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.840 
doesn't look like a sailboat but those
aren't<00:01:49.290> chimneys<00:01:49.799> they<00:01:50.280> are<00:01:50.460> spinning

they take the place of the sails they
deflect<00:01:56.250> crosswinds<00:01:57.090> using<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> Magnus

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
deflect crosswinds using the Magnus

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.920 
deflect crosswinds using the Magnus
effect<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.409> propel<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.950> ship<00:01:58.979> forwards<00:01:59.670> and

effect to propel the ship forwards and
this<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.229> plane<00:02:01.860> with<00:02:02.189> spinning<00:02:02.640> cylinders

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
this is a plane with spinning cylinders

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.569 
this is a plane with spinning cylinders
instead<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.750> wings<00:02:04.100> using<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.189> Magnus<00:02:05.490> effect

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
instead of wings using the Magnus effect

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.190 
instead of wings using the Magnus effect
the<00:02:05.909> cylinders<00:02:06.299> actually<00:02:06.750> generate<00:02:07.170> more

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the cylinders actually generate more

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.190 
the cylinders actually generate more
lift<00:02:07.740> than<00:02:08.039> traditional<00:02:08.819> wings<00:02:09.030> however<00:02:09.929> they

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
lift than traditional wings however they

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.890 
lift than traditional wings however they
also<00:02:10.440> generate<00:02:10.830> way<00:02:11.250> more<00:02:11.489> drag<00:02:11.879> making<00:02:12.750> them

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
also generate way more drag making them

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.340 
also generate way more drag making them

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
practical this plane only flew once and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.970 
practical this plane only flew once and
then<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.350> crashed

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
then it crashed

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.770 
then it crashed
but<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.730> Magnus<00:02:18.030> effect<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.420> making<00:02:18.720> a

but the Magnus effect is making a
comeback<00:02:19.080> here<00:02:19.740> is<00:02:19.860> an<00:02:20.010> experimental<00:02:20.490> rotor

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
comeback here is an experimental rotor

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.210 
comeback here is an experimental rotor
wing<00:02:21.180> aircraft<00:02:21.450> which<00:02:22.170> generates<00:02:22.710> all<00:02:22.890> its
