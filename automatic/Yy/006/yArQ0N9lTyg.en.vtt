00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.779
 let's then work with our 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.360
 butter cream what we're going to 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.820
 do now is I have separated into 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.040
 portions according to what I'm going to use we're going 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.600
 to color each one and we're going to put it on 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.670
 the pastry sleeves that we are going to use 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.379
 for decoration then first thing 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.010
 what I'm going to teach you is to do the 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.710
 sunflower 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.290
 although for the sunflower we need 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.780
 then the pastry bag 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.080
 we are going to use a trailer although the 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.440
 coupler is two pieces and what 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:51.579
 we do is introduce what looks like 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.589
 a nozzle in plastic 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.129
 we see more or less where we are going to 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.129
 trim 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.430
 perfect as it covers at least the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.560
 half of the mouthpiece in this case we're going 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.190
 to use the mouthpiece number 69 of wilton 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.909
 which is to make sheets we put here and 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.320
 then with this thread 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.320
 we close our sleeve 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.210
 then in the case of sunflower for 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.800
 first butters are painted the same as 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.280
 the cake with food coloring 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.860
 that are based on is the water powder or 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.930
 those who are in pasta although in this 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.870
 case I already add at least some 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.820
 four droplets of yellow and I know that 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.200
 I always put a drop of orange 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.090
 so that a little yellow is left 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.360
 more intense than more like the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.360
 sunflower 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.790
 we mix 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.649
 this is pretty to the eye ok does not have 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.470
 no exact amount of dye 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.680
 each dye also each brand then 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.090
 will work differently on your cream 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.920
 so you guys are doing little to 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.170
 little until you get the color that 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.030
 you want important to mix 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.250
 very well so that they do not have streaks of 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.010
 the colors but everything is left 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.860
 homogeneous then as before 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.320
 we open the sleeve 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.970
 we always do this so as not to get dirty 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.920
 the ends of the sleeve and we can 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.720
 work cleaner more comfortable 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.890
 that here we have the hole where 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.890
 let's put the cream 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.370
 ah 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:08.790
 I always do what I do 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.890
 who supported me at the table and with the help of 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.040
 a spatula of these white ones that 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:18.260
 They use a lot in the kitchen because they lowered all the 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.260
 cream to the end 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.060
 ah 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.060
 ah 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.550
 ah 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.550
 ah 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.290
 and then we have the sleeve for our 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.300
 sunflower we are going to then make our 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.910
 sunflower cupcake we have the cream 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.069
 yellow look how this should look 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.310
 it must be the final result 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:53.099
 for that then I already told you about the 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.650
 wilton mouthpiece number 69 that has 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.409
 leaf form we already have our cream 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.939
 of butter painted yellow 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:03.599
 we have our cupcake and we need 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:09.260
 an oreo cookie we are going to separate 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.260
 tapas that we are going to remove the cream 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.800
 and this is going to be the center of our 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.020
 sunflower 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.650
 so before we put the oreos on 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.390
 to make a first layer of leaves goes to 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.780
 be the one that is most external 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:26.180
 ok note that the nozzle goes totally 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.950
 lying down and let's start more or less 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.920
 counting one centimeter in 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.590
 although then we press 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.800
 We speak 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.169
 this first layer is usually going to fall 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.930
 just as he is doing 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.020
 if they see that 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.759
 it is very soft the cream we can put it 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.199
 a few seconds to the fridge ok for this 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.150
 for butter cream for the 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.630
 sunflower should be a little harder 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.630
 the cream 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.190
 we have made a first layer 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.560
 we put 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.400
 a little cream in the center 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.400
 paste the cookie 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.070
 and we will continue with our other two 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.070
 layers 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:26.339
 ah 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.230
 and 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.629
 let's make a last layer here more 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.629
 raised more petals more tiny 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.810
 i 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.810
 i 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.410
 and then we have our cupcake 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.410
 sunflower
