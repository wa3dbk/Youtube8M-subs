00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
sunset and we came up with this idea to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.570 
sunset and we came up with this idea to
create<00:01:48.900> we<00:01:49.830> thought<00:01:50.010> wouldn't<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.370> cool<00:01:50.550> if

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
create we thought wouldn't it be cool if

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.300 
create we thought wouldn't it be cool if
you<00:01:50.730> had<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.030> house<00:01:51.210> where<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> whole<00:01:52.010> wall<00:01:53.010> was

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
you had a house where the whole wall was

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.470 
you had a house where the whole wall was
windows<00:01:53.700> because<00:01:53.940> then<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.210> would<00:01:54.330> never

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
windows because then you would never

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.390 
windows because then you would never
have<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.960> trying<00:01:55.230> to<00:01:55.290> fit<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.740> sunset<00:01:56.190> into

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
have to be trying to fit the sunset into

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.650 
have to be trying to fit the sunset into
one<00:01:56.760> little<00:01:57.090> space<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:59.280> then<00:01:59.700> not<00:02:00.060> less<00:02:00.360> than

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
one little space and then not less than

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
one little space and then not less than
a<00:02:00.690> year<00:02:01.080> later<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.370> built<00:02:02.640> it

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.050 

when<00:02:24.680> we<00:02:24.799> were<00:02:24.920> living<00:02:25.250> here<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.519> building<00:02:25.879> it

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
when we were living here and building it

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.470

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
them on the way we just kind of made it

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.220 
them on the way we just kind of made it
the<00:03:22.879> purpose<00:03:23.269> of<00:03:23.389> her<00:03:23.510> journey<00:03:23.720> or<00:03:23.959> whatever

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.980 

the<00:03:35.620> opening<00:03:36.100> ones<00:03:36.310> we<00:03:36.550> found<00:03:36.910> in<00:03:37.420> like<00:03:37.959> a

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
the opening ones we found in like a

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.440 
the opening ones we found in like a
restore<00:03:38.650> type<00:03:39.160> place<00:03:39.459> in<00:03:39.730> Washington<00:03:40.330> DC<00:03:42.450> so

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
restore type place in Washington DC so

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.750 
restore type place in Washington DC so
each<00:03:44.140> one<00:03:44.350> has<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.650> little<00:03:44.860> bit<00:03:44.980> of<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.250> story<00:03:45.520> to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
each one has a little bit of a story to

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.479 
each one has a little bit of a story to
it

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.429 

I<00:03:52.519> think<00:03:53.120> as<00:03:53.299> we<00:03:53.480> went<00:03:53.689> and<00:03:53.900> got<00:03:54.079> into<00:03:54.349> the

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 
I think as we went and got into the

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.530 
I think as we went and got into the
building<00:03:54.620> we<00:03:54.920> brought<00:03:55.459> our<00:03:55.760> thoughts<00:03:56.299> and

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
building we brought our thoughts and

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.470 
building we brought our thoughts and
practices<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.319> ideas<00:03:57.439> to<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.069> but<00:03:58.280> at<00:03:59.239> the

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
practices and ideas to it but at the

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.050 
practices and ideas to it but at the
base<00:03:59.689> it<00:03:59.989> was<00:04:00.170> really<00:04:00.500> that<00:04:00.680> idea<00:04:00.950> of<00:04:01.310> making<00:04:01.579> a

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
base it was really that idea of making a

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.970 
base it was really that idea of making a
home

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
home

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:14.050 
home
I<00:04:10.840> just<00:04:11.840> get<00:04:11.989> a<00:04:12.019> kick<00:04:12.260> out<00:04:12.440> of<00:04:12.470> people<00:04:13.190> that<00:04:13.430> use

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
I just get a kick out of people that use

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.569 
I just get a kick out of people that use
the<00:04:14.239> process<00:04:14.690> just<00:04:15.680> out<00:04:15.980> of<00:04:16.010> visual

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
the process just out of visual

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.789 
the process just out of visual
aesthetics<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.450> like<00:04:17.720> showing<00:04:18.169> off<00:04:18.470> the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
aesthetics and like showing off the

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.400 
aesthetics and like showing off the
mystery<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.459> magic<00:04:19.880> of<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.150> for<00:04:21.109> me<00:04:21.260> the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
mystery and the magic of it for me the

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.860 
mystery and the magic of it for me the
process<00:04:21.680> isn't<00:04:22.220> really<00:04:22.610> about<00:04:22.850> that<00:04:23.120> more

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
process isn't really about that more

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.280 
process isn't really about that more
about<00:04:24.139> it<00:04:24.290> I<00:04:24.470> guess<00:04:25.280> how<00:04:25.430> it<00:04:25.580> translates<00:04:26.479> and

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
about it I guess how it translates and

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.870 
about it I guess how it translates and
it<00:04:27.800> makes<00:04:28.370> you<00:04:28.610> think<00:04:28.820> about<00:04:29.000> time

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
it makes you think about time

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:39.290 
it makes you think about time
you

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.320
