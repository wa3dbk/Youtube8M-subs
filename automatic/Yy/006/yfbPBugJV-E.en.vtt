00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.310
 extend over the entire upper eyelid 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.250
 and even under poetic I go to apply the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.170
 django pence the number 01 and bischia 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.630
 of the knicks and I also lay it up here 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.280
 all the eye and later with the 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.060
 just strange I'm going to remove the excess 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.060
 of color 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.060
 now I take the angeles paddle 7 Jun 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.680
 water and apply this color 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.990
 silver gray over the entire eyelid 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.730
 mobile initially by tapping and after 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.730
 of which I do not go slightly to fade 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.869
 I take this diego game of the 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.810
 palma la boyle has a chromatic base 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.180
 black and I'm going to make my final 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.830
 eye 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.470
 I make smaller strokes after that 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.630
 with a brush I esteem and create mine 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.759
 shape stretch towards the end making one 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.150
 kind of cat eyes now I take a 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.890
 black eyeshadow and I'm going to fix everything 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.480
 with a pen brush over it 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:27.799
 on my newly created form with the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:31.130
 pencil and then faded they escape well I take 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:34.069
 the number 167 the parlamat of the kiko e 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.230
 I apply it under the eyebrow arch 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.660
 also because it will help me to blend again 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.980
 better colors and tortures 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.980
 later how am I doing here 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.370
 again from the alt 7 pallet 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.019
 down a light pink color 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.850
 I'm going to apply it to him in the first third 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.340
 of the eyelid bringing it also 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.680
 under the first third of the market 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.930
 explicit takes the long lasting 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.780
 absence and 0 4 start and stories 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.100
 silver for now must apply to the center 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.350
 of the eyelid 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.830
 after I declare heating with my finger and not 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.830
 works better 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:17.140
 eat south instead of opening 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.700
 this black pearly gray and will have to 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.500
 apply in the final part of the eye 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.930
 again the first color used is lo 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.530
 attic among the silver is the dark gray 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.530
 just put it 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.790
 with the genoa in grass to create one 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.159
 MiniOne of the lower eyelid to 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.319
 under the eyelashes leaving a part 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.360
 white in the ends of the eye 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.950
 because then we will create a white line 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.720
 inside of 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.579
 and while in the inner corner it goes from 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.959
 create ca n't do it enough three fingers 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.590
 here it takes a little patience 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.420
 do it with small strokes to create one 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.790
 eyeliner line also on the eyelid 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.010
 superior even those serenity to the 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.390
 I'm going to bring the sun into the rhyme 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.609
 inner eye others with pencil 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.950
 white and I'm going to draw a line 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.000
 also between the two black lines made 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.129
 on the outside 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.319
 I take the number one of the astra il sol 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.180
 chorus excuse the light play with the 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.620
 night of the ship of colors to escape 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.979
 pass it in the inner corner of the eye 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.239
 is in the final white line in 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:24.820
 so as to make it all the more 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:26.229
 bright I take with a cotton swab of 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.850
 false eyelash glue washing ad 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.919
 apply in the points that interest me 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.310
 first use some purple 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:36.990
 silver and apply it with the brush 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.940
 rubber of the essence just preferred 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.070
 let it go over the glue afterwards 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.820
 having it slightly dried 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.820
 this second 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:56.720
 and so on in the points that me 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:58.520
 affecting glue and then in purpurin 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.130
 followed I take a red purple and 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.050
 also go here to put it in the points that 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.120
 I'm interested, I decide to apply it 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.860
 in the extreme part of the eye to the of 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.840
 below the diagonal lines created with 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.880
 a little scotch passed a couple of before 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.400
 sometimes on mine on the back of my hand 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.380
 but afterwards and to remove the glitter fallen into 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.780
 excess 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.850
 I apply the color between the two purlins 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.840
 silver used before so as to 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.220
 create a connection line since 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.170
 in the central part I preferred not 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.970
 apply the glitter in such a way as not to 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.830
 maybe annoy when it closes 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.870
 the eye we apply the false eyelashes e 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.890
 after which we apply the mascara in 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:43.100
 excellent amount also to attack the 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.320
 false eyelashes with real ones on 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.050
 lips opted for a lip tint in 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.060
 so that it lasts all the time 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.040
 if you want then you can intensify again 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.280
 more with a lipstick maybe I'm in 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.660
 central part in this case we have it 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.260
 red mass to recall the color 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.930
 purple is certainly a lot 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.640
 artistic surely you will notice on 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.889
 stage thanks to those lights and then a 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.639
 dance essay I am 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.639
 then it's great 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.990
 and precisely to be the final result 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:21.560
 now when beaten but let's examine 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.560
 loan ok
