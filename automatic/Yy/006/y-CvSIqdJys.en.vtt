00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.200
 Good people, let's show here how 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:12.630
 calibrate the air gesture between devices 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:17.840
 o s4 no hd 9 509 500 plus hd 9 thousand 9 mil 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.359
 More ok here I say calibrated the sensor 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.600
 opera hand I'm passing with the touch of 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.570
 The screen I'm passing is through the eude sensor. 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.250
 gauge to operate up to the sensors 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.050
 are everyone here? 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.910
 in the chamber region next to the chamber 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.559
 are the sensors 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:41.129
 I got a blank sheet of paper 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:45.300
 of the trade in our capital 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:50.870
 I got this piece of paper, I'm going 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.270
 enter system settings menu 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.800
 Look, if I came here to connect 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.829
 I have essence manager and managers in 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.400
 yes i just landed the disable function 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.420
 and select where I want it to work 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.420
 camera songs gallery the launcher is a 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.790
 if it is off 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.650
 here will not work nothing happened 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.520
 deselecting the functions here will also not 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.680
 to function 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.650
 in my case it is connected from all 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.659
 functions as the mismatch says 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.060
 program and it is not working 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.630
 so I'll come in here on Monday 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:36.030
 option when we go back there in the beginning menu 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:40.460
 system configurations, I come in the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:47.460
 second option should I select 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:51.630
 she's there at the last option 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.619
 a ls underline s / a liberation 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.759
 calibration select I entered the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.890
 setting to calibrate the sensor 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.170
 that he asks me the first step is to take 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.329
 any obstacle ahead of the area of 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.280
 sensor does not have any obstacle will 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.280
 sin on start to start 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.190
 it will detect that it has nothing in it. 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.190
 front 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.870
 the bolton parameters are now ok 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.090
 asking for a second, I'll have to 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.190
 put an object in front in the distance 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.450
 for calibration I'll get this 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.020
 paper sheet 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.630
 the sensor covers a distance 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.970
 about two centimeters 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.700
 covering the sensor ok 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.020
 Then I'll give the next one and it's next then 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.460
 I'm holding more or less one 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.090
 distance of two centimeters 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.470
 distance from him and I will stay in 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.470
 next next 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.800
 He's calibrating the distance, okay now. 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.990
 he gave me the message there that I can 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:05.710
 do the tests by hand to check 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:20.140
 if it's okay to change here, and ok 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:27.600
 Let's see if it works or put it in the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.600
 photos gallery 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:40.420
 he took the gesture with his finger only 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.370
 then you try not to calibrate 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.360
 first time no problem try 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.160
 the second time is informed electronic is 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.470
 so trial and error tried the first 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.960
 Time did not work, do not despair. 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.760
 in the second a little more is missing 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.200
 bit more for you a little bit more 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.420
 down and you will be testing until 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.920
 succeed 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:05.470
 ok here it is calibrated one way 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:10.180
 simple easy and efficient 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:12.340
 then on the menu entering the 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.140
 connect entering adolescence in 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.510
 time will be active if you are not connected 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.489
 here it will not work 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.919
 Did you throw the functions that you want 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:26.050
 Are you working? 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:28.990
 then you go on must be loves to drag 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.010
 until last ls underline ps 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.770
 calibration is the last option 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:39.360
 select the option removed all ahead 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.360
 of a start 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:47.140
 we are redoing steps ac3 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.520
 now he asks you to 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:55.030
 place the object in the distance to 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:00.090
 perform the calibration place a sheet 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:02.620
 about 12 centimeters from the next 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.730
 it will take another three seconds to 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:10.120
 calibrate this distance and you're 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.010
 Calibrated already gave the ok in the end and can 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.570
 enjoy there your way 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.570
 remains configured
