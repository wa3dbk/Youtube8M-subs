no reason the other problem is his
manner<00:03:14.300> if<00:03:15.260> his<00:03:15.410> manner<00:03:15.710> runs<00:03:16.010> out<00:03:16.220> which<00:03:17.120> it

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
manner if his manner runs out which it

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.990 
manner if his manner runs out which it
will<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:19.010> I've<00:03:19.100> got<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.280> do<00:03:19.460> a<00:03:19.490> lot<00:03:19.640> of<00:03:19.700> running

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
will so I've got to do a lot of running

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.280 
will so I've got to do a lot of running
away<00:03:21.970> hopefully

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.199 

right<00:03:29.010> everybody<00:03:29.250> taking<00:03:29.670> like<00:03:29.849> a<00:03:29.879> lot<00:03:30.060> of

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
right everybody taking like a lot of

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.009 
right everybody taking like a lot of
damage<00:03:30.329> and<00:03:30.719> he's<00:03:31.409> still<00:03:31.620> up<00:03:31.739> dead<00:03:32.780> no<00:03:33.780> I'm<00:03:33.900> not

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
damage and he's still up dead no I'm not

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:45.759 
damage and he's still up dead no I'm not
liking<00:03:34.230> this<00:03:35.569> this<00:03:36.569> was<00:03:36.719> a<00:03:36.750> mistake

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.430 

die

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.860 

yeah<00:03:50.430> okay<00:03:50.670> so<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.880> wizard<00:03:51.210> the<00:03:51.450> wizard<00:03:51.540> was<00:03:51.810> a

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
yeah okay so the wizard the wizard was a

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.120 
yeah okay so the wizard the wizard was a
bad<00:03:52.050> idea<00:03:52.080> I<00:03:54.380> was<00:03:55.380> kind<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.620> hoping<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
bad idea I was kind of hoping that the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.410 
bad idea I was kind of hoping that the
Wizards<00:03:56.760> like<00:03:58.010> best<00:03:59.010> attack<00:03:59.370> would<00:03:59.670> be<00:03:59.820> more

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
Wizards like best attack would be more

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.730 
Wizards like best attack would be more
powerful<00:04:00.630> than<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:01.850> but<00:04:02.850> it<00:04:02.970> isn't

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
powerful than that but it isn't

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.810 
powerful than that but it isn't
something<00:04:04.740> else<00:04:05.070> I<00:04:05.160> forgot<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.460> mention<00:04:05.490> last

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
something else I forgot to mention last

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.840 
something else I forgot to mention last
time<00:04:06.060> it's<00:04:06.240> probably<00:04:06.450> not<00:04:06.570> a<00:04:06.600> good<00:04:06.780> time<00:04:06.990> to

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
time it's probably not a good time to

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
time it's probably not a good time to
display<00:04:08.850> it<00:04:09.000> by<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.150> well<00:04:09.330> anyway<00:04:09.600> is<00:04:09.810> this

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
display it by a well anyway is this

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.850 
display it by a well anyway is this
which<00:04:12.870> sends<00:04:13.110> out<00:04:13.200> a<00:04:13.230> shock<00:04:13.500> wave<00:04:13.710> and

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
which sends out a shock wave and

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.640 
which sends out a shock wave and
depletes<00:04:14.160> all<00:04:14.280> your<00:04:14.400> manner<00:04:15.650> hopefully

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
depletes all your manner hopefully

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.780 
depletes all your manner hopefully
that's<00:04:16.769> really<00:04:17.040> really<00:04:17.190> good<00:04:17.250> because<00:04:17.549> I'm

impossible<00:06:02.910> it<00:06:03.419> spawns<00:06:03.720> a<00:06:03.900> hell<00:06:04.080> of<00:06:04.110> a<00:06:04.230> lot<00:06:04.290> of

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
impossible it spawns a hell of a lot of
