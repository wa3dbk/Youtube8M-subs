00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:07.230
 Hello friends here ordered 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:12.840
 package on aliexpress 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:17.250
 I ordered from the Chinese 3 wobblers there two 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:25.080
 seemingly three composite package wrapped 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:27.689
 shanski then two weeks seems to be instead 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.600
 previous packages reached a bit longer 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:45.110
 it would be faster for a look that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:45.110
 air mean i will say so ordinary space 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:01:02.219
 of the rest of the hooks clings to the hooks 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.850
 clings cover blocked such here 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.210
 holes 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.210
 105 millimeters 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:21.270
 here too sunbeds he is compound on 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:31.310
 metallic stiletto as if painted 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:31.310
 not bad at Penza so there is no 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.920
 nicks no paint noticed 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.750
 paint so much from the package either 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.490
 your score 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:54.770
 she's here for the connection here 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.830
 on connections pours Crimean on 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.830
 rubbing in places too 105 millimeters 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:15.950
 hooks like on 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:19.390
 They cling to but that's better than weight 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.070
 by the way in all the same at 16 equals 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.260
 here is a bit of trouble 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:30.230
 managed to dry 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:39.400
 where it had already prepared the hooks too, 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:42.370
 clings well written that took 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:47.049
 fisher fishermen 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.860
 here toksov took fishermen 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:54.590
 Here are these three things in both ordered 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.600
 Well, then I can not say anything about them 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.380
 the only thing left is to go fishing 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.239
 there certainly test their will on them awl 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.610
 the curl will not be floating no 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.920
 floating 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.640
 how much dives how shorter which on 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.230
 cast now it's hard to say 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.930
 so it seems to be this design 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:24.260
 good painting here too 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:26.630
 not bad but the ball is a ball so no joke 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:32.920
 something dangles there's a rattle it's two 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.920
 the ball is also find the noise turns out 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.010
 so varnished of course beautiful but all 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.700
 it's not original anyway 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.190
 here again I repeat, with that 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.700
 ends for mine then something for talila two 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:55.710
 dochechki there is so principle done 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:59.130
 not bad but not bad due to the fact that 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.870
 plastic see the former naturally 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:06.180
 Forms for all equally unique 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.770
 that's when these different color painting 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.010
 I do not know about ultraviolet 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.740
 glows or not this paint and so 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.670
 by myself 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:23.200
 so. By the way, I ordered them. 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.100
 cost 2 pieces of 99 cents and clothe 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.320
 this one for the buck 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:33.750
 It turns so that's not their price well, all 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.750
 there will be more that I will work out before the meeting
