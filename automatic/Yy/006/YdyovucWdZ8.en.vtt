00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
long version to cash on delivery

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:37.110 
long version to cash on delivery
so<00:00:17.960> let's<00:00:18.560> go<00:00:29.890> so<00:00:30.890> here's<00:00:31.069> the<00:00:31.159> packaging<00:00:31.669> I

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.729

think there's something else inside as
well

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:59.669 

scrambles<00:00:47.210> that's<00:00:47.960> cool<00:00:48.230> that's<00:00:48.379> cool<00:00:55.359> okay

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.970 

more<00:01:00.679> scrambles<00:01:01.190> okay<00:01:02.179> so<00:01:02.239> it's<00:01:02.359> a<00:01:02.390> pretty<00:01:02.660> of

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
more scrambles okay so it's a pretty of

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.679 
more scrambles okay so it's a pretty of
scrambles<00:01:03.980> inside<00:01:04.970> I<00:01:05.000> don't<00:01:05.299> know<00:01:05.390> if<00:01:05.509> this

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
scrambles inside I don't know if this

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.569 
scrambles inside I don't know if this
comes<00:01:05.900> with<00:01:06.049> every<00:01:06.710> parcel<00:01:06.950> oh<00:01:07.189> it's<00:01:07.340> just

again<00:01:28.939> and<00:01:29.869> that's<00:01:30.079> the<00:01:30.200> back<00:01:30.579> so<00:01:31.579> let's<00:01:32.149> open

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
again and that's the back so let's open

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.220 
again and that's the back so let's open
the<00:01:32.509> cover<00:01:32.719> up

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.040 

quick<00:01:39.680> solving<00:01:40.070> guide<00:01:40.390> so<00:01:41.390> I<00:01:41.420> don't<00:01:41.750> need<00:01:41.870> that

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
quick solving guide so I don't need that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.190 
quick solving guide so I don't need that
and<00:01:42.620> this<00:01:43.430> is<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.820> more<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:44.210> we<00:01:44.540> long<00:01:44.750> version

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
and this is the more you we long version

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:57.300 
and this is the more you we long version
do<00:01:48.880> it's<00:01:49.880> got<00:01:50.090> half<00:01:51.050> prides<00:01:51.350> I<00:01:51.530> guess<00:01:55.810> whoa

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
do it's got half prides I guess whoa

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:07.810 
do it's got half prides I guess whoa
this<00:01:58.310> is<00:01:58.460> insane<00:02:05.440> our<00:02:06.440> deep<00:02:07.130> I'm<00:02:07.340> gone<00:02:07.580> wrong

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
this is insane our deep I'm gone wrong

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.620 
this is insane our deep I'm gone wrong
I'm<00:02:08.590> sorry<00:02:09.590> about<00:02:09.679> that<00:02:09.820> I'll<00:02:10.820> just<00:02:11.030> do<00:02:11.240> a

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
I'm sorry about that I'll just do a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:26.560 
I'm sorry about that I'll just do a
quick<00:02:11.780> solve<00:02:12.110> over<00:02:12.260> here<00:02:12.530> again<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:26.030> feels<00:02:26.420> a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
quick solve over here again it feels a

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.740 
quick solve over here again it feels a
bit<00:02:26.750> empty<00:02:26.959> right<00:02:27.560> now<00:02:27.850> but<00:02:28.850> I<00:02:29.090> guess<00:02:29.570> after

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
bit empty right now but I guess after

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.900 
bit empty right now but I guess after
looping<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.410> it'll<00:02:30.620> be<00:02:30.770> amazing<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.980> use

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
this was amazing I mean I I didn't even

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.490 
this was amazing I mean I I didn't even
expect<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.250> be<00:02:43.430> like<00:02:44.080> better<00:02:45.080> than<00:02:45.320> this

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
expect it to be like better than this

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.960 
expect it to be like better than this
angie<00:02:45.800> is<00:02:45.830> something<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.250> just<00:02:46.310> heard<00:02:46.640> this<00:02:46.760> was
