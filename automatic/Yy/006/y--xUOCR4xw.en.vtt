neural<00:00:00.269> table<00:00:01.129> so<00:00:02.840> you'll<00:00:03.840> probably<00:00:04.140> be

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
neural table so you'll probably be

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.459 
neural table so you'll probably be
hoping<00:00:05.400> for<00:00:06.740> throwing<00:00:07.740> doubles<00:00:09.019> so<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.290> you

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
hoping for throwing doubles so that you

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.770 
hoping for throwing doubles so that you
can<00:00:11.120> take<00:00:12.120> skills<00:00:12.719> like<00:00:13.490> guard<00:00:14.660> stand<00:00:15.660> firm

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
can take skills like guard stand firm

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.640 
can take skills like guard stand firm
perhaps<00:00:17.390> fan<00:00:18.390> could<00:00:18.690> be<00:00:18.900> interesting<00:00:19.500> because

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
perhaps fan could be interesting because

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.390 
perhaps fan could be interesting because
of<00:00:19.859> their<00:00:20.100> low<00:00:20.340> armor<00:00:20.609> value<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:22.130> mighty<00:00:23.130> blue

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
of their low armor value and mighty blue

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.589 
of their low armor value and mighty blue
piling<00:00:24.300> on<00:00:24.449> things<00:00:24.960> like<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.970> jum<00:00:26.970> jump<00:00:27.449> up

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
piling on things like that jum jump up

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.230 
piling on things like that jum jump up
can<00:00:27.930> also<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:28.439> good<00:00:28.619> for<00:00:28.800> them<00:00:28.949> but<00:00:29.670> you'll

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
can also be good for them but you'll

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.840 
can also be good for them but you'll
probably<00:00:30.480> be<00:00:31.260> giving<00:00:31.619> them<00:00:31.769> tackle<00:00:32.340> right<00:00:32.700> off

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
probably be giving them tackle right off

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.049 
probably be giving them tackle right off
the<00:00:32.969> bat<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.710> perhaps<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.250> Dauntless<00:00:35.730> after

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
the bat and perhaps the Dauntless after

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.740 
the bat and perhaps the Dauntless after
that<00:00:36.920> anyway<00:00:37.920> we'll<00:00:38.550> buy<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> bunch<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.390> them

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.990 

and<00:00:43.160> now<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.370> 11<00:00:44.850> players<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:47.000> 120,000

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
and now we have 11 players and 120,000

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.220 
and now we have 11 players and 120,000
left<00:00:49.070> which<00:00:50.070> means<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.640> could<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.600> Norse

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
left which means I could get a Norse

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.250 
left which means I could get a Norse
werewolf<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:53.840> berserker<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.640> runner<00:00:57.109> maybe<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
werewolf a berserker a runner maybe a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.639 
werewolf a berserker a runner maybe a
couple<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.770> linemen<00:00:59.039> or<00:00:59.780> you<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.960> go<00:01:01.140> back<00:01:01.379> of

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
couple of linemen or you can go back of

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.670 
couple of linemen or you can go back of
course<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:03.030> another<00:01:03.359> re-roll<00:01:03.840> or<00:01:04.110> even

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
course and get another re-roll or even

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.320 
course and get another re-roll or even
two<00:01:04.920> rerolls<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.170> frankly<00:01:07.880> for<00:01:08.880> rerolls

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
two rerolls and frankly for rerolls

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.200 
two rerolls and frankly for rerolls
would<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> good<00:01:09.960> idea<00:01:10.490> however<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:11.850> get

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
would be a good idea however you can get

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.280 
would be a good idea however you can get
one<00:01:12.600> rear<00:01:12.810> on1<00:01:13.260> lineman<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.790> depends<00:01:15.090> on

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
one rear on1 lineman so it depends on

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.270 
one rear on1 lineman so it depends on
what<00:01:16.290> kind<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.820> team<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.030> want<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.420> start<00:01:18.689> with

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
what kind of team you want to start with

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.399 
what kind of team you want to start with
let's<00:01:20.280> go<00:01:20.490> with<00:01:20.820> four<00:01:21.390> rerolls<00:01:21.869> which<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.380> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
let's go with four rerolls which is a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.289 
let's go with four rerolls which is a
very<00:01:22.770> very<00:01:23.100> good<00:01:23.310> amount<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.000> start<00:01:24.240> a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
very very good amount when you start a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.950 
very very good amount when you start a
start<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> team<00:01:25.200> out<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.030> only<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.509> 11

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
start a team out and you only have 11

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.179 
start a team out and you only have 11
players<00:01:28.340> not<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.700> durable<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:31.189> even

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
players not really durable so even

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.120 
players not really durable so even
though<00:01:32.400> they're<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:33.450> really<00:01:35.119> bash<00:01:36.119> e<00:01:36.290> team<00:01:37.290> they

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
though they're a really bash e team they

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.730 
though they're a really bash e team they
don't<00:01:38.369> take<00:01:39.650> violence<00:01:40.650> very<00:01:40.950> well<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> you'll

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
don't take violence very well so you'll

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.749 
don't take violence very well so you'll
probably<00:01:44.369> try<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> avoid<00:01:45.720> getting<00:01:46.490> too<00:01:47.490> close

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
probably try to avoid getting too close

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.850 
probably try to avoid getting too close
to<00:01:49.880> really<00:01:50.880> strong<00:01:51.270> offensive<00:01:52.200> teams<00:01:52.500> like

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
to really strong offensive teams like

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.609 
to really strong offensive teams like
chaos<00:01:53.759> or<00:01:54.860> dwarves<00:01:56.390> still<00:01:57.390> they<00:01:57.780> do<00:01:57.899> come<00:01:58.229> most

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
chaos or dwarves still they do come most

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.639 
chaos or dwarves still they do come most
of<00:01:58.770> them<00:01:58.920> come<00:01:59.130> with<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.610> skilled<00:01:59.939> block

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
of them come with the skilled block

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.649 
of them come with the skilled block
right<00:02:01.649> after<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.070> which<00:02:02.399> means<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:03.270> gives

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
right after that which means it gives

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.540 
right after that which means it gives
them<00:02:03.899> an<00:02:04.170> advantage<00:02:04.740> when<00:02:05.729> they<00:02:05.909> start<00:02:06.180> out<00:02:06.350> so

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
them an advantage when they start out so

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.059 
them an advantage when they start out so
they're<00:02:08.550> really<00:02:09.330> good<00:02:09.539> team<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.500> only<00:02:10.800> player

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
they're really good team the only player

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.440 
they're really good team the only player
i<00:02:11.220> don't<00:02:11.459> like<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:11.819> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
i don't like on the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.589 
i don't like on the
team<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.349> Yeti<00:02:13.620> as<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.340> explained<00:02:14.790> but

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
team is the Yeti as I explained but

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.220 
team is the Yeti as I explained but
still<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.769> can<00:02:17.040> do<00:02:17.610> very<00:02:18.000> well<00:02:18.150> with<00:02:18.629> just<00:02:18.989> a

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
still you can do very well with just a

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.770 
still you can do very well with just a
couple<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:20.129> Norse<00:02:20.790> werewolves<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.420> couple<00:02:21.690> of

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
linemen sure you can also try to go for

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.470 
linemen sure you can also try to go for
the<00:02:31.260> passing<00:02:32.130> game<00:02:32.310> with<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.700> thrower<00:02:33.030> but

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
the passing game with the thrower but

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.890 
the passing game with the thrower but
still<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.769> know<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:35.459> usually<00:02:36.030> don't<00:02:36.390> use<00:02:36.690> my

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
opposition then score against them
