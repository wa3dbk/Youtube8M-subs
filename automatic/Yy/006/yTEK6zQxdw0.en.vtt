 and today you will learn to play 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.660
 the simplified version of the song 60 days 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.730
 in love 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.410
 in the version of victor and leo in this version 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.570
 of the music I'm going to teach the chords 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.099
 and only a standard rhythm and 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.020
 we'll use to play all 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.090
 parties for those who want to learn the parts 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.860
 most complex of the song just click on the 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.870
 little balloon to access our class 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.160
 complete in this version 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.200
 We're going to play the not so good song. 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.390
 different from the original we'll play 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.590
 backing tracks all chords 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.940
 from victor e leo 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.340
 but for anyone who wants to play the second 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.500
 you just have to access the cipher on the 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.989
 this club and increase the silva tone 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.540
 a tone to our version the chords will be 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.390
 three looks only the biggest name 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:06.590
 [Music] 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:10.029
 the biggest one in an error is bigger 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.029
 [Music] 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.790
 To start our class I'm going to play a 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.880
 the biggest part of the song for you to see 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:29.189
 how is it 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:32.189
 [Music] 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.189
 traveling 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:49.729
 I knew love and left me and engineering 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.909
 Little God, by his cell phone. 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.719
 I changed the way I said 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.719
 the pt 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:13.310
 think 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:17.599
 [Music] 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:23.750
 two months ago from an uncle of her forever 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:27.150
 I soon remember pieces of my life. 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.909
 memories of my past 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.550
 will never be forgotten ipad of a 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:37.080
 decoy 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:44.570
 these have passed both 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.570
 It's in a glass that the sensei put forth a kiss. 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:03:01.360
 [Music] 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.600
 If someone says anything, it brings me back. 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.990
 made shattered 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.790
 the plan 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:13.439
 quickly did not see 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:17.900
 I think I 'm tired, I'll never forget 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.900
 in appearance of taboado 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:24.769
 I left my dear 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.769
 I left my mouth 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.670
 I left 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:38.590
 My dear, I left my own life. 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.590
 60 days in love 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.240
 to make the rhythm of all the song we 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.190
 let's use a traditional beat of the 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.860
 neighboring countries and is widely used 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.020
 in the old Guarani sertaneja music 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:04:07.290
 this beat pattern will look like this 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:04:09.840
 [Music] 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.269
 our first touch at the beginning of each 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.989
 default will be down in all 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.989
 strings using the thumb 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.039
 the stock is slower and more airy or 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.250
 let's leave the thumb on 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:26.800
 all the strings playing one at a time 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.320
 at the end of the match the sound of all 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.270
 new ones together 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.300
 doing a little faster will stay 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.540
 like this 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.760
 [Music] 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.680
 after that we 'll play once 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.330
 down with your index fingers and 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.250
 middle and annular 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.980
 So we'll tap our thumbs in the 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.780
 strings and on the flying arm makes a sound 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.860
 percussive that gets really cool and 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:55.919
 the music time looks lonely 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:58.419
 [Music] 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.719
 then the first and second rings do not 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.719
 stay like this 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.330
 [Music] 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.780
 We'll play it down, then we'll play it down. 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.270
 on the most severe strings with the thumb 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.889
 [Music] 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.110
 we played once again down the three 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.189
 fingers and we hit the back in the arm more 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.189
 once using your thumb 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.610
 So we play once again in the 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.610
 more severe ropes using the thumb 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:38.069
 ready 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:40.210
 [Music] 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.680
 notice that some moments we go 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.580
 play a beat twice for the same 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.289
 wake up 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.660
 I'm going to start playing the part that does not 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.310
 voiceless for you accompanied this 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.090
 part will be at the beginning of the song and 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:06:09.589
 between each stanza 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:06:09.589
 [Music] 

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:14.139
 now I'm going to play one of the stanzas of 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:15.909
 slow music for you 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:20.909
 and then just follow that same line and 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:20.909
 touch the rest by traveling 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.180
 the water 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:33.710
 [Music] 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:36.070
 You know a brunette who left me the mark. 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:40.270
 it smells 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:46.400
 in small we counts 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:48.230
 there your way 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.100
 drinking 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.100
 if you want 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:02.340
 [Music] 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.500
 that's it, this was our lesson in 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.310
 simplified version of the song 60 days 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.410
