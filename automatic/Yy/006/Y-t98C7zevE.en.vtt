like<00:05:15.160> cool<00:05:15.600> yeah<00:05:16.600> server<00:05:17.560> lag<00:05:19.260> all<00:05:20.260> right<00:05:20.350> I

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
like cool yeah server lag all right I

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.260 
like cool yeah server lag all right I

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
think it's about time we wrap it up

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:30.150 
think it's about time we wrap it up
anyway<00:05:22.890> no<00:05:23.890> no<00:05:25.290> no<00:05:26.730> ya<00:05:27.730> know<00:05:29.010> we've<00:05:30.010> been

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
anyway no no no ya know we've been

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.600 
anyway no no no ya know we've been
recording<00:05:30.280> for<00:05:30.610> 28<00:05:31.510> minutes<00:05:31.780> and<00:05:32.170> 36<00:05:33.160> seconds

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
recording for 28 minutes and 36 seconds

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.240 
recording for 28 minutes and 36 seconds
I<00:05:33.880> really<00:05:34.240> that's<00:05:34.510> it<00:05:34.750> no<00:05:35.320> I<00:05:35.350> don't<00:05:35.620> know<00:05:35.710> it

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
I really that's it no I don't know it

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.890 
I really that's it no I don't know it
seems<00:05:36.790> like<00:05:36.880> longer<00:05:37.240> it's<00:05:37.450> probably<00:05:37.660> longer

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
seems like longer it's probably longer

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.170 
seems like longer it's probably longer
yeah<00:05:38.290> it's<00:05:38.500> like<00:05:38.950> over<00:05:39.730> everyone<00:05:40.150> else

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
yeah it's like over everyone else

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.750 
yeah it's like over everyone else
getting<00:05:40.600> server<00:05:40.990> lag<00:05:41.290> yeah<00:05:41.980> I'm<00:05:42.280> great<00:05:42.430> time<00:05:42.730> I

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
getting server lag yeah I'm great time I

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.080 
getting server lag yeah I'm great time I
think<00:05:43.030> that's<00:05:43.180> a<00:05:43.300> sign<00:05:43.690> that<00:05:43.750> we<00:05:44.020> should<00:05:45.090> leave

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
think that's a sign that we should leave

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.220 
think that's a sign that we should leave
this<00:05:46.300> place<00:05:46.600> and<00:05:47.700> stop<00:05:48.700> the<00:05:48.820> recording<00:05:49.230> yep

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
this place and stop the recording yep

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.250 
this place and stop the recording yep
that's<00:05:50.920> what<00:05:51.040> I<00:05:51.070> said<00:05:51.300> no<00:05:52.300> no<00:05:52.900> no<00:05:53.200> you
