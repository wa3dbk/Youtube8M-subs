00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 it is the best season to abuse the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.870
 makeup but the date demands glamor and 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.870
 brightness was not recorded 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.330
 So, let's go shopping. I 've seen it in Brasilia. 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.609
 mall nor the hill lord in the lunchbox 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.500
 apothecary to choose the most 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.930
 bright and colorful to shine on the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.730
 Carnival option is not lacking to put 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.619
 A kitchen in this black face. 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.050
 we will solve the problem that is the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.480
 how much a well-colored makeup 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.610
 cheerful with enough final brightness 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.010
 So we can play a carnival. 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.649
 little skin is ready people used 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.730
 a very light base to stay natural does not 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.530
 There was nothing heavy and we're going to start. 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.809
 using a cream shade she goes 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.750
 help to fix the focus of life because 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.199
 And then your makeup will last a long time. 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.760
 will paste power sweated continue what 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.609
 If you can fail, you do not have to worry. 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.949
 of being very defined using only one 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.350
 this shadow with suppressed eyes in the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.220
 We will actually apply a shadow 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.799
 also powdered in golden bread and then you 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.689
 will lay that shadow over that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.689
 base that little hand we did nothing 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.390
 The next step you use this shadow 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.250
 Roxinha will make a nice contrast to 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.420
 explored yellowish 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.399
 we will outline the eyelashes of smo 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.229
 raquel and there may be a more 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.929
 I do not need a term either. 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.600
 defined is just not for a body more 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.929
 around the drawing of the eye at 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.810
 Cream Shadow is the Opposites to It Before 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.189
 buy, you can not use only her 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.110
 happens is that some people have the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.060
 more oily skin depending on the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.830
 shade may accumulate in the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.750
 when you end up with 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.549
 the powdered shadow on top I give a 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.170
 insured in shade on cream she then 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:04.259
 I got in the other security was with this 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.880
 same drop shadow will catch a think 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.539
 a little firmer than the one who 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.569
 the population is golden 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.390
 mark a little this very soft corner 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.519
 than to make a gradient with that 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.310
 the golden one we used started and then 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.260
 it already foams and already mixes with 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.890
 that golden voice that we made years ago 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.390
 same thing on both sides 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.750
 not only do they come back more 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.650
 intense this here is just to increase the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.200
 Glitter has a few dots of glitter and there 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.880
 There is no good way to 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.549
 glitter around the hotel you are 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.709
 working but how is carnival just not 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.720
 You need to worry about leaving it so clean. 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.790
 from that region of the eye to 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.849
 intensify if I compete a little 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.640
 made leaf use a pencil also like 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.950
 among mogi is a community well 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.079
 similar but it is more intense and is more 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.969
 a detail with the good and we will not 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.129
 to wear black what are we going to wear your 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:04.409
 Pretty mascara this one is a brand 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:08.220
 incredible of givenchy or who wanted 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:10.590
 get a little pain and she has a kitchen 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.060
 and eggplant and has a glitter then goes 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.269
 marry that combination that people 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.579
 made in your eye can get quite can 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.769
 to be generous a mask that she who 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.220
 goes from finishing on our side 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.230
 then we put the push that I will 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.549
 make everything mouth that will also be a 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.650
 Good with co 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.739
 and I'll give you one more blush option 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.590
 Liquid blush it has a larger fixation 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.769
 it is well segmented so it goes 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.510
 take too long to leave to stay 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.389
 Coladinho several hours 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.750
 button we will use the one that is a 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:48.150
 color like coral that will never fight 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.859
 both you've worn and it 's a color 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.199
 cheerful and not a very dark color 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:55.500
 so if you start now a little bit 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:57.510
 if you see above the cd it will not go 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.090
 problem, nor does it have a 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.370
 mack finish that is more dry 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.840
 so the idea that it lasts a little longer 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.750
 also 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.530
 We're going to put one more child 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:15.680
 long, flashiest son and you 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.680
 puts it close to the queen and his 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.979
 the most integrated approach possible 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.840
 baptized x does not then relax during 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.960
 15 minutes and you will feel like you 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.550
 a cap without a purple eye 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.860
 It's cool it's always nice to have a 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.290
 reinforced dipole at the root of the eyelashes 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.150
 so how I used the purple outline and 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.430
 I will see in the same lapse of luxury and I will 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.370
 reinforce this my queen to 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.710
 disguise just the root of the tenement 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.040
 then it is in this cushion that has to call 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.410
 the attention and not the root of the lashes and there 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.050
 another thing we can play in 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.539
 is to use that same golden glitter and give 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.360
 a little slap here high on the apple 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:57.370
 rising toward the temples link you 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.100
 You can play wherever else you want. 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.610

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:16.120

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:17.979
 with my tongue to finish I made 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.229
 You do not leave with me 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.000
