00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.890
 some color in expo center illustrious visit had colombia these days the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.620
 Two-time world champion of formula one Finnish mika hakkinen that Saturday 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.909
 Mendez with the details 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:15.690
 the streets of Bogota were paralyzed 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.890
 Many people did not know what was happening but others waited anxiously for the presence 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.109
 of the two-time champion 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.810
 and the rumor that was only one picasa 500 is in Colombia and finally the pilot 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:29.330
 appeared people crowded to see him and hear him reasons why he had 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.300
 come jacqui smith is ambassador of the pact of responsible consumption of liquor 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.239
 that designated hacker driver who ingests alcoholic beverages when going to 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.660
 Drive Robert Frost Bonaparte Beijing 8 Aug 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.850
 I would love it because first of all I would like 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.750
 hector osio many people although it is not the channel itself 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.840
 and that many things have happened to him for driving a vehicle in the text of 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.690
 liqueur 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.640
 also when the brand proposed me two years ago I started watching videos 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.990
 clips listen to testimonies by rails 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.250
 see things on television and I realized that those people do not hurt themselves 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.890
 same 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.190
 but we keep pet children 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.710
 it's very stupid 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.080
 I thought I felt for vitro icaza who signed the agreement promised 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.070
 to carry that message to all Colombians a campaign that has been 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.850
 a worldwide success, people are 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.869
 gin with very good spirit to the park goya lavalle have a pasodoble two 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:21.790
 times champion 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.289
 the official formula one of NATO as a result of the scandal at night 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.020
 when it has been taken are not worth message specialties that goes up 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.979
 the world we are familiar with formula 1 are the statements 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.390
 spectacular but the Finnish pilot also took the opportunity to 

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:38.380
 Bogotan streets 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.880
 he did it in a two-seater 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.880
 the roar of ampuero engines 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.300
 and it was the right moment to also advise future Colombian pilots 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.310
 last night I was up to subtract this after winning it seems to me that colom is 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.860
 losing the opportunity to have a pile the formula 1 I know that here is 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.030
 I really enjoyed having a runner in formula 1 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.120
 but that is not easy for colombia 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.840
 Here there are resources, there is human quality 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.510
 an advice that history 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.490
 pique to be in formula 1 you have to have a good management that is 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.900
 behind him that not only did his physique and his running style but 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.179
 also his mentor stern employment 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.699
 they only spent a few hours of their presence in the country when 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:22.309
 had registered five thousand two hundred signatures of Colombians who joined the 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.649
 responsible technical consumption pact that is more or less in 20 countries 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:29.269
 for the last two years is our global ambassador of the march and 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.239
 the campaign some the pact picks up the designated driver is also known to 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:33.680
 yes 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.300
 and well it's incredibly 20 countries now want other subjects in 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.510
 Latin America and then we will continue to follow that which gives more 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.969
 force 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.230
 but logically the double world champion also took advantage of his presence 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.540
 to comment what was the step of Juan Pablo Amoya for the formula 1 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.939
 stagno piantÃ³ field but I was thinking and talking about Juan Pablo 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:52.909
 montoya 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.219
 and I think it's an interesting race in formula one 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.539
 but I think he could have given much more because he's a very good driver 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.299
 what happens is that formula 1 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.749
 it's a special business and there to be very concentrated, you have to stay and 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:11.709
 continue fighting a lot love the balcony this the windows on the platforms in 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.180
 Where there was a space, the Colombians crowded to see the 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.150
 two-time world champion who with his simplicity talked about cars drove by 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.720
 the streets of the city and certainly left a civic message to reduce the 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.719
 Accident when the ico is ingested 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:31.129
 Thank you
