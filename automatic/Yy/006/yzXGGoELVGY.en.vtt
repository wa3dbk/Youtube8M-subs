00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
let me pan in see that's the Wii sensor

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.289 
let me pan in see that's the Wii sensor
bar<00:01:59.299> right<00:01:59.479> there<00:02:00.670> right<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:01.759> top<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:02.180> can

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
bar right there right on top and you can

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.039 
bar right there right on top and you can
still<00:02:02.450> see<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.689> problem<00:02:03.650> is<00:02:03.770> on<00:02:03.979> my<00:02:04.159> other<00:02:04.310> we

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
still see it problem is on my other we

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.450 
still see it problem is on my other we
see<00:02:06.049> I<00:02:06.110> put<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.290> sense<00:02:06.500> of<00:02:06.560> our<00:02:06.680> all<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:06.950> way

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
see I put the sense of our all the way

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.940 
see I put the sense of our all the way
down<00:02:07.670> there<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.439> fact<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:09.739> snot

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
down there and the fact that snot

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.460 
down there and the fact that snot
focusing<00:02:10.340> doesn't<00:02:10.610> make<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:10.819> any<00:02:10.909> better

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
focusing doesn't make it any better

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.379 
focusing doesn't make it any better
so<00:02:12.470> there's<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:12.860> Wii<00:02:13.040> sensor<00:02:13.280> bar<00:02:13.609> right

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:14.389 
so there's the Wii sensor bar right

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.839 
so there's the Wii sensor bar right
there<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:14.779> current<00:02:15.049> one<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:16.069> it's<00:02:16.669> just

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
there the current one and it's just

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.670 
there the current one and it's just
really<00:02:17.540> hard<00:02:17.870> for

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
really hard for

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.649 
really hard for
go<00:02:18.799> and<00:02:19.159> because<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.700> how<00:02:19.909> skinny<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.299> is<00:02:20.420> it

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
go and because of how skinny it is it

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.059 
go and because of how skinny it is it
just<00:02:20.840> doesn't<00:02:21.140> want<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.349> work<00:02:21.409> right<00:02:21.560> there

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
just doesn't want to work right there

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.530 
just doesn't want to work right there
so<00:02:22.819> I<00:02:23.060> current<00:02:23.780> my<00:02:24.049> new<00:02:24.230> one<00:02:24.469> and<00:02:25.310> my<00:02:26.150> old<00:02:26.329> one

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
so I current my new one and my old one

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.970
