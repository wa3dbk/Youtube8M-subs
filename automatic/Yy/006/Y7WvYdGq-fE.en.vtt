here<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> mic<00:01:34.560> itself<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.159> pretty

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
here is the mic itself and the pretty

here is the mic itself and the pretty
much<00:01:35.400> main<00:01:35.579> reason<00:01:35.909> why<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> got<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.600> that

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
much main reason why I got this is that

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.390 
much main reason why I got this is that
it's<00:01:36.900> designed<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.320> DSLRs<00:01:37.920> because<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
it's designed for DSLRs because of the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.149 
it's designed for DSLRs because of the
hotshoe<00:01:39.030> option<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.780> bottom<00:01:40.079> here<00:01:40.290> as

I've been debating to get this or the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.499 
I've been debating to get this or the
Sennheiser<00:01:43.649> MKE<00:01:44.250> 400<00:01:44.729> which<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.299> another

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
Sennheiser MKE 400 which is another

Sennheiser MKE 400 which is another
shotgun<00:01:46.110> microphone<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:47.159> great<00:01:47.880> for

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
shotgun microphone that's great for

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.550 
shotgun microphone that's great for
DSLRs<00:01:48.600> however<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.869> chose<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> rode<00:01:49.350> one

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
DSLRs however I chose the rode one

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.960 
DSLRs however I chose the rode one
mainly<00:01:49.799> because<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.310> seemed<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.790> more

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
mainly because it seemed like the more

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.719 
mainly because it seemed like the more
popular<00:01:51.509> model<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.740> reviews<00:01:53.549> on<00:01:53.700> it

popular model and the reviews on it

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.310 
popular model and the reviews on it
seemed<00:01:54.030> pretty<00:01:54.180> positive<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> decided<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
seemed pretty positive so I decided you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200 
seemed pretty positive so I decided you

itself here you have the foam piece on

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.030 
itself here you have the foam piece on
here<00:02:00.659> which<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.020> wind<00:02:01.320> chill<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.770> kind<00:02:02.009> of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
here which is like wind chill to kind of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.260 
here which is like wind chill to kind of
reduce<00:02:02.280> wind<00:02:02.549> noise<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.030> use<00:02:03.149> this

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
pretty much like increase the loudness

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.470 
pretty much like increase the loudness
or<00:02:32.310> decrease<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.850> loudness<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.330> the

you have these elastic bands here as I
mentioned<00:02:37.140> earlier<00:02:37.440> they<00:02:37.590> basically<00:02:37.860> kind<00:02:38.220> of

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
mentioned earlier they basically kind of

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.940 
mentioned earlier they basically kind of
reduce<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.550> vibrations<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:40.050> microphones

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
reduce the vibrations of the microphones

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.920 
reduce the vibrations of the microphones
and<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.340> reduce<00:02:41.850> any<00:02:42.030> noise<00:02:42.240> when<00:02:42.810> you're

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
microphone sensitivity all the way down

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.410 
microphone sensitivity all the way down
to<00:04:01.740> 6<00:04:02.040> at<00:04:02.280> least<00:04:02.400> that's<00:04:02.610> what<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.060> think<00:04:03.330> is

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
to 6 at least that's what I think is

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.890 
to 6 at least that's what I think is
best<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:04.190> everything<00:04:05.190> else<00:04:05.459> should<00:04:05.730> be<00:04:05.900> left

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
best and everything else should be left

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.050 
best and everything else should be left
ok<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.010> guess<00:04:08.160> we're<00:04:08.370> going<00:04:08.490> to<00:04:08.520> switch<00:04:08.700> over

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
ok so I guess we're going to switch over

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.230 
ok so I guess we're going to switch over
to<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.950> T<00:04:10.950> 52-card<00:04:11.430> here<00:04:11.730> just<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.000> show<00:04:12.180> you

quality<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.430> guess<00:04:15.030> my<00:04:15.150> iPhone<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.930> internal

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
quality I guess my iPhone the internal

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.789 
quality I guess my iPhone the internal
mic<00:04:16.410> on<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.650> Nikon<00:04:17.160> d50<00:04:17.609> 300<00:04:18.030> and

mic on the Nikon d50 300 and

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.039 
mic on the Nikon d50 300 and
over<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.489> road<00:04:19.729> Mike<00:04:20.000> it's<00:04:20.750> actually

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
over to the road Mike it's actually

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.839 
over to the road Mike it's actually
green<00:04:21.530> light<00:04:21.709> but<00:04:21.949> I<00:04:21.979> put<00:04:22.220> in<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.490> think<00:04:22.699> an

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
green light but I put in I think an

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.640 
green light but I put in I think an
almost<00:04:23.000> dead<00:04:23.509> 9-volt<00:04:23.930> battery<00:04:24.229> so<00:04:24.379> that's

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
almost dead 9-volt battery so that's

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.439 
almost dead 9-volt battery so that's
what<00:04:24.889> it<00:04:25.159> looks<00:04:25.400> like<00:04:25.550> if<00:04:25.759> you're<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:26.270> little

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
below that you know if it's a pretty

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.770 
below that you know if it's a pretty
nozzle<00:04:55.520> difference<00:04:55.909> or<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.240> sound<00:04:56.479> quality's

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
nozzle difference or the sound quality's

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.559 
nozzle difference or the sound quality's
any<00:04:56.900> better<00:04:57.139> or<00:04:57.319> not<00:04:57.469> but<00:04:58.099> yeah<00:04:58.789> guys<00:04:59.000> this<00:04:59.509> is

00:04:59.559 --> 00:04:59.569 
any better or not but yeah guys this is

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.089 
any better or not but yeah guys this is
what<00:04:59.719> it<00:04:59.810> sounds<00:05:00.080> like<00:05:00.199> so<00:05:00.409> far<00:05:00.620> I'm<00:05:00.830> pretty

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
what it sounds like so far I'm pretty

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.670 
what it sounds like so far I'm pretty
happy<00:05:01.639> with<00:05:01.909> it<00:05:01.969> I<00:05:02.240> think<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.199> sounds<00:05:03.319> much

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
happy with it I think it sounds much

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.219 
happy with it I think it sounds much
more<00:05:03.740> better<00:05:04.129> than<00:05:04.699> the<00:05:04.940> stereo<00:05:05.719> microphone

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
more better than the stereo microphone

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:07.629 
more better than the stereo microphone
that's<00:05:06.409> built<00:05:06.650> into<00:05:06.800> the<00:05:07.039> Nikon<00:05:07.400> which<00:05:07.520> is

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
that's built into the Nikon which is

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:08.890 
that's built into the Nikon which is
actually<00:05:07.909> so<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.060> be<00:05:08.180> improved<00:05:08.569> over<00:05:08.870> the

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
actually so to be improved over the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.439 
actually so to be improved over the
Nikon<00:05:09.259> d50<00:05:09.740> 100<00:05:10.310> but<00:05:10.699> again<00:05:10.940> it<00:05:11.120> isn't<00:05:11.270> a

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
Nikon d50 100 but again it isn't a

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.719 
Nikon d50 100 but again it isn't a
turtle<00:05:11.719> mic<00:05:11.900> which<00:05:12.680> you<00:05:12.979> know<00:05:13.069> in<00:05:13.280> comparison

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
turtle mic which you know in comparison

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.749 
turtle mic which you know in comparison
to<00:05:13.759> actual<00:05:14.710> third-party<00:05:15.710> mics<00:05:15.919> not<00:05:16.460> that

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
to actual third-party mics not that

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.969 
to actual third-party mics not that
great<00:05:16.969> but<00:05:17.300> overall<00:05:17.900> you<00:05:18.110> know<00:05:18.199> it's<00:05:18.349> decent

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
great but overall you know it's decent

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.980 
great but overall you know it's decent
for<00:05:19.129> what<00:05:19.250> it<00:05:19.370> is<00:05:19.490> but<00:05:20.090> I<00:05:20.150> mean<00:05:20.300> some<00:05:20.509> overall

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
for what it is but I mean some overall

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.390 
for what it is but I mean some overall
guys<00:05:21.169> you<00:05:21.440> know<00:05:21.560> in<00:05:21.650> terms<00:05:21.740> of<00:05:21.889> the<00:05:21.949> price<00:05:22.190> tag

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.620 
I think that's quite a bit much even
though<00:05:24.229> I<00:05:24.289> got<00:05:24.469> on<00:05:24.590> sale<00:05:25.150> for<00:05:26.150> a<00:05:26.180> microphone
