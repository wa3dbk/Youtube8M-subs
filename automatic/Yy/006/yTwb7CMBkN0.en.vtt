00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.380
 has become my passion 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.850
 let's try a quick quick trick 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:28.170
 but nice with new new things 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.750
 andora bean products 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.180
 it must be just a trick 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:41.730
 super fast, you have the time 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:45.000
 bought this silver stick e 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.969
 resumes all released however not 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.910
 colors to whom so that they have 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.910
 the first light effect so fast 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:09.750
 and then with the hands with the fingers with the heat 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.440
 I stretch it well on the eyelid so 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.440
 more uniform 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:31.659
 now let's take it with this 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:41.979
 this is also a color for the headmaster 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:48.579
 literato bristle brush puppet 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:53.920
 large and slowly I go to get a 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:02:04.000
 bit of color of this blue a lot blue 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:06.939
 intense fact of being successful and it 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.980
 I'm going to lean on the base I have 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:14.880
 created silver so that it does a little to 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.880
 glue 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.909
 I leave I am not going to put it in the part 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:30.260
 of the inner corner so that it remains 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:34.329
 stay brighter we do from the center 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.329
 more or less outwards 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:49.430
 much gave in the evening however depending 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.269
 yes clothes can be used sometimes 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.870
 also of young people 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:59.389
 now let's go and fix the part 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:03.790
 external brush a little bigger and 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.790
 clean this 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.770
 I find it actually clean 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:17.110
 so as not to mix the colors start 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:22.030
 to pass very lightly for 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:26.860
 fade out and do not make the effect 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.440
 stain let's say as you see I always keep 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.540
 those wine below the arch 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.780
 eyebrows because otherwise I would do 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.250
 really panda effect under the arch 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.340
 eyebrows must not go 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:44.770
 especially when using dark colors 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:47.500
 like blue the gray colors this type 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.780
 never or brown even sure won't go 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.690
 never under the arch because otherwise from a 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.120
 really bad effect ok now 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.710
 we faded my mind, I'm going to clean up 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:03.750
 the side hint area when you are 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:07.320
 I do this very technical operation 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:13.150
 I always tend to do some sort of drawing 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:16.419
 with your fingers so that even the shadow 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:22.720
 of the makeup that is created if it is not 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:27.190
 completely random we define well 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:31.600
 the eye with a colored pencil is there 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:34.230
 very good either the black pencil or a city 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:39.040
 however dark I try to put this 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:42.070
 which recalls the group a little we see a 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.289
 let's try and why I'm not doing it 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.969
 now 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.969
 I've never tried with matching 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.960
 but I do a row not too much 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:02.350
 that goes alone to define well 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.350
 the lash line 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:15.069
 ok well it's pretty good as a color 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:36.080
 with two three products this is the thing 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:39.499
 magical part of everything in it 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:45.619
 many colors are sincere have 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:47.419
 made the new pastel shades on pink 

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:49.520
 green water and color used 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:52.039
 I'm not crazy about this summer 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.229
 rebuilt continues to take these 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.479
 versions here that are still there until 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.520
 there are in various shades I have it 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.800
 this is the last one this one 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.599
 that you go on the Argentine then you are 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.259
 even whiter more tending to 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:09.169
 white however i am found i still got it 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:11.809
 then we also took brown 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:15.289
 rosÃ© that gives an effect even a little 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:17.569
 brahms and very very nice in my opinion is 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:21.860
 this 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:24.439
 even surrogates have a convenience 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.759
 incredible because in a moment of stan 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:29.330
 short while 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:33.080
 if you want to re-define above with eye shadows 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:36.589
 pencils in two seconds 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.169
 you already have a really eye makeup 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:41.509
 very fast and comfortable very practical and then 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:45.080
 the make-up is also very hard 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:51.219
 anyway now we are going to finish 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:57.309
 let's say with a light base not used 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:57.309
 that only has its own color number 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:10.540
 perfect even in place 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.880
 I didn't time I didn't watch 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:17.200
 how long it took me to say that we have 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.430
 put very little I hope you 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.020
 like 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.020
 then we find others bye
