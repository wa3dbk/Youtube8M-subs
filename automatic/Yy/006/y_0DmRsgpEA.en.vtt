 cable 2 meters why bought it 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:37.649
 Chinese shit a week ago broke 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:41.579
 another screwdriver broke chinese 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.950
 dvd screwdriver that was bought 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.340
 let's say for some average money 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.950
 something around 60 dollars how would the price 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.809
 and not a small pension 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.190
 throw a little dive buy something already 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.800
 type bosch and or makita 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.320
 but in the back, as always, greedy bought 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.079
 something mean to minutes between full 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.910
 by shit and something more or less normal and 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.460
 in the end this is now up to the average 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.010
 worked for only three months i.e. 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.560
 the screwdriver of his body through the picture I you 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.650
 leave you see 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.450
 worked for three months only 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.439
 broke the button first started 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.650
 screw up the reverse 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.009
 that is, it simply did not turn on and because 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.619
 that build a button and there is a reverse button and 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.020
 click on the reverse they are combined in general 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.460
 Of course you could have a lead in the repair and 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.500
 wait two three months while his 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.020

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.829

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.040
 screwdriver network expert in epicenter 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.270
 it costs less than 200 hryvnia that is 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.490

 I have a lot of power tools and 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.320
 the experience is so very simple and he gave me 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.650
 The following is to either buy good 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.620
 the tool is not cheap yes well something like 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.990
 bosch blue makita 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.510
 or not at all money there hilti yes if 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.960
 no money then buy the cheapest 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.560
 Chinese shit why am I like that 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.990
 Bulgarian I have everything for Bulgarian 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.740
 This is a Bulgarian bought it just 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.120
 it was necessary to cut off something 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.310
 grinder was not here I went to the epicenter 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.560
 bought this too it is less than 20 dollars 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.130
 This Bulgarian I have five years or 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.709
 six 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.840
 visa and there is something and just do not do 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.690
 sample but the shorter it works on 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.820
 slaughter and not yet happening to him 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.620
 pennies basically a normal Bulgarian 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.720
 here is here for example 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.940
 the old Soviet drill is already there 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.280
 probably more than twenty years is not really 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.500
 less than twenty more than one hundred percent 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.239
 I also work Misha them she told me how 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.400
 concrete mixer I and there inserts 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.760
 special mixer is not this nozzle and misha 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.050
 and cement is all that kind of thing 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.060
 so the buyer is either something reliable 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.590
 either something completely golem and that's what not 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.430
 sorry here you have bought this ball to 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.470
 reality he broke down after three months 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.440
 Iâ€™ll quietly throw him away 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.900
 no thought there about 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.940
 Well, that's supposedly Havana, yes, it's from shit like 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.830
 would i know that this shit in know 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.570
 be such that he will be this 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.520
 Bulgarians will work for many years and 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.320
 something mean for the price let 's 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.030
 Chinese it is expensive here it can 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.190
 break down in three months some dvd 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.020
 Well, let's proceed to unpacking and then 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.080
 so I have no tests 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.680
 tripod so there will be some such 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:58.590
 unpacking kind so well 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:02.410
 actually very simple either 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:06.130
 box except a screwdriver and nothing else 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.860
 not in a nutshell about those screwdriver them 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.210
 expert who were in the epicenter there 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.440
 there were three help models 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.470
 differed in price slightly 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.160
 cheap model right here 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.370
 models button speed adjustment 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.470
 smoothly 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.280
 from the cheapest model was not smooth 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.880
 adjustment that is, there was such 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.290
 Krutilochka here here and u more expensive 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.080
 models had a switch over here 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.970
 above for high revs that is 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.100
 screwdriver to use a drill but 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.919
 I honestly have enough drills and without 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.040
 I generally have this screwdriver 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.340
 drill there is a punch there is another 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.510
 a door 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.010
 really I only needed that Paul 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.730
 so I bought a moderately priced model 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:51.310
 in power they were all the same here 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:56.230
 Well here means the switch button 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:05:02.669
 reverse back and forth and switch 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:02.669
 tightening moment chuck itself clamping 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:11.150
 in fact, that's the whole set 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.460
 now we will start the test 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.660
 so taking part in the test 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:22.760
 my outdoor workbench 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:25.990
 thickness of 4 centimeters and three types of screw 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.900
 I took this screw with a press washer 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.720
 here it is a half centimeter screw on 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.560
 wood 5 centimeters and screws for wood 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.450
 7 centimeters and now I will try you 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.960
 window to start put the regulator on 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:51.100
 for example, 8 and start with screws with 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:58.520
 press-puck worked great 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:59.870
 appraiser so screw 5 centimeters well 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:06.980
 let's leave on the same eight 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:11.890
 interesting well, no problem and screw 7 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.890
 centimeters too the eight remains 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.900
 in general, he played twisted all three 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.180
 screw in principle 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.949
 which is to be expected technique is cheap 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.320
 Chinese and 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:28.000
 and it works yes here unlike 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.430
 middle chinese 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.139
 Well, in general, let's see how he will show himself 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:37.990
 in work well twists or will work to 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:40.710
 ok screw tightened and by the way 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.710
 I'll try to look like 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:58.050
 Well, everything is fine, it was Sergey with you 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.030
 there was a review of an inexpensive screwdriver expert
