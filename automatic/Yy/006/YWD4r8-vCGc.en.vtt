Motorsports Park give us your take on it

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.860 
Motorsports Park give us your take on it
the<00:00:37.280> tracks<00:00:37.580> absolutely<00:00:38.210> awesome<00:00:38.360> full

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
the tracks absolutely awesome full

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.810 
the tracks absolutely awesome full
blinders<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.860> whole<00:00:39.980> whether<00:00:40.160> it's<00:00:40.610> real

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
blinders the whole whether it's real

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.150 
blinders the whole whether it's real
wide<00:00:41.030> open<00:00:41.480> flowing<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:42.200> yeah<00:00:42.770> I<00:00:42.800> really

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
wide open flowing and yeah I really

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.430 
wide open flowing and yeah I really
really<00:00:43.430> like<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.640> circuit<00:00:44.140> it's<00:00:45.140> got<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.290> bit

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
really like the circuit it's got a bit

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.810 
really like the circuit it's got a bit
of<00:00:45.500> everything<00:00:45.710> you<00:00:45.800> know<00:00:45.950> tight<00:00:46.190> style<00:00:46.520> fast

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
of everything you know tight style fast

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.479 
of everything you know tight style fast
bit<00:00:47.330> of<00:00:47.390> bumps<00:00:47.660> yes<00:00:48.320> just<00:00:48.590> a<00:00:48.680> good<00:00:48.830> good<00:00:49.220> track

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
bit of bumps yes just a good good track

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.790 
bit of bumps yes just a good good track
so<00:00:49.820> I<00:00:50.120> just<00:00:50.809> need<00:00:50.960> to<00:00:51.110> figure<00:00:51.290> out<00:00:51.410> little<00:00:51.710> bit

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
so I just need to figure out little bit

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.200 
so I just need to figure out little bit
better<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.129> hopefully<00:00:52.699> a<00:00:52.820> little<00:00:52.879> bit<00:00:53.090> more

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
better and hopefully a little bit more

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.630 
better and hopefully a little bit more
the<00:00:53.300> front<00:00:53.570> is<00:00:54.379> there<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.710> particular<00:00:55.040> section

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
the front is there a particular section

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.150 
the front is there a particular section
that<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:56.030> set<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.480> bike<00:00:56.660> up<00:00:56.870> more<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.559> suit<00:00:57.860> is

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
that you set the bike up more to suit is

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.439 
that you set the bike up more to suit is
there<00:00:58.309> a<00:00:58.340> particular<00:00:58.640> part<00:00:59.180> that's<00:00:59.390> really

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
there a particular part that's really

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.180 
there a particular part that's really
important<00:01:00.050> to<00:01:00.170> get<00:01:00.409> the<00:01:00.530> bike<00:01:00.680> working<00:01:01.040> well

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
important to get the bike working well

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.180 
important to get the bike working well
as<00:01:01.339> it<00:01:02.239> is<00:01:02.659> a<00:01:02.780> bit<00:01:02.900> of<00:01:03.080> a<00:01:03.140> balance<00:01:03.500> but<00:01:03.739> the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
as it is a bit of a balance but the

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.710 
as it is a bit of a balance but the
minute<00:01:04.550> we're<00:01:04.670> sort<00:01:04.879> of<00:01:04.909> slow<00:01:05.150> in<00:01:05.300> a<00:01:05.390> couple<00:01:05.659> of

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
minute we're sort of slow in a couple of

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.700 
minute we're sort of slow in a couple of
the<00:01:06.020> slower<00:01:06.260> turns<00:01:06.590> which<00:01:08.140> it<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.290> a<00:01:09.320> balance

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
the slower turns which it is a balance

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.620 
the slower turns which it is a balance
but<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:10.670> know<00:01:10.790> people<00:01:11.000> are<00:01:11.150> making<00:01:11.390> it<00:01:11.479> work

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
but you know people are making it work

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.750 
but you know people are making it work
in<00:01:11.840> pretty<00:01:12.200> much<00:01:12.260> all<00:01:12.380> sectors<00:01:12.920> but<00:01:13.130> if<00:01:13.670> you

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
in pretty much all sectors but if you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.070 
in pretty much all sectors but if you
look<00:01:13.880> actually<00:01:14.000> in<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.360> sectors<00:01:14.690> no<00:01:14.840> one's

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
look actually in the sectors no one's

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.570 
look actually in the sectors no one's
quick<00:01:15.560> in<00:01:15.710> all<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:15.979> sectors<00:01:16.220> they're<00:01:16.460> always

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
quick in all the sectors they're always

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.930 
quick in all the sectors they're always
a<00:01:16.670> sector<00:01:17.330> they're<00:01:17.479> they're<00:01:17.810> down<00:01:17.990> in<00:01:18.170> so<00:01:18.940> it

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
a sector they're they're down in so it

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.060 
a sector they're they're down in so it
is<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.120> balance<00:01:20.479> but<00:01:20.720> I<00:01:21.380> think<00:01:21.740> there's<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:21.920> few

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
is a balance but I think there's a few

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.070 
is a balance but I think there's a few
things<00:01:22.130> I<00:01:22.400> can<00:01:22.460> improve<00:01:22.880> on<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:23.390> freshly<00:01:23.840> get

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
things I can improve on and freshly get

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.360 
things I can improve on and freshly get
the<00:01:24.170> bike<00:01:24.320> better<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.770> then<00:01:24.860> hopefully<00:01:25.250> can

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
the bike better and then hopefully can

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.700 
the bike better and then hopefully can
be<00:01:25.400> a<00:01:25.729> little<00:01:26.119> bit<00:01:26.210> stronger

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.470 

we<00:01:33.130> just<00:01:33.340> went<00:01:33.460> through<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.820> whole<00:01:33.880> Superpole

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
we just went through the whole Superpole

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.150 
we just went through the whole Superpole
knockout<00:01:34.900> session<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:35.530> did<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:36.010> went

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
knockout session you did you went

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.560 
knockout session you did you went
through<00:01:36.340> all<00:01:36.550> three<00:01:36.790> sessions<00:01:37.030> into<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
through all three sessions into the

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.620 
through all three sessions into the
third<00:01:37.780> session<00:01:38.050> and<00:01:38.440> you<00:01:38.830> were<00:01:38.920> talking<00:01:39.280> about

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
third session and you were talking about

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.030 
third session and you were talking about
running<00:01:40.630> out<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:40.900> queue<00:01:41.170> tires<00:01:41.410> for<00:01:41.680> that<00:01:41.800> last

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
running out of queue tires for that last

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.610 
running out of queue tires for that last
session<00:01:42.310> so<00:01:42.700> how<00:01:43.360> do<00:01:43.420> you<00:01:43.630> blot<00:01:43.990> that<00:01:44.230> all<00:01:44.410> out

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
session so how do you blot that all out

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.520 
session so how do you blot that all out
it's<00:01:45.460> a<00:01:45.550> tricky<00:01:45.760> one<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:46.060> know<00:01:46.230> for<00:01:47.230> the<00:01:47.290> first

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
it's a tricky one you know for the first

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.590 
it's a tricky one you know for the first
first<00:01:48.040> part<00:01:48.280> of<00:01:48.340> qualifying<00:01:48.730> I<00:01:49.180> went<00:01:49.420> out<00:01:49.480> on<00:01:49.510> a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
first part of qualifying I went out on a

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.940 
first part of qualifying I went out on a
race<00:01:49.780> time<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.050> never<00:01:50.170> really<00:01:50.530> got<00:01:50.620> a<00:01:50.680> good

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
race time I never really got a good

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.770 
race time I never really got a good
lapping<00:01:51.340> you<00:01:51.370> know<00:01:51.550> I<00:01:51.580> was<00:01:51.790> behind

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
lapping you know I was behind

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.570 
lapping you know I was behind
I<00:01:52.810> think<00:01:53.050> toes<00:01:53.260> and<00:01:53.590> never<00:01:53.800> really<00:01:54.160> sort<00:01:54.520> of

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
I think toes and never really sort of

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.000 
I think toes and never really sort of
made<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.820> work<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.440> that<00:01:56.440> means<00:01:56.650> you<00:01:56.800> I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
made it work and that that means you I

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.440 
made it work and that that means you I
think<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.400> use<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.550> qualifying<00:01:58.000> tie<00:01:58.210> for<00:01:58.420> the

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
think the use of qualifying tie for the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.510 
think the use of qualifying tie for the
next<00:01:58.690> one<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.870> make<00:01:59.020> sure<00:01:59.050> is<00:01:59.290> in<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.440> top<00:01:59.710> top

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
next one to make sure is in the top top

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.900 
next one to make sure is in the top top
sixteen<00:02:00.970> so<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.650> I<00:02:02.770> did<00:02:03.130> an<00:02:03.250> all<00:02:03.400> right<00:02:03.550> lap<00:02:03.730> on

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
sixteen so and I did an all right lap on

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.730 
sixteen so and I did an all right lap on
it<00:02:04.060> but<00:02:04.270> basically<00:02:04.570> used<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.080> qualifying<00:02:05.470> tire

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
it but basically used a qualifying tire

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.990 
it but basically used a qualifying tire
and<00:02:06.580> then<00:02:07.210> for<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.390> second<00:02:07.720> one<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:08.880> went<00:02:09.880> out

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
and then for the second one I went out

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.240 
and then for the second one I went out
on<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.600> qualifying<00:02:11.110> tire<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:11.530> did<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> good<00:02:12.070> lap
