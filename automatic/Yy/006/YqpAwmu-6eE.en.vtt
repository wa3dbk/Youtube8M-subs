00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.870
 good dear friends of youtube in this 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.940
 video tutorial would let them know how 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.769
 the network keys to which we have 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.260
 connected 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.239
 first let's see if we have 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.100
 we are connected to the internet as you see here 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:57.420
 is connected to my networks 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.170
 own movistar followed we go to the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.600
 windows 8 icon we are that left 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.030
 As you can see , there are many options 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.970
 extinguished transgression which 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.740
 we will take administrator or collections of 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.259
 networks 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.420
 we're going to the one we're connected to 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.850
 currently that the current file as 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.310
 we have with bluetooth or by esther that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.700
 means by cable we are that 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.060
 left and state 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.159
 as you see here this picture does not come out 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.530
 we are to network properties and to all 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.329
 we do know that we are here to 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.329
 security and show characters 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.850
 and ready 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.960
 something very simple 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.530
 which properly windows 8.1 treats as 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.530
 to hide 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.690
 to make it a bit safer and everything 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.940
 a tone 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:01.590
 I can not be doing this information 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:05.659
 good in windows 8 is much easier 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.659
 we just have to go to the network 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.030
 to the wifi network that we have connects to the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.150
 fly left to me does not come out because 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.480
 in windows 2.1 it deals like 2003 this 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.760
 option we give you between left and 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.770
 properties and in others 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.990
 it automatically brings us to this 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.980
 screenshot that appears here currently 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.700
 and already being with me security 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.650
 and characters 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.209
 the subject 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:42.700
 like nothing of the other world subscribe from 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.700
