00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
to Jace Amaro first of all his he's a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.219 
to Jace Amaro first of all his he's a
receiving<00:01:17.549> tight<00:01:17.759> end<00:01:17.939> not<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> guy<00:01:18.390> who<00:01:18.450> really

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
receiving tight end not a guy who really

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.020 
receiving tight end not a guy who really
lines<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.770> with<00:01:19.950> his<00:01:20.070> hands<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.610> dirt<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
lines up with his hands in the dirt and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.410 
lines up with his hands in the dirt and
helps<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.860> blocking<00:01:22.860> side<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.159> things

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
helps with the blocking side of things

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.999 
helps with the blocking side of things
but<00:01:24.420> I'll<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.810> his<00:01:24.930> blocking<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.590> second

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
but I'll get to his blocking in a second

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.620 
but I'll get to his blocking in a second
when<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> comes<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.610> him<00:01:26.970> being<00:01:27.150> or<00:01:27.299> receiving

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.760

possession<00:01:48.210> type<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.659> tight<00:01:48.840> end<00:01:49.049> not<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.350> big

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
possession type of tight end not a big

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.330

comparing<00:01:53.340> him<00:01:53.549> with<00:01:53.579> Eric<00:01:54.000> Ebron<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.390> think

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
comparing him with Eric Ebron I think

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.149 
comparing him with Eric Ebron I think
Eric<00:01:54.869> Ebron<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:55.829> more<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.100> a

Eric Ebron is going to be more of a

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.249 
Eric Ebron is going to be more of a
tight<00:01:56.340> end<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.640> has<00:01:56.820> more<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.600> big-play

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
tight end that has more of that big-play

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.350 
tight end that has more of that big-play
potential<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.070> think<00:01:59.579> Jace<00:01:59.759> Amaro<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.299> to

potential I think Jace Amaro is going to

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.969 
potential I think Jace Amaro is going to
be<00:02:00.420> more<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.780> possession<00:02:01.320> working<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
be more of that possession working the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.859 
be more of that possession working the

middle of the field in aligning up in

middle of the field in aligning up in
the<00:02:03.960> slot<00:02:04.170> type<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.619> wide<00:02:04.770> receiver<00:02:05.159> now

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
the slot type of wide receiver now

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.580 
the slot type of wide receiver now
hypothetically<00:02:06.630> speaking<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:07.229> if<00:02:07.320> he<00:02:07.409> does

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
when it comes to the evaluation process

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.270 
when it comes to the evaluation process
now<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:52.930> draft<00:04:53.319> projection<00:04:53.889> that<00:04:53.979> I<00:04:54.039> have

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
now the draft projection that I have

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.580 
now the draft projection that I have
form<00:04:54.580> is<00:04:54.729> 29<00:04:55.330> of<00:04:55.509> 50<00:04:55.629> to<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.259> might<00:04:56.440> think

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
form is 29 of 50 to you might think

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.129 
form is 29 of 50 to you might think
those<00:04:56.800> are<00:04:56.830> funky<00:04:57.310> numbers<00:04:57.639> but<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.449> 29<00:04:58.930> is

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
those are funky numbers but the 29 is

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.629 
those are funky numbers but the 29 is
because<00:04:59.440> New<00:04:59.590> England<00:04:59.949> is<00:05:00.069> drafting<00:05:00.490> there

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
because New England is drafting there

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.309 
because New England is drafting there
the<00:05:00.759> 52<00:05:01.210> s<00:05:01.270> because<00:05:01.629> the<00:05:01.719> Arizona<00:05:02.080> Arizona

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 
the 52 s because the Arizona Arizona

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:03.959 
the 52 s because the Arizona Arizona
Cardinals<00:05:02.860> are<00:05:03.159> drafting<00:05:03.490> there<00:05:03.610> i<00:05:03.639> think<00:05:03.729> is

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:03.969 
Cardinals are drafting there i think is

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:05.760 
Cardinals are drafting there i think is
going<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.180> go<00:05:04.270> anywhere<00:05:04.539> in<00:05:04.690> that<00:05:04.780> range<00:05:05.020> could

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
going to go anywhere in that range could

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.409 
going to go anywhere in that range could
go<00:05:05.919> late<00:05:06.099> first-round<00:05:06.639> could<00:05:06.849> go<00:05:07.000> mid<00:05:07.210> you

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
go late first-round could go mid you

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.369 
go late first-round could go mid you
know<00:05:07.539> up<00:05:07.659> to<00:05:07.810> mid<00:05:07.960> 2nd<00:05:08.379> round<00:05:09.509> i<00:05:10.509> already<00:05:11.020> you

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
know up to mid 2nd round i already you

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:12.689 
know up to mid 2nd round i already you
know<00:05:11.409> gave<00:05:11.770> my<00:05:11.889> two<00:05:11.949> cents<00:05:12.310> about<00:05:12.430> the

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
know gave my two cents about the

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.459 
know gave my two cents about the
Patriots<00:05:13.180> and<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.509> scenario<00:05:13.960> that<00:05:14.110> what

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:14.469 
Patriots and the scenario that what

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:15.839 
Patriots and the scenario that what
happened<00:05:14.770> there<00:05:14.860> I<00:05:14.889> think<00:05:15.009> Seattle<00:05:15.460> could<00:05:15.759> be

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
happened there I think Seattle could be

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.390 
happened there I think Seattle could be
a<00:05:15.879> possibility<00:05:16.360> teams<00:05:17.319> like<00:05:17.500> Oakland<00:05:17.979> Atlanta

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
a possibility teams like Oakland Atlanta

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.600 
a possibility teams like Oakland Atlanta
Tampa<00:05:18.759> Bay<00:05:18.909> the<00:05:19.659> Giants<00:05:20.169> Pittsburgh<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:21.310> Jets

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
Tampa Bay the Giants Pittsburgh the Jets

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.070 
Tampa Bay the Giants Pittsburgh the Jets
the<00:05:21.849> Cardinals<00:05:22.240> are<00:05:22.330> all<00:05:22.509> teams<00:05:22.810> that<00:05:22.990> could

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
the Cardinals are all teams that could

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.110 
the Cardinals are all teams that could
definitely<00:05:23.319> look<00:05:23.680> at<00:05:23.830> a<00:05:23.889> tight<00:05:24.250> end<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.699> if

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
definitely look at a tight end and if

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.930 
definitely look at a tight end and if
he's<00:05:25.270> there<00:05:25.479> in<00:05:25.629> the<00:05:25.659> second<00:05:26.110> round<00:05:26.259> I<00:05:26.940> really

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
he's there in the second round I really

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.399 
he's there in the second round I really
would<00:05:28.120> not<00:05:28.240> be<00:05:28.479> surprised<00:05:28.900> if<00:05:29.080> any<00:05:29.229> of<00:05:29.319> those

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
would not be surprised if any of those

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.649 
would not be surprised if any of those
teams<00:05:29.650> i<00:05:29.800> have<00:05:29.979> listed<00:05:30.250> would<00:05:30.639> take<00:05:31.210> Jason

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:31.659 
teams i have listed would take Jason
