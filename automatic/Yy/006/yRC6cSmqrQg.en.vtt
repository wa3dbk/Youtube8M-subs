terms of network marketing but a couple
of<00:01:51.470> years<00:01:51.500> ago<00:01:51.679> when<00:01:52.130> i<00:01:52.159> first<00:01:52.250> met<00:01:52.729> Cindy<00:01:53.060> she

of years ago when i first met Cindy she

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.719 
of years ago when i first met Cindy she
taught<00:01:54.409> me<00:01:54.739> what<00:01:55.099> is<00:01:55.220> called<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:55.459> wealth

formula and I think that that is one of
the<00:01:59.179> first<00:01:59.390> things<00:01:59.599> to<00:01:59.869> understand<00:02:00.319> when<00:02:00.500> it

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619

the first things to understand when it
comes<00:02:00.799> to<00:02:00.979> get<00:02:01.280> taking<00:02:01.700> control<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:02.090> your<00:02:02.239> time

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
comes to get taking control of your time

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.580 
comes to get taking control of your time
and<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.619> basis<00:02:04.039> of<00:02:04.069> the<00:02:04.399> wealth<00:02:04.640> formula<00:02:05.149> is

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
and the basis of the wealth formula is

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.979 
and the basis of the wealth formula is
that<00:02:06.590> we're<00:02:07.189> all<00:02:07.219> created<00:02:07.729> equal<00:02:08.269> in<00:02:08.539> the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
that we're all created equal in the

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.699 
that we're all created equal in the
sense<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.560> we<00:02:09.769> all<00:02:10.069> have<00:02:10.099> 24<00:02:10.849> hours<00:02:11.150> in<00:02:11.299> a<00:02:11.390> day

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
sense that we all have 24 hours in a day

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.860 
sense that we all have 24 hours in a day
okay<00:02:12.709> that's<00:02:12.950> just<00:02:13.160> what<00:02:13.700> separates<00:02:14.239> us<00:02:14.450> and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
okay that's just what separates us and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.360 
okay that's just what separates us and
you<00:02:15.200> know<00:02:15.230> different<00:02:15.650> people<00:02:15.769> are<00:02:16.010> where<00:02:16.190> they

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
you know different people are where they

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.860 
you know different people are where they
are<00:02:16.400> because<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.150> choices<00:02:17.389> that<00:02:17.600> they've

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
are because of the choices that they've

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.199 
are because of the choices that they've
made<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.290> how<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.590> spend<00:02:18.950> those<00:02:19.160> 24<00:02:19.730> hours<00:02:20.030> so

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
made on how to spend those 24 hours so

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.870 
made on how to spend those 24 hours so
we<00:02:20.329> have<00:02:20.510> every<00:02:20.810> day<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:22.100> next<00:02:22.280> five<00:02:22.609> years

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
we have every day the next five years

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.210 
we have every day the next five years
are<00:02:23.090> going<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:23.299> pass<00:02:23.540> anyway<00:02:24.109> right<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.980> next

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
are going to pass anyway right the next

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.650 
are going to pass anyway right the next
five<00:02:25.400> years<00:02:25.549> are<00:02:25.730> going<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:25.940> pass<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.450> only

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
five years are going to pass the only

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.569 
five years are going to pass the only
thing<00:02:26.900> that's<00:02:27.530> going<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:27.769> determine<00:02:28.010> where<00:02:28.549> we

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
thing that's going to determine where we

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.610 
thing that's going to determine where we
are<00:02:28.910> five<00:02:29.209> years<00:02:29.450> now<00:02:29.780> is<00:02:29.930> how<00:02:30.139> we<00:02:30.200> choose<00:02:30.560> to

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
are five years now is how we choose to

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.590 
are five years now is how we choose to
spend<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.280> 24<00:02:31.760> hours<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.060> we're<00:02:32.299> given

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
spend the 24 hours that we're given

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.160 
spend the 24 hours that we're given
every<00:02:32.780> single<00:02:33.079> day<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.720> first<00:02:35.959> thing

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
every single day so the the first thing

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.479 
every single day so the the first thing
that<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.350> have<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.530> understand<00:02:37.040> to

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.110 
arbitrary number there's no reason why
we<00:03:50.300> should<00:03:51.300> have<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.540> work<00:03:51.690> 40<00:03:52.080> hours<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.380> week<00:03:52.470> I

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
we should have to work 40 hours a week I

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.220 
we should have to work 40 hours a week I
believe<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.150> page<00:03:54.540> should<00:03:54.720> be<00:03:54.840> based<00:03:55.050> on

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
believe that page should be based on

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.740 
believe that page should be based on
productivity<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:56.160> not<00:03:56.310> time<00:03:56.610> spent<00:03:57.090> but

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
productivity and not time spent but

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.360 
productivity and not time spent but
that's<00:03:58.020> not<00:03:58.260> really<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.650> world<00:03:58.890> that<00:03:59.040> we<00:03:59.160> live

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
that's not really the world that we live

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.540 
that's not really the world that we live
in<00:03:59.430> prostate<00:04:00.120> on<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.980> fact<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.460> matter

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
in prostate on so the fact of the matter

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.400 
in prostate on so the fact of the matter
is<00:04:02.790> that<00:04:02.940> for<00:04:03.480> most<00:04:03.660> people<00:04:03.990> to<00:04:04.020> pay<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.380> bills

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
is that for most people to pay the bills

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.610 
is that for most people to pay the bills
they<00:04:04.830> need<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.070> work<00:04:05.250> for<00:04:05.490> the<00:04:05.610> hour<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.900> so

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
they need to work for the hour and so

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.059 
they need to work for the hour and so
let's<00:04:07.800> factor<00:04:08.010> in<00:04:08.340> that

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
let's factor in that

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.660 
let's factor in that
so<00:04:09.280> we<00:04:09.400> can<00:04:09.579> work<00:04:09.760> hey<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.450> bills<00:04:10.749> and<00:04:11.049> then<00:04:12.040> we

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
so we can work hey the bills and then we

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.280 
so we can work hey the bills and then we
still<00:04:12.879> got<00:04:12.999> to<00:04:13.120> live<00:04:13.239> we<00:04:13.480> got<00:04:13.629> to<00:04:13.719> have<00:04:13.870> fun<00:04:14.079> I

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
still got to live we got to have fun I

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.370 
still got to live we got to have fun I
got<00:04:14.439> enjoy<00:04:14.829> life<00:04:15.069> we<00:04:15.280> got<00:04:15.430> it<00:04:16.079> see<00:04:17.079> beautiful

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
got enjoy life we got it see beautiful

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.560 
got enjoy life we got it see beautiful
places<00:04:17.799> and<00:04:18.459> do<00:04:18.729> all<00:04:18.880> those<00:04:19.090> sorts<00:04:19.419> of<00:04:19.509> things

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
places and do all those sorts of things

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.650 
places and do all those sorts of things
so<00:04:20.440> let's<00:04:20.650> let's<00:04:21.039> give<00:04:21.280> everybody<00:04:21.639> six<00:04:22.539> hours

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
so let's let's give everybody six hours

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.070 
so let's let's give everybody six hours
every<00:04:23.500> single<00:04:23.530> day<00:04:24.039> on<00:04:24.280> average<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:25.720> do
