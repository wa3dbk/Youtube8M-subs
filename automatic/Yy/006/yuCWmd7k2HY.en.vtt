00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.780
 hello everyone and welcome to this 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.270
 special flash we are a few 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.670
 hours of this clasico between the Olympic 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.560
 of marseille and paris saint-germain 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.270
 for the confrere of Provence it is 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.340
 simply boiling for our 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.289
 confreres of the team who is the leader 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.900
 between the Olympic marseille leader and 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.360
 Paris Saint Germain 2nd at 3 points 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.460
 must go back to 1993 to find date 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.790
 of two teams as close to one of 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.530
 the other 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.120
 93 it reminds of hamon memories 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.620
 guest it's eric di meco hi eric a 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.269
 day then Eric there are plenty of questions 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.199
 I have plenty to ask first is 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.239
 quite simply 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.890
 who is favorite of this clasico the Olympic 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.870
 of marseille leader or the paris 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.549
 Saint Germain beat in Porto on Tuesday with 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.809
 champions I believe that paris 

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.159
 Saint Germain remains the favorite of this 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.449
 time meets when we see a small 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.580
 few investments that have been 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.489
 two years ago we have been obliged to 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.059
 to recognize that this team is 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.309
 favored 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.710
 now a little less than what 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.880
 could predict at the beginning of the season 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.070
 the first place of the Olympic 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.630
 marseille especially to tighten a small 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.189
 little difference between the two teams 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.630
 according to me and that we often speak in 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.250
 the classics to the physical impact 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.020
 between these two teams in these 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.610
 matches then we must go back to 2000 already 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.830
 to find a trace of a red card 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.370
 it lÃ© leroy who had been 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.570
 expel 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.010
 what does it mean finally 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.170
 that Paris saint germain today 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.730
 maybe better armed christophe jallet 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.200
 say you have to put it the gifs 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.870
 will put the first tone is given 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.580
 yes I do not think it's less 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.410
 when I say we speak we often speak 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.000
 of the physical impact but I'm talking 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.440
 rather of determination ie the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.630
 determination it is indeed in the east 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.530
 in contacts in the recovery 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.820
 ball in the laundry in the challenge 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.140
 physical as well but it's also in 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 all we do is one year 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.870
 in the offensive phases and 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.520
 the olympique de marseille from the beginning 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.770
 of the season has shown that in those at this 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.380
 level there he also had 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.520
 enough to compete with what surely 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.780
 put the paris saint-germain so 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.700
 determined me I would say rather 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.100
 determination for this match or so he 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.259
 there are keys in this meeting eric la 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.429
 first is the tan ibrahimovic zlatan 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.060
 and who too strong for league 1 this 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.710
 morning he says 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.450
 the number 1 danger for the Olympic 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.670
 marseille just now there we know 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.110
 the quality of this guy we see him since 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.360
 the start of the championship 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.830
 it's a player who has 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.430
 marked the spirits since he is 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.640
 arrived in France 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.959
 now we also know so I know 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.819
 not if it's a legend or not but 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.000
 all the journalists who followed him to 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.739
 through these European vicissitudes say 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.349
 as well as in big matches it's 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.430
 sometimes missing here so I leave the 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.310
 principle that tonight it's a big 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.599
 match we may not see the tan 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.319
 as far as we have seen since the beginning of 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.430
 championship but there is still 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.569
 other arguments in this team 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.069
 then on the Olympic side of 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.150
 marseille do you agree with 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.010
 me if I tell you that it's almost the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.500
 first clasico for andrÃ© pierre gignac 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.120
 with the olympique de marseille him who has 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.489
 been often hurt and often on the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.349
 bench we can even say that this is the 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:57.950
 first season of dd who returned 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:01.799
 in this championship thoroughly I admit that 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.690
 physically technically and even in 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.220
 his state of mind when he was not 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.000
 in success try to try 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.530
 things of the times they were at 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.389
 against the game while now 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.489
 it is completely in the sense of the game 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.290
 he scores goals that's important for 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.239
 him but above all he also makes his 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.190
 partners and that's still a 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.970
 positive point this is it's a real 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.299
 good news for the Olympic 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.010
 marseille 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.850
 this question for you eric but 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.859
 first we will see the 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.299
 temperature with our supporters they 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.239
 will be forty thousand just now 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.190
 behind me to play their 12th role 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.139
 man stopped to take the temperature this 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.540
 morning with these pictures signed jonathan 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:37.470
 bartolozzi this clasico and it'll be a 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.359
 really match a crazy thing because 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.540
 that night it's going to be full we're expecting 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.959
 to a match while playing football at very 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.459
 difficult they have talent in passion 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.310
 now I do not know that 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.200
 compete complicated match 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.519
 it's been three years since the psg clean one 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.319
 point to marseille I think we're going 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.859
 continue the good series tonight it will be 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.069
 a tight match 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.750
 they financed this year on big 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.910
 players we will show them that with a 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.320
 small budget that with rabies march and 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.000
 is what can win I know 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.239
 marks which is played with heart and 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.769
 I know and will do everything to deliver a 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.310
 pretty interesting match in front of their 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.680
 public 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.930
 this year they are jealous there a 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.859
 statement I will not say shocked 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.190
 but that's what set fire to 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.079
 powders 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.880
 it's part of the magic it's 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.740
 his classics shows also knows 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.389
 if it's a gentleman max we get bored 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.590
 so it takes a little bit of impact 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.720
 must it fit a little bit but 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.160
 here it stays clean when 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.180
 even now here that come 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.440
 to be egypt there is no problem I 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.970
 will say years I think it will be 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.229
 welcome jitter that will put their 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.940
 is that we do not need 300 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.220
 million euros of budget to run 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.460
 on a lot we just have the pride of 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.169
 club 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.759
 that year he wins then put a 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.009
 baffe right on the left ie 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.780
 going to put their foot in their ass I think 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.310
 that a kudu is going to be a name this 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.720
 evening i think if brasles knew 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.820
 I do not think that at the end of the match was 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.100
 nicholas to him will say something being 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.530
 given the Parisian workforce we are going 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.570
 near maintained one of the water pack me I 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.560
 see good bourgeois from the roof of 1 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:04.620
 I would say 3 2 for the om goal of gignac 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.330
 goals of rÃ©my and ayew andrÃ© ayew ne 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.470
 let's not be too greedy I think 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.220
 if we could leave after this match in 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.390
 a defeat we will always be first 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.830
 if they want the first cold well 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.780
 win at home then we hear the 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.400
 rather cautious supporters before this 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.130
 clasico does not fall into the panel of 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.780
 statements of christophe jallet is this 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.190
 we can talk about first tests eric 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.510
 for the Olympique de Marseille bad 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.770
 languages ââsay that this is the first 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.740
 once you meet a top team 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.840
 10 the schedule was done so may 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.970
 we have seen the previous seasons that 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.130
 it was never easy to win 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.569
 against small teams and especially 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.610
 last year where we still have a lot 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.979
 suffered here in Marseille in his 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.180
 confrontations 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.120
 it is clear that everyone is waiting 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.530
 this this confrontation for for himself 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.349
 gauge but the paris Saint-Germain also 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.490
 the paris saint germain comes tonight at 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:53.259
 velodrome stage with some certainty 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.130
 many qualities but also some 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.090
 handles interrogations like 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.340
 the Olympique de marseille I think it 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.630
 is going to be a rich match of lessons 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.220
 for both teams so maybe 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.380
 also the cotyle not on the side of paris 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.419
 holy germain the defeat to porto on 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.590
 talk a lot about zlatan turtur 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.900
 now for our confreres 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.520
 sports bit le paris saint-germain 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.199
 what danger ultimately for the Olympic 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.349
 de marseille which player to watch 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:16.750
 other than zlatan ibrahimovic it's clear 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.490
 that I find that lead from the beginning 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.830
 of the season that revolves around 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.150
 zlatan since some characters that 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.639
 is able to come for the 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.949
 balloons in the heart of the game was 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:29.080
 interesting in this in that role and 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:30.520
 and we know it's a boy who can 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.050
 disappear from the match but who can 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.479
 an acceleration to pose problems 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.040
 pastore who seems to be coming back I 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.650
