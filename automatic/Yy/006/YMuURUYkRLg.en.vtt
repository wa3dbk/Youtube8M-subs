 This theme will be released this spring 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.470
 Donpepe Well I do not have a label that still 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.390

 Room forecast than usual 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.910
 And that 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.670
 Still 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.159
 It's still so cheap 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.159
 I have the price well 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.450
 At 100 meters with 0.65 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.450
 Price 2,600 yen 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:24.620
 It is a price that I can not think for a while 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.770
 Well So nice thing about that child 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:32.080
 Type often Hyammata how ingredients of 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.080
 I would like to have a look after talking a little 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.720
 First from the rice store 45 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.700
 Up to 35 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.030
 There is each lineup 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.940
 100 meters of autumn 150m winding 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.780
 200m winding 300m volume 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:56.540
 You can choose too much 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:59.270
 This is not labeled yet, but the label is 100m green 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.920
 150m winding is red 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.340
 200 meter volume 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.740
 3 Pee meter Maki 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.740
 It is from money to money 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.990
 Using this, this time d Puting 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.020
 also doing t pay the beginning you have a kite 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.370
 There is no first time No tomorrow 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.080
 I 'm riding, but specifically that 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.680
 Well many are deep fishing but 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.410
 It is easier than a Ting to do from Sign Language 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.659
 that 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:40.890
 Of course if you stick to it, of course it's deep but basics take it first 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.210
 In To First I several times Shakti 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.630
 By itself 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.720
 It is easy once you know the basics of Tsumagoi 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.450
 Oh point or something 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.540
 Leave the captain 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:59.349
 It will be taken to the place where the captain can fish, that angler will be told and people will already do it 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.519
 The coat is tightly wrapped 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.519
 In terms of theory 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.360
 First of all 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:15.220
 Calm the Egi from the ship 's 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:19.240
 I think there is an appeal to whether you hit a few or one length 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.230
 When I stop and wait, the ship will flow that tide 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.340
 Because it flows slowly 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.640
 You will be trolling after you move it 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.260
 This is the timing to add 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.069
 In fluoride per out on this at tip 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.830
 Per 6 to say that much lift from the bottom 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.170
 Is 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:44.540
 Per suppress the earlier and the first to pull 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.990
 When you look at it going to fit in a positive 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.850
 Only this 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.850
 Seems to say hello 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:05.530
 Well, um says seedlings Toka various actions it here but the basic is it 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:05.530
 After that, depending on the captain, it is to use the suspension this time 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:14.230
 I introduced in a few minutes ago Donpepe a this 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.600
 Color is divided into 5 colors by 10 meters 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.130
 From it I Well 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:26.430
 I do not know the water presentation when attacking 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:32.790
 Generally it is common to listen to growth and have them look for fish, but to some extent 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:34.790
 5 colors of color by this 10 meter that I want to grasp angler anxious 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.120
 I will 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.620
 Oh dear 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:43.880
 First went to'm Ito from So Tsu This sounds wo 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.880
 If blue comes out 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:52.110
 Well points from 40 meters to 50m 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:56.430
 Why um I buy only this 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:05:02.220
 I think that the promotion of the place where I 'm doing ya can understand strangely 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:06.770
 In and say whether it is what important that you know that you know this 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:12.369
 It is a unit and that captain will run to you 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:19.390
 8 points after writing or something like that fish's favorite point 

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:21.590
 To put in will continue to flow just begun that tree, even 50 meter line 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.790
 The place where you can fish is 30 meters 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:30.760
 If there was a dark blue when the ship flowed 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:33.910
 Suddenly it is morning or angler horn feels it positively 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:39.390
 Oh now tool point to feel 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.390
 So concentrate It is it that the most important 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.830
 Well if only I know 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.330
 it's simple 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:52.310
 Government solder that would let the other captain also after 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.310
 I have something I want to hear 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:01.990
 What does not contain anything good in orange Power Pro Yellow Green 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:05.000
 One by this that 1 meter 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.889
 Well I will try this out once 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.470
 is 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:14.880
 Where is the first meter? 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:18.260
 All this is about 1 meter headache 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:22.510
 But I think that it is not a little visible in the camera around a little this 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:24.280
 White mark is included This is 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.000
 Two meters 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.000
 To meter 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.770
 3m 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.790
 4 meters now 2 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:40.280
 I will 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:42.620
 5m only five meters at the Anokokkara 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.780
 Black and white 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:50.729
 Contains the mark 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:55.849
 It is the effect that the middle of in this is well 10m 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:58.809
 Nai' of white to each other all 1 meter 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.809
 Contains
