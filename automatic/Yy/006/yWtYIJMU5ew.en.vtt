00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
here we are in split screen it literally

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.459 
here we are in split screen it literally
wouldn't<00:01:00.149> work<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.020> Joey

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
wouldn't work and as you can see Joey

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.280

really<00:01:01.710> isn't<00:01:02.280> here<00:01:02.489> my<00:01:02.640> uncle<00:01:02.910> um<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.629> all

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
really isn't here my uncle um so all

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.440 
really isn't here my uncle um so all
that<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.100> from<00:01:05.580> spawn<00:01:05.909> over

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
that you have to do is from spawn over

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.370 
that you have to do is from spawn over
here<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:07.320> go<00:01:07.619> over<00:01:07.920> here<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:09.229> here's<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
here just go over here and here's the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.210 
here just go over here and here's the
new<00:01:10.500> parking<00:01:10.830> tombstone<00:01:11.640> cost<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.750> 2000<00:01:13.560> my

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
new parking tombstone cost is 2000 my

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.890 
new parking tombstone cost is 2000 my
guess<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.500> either<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:17.659> makes<00:01:18.659> you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
guess is that it either like makes you

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.710 
guess is that it either like makes you
spawn<00:01:19.170> well<00:01:20.040> since<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.909> tube<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.270> maybe<00:01:21.540> you

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
spawn well since is it tube so maybe you

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.820 
spawn well since is it tube so maybe you
spawn<00:01:22.080> wherever<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.159> die<00:01:23.369> or<00:01:23.400> something<00:01:23.790> and

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
spawn wherever you die or something and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.819 
spawn wherever you die or something and
or<00:01:25.830> maybe<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:27.390> helps<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.900> walk<00:01:28.290> across<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
or maybe it helps you walk across the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.749 
or maybe it helps you walk across the
fire<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.930> get<00:01:31.590> enough<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.610> get

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
fire so I'm going to get enough to get

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.109 
fire so I'm going to get enough to get
this<00:01:32.909> perk<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.979> I'll<00:01:34.979> show<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.430> what<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.909> does

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
this perk and I'll show you what it does

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.630

00:03:59.219 --> 00:03:59.229 
only playing with like two controllers

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:04.140 
only playing with like two controllers
and<00:03:59.979> just<00:04:00.669> one<00:04:00.849> person<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:01.750> uh<00:04:02.260> Joey<00:04:02.919> or<00:04:03.310> the

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
died so that's exactly why I didn't work

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.969 
died so that's exactly why I didn't work
is<00:04:09.129> because<00:04:09.579> um<00:04:09.970> my<00:04:10.810> fellow<00:04:11.319> teammates

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:11.979

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
already died and then it says during

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.469 
already died and then it says during
this<00:04:14.889> moment<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.579> character<00:04:16.000> will<00:04:16.239> have<00:04:16.449> a

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
this moment the character will have a

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.689 
this moment the character will have a
chance<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.930> return<00:04:17.199> and<00:04:17.739> interact<00:04:18.220> with<00:04:18.489> a

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
chance to return and interact with a

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.210 
chance to return and interact with a
floating<00:04:19.090> tombstone<00:04:19.599> so<00:04:20.199> in<00:04:20.739> other<00:04:20.949> words

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
floating tombstone so in other words

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.189 
floating tombstone so in other words
that<00:04:21.489> means<00:04:21.729> that<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.270> basically<00:04:22.570> just<00:04:22.870> get

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
that means that you basically just get

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.070 
that means that you basically just get
like<00:04:23.320> revived<00:04:23.860> as<00:04:24.240> soon<00:04:25.240> as<00:04:25.419> the<00:04:25.539> round<00:04:25.750> starts

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
like revived as soon as the round starts

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.680 
like revived as soon as the round starts
like<00:04:26.199> you<00:04:26.320> usually<00:04:26.560> do<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.210> then<00:04:28.210> it<00:04:28.389> then<00:04:28.630> it

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
like you usually do and then it then it

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.200 
like you usually do and then it then it
goes<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:28.930> say<00:04:29.229> by<00:04:29.919> interacting<00:04:30.729> with<00:04:30.909> it<00:04:31.030> the

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
goes to say by interacting with it the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.120 
goes to say by interacting with it the
player<00:04:31.449> will<00:04:31.690> be<00:04:31.720> able<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:32.139> resurrect<00:04:32.620> from

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
player will be able to resurrect from
