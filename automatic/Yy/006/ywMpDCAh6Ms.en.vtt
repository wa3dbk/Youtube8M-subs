the oil there are several tips that
we'll<00:00:25.179> go<00:00:25.330> through<00:00:25.570> but<00:00:25.720> we're<00:00:25.900> going<00:00:26.050> to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
we'll go through but we're going to

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.380 
we'll go through but we're going to
start<00:00:26.560> with<00:00:27.039> simply<00:00:27.429> how<00:00:27.609> often<00:00:27.939> do<00:00:28.029> we<00:00:28.089> check

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
start with simply how often do we check

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.810 
start with simply how often do we check
the<00:00:28.599> oil<00:00:28.630> in<00:00:28.960> the<00:00:29.079> engine<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:30.369> engine<00:00:30.699> oil

the oil in the engine the engine oil

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.460 
the oil in the engine the engine oil
should<00:00:31.060> be<00:00:31.179> checked<00:00:31.480> at<00:00:31.660> least<00:00:31.689> once<00:00:32.290> a<00:00:32.439> month

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
should be checked at least once a month

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.650 
should be checked at least once a month
and<00:00:32.890> this<00:00:33.340> is<00:00:33.490> done<00:00:33.640> by<00:00:33.670> popping<00:00:34.180> the<00:00:34.270> hood<00:00:34.300> and

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
and this is done by popping the hood and

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.370 
and this is done by popping the hood and
pulling<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:35.320> oil<00:00:35.470> dipstick<00:00:35.770> out<00:00:36.160> cleaning<00:00:37.150> it

removing it and reading the level it's

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.980 
removing it and reading the level it's
really<00:00:42.340> not<00:00:42.430> very<00:00:42.670> complicated<00:00:43.090> and<00:00:43.510> if<00:00:43.870> you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
really not very complicated and if you

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
last few years it was once common to

last few years it was once common to
change<00:00:57.340> our<00:00:57.490> oil<00:00:57.670> every<00:00:57.970> 3,000<00:00:58.690> miles<00:00:58.840> but

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
change our oil every 3,000 miles but

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.020 
change our oil every 3,000 miles but
modern<00:00:59.830> engines<00:01:00.160> have<00:01:00.310> recommended<00:01:00.640> change

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
modern engines have recommended change

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.740 
modern engines have recommended change
intervals<00:01:01.450> that<00:01:01.630> go<00:01:01.750> anywhere<00:01:02.050> from<00:01:02.200> 5,000<00:01:03.130> to

7500 miles or maybe even more in fact

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.359 
7500 miles or maybe even more in fact
some<00:01:07.689> engines<00:01:08.020> today<00:01:08.229> don't<00:01:08.890> even<00:01:09.009> make

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
some engines today don't even make

some engines today don't even make
recommendations<00:01:10.150> based<00:01:10.329> on<00:01:10.600> mileage<00:01:10.869> but

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
recommendations based on mileage but

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:13.529 
recommendations based on mileage but
rather<00:01:11.679> use<00:01:12.009> engine<00:01:12.399> computers<00:01:12.939> to<00:01:13.090> determine

life<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:20.229> now<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.439> we<00:01:20.649> know<00:01:20.679> how<00:01:20.979> often<00:01:21.189> to

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
life so now that we know how often to

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.039 
life so now that we know how often to
check<00:01:21.609> and<00:01:21.850> change<00:01:21.999> our<00:01:22.240> oil<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.689> next<00:01:22.929> thing

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
check and change our oil the next thing

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.749 
check and change our oil the next thing
to<00:01:23.140> consider<00:01:23.200> is<00:01:23.679> what<00:01:23.979> oil<00:01:24.189> we're<00:01:24.490> going<00:01:24.670> to

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
to consider is what oil we're going to

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.730 
to consider is what oil we're going to
use<00:01:24.969> when<00:01:25.210> we<00:01:25.329> do<00:01:25.479> change<00:01:25.840> it<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:26.499> there<00:01:26.619> are<00:01:26.679> a

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
use when we do change it and there are a

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.380 
use when we do change it and there are a
number<00:01:26.890> of<00:01:27.039> things<00:01:27.219> to<00:01:27.399> consider<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:28.060> the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
number of things to consider and the

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.539 
number of things to consider and the
first<00:01:28.630> is<00:01:28.810> going<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.079> be<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.350> oil<00:01:29.530> weight<00:01:29.859> this

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
first is going to be the oil weight this

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.249 
first is going to be the oil weight this
is<00:01:30.700> usually<00:01:30.880> represented<00:01:31.240> by<00:01:31.719> two<00:01:31.869> numbers

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
is usually represented by two numbers

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.819 
is usually represented by two numbers

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
that's too heavy can reduce your fuel

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.599 
that's too heavy can reduce your fuel

the<00:01:55.450> next<00:01:55.749> thing<00:01:55.899> to<00:01:56.020> consider<00:01:56.079> is<00:01:56.619> its

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
the next thing to consider is its

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.459 
the next thing to consider is its
classification<00:01:57.670> or<00:01:58.149> certification<00:01:59.020> now

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
classification or certification now

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.039 
classification or certification now
typically<00:01:59.889> this<00:02:00.429> is<00:02:00.609> represented<00:02:01.209> by<00:02:01.240> an<00:02:01.539> API

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049
