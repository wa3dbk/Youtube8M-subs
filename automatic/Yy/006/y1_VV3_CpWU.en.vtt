00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 Hello everyone, welcome this 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.830
 new episode of minecraft mod 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.569
 today we will talk about a half day 1 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.550
 point 7.10 very interesting a lot 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.410
 simple the way we have to talk today 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.300
 it's called eni dimension kids 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.250
 dimension is a fashion that goes to 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.719
 really add so many dimensions to 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.420
 different types of different subjects a 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.430
 depending on the frame material of the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.750
 boys portal in fact the fashion is a lot 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.460
 simple to use will suffice 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.869
 use a specific material for 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.119
 create the frame equal to that of 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.220
 never and turn it on with an in iter 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.140
 specific and not normal intestinal stroke 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.669
 then the procedure as is done in this 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.969
 in case we have the diamond one and the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.370
 size of kilns then boys 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.250
 demant in amon process of meter steak 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.559
 and her for fake steel and a block of 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.239
 diamond in this case will change for him 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.809
 in fact only the material for ovens 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.399
 sini the end Erpen stick style and fake 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.199
 this time they provided kids 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.449
 so you can find them in the section 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.160
 tools in creative if you are in creative 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.050
 then I warn you never go in 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.370
 size of this or in size 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.620
 like that of the furnace if you have 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.239
 weak computer because the winch melaka 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.060
 a figure inside this because that's enough 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.439
 that a furnace is activated by itself and the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.970
 lava that for upside-down does 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.189
 turn on the nt because in each 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.350
 size find a small bouquet a 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.189
 small bush of tnt that can 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.470
 to blow up 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.509
 then let's go for a moment that the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.610
 tender a figure but then I will succeed in water 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.560
 more or less the size is 16 this 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.000
 is an example of that of furnaces that 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.340
 the more it will load the more it will start 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.750
 explode so guys in a little lager 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.229
 or so much that it is better that I go out 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.570
 me too 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.610
 see how this is generated 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.159
 furnaces with small dmt buds 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.020
 around the world and beautiful 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.060
 fortress of never 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.530
 so I go out of here to read it 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.869
 too much and I go into the diamond ones that 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.909
 much more p then guys here are the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.340
 diamond size go 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.140
 ok you can see diamond everywhere 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.140
 Diamond blocks everywhere you look 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.149
 as luminous in here and so many of nt 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.770
 always buds around tnt that 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.939
 They may explode but there is lava 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.549
 so you did n't have to go on for 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.479
 luck because there's water here and more 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.790
 we can always find ours 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.320
 strongholds of never and so many why 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.469
 of diamond that is this is the size 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.170
 it gives us great and that is absurd 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.730
 as you can see there are several 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.250
 size you will find the list both in 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.530
 description that is in the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.030
 that I will put them in the fashion download 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.550
 the creator said and requested 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.260
 specifically requested if they come 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.450
 recommended new sizes 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.580
 so he adds them and creates portals 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.910
 so let's remember guys 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.830
 always pay attention to the worlds 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.000
 just made of tnt don't do them but 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.280
 rekindle because they make you grow 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.870
 the package goes on forever so then not 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.120
 I recover you more boys I warn you 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.160
 right away and be careful if you have computers 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.590
 weak in the world of books then in the 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.140
 bush world guys why 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.270

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.500
 ok guys this was today's fashion ha 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.209

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.880
 several dimensions less shown a 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.440
 pair and leave you the surprise to see 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.660

 try it on you guys too 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.950
 always gives the opportunity to leave 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.110
 haggard let it die to tell me if it is 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.310
