00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Czech people and a beautiful 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.069
 We are back with another episode 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.469
 by replay of the week today with the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.330
 winner in the category heavy tanks 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.600
 and you have to say that actually 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:22.140
 It must be clan to face 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.250
 We come in as I always watch me 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:31.320
 with you for the first time 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:36.149
 and we have a lot of fun here 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.960
 exactly like alex quad in it and 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.980
 alex quattro one from to the other 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.340
 from two face the far no idea what 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.890
 but we'll see 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:56.129
 257 heavy and 14 and top animal 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:01.199
 hardcore top animal but also in the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.629
 opposing team we see with saw 314 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.170
 heavies which are quite the difference 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.030
 can do and it almost threatens to drive 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.490
 with his t 57 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.240
 direction mountain together with his 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.259
 Colleagues leonard and where is the is4 of 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.140
 good the is4 is in the middle on d 6 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.130
 and the fv press there because directly 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.229
 How amazing is that 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.210
 I think that's really cool what it is 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.619
 woe guys do not make the torches 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.990
 long ones say we are three 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.210
 we are top animal we are 14 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.880
 we push by and nothing stops us 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.500
 It looks the same now and in the near future 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:44.710
 as if she noticed absolutely nothing 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.550
 well pushed so far and the alex 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.740
 kva in it 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.210
 he has to see that he is there 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.700
 somehow it helps but he may of course 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.500
 also not very pure he is doing very 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.500
 good as I see drives direction cap 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.840
 back that it's the safe way and here 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.140
 decides on the mountain meanwhile 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.210
 to be together with leonard 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.910
 to go back to the order 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:12.489
 Press more and more through 04 already 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:19.480
 pennergame he will be nice 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:22.030
 cursed but bright as the know 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.170
 we all of them can eat properly 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.760
 but it is so much that stands for 04 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.329
 The state can not do worse 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.150
 run more 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:34.019
 there comes the first fv and there is directly 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.670
 times with car in the side geballert 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.400
 but does not get him out unfortunately 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.109
 also flared nicely and he has cap he 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.920
 did not have an automatic fire extinguisher 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:48.910
 at just the normal fire extinguisher that 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.550
 can already taste good 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.030
 they are clean and clean 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.350
 times two turned off 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.440
 and unfortunately it is still 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.360
 opposing fv platoon completely there and 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.190
 there comes one or two and academic 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:09.010
 grade reloaded tracking now nice 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.020
 He tended it out and back in 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.330
 reload go very well here 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.330
 well done the s8 comes a bit too 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.890
 It does not get much to six late 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.230
 the score and all four keels too 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:27.220
 go on the plateau number 157 heavy 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:32.800
 that is so blatant bbm autoloader me 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.510
 had you never said yes 528 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.870
 the score was all five kids from 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:44.230
 platoon two face and how is this here 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:46.990
 turn completely on the wheel but 2nd 57h 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.750
 vivendi eight bullets squeeze out what 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:54.880
 do you want to do what you want there too 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.110
 as well as where do you go or 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.540
 sti 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.160
 or is here was once was was 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.840
 first shot went next second shot 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.990
 meets tracking boy tracking tracking 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.620
 But tracking is not a shame 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.090
 get there coming from the right and 28 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.320
 prototype but this is a lot yes 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.480
 also there 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.720
 here is a lot of things still playing there 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.640
 also with each reload ok very 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.760
 interesting that there is the pilot 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.350
 indicating in 14 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.660
 I do not know that personally yet 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.600
 and the wild hatz goes on with the 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.430
 guys from two face that's so blatant 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.810
 just race through here and get yourself 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.570
 a man out there comes from now 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.430
 back and get the more again 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.840
 just get him out he can not do anything 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.450
 against it do the opponent 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.210
 he plays so strong comes from behind 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.730
 directly with auto aim first in the side 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.740
 the fv has no armor there 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.560
 you do not need to practice big and then 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.830
 Continue on red redmond from the new 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.669
 founded little boys from badaboom 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.080
 the sina funny it at the same time me 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.060
 not seen album is indeed synonymous 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.750
 operationally 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:07.169
 the mx 50 100 hello sina was there well 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.970
 asked not shoved where three shot 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.970
 still deep in 50 01 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:19.200
 i'm 57 harry i'm doing everything 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.680
 out what's going on he still has a shot 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.020
 in it 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.790
 10 12 of the game was the here is much 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.600
 pressure on the back of the metal 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:30.120
 and the cardon late in the middle lane 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.560
 here and look that has the two 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.690
 mates staying and which are in one 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.910
 both of them did not shoot me 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.100
 deep 50 and 1 needs 2 but he has 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.830
 1800 hp I would be easy now 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.320
 to roll in just like that on there until 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.850
 centurion then snap the murder 1 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.850
 and then it works 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.880
 that's what you want to do yes what 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.370
 do you want to do what you want 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.340
 however, as the main goal but level eighth 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.620
 medium 11 kills meanwhile on the clock 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.300
 and only the three alive that was 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.160
 just the twelfth so critical 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:17.500
 post is safe and only 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:19.630
 24 more against the whole lot or come to 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.050
 face and beast and just have a look 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:26.140
 completely cleared out yes he starts again 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.050
 the bullet from the artillery catch me if 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:35.710
 you can 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:37.360
 13 land at 14 out of 15 14 out of 15 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.190
 do you want to fool me? 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.070
 I think I do not have that yet 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.540
 seen the only children of the t30 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.150
 made us have him complete 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:50.140
 threesome the whole against rische team 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.420
 disassembled just disassembled that is so 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:55.180

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:59.410

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:02.890
 so my dear was there very seriously 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:06.790
 This was a blatant thing 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:09.610
 fought by the guys of two face and 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:12.430
 some have even cleared all 14 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.290
 of 15 kids steel wall was on top 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.000

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.630
 you do not count anymore 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.400
 has been 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.930
 but although you can not do it, I have 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.490
 once made for you and times looked

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:33.160
 damage the rest of the team overall 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:36.550
