00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.740
 almonds 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.589
 it is a Moroccan pastry of form 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.749
 triangular made of leaves of 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.929
 brick hiding inside a 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:20.869
 flavored almond preparation 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:24.560
 cinnamon gum arabic and flower 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.599
 orange it's briouates are great 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.640
 crispness on the outside and soft to 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.220
 interior 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:35.170
 I hope the steps makes itself clear and 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.170
 If you have any questions do not hesitate 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.250
 for bredoises we need yes 100 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.250
 grams of blanched almonds 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.329
 250 g of sugar 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.730
 a teaspoon of cinnamon half a 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:01:01.030
 teaspoon of gum arabic words 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:04.059
 between 150 and 200 g of melted butter 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.700
 the amount of melted butter will depend on the 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.399
 fines use certain varieties 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.430
 requires more butter than others 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:15.790
 so add you as you go and 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:22.030
 you check the texture 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.030
 an egg yolk leaves brick 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:30.300
 half an atheist glass or the equivalent of 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.300
 40 thousand liters of orange blossom water 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:44.490
 I mix the almonds with the sugar is 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:48.530
 jelly mix that's my mix to world and 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.720
 sugar after mixing I will add 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:02:00.300
 the rest of the ingredients there I add 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:02.480
 gum arabic cinnamon yellow 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.480
 egg 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.840
 orange blossom water 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.510
 I gradually add my butter 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.930
 molten 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.750
 we mix years I also check the 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.920
 texture of the dough 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.860
 so for now, you never have to 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.370
 master at once so you have to go 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.370
 gradually 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.910
 that's the texture that 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.510
 the marzipan after having it well 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.220
 worked so she is malleable 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.840
 later I'll start 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.840
 make small balls 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.069
 here I finished burning the whole 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.120
 amount of marzipan I had 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.730
 with the quantity that I propose to you 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.939
 you can have a hundred prices 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.939
 watt 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.980
 I superimposed my brick sheets 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.319
 so I'm going to fold them in half and I 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:27.099
 am going to cut in half so you can 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.099
 use either scissors or a hillside 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:38.709
 and I cut 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.390
 then every three part actually 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.519
 the ends they will not serve me 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.629
 because they are going to be too small for 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.629
 make wheelbarrows 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.099
 I cover them 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.170
 plastic film and I go out as and 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.849
 as it does not dry 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.080
 I take a sliver of leaves 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.080
 brig that I have is cut 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.480
 and I take a ball of marzipan 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:22.590
 that I will place this way I 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:29.880
 start the first mans fold I do the 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:35.790
 second fold to form the triangle and 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:40.370
 I continue to bend my triangle game 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.370
 cooper the end 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.460
 I build young a little bit of mixture 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.910
 of water and flour to stick and I 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.550
 stuck up 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.970
 this piece of brick sheet to 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.450
 inside and I continue like that with 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.450
 the whole quantity 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.840
 so when I finish the amount of 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:20.600
 briouates that I have to do I'm going 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:25.730
 start frying we start the 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:27.970
 frying in a mine at 180 degrees 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.970
 near 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.040
 teum everywhere brakes a beautiful color 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.840
 golden I remove them 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.530
 tomorrow frying bath to soak them 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.530
 in honey 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:03.129
 and I leave them well in mine a 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.129
 ten minutes 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.710
 I have drops but briouates thereafter 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.539
 and I let them cool before 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.250
 tasting 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:17.629
 I tell you this is petty and to very 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.629
 soon to innovate greediness
