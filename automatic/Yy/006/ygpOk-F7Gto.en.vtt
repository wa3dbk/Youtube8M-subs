you are on ipod touch 2g and see models
are<00:01:33.120> um<00:01:35.430> currently<00:01:36.430> don't<00:01:36.670> work<00:01:36.880> for<00:01:37.780> this

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
are um currently don't work for this

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
are um currently don't work for this
jailbreak<00:01:40.050> are<00:01:41.050> not<00:01:41.230> supported<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:42.220> once<00:01:42.820> the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
jailbreak are not supported so once the

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.470 
jailbreak are not supported so once the
ipsw<00:01:44.050> is<00:01:44.200> successfully<00:01:44.770> identify<00:01:45.340> click<00:01:45.910> Next

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
ipsw is successfully identify click Next

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.560 
ipsw is successfully identify click Next
and<00:01:46.750> lent<00:01:47.080> them<00:01:47.800> pilot<00:01:48.520> process<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.210> colonel

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
and lent them pilot process the colonel

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:58.440 
and lent them pilot process the colonel
and<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.930> i<00:01:55.960> will<00:01:56.320> just<00:01:56.730> install<00:01:57.730> cydia<00:01:58.180> on<00:01:58.210> this

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
and so i will just install cydia on this

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.180 
and so i will just install cydia on this
the<00:01:58.630> first<00:01:58.870> time<00:01:59.080> I'm<00:01:59.290> doing<00:01:59.500> this<00:01:59.740> some<00:02:00.010> way

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
the first time I'm doing this some way

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.850 
the first time I'm doing this some way
up<00:02:00.370> on<00:02:00.610> touch<00:02:00.870> just<00:02:01.870> remember<00:02:02.350> this<00:02:02.470> works<00:02:02.740> for

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
up on touch just remember this works for

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.940 
up on touch just remember this works for
all<00:02:03.040> I<00:02:03.070> devices<00:02:06.480> so<00:02:07.480> now<00:02:07.660> it<00:02:07.810> tells<00:02:07.990> me<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.560> turn

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
all I devices so now it tells me to turn

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.320 
all I devices so now it tells me to turn
off<00:02:09.160> my<00:02:09.190> idevice<00:02:10.980> so<00:02:11.980> I'm<00:02:12.370> going<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.790> turn<00:02:13.599> off

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
off my idevice so I'm going to turn off

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.460 
off my idevice so I'm going to turn off
when<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.510> device

so on the next step I'm just going to
show<00:02:25.820> you<00:02:26.000> how<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:30.500> go<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.740> dfu<00:02:31.400> mode<00:02:31.430> after<00:02:31.850> I

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
show you how to go to dfu mode after I

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.930 
show you how to go to dfu mode after I
click<00:02:32.270> Next<00:02:32.740> so<00:02:33.740> for<00:02:33.950> three<00:02:34.190> seconds<00:02:34.640> hold

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940

button<00:02:50.830> down<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:53.020> your<00:02:54.020> iDevice<00:02:54.500> should<00:02:54.770> go

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
button down and your iDevice should go

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:05.630 
button down and your iDevice should go
into<00:02:55.220> DFU<00:02:55.820> mode

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.699 

basically<00:03:06.640> your<00:03:07.230> iDevice<00:03:08.230> should<00:03:08.500> look<00:03:08.680> like

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
basically your iDevice should look like

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:16.770 
basically your iDevice should look like
this<00:03:11.610> while<00:03:12.610> redsnow<00:03:13.090> does<00:03:13.450> its<00:03:13.630> thing<00:03:15.780> so

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
this while redsnow does its thing so

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.480 
this while redsnow does its thing so
