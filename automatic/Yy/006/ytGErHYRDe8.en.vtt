00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.219
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.929
 room 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.929
 I thought I 'm making my little vum 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.859
 tour because I wanted you my 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.060
 Show and show small cool room 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.230
 That's why I would say we catch 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.090
 now maybe a big one 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.849
 desk how to easily recognize 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.320
 can 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.289
 and you can already see the first one 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.370
 small feature that I have in my room 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.780
 have that is this monitor wall mount 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:44.100
 the iss attached and that has the purpose 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.570
 that you have the monitor completely gone 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.120
 so it looks like from the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.739
 it then here completely folded away it 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.180
 just has the purpose that I at 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.789
 school assignments the full 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.890
 If you have desk available 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.620
 on keyboard mouse also still puts away 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.859
 then just the whole place more 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.780
 free 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.619
 behind you can now see the monitor 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.790
 connections and the attachment up here 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.500
 is still a small hd logitech webcam 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.869
 and there you can see your cable guides 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.280
 linked to my description and 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.460
 You can see my little sat here 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.030
 receiver as below operation still umgelegt 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.450
 and now I can indeed lake 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.509
 then look down here you can see one 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.150
 electric heating control it too 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.780
 very practical then of course here 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.180

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.960

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.130
 this green power strip to the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.869
 wall is screwed so I can mine 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.220
 complete hardware as my computer 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.329
 a monitor and everything else pretty much 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.240
 turn off at night because I too 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.390
 no desire that it shines and continues 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.659
 is it then here 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.060
 that can be part of my writing table 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.979
 And that is this switch panel that is 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.979
 a self-made switch panel 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:19.330
 carboxylic optics to that of the start button for 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:21.330
