should be coming and not take the actual
google<00:03:37.500> map<00:03:37.650> route<00:03:38.030> because<00:03:39.030> i<00:03:39.120> think<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.390> is

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
google map route because i think this is

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.060 
google map route because i think this is
shorter<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.260> just<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.650> know<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.770> can<00:03:40.950> just

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
shorter so I just you know I can just

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.250 
shorter so I just you know I can just
make<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.490> for<00:03:41.670> him<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.030> send<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.750> across<00:03:42.840> and

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
make it for him and send it across and

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.020 
make it for him and send it across and
of<00:03:43.650> course<00:03:43.830> i<00:03:43.890> can<00:03:44.040> write<00:03:44.220> my<00:03:44.400> own<00:03:44.550> notes<00:03:44.790> or
