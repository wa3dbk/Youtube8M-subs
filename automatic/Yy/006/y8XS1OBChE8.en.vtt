00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.589
 wetzlar 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.759
 stand and outweigh 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.390
 presented by kinopolis pour 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.970
 before the home game against gain comes 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.340
 the magic word reparation in space 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.700
 the hsg so far with two defeats 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.320
 against the newcomers in league and cup 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.120
 to the weak performance of the past 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.160
 weekend in bezigheim 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.989
 the signs were from central Hesse 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.850
 so watch the engines of both 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.110
 At first, however, teams only came 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.690
 stuttering in gear 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.640
 But then the Wetzlarer took over 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.760
 scepter ivano balic grabs the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.880
 ball and manas buy in the counter to 5 2 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:59.860
 1 after eight minutes so the first 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.870
 Four-door tour of the HSG 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.360
 protégés kai wandschneider bite 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.890
 especially at the guestkeeper's teeth 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.190
 out in the following 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.369
 quarter of an hour, the hsg came only to three 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.800
 meet and thereby gain back into 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:20.470
 The distance was suddenly bavaria 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.740
 with 7 to 8 air to breathe 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.930
 then procures that just 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.909
 birthday boy on the day of his 25th 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.250
 birthday to steffen fäth with 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.420
 his hits the best phase of the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.700
 host 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.250
 until half past time the green whites swept 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.210
 again and again over the guests of the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.280
 pay a clear 16 11 guide to the break 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.799
 the interim conclusion accordingly 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.580
 positive 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.670
 in the first half we have 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.110
 played very well good defense good 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.660
 Attack We have many counter-attacks 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.630
 shoots and so it should be hopefully 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.850
 also continue until 19 to 15 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.620
 leadership by sebastian weaver seemed 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.440
 then everything in butter 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.790
 but then the Schlendrian returned 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.340
 the one mittelhessen 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.640
 a quarter of an hour before came the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.550
 never staking francs on 18 20 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.950
 zoom 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.590
 the wetzlarer game remained unstable 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.610
 what followed was again a high of 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.870
 hsg those of over 4,000 spectators 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.970
 was fantastically powered 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.310
 at the crucial moment could 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.910
 wetzlar settle again and the guests 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.670
 with 28 to 26 lower 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.340
 revanche succeeded wetzlar with it for the time being 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.340
 in secure midfield in tenth place 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.610
 next game we play against 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:54.420
 Belgian we have to have this game 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.600
 now a week to prepare for 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.030
 this game 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.320
 I believe that with a good game 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.960
 with full concentration 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.450
 we can win that yes I think we 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.240
 were just on it whenever today 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.590
 but it never managed somehow because that 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.080
 to make a goal that so decidedly 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.570
 or that would be that worms 1 proceed 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.820
 We had good chances but was far too 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.470
 hectic and ranges think that we 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.600
 just way too many technical mistakes 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.040
 I just invite you to Wetzlar 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.350
 do not like collision gates like today 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.590
 but come ten at least as 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.660
 simply no no bundesliga game 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.200
 good times of us are missing 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.200
 simply the constancy
