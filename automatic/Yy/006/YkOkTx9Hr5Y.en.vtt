there's<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.170> legend<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.850> that<00:00:32.850> says<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.450> NFS

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
there's a legend that that says the NFS

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.720 
there's a legend that that says the NFS
underground<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.890> original<00:00:35.309> undergrown

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
underground so the original undergrown

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.260 
underground so the original undergrown
dot<00:00:36.300> city<00:00:36.690> map<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.290> based<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.800> motor<00:00:38.070> city<00:00:38.370> is

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
dot city map is based on motor city is

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.760 
dot city map is based on motor city is
that<00:00:39.420> true<00:00:39.570> enough<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:43.050> team<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.559> made

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
that true enough so the team that made

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.930 
that true enough so the team that made
the<00:00:44.100> city<00:00:44.399> was<00:00:44.610> based<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.149> Seattle<00:00:45.950> Tina<00:00:46.950> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the city was based in Seattle Tina you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.970 
the city was based in Seattle Tina you
know<00:00:48.059> undergrad<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.870> opposite<00:00:49.170> original<00:00:49.590> box

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
know undergrad was opposite original box

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.760 
know undergrad was opposite original box
down<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> Ferrari<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.449> highly<00:00:52.140> unlikely<00:00:52.410> but

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
down a Ferrari so highly unlikely but

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.119 
down a Ferrari so highly unlikely but
that<00:00:52.980> was<00:00:53.129> true<00:00:53.489> two<00:00:54.030> independent<00:00:54.510> teams<00:00:54.719> I

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
that was true two independent teams I

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.300 
that was true two independent teams I
believe

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
believe

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.510 
believe
so<00:00:57.550> that<00:00:57.700> came<00:00:57.910> over<00:00:58.180> and<00:00:58.530> basically<00:00:59.530> under

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
so that came over and basically under

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.520 
so that came over and basically under
God<00:01:00.700> was<00:01:00.850> built<00:01:01.090> basically<00:01:01.300> from<00:01:01.660> scratch<00:01:01.930> the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
God was built basically from scratch the

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.290 
God was built basically from scratch the
whole<00:01:02.650> game<00:01:02.890> was<00:01:03.130> like<00:01:03.430> you<00:01:03.670> know<00:01:03.760> he<00:01:03.970> went<00:01:04.120> to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
whole game was like you know he went to

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.210

the concept working on that was from

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.980 
the concept working on that was from
ground-up<00:01:27.340> datings<00:01:27.790> pressure<00:01:28.120> here<00:01:28.450> that's

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
ground-up datings pressure here that's

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.390 
ground-up datings pressure here that's
what<00:01:29.140> that's<00:01:29.410> great<00:01:29.619> when<00:01:29.740> i<00:01:29.830> got<00:01:30.010> into<00:01:30.190> the

the drip into the dragon so the music

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.270 
the drip into the dragon so the music
glitch<00:02:34.960> but<00:02:35.170> then<00:02:35.319> return<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> few<00:02:36.069> Jews

glitch but then return it to a few Jews
you<00:02:36.460> see<00:02:36.610> how<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.850> kind<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.120> cool<00:02:37.240> so<00:02:37.480> we<00:02:37.569> left<00:02:37.780> a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
you see how is kind of cool so we left a

he asks what's going on for support in

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.160 
he asks what's going on for support in
this<00:03:19.340> world<00:03:19.610> so<00:03:20.150> close<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:20.810> controller

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
this world so close so controller

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.030 
this world so close so controller
support<00:03:21.880> exciting<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:23.239> hear<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:24.040> obviously

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040

mostly<00:03:25.910> for<00:03:26.090> speeds<00:03:26.300> we<00:03:26.769> support<00:03:27.769> wheels

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
mostly for speeds we support wheels

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.360 
mostly for speeds we support wheels
controllers<00:03:29.620> so<00:03:30.620> obviously<00:03:30.950> we're<00:03:31.160> doing

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
controllers so obviously we're doing

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.770 
controllers so obviously we're doing
that<00:03:31.489> this<00:03:31.730> year<00:03:31.790> at<00:03:32.269> least<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.660> another

so<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:44.900> wanted<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:45.290> kind<00:03:45.500> of<00:03:45.590> lean<00:03:45.739> into<00:03:45.980> his

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
so I wanted to kind of lean into his

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.060 
so I wanted to kind of lean into his
questions<00:03:46.550> as<00:03:46.640> well<00:03:46.819> so<00:03:47.680> his<00:03:48.680> question<00:03:48.829> was

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
questions as well so his question was

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.130 
questions as well so his question was
are<00:03:49.940> we<00:03:50.150> turning<00:03:50.450> on<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.780> keyboard

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
are we turning on the keyboard

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.410 
are we turning on the keyboard
exclusively<00:03:51.799> how<00:03:52.220> does<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:52.430> work<00:03:52.760> with<00:03:52.970> this

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
exclusively how does that work with this

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.990 
exclusively how does that work with this
question<00:03:53.780> with<00:03:53.930> controller<00:03:54.440> support<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:55.340> we

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
question with controller support so we

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.759 
question with controller support so we
are<00:03:56.180> this<00:03:56.600> is<00:03:56.750> this<00:03:57.110> is<00:03:57.290> we're<00:03:57.500> basically

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
are this is this is we're basically

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.280 
are this is this is we're basically
essentially<00:03:58.220> tuning<00:03:59.090> on<00:03:59.269> keyboard<00:03:59.780> yeah<00:04:00.079> but

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
essentially tuning on keyboard yeah but

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.380 
essentially tuning on keyboard yeah but
we're<00:04:00.440> also<00:04:00.560> supporting<00:04:01.209> controllers<00:04:02.209> we've

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
we're also supporting controllers we've

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.420 
we're also supporting controllers we've
already<00:04:02.570> have<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.110> 360<00:04:03.739> controller<00:04:04.100> working

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
already have the 360 controller working

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.460 
already have the 360 controller working
perfect<00:04:04.820> so<00:04:05.030> John<00:04:05.570> was<00:04:05.720> our<00:04:05.840> broadcast<00:04:06.320> a

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
perfect so John was our broadcast a

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.650 
perfect so John was our broadcast a
while<00:04:06.620> back<00:04:06.890> he<00:04:07.100> was<00:04:07.280> saying<00:04:07.519> that<00:04:07.700> there's<00:04:07.910> a

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
while back he was saying that there's a

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.900 
while back he was saying that there's a
xbox<00:04:09.660> 360<00:04:10.050> controllers<00:04:10.560> yeah<00:04:11.010> it's<00:04:11.550> working

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
xbox 360 controllers yeah it's working

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.900 
xbox 360 controllers yeah it's working
it's<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.450> bowl<00:04:13.020> already<00:04:13.430> as<00:04:14.430> we're<00:04:14.730> tuning

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
it's in a bowl already as we're tuning

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.210 
it's in a bowl already as we're tuning
the<00:04:15.090> physics<00:04:15.480> basically<00:04:16.230> we're<00:04:16.739> tuning<00:04:17.070> it

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
the physics basically we're tuning it

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.220 
the physics basically we're tuning it
it's<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.850> first<00:04:18.060> game<00:04:18.239> that<00:04:18.299> it's<00:04:18.630> it's

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
it's the first game that it's it's

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.259 
it's the first game that it's it's
online<00:04:19.380> only<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:20.040> we're<00:04:20.190> actually<00:04:20.340> since

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
online only so we're actually since

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.030 
online only so we're actually since
Motor<00:04:21.480> City<00:04:21.780> basically<00:04:22.290> we're<00:04:22.530> developing<00:04:22.919> a

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
Motor City basically we're developing a

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.180 
Motor City basically we're developing a
purely<00:04:23.340> online<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:24.090> it's<00:04:24.470> keyboard<00:04:25.470> kind<00:04:26.070> of

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
purely online so it's keyboard kind of

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.740 
purely online so it's keyboard kind of
revenge<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.639> whole<00:04:26.850> d-pad<00:04:27.360> kind<00:04:27.630> of

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
revenge in the whole d-pad kind of

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.280 
revenge in the whole d-pad kind of

works<00:04:31.860> on<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.280> new<00:04:32.430> school<00:04:32.730> with<00:04:32.910> the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
works on the new school with the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000 
works on the new school with the
controller<00:04:33.330> so<00:04:33.690> we're<00:04:34.200> basically<00:04:34.320> tuning<00:04:34.919> at

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
controller so we're basically tuning at

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.770 
controller so we're basically tuning at
all<00:04:35.160> across<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.550> board<00:04:35.580> in<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.090> future<00:04:36.419> the

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
all across the board in the future the

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.510 
all across the board in the future the
wheels<00:04:37.020> will<00:04:37.230> come<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.560> over<00:04:37.889> in<00:04:38.040> companies

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
wheels will come and over in companies

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.760 
wheels will come and over in companies
such<00:04:39.120> as<00:04:39.150> Molly<00:04:39.419> attention<00:04:39.810> on<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:39.960> to<00:04:40.230> me

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
such as Molly attention on that to me

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.050 
such as Molly attention on that to me
always<00:04:40.950> before<00:04:41.160> equallogic<00:04:41.580> they're<00:04:41.940> good

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
always before equallogic they're good

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.700 
always before equallogic they're good
people<00:04:42.300> yeah<00:04:42.600> we've<00:04:43.380> had<00:04:43.560> a<00:04:43.590> good

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
people yeah we've had a good

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.050 
people yeah we've had a good
relationship<00:04:43.889> so<00:04:44.400> there's<00:04:44.580> no<00:04:44.669> reason<00:04:44.850> we

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
relationship so there's no reason we

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.210 
relationship so there's no reason we
won't<00:04:45.300> that's<00:04:45.630> been<00:04:45.810> in<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:45.990> future<00:04:46.380> with<00:04:47.160> the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
won't that's been in the future with the

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.670 
won't that's been in the future with the
game<00:04:47.400> like<00:04:47.580> haters<00:04:47.760> people<00:04:48.290> epsilon<00:04:49.290> Lexus

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
game like haters people epsilon Lexus

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.560 
game like haters people epsilon Lexus
it's<00:04:49.950> going<00:04:50.100> to<00:04:50.160> be<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.280> good<00:04:50.430> that's<00:04:50.700> every

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
it's going to have a lot so we're going

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.420 
it's going to have a lot so we're going
to<00:04:57.150> basically<00:04:57.450> supporting<00:04:58.110> this<00:04:58.350> one<00:04:58.560> foot<00:04:58.770> so

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
to basically supporting this one foot so

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
to basically supporting this one foot so
you<00:04:59.729> know<00:05:00.180> as<00:05:00.389> as<00:05:00.870> we<00:05:01.050> roll<00:05:01.470> up<00:05:01.650> into<00:05:02.450> launch

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
you know as as we roll up into launch

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.940 
you know as as we roll up into launch
you're<00:05:03.930> going<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.110> see<00:05:04.260> a<00:05:04.290> certain<00:05:04.530> amount<00:05:04.770> of

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
you're going to see a certain amount of

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.060 
you're going to see a certain amount of
features<00:05:05.550> of<00:05:05.790> slowly<00:05:06.300> we're<00:05:06.570> going<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:06.750> be<00:05:07.070> so

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
features of slowly we're going to be so

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.520 
features of slowly we're going to be so
kind<00:05:08.490> of<00:05:08.639> both<00:05:09.000> questions<00:05:09.419> yes<00:05:09.780> controller

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
kind of both questions yes controller

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.560 
kind of both questions yes controller
support<00:05:10.710> across<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.190> board<00:05:11.460> not<00:05:12.210> probably

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
support across the board not probably

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.320 
support across the board not probably
all<00:05:12.720> at<00:05:12.810> once<00:05:13.020> but<00:05:13.289> three<00:05:13.770> time<00:05:14.060> game<00:05:15.060> is<00:05:15.210> going

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
all at once but three time game is going

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.380 
all at once but three time game is going
to<00:05:15.390> be<00:05:15.450> first<00:05:16.200> tune<00:05:16.440> on<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.590> keyboard<00:05:17.390> which

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
to be first tune on the keyboard which

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.090 
to be first tune on the keyboard which
makes<00:05:18.600> it<00:05:18.720> feel<00:05:18.930> kind<00:05:19.140> of

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
makes it feel kind of

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.170 
makes it feel kind of
wait<00:05:20.730> it<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:22.040> yes<00:05:23.040> that's<00:05:23.760> really<00:05:24.030> well

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
wait it and yes that's really well

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.230 
wait it and yes that's really well
already<00:05:24.570> it's<00:05:25.140> a<00:05:25.230> good<00:05:25.710> place<00:05:25.950> but<00:05:26.250> i<00:05:26.850> think<00:05:27.060> i

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
already it's a good place but i think i

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.270 
already it's a good place but i think i
think<00:05:27.960> the<00:05:28.230> other<00:05:28.260> question<00:05:28.680> on<00:05:28.770> that<00:05:28.800> one<00:05:29.070> was

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
think the other question on that one was

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.360 
think the other question on that one was
there<00:05:30.060> is<00:05:30.240> a<00:05:30.270> question<00:05:30.420> about<00:05:30.860> carbon<00:05:31.860> or<00:05:32.220> just

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
there is a question about carbon or just

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.760 
there is a question about carbon or just
wanted<00:05:32.910> and<00:05:33.180> how<00:05:33.300> we're<00:05:33.540> so<00:05:34.290> basically<00:05:34.650> the

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
wanted and how we're so basically the

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.680 
wanted and how we're so basically the
answer<00:05:35.010> that<00:05:35.190> one<00:05:35.340> is<00:05:35.520> it's<00:05:36.240> a<00:05:36.300> touchy<00:05:36.510> one

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
answer that one is it's a touchy one

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.360 
answer that one is it's a touchy one
we're<00:05:36.990> still<00:05:37.290> doing<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.650> physics<00:05:37.800> we're

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
we're still doing the physics we're

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.650 
we're still doing the physics we're
getting<00:05:38.700> you<00:05:38.850> know<00:05:38.940> through<00:05:39.120> all<00:05:39.210> our<00:05:39.240> Vedas

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
getting you know through all our Vedas

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.570 
getting you know through all our Vedas
we're<00:05:39.840> getting<00:05:40.230> the<00:05:40.500> feedback<00:05:40.710> order<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.460> is

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
we're getting the feedback order that is

of everything into it and you know going

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.430

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
always have that an accessibility but

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.920 
always have that an accessibility but
believable<00:06:11.550> yeah<00:06:11.940> and<00:06:12.240> so<00:06:12.660> we're<00:06:12.810> keeping
