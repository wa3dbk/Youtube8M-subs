00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.740
 hi I finally came back later 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:16.280
 millennia the land remains a few days 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.830
 then the move is going well but 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.110
 maybe you hear I read why the room is 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.000
 almost empty in fact we have to dismantle 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.850
 all the furniture because tomorrow we paint 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.700
 and I decided to make this video because 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.950
 actually I don't know if I'll be able to do it 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.710
 others before leaving because we are leaving 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.239
 in 3 4 days 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.300
 I do n't think we will see the first one 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.280
 was the last video from Italy and I have 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.020
 decided to make a little video for 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.210
 point tell me how good it was and make you 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.560
 see some favorite necklaces among 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.540
 the other an hour race also of the 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.870
 girls at the end video I will pay them 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.570
 because I'd like to know if they have 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.870
 of necklaces in short from the fifth 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.820
 breathing let 's say the necklaces like 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.559
 even the earrings are a bit of 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.360
 accessories that suit him in fact 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.250
 he has enough 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.130
 I decided to show me mine 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.229
 favorite without thinking about summer 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.729
 spring and winter just for 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.350
 example that not all those I had 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.270
 here and monster sails and then I split 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.350
 a bit for colors I would start with those 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.310
 darker perhaps more winter then from the 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.180
 older fishing was already showing 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:37.159
 another video I bought it they have 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:40.159
 donated instead and it is a necklace made with 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.590
 kubicki with or dark and I find it very much 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.040
 nice I like them and I think you will see the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.710
 the necklaces that show you the necklaces 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.930
 very very graphic and geometric 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.270
 linear this is really rape me me 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.280
 really like it 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.930
 then another dark one I bought from 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.740
 this is little 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.670
 very very minimal even this with 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.019
 this pendant made that then horn 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:12.069
 these make her a madrid artist 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:14.270
 and in short, there is a retailer 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.060
 with all these creations by 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.610
 this artist I always go to look at them 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.450
 because they are beautiful there 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.550
 another dark one but it will be spring 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.470
 because they run it from the centers recently 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.360
 so I guess it's inside 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.610
 of the spring collection though 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.620
 colors are not really spring is 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.629
 this is what you see here too 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.390
 lines just lines her mom and likes 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.280
 this is this geometric style here and 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.890
 sometimes these colors could 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.050
 feel good about everything I like 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.770
 very much also the bow behind it is made 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.140
 it closes with the very nice flock 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.410
 then other super minimal 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.520
 this is a gold chain though of 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.230

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.700
 sorry that then ends with this 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.060
 ball of red stones 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.580

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.420
 should stand up like this around the neck and 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.860
 stop longer so you see it actually is 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.660
 broken entry mechanism twenty 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.210

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.370

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.880

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.370
 trivial Lorraine friend I am made both 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.260

 Well every now and then I put them there at 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.030
 moment often because so on a 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.700

 the one I have around my neck than the version 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.090
 yellow and the white version does a little 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:06.450
 slab noise parts hundred is worth nothing 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.160
 in short, like the necklace value 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.760

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.830
