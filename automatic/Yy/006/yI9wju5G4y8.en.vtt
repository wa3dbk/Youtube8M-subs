00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
talking through all of the doors that we

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.810 
talking through all of the doors that we
have<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.739> straight<00:00:46.980> line<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.760> will

to<00:00:52.289> tutorials<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:53.070> where<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.520> find<00:00:53.579> them

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
to tutorials on where you can find them

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.750 
to tutorials on where you can find them
now<00:00:55.649> as<00:00:55.800> always<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.250> these<00:00:56.340> sorts<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.699> things

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
now as always with these sorts of things

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.880 
now as always with these sorts of things
the<00:00:57.120> first<00:00:57.390> door<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.899> always<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.500> simplest

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the first door is always the simplest

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.410 
the first door is always the simplest
and<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.730> definitely<00:00:59.940> no<00:01:00.300> exception

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and this one is definitely no exception

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.599 
and this one is definitely no exception
all<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> pressure<00:01:02.100> plate<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
all we have is a pressure plate and a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.369 
all we have is a pressure plate and a
trapdoor<00:01:02.879> now<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.390> only<00:01:03.600> thing<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.870> I've

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
trapdoor now the only thing is I've

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.080 
trapdoor now the only thing is I've
forgot<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.010> trap<00:01:05.250> doors<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.670> their<00:01:05.790> own<00:01:05.909> hip

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
forgot the trap doors have their own hip

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.060 
forgot the trap doors have their own hip
boxes<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.990> meant<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.590> had<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.920> do

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
boxes and that meant that I had to do

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.950 
boxes and that meant that I had to do
when<00:01:08.400> starting<00:01:08.820> off<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.450> had<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.630> start

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
when starting off is I had to start

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.510 
when starting off is I had to start
walking<00:01:10.350> slightly<00:01:10.799> off<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.100> left<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
walking slightly off to the left and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.490 
walking slightly off to the left and
then<00:01:12.060> correct<00:01:12.450> myself<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.200> went<00:01:13.350> along

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
then correct myself as I went along

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.380 
then correct myself as I went along
which<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> little<00:01:14.490> bit<00:01:14.610> problematic<00:01:15.240> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
which was a little bit problematic and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.539 
which was a little bit problematic and
it<00:01:15.750> did<00:01:15.900> cause<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> few<00:01:16.619> issues<00:01:16.830> when<00:01:17.220> recording

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
it did cause a few issues when recording

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.270 
it did cause a few issues when recording
now<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.330> one<00:01:18.630> after<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.140> looks<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:20.040> an

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
now the one after this looks like an

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.370 
now the one after this looks like an
empty<00:01:20.490> doorway<00:01:20.820> Maddie<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:21.869> take<00:01:22.049> out<00:01:22.229> this

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
empty doorway Maddie if we take out this

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.570 
empty doorway Maddie if we take out this
pressure<00:01:22.590> plate<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.950> will<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.310> can't

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
pressure plate you will see we can't

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.310 
pressure plate you will see we can't
make<00:01:23.790> our<00:01:23.970> way<00:01:24.090> through<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.570> that's<00:01:25.020> just

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
make our way through and that's just

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.840 
make our way through and that's just
because<00:01:25.439> we've<00:01:25.740> got<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> fence<00:01:26.310> post<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
because we've got the fence post in the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.670 
because we've got the fence post in the
way<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.479> what<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:27.900> does<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.439> moves

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
way so what this one does is it moves

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.440 
way so what this one does is it moves
the<00:01:28.890> fence<00:01:29.070> post<00:01:29.310> across<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.939> replaces<00:01:30.270> it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
the fence post across it replaces it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.450 
the fence post across it replaces it
with<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.689> block<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.590> places<00:01:32.070> back<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
with a block and then places back the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
follow us through really quite a cool

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.270 
follow us through really quite a cool
little<00:01:36.509> mob<00:01:36.810> proof<00:01:37.079> door<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.740> really<00:01:38.100> like

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
little mob proof door that I really like

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.420 
little mob proof door that I really like
indeed<00:01:38.640> after<00:01:39.530> this<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.860> got<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.070> very

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
indeed after this we have got a very

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.700 
indeed after this we have got a very
simple<00:01:41.729> 2x1<00:01:42.270> slime<00:01:42.840> block<00:01:43.110> door<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.500> when<00:01:43.619> we

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
simple 2x1 slime block door that when we

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.289 
simple 2x1 slime block door that when we
walk<00:01:43.890> over<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.189> pressure<00:01:44.369> plate<00:01:44.610> they<00:01:45.030> drop

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
walk over the pressure plate they drop

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.850 
walk over the pressure plate they drop
down<00:01:45.479> into<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.960> floor<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.380> really<00:01:46.710> like

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
down into the floor and I really like

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.620 
down into the floor and I really like
these<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.369> because<00:01:47.700> all<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.270> redstone

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
these just because all of the redstone

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.690 
these just because all of the redstone
is<00:01:48.780> underground<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.470> all<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> redstone

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
is underground and all of the redstone

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.730 
is underground and all of the redstone
is<00:01:50.970> very<00:01:51.360> simple<00:01:51.810> indeed<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> only

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
is very simple indeed now the only

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.319 
is very simple indeed now the only
problem<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.040> we've<00:01:53.250> got<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.610> obviously<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
problem that we've got is obviously the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.760 
problem that we've got is obviously the
whole<00:01:54.540> archway<00:01:55.079> needs<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.500> made<00:01:55.649> of

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
whole archway needs to be made of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.160 
whole archway needs to be made of
obsidian<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.399> some<00:01:56.939> other<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.299> movable<00:01:57.780> object

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
obsidian or some other a movable object

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.959 
obsidian or some other a movable object
and<00:01:58.350> also<00:01:58.799> when<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.189> walk<00:01:59.369> through<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.820> get

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
and also when you walk through you get

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.389 
and also when you walk through you get
slowed<00:02:00.270> down<00:02:00.299> by<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.810> slime<00:02:01.110> blocks<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.590> I

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
slowed down by the slime blocks and I

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.219 
slowed down by the slime blocks and I
don't<00:02:02.640> particularly<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.509> now<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
don't particularly like that now the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.679 
don't particularly like that now the
next<00:02:04.710> one<00:02:04.860> along<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.280> caused<00:02:05.549> me<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.509> many

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
next one along that caused me so many

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.210 
next one along that caused me so many
problems<00:02:06.840> at<00:02:07.469> when<00:02:07.619> recording<00:02:08.099> this

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
problems at when recording this

problems at when recording this
essentially<00:02:09.060> what<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.300> had<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.690> we<00:02:09.840> had<00:02:09.989> a

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
essentially what we had is we had a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.809 
essentially what we had is we had a
minecart<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.800> other<00:02:10.950> side<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.640> would

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
minecart on the other side that I would

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.280 
minecart on the other side that I would
right<00:02:12.030> click<00:02:12.060> through<00:02:12.540> meaning<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.170> we

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
right click through meaning that we

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.790 
right click through meaning that we
don't<00:02:13.319> have<00:02:13.650> to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
don't have to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.770 
don't have to
travel<00:02:14.100> through<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.400> lava<00:02:14.550> now<00:02:15.210> originally

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
travel through the lava now originally

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.420 
travel through the lava now originally
the<00:02:15.900> minecart<00:02:16.380> was<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.800> spot<00:02:17.100> right<00:02:17.370> here

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
the minecart was on this spot right here

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.150 
the minecart was on this spot right here
but<00:02:17.910> as<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.150> can<00:02:18.300> see<00:02:18.570> if<00:02:18.810> we<00:02:19.140> travel<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.830> little

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
but as you can see if we travel a little

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.360 
but as you can see if we travel a little
bit<00:02:20.310> further<00:02:20.400> away<00:02:20.990> squid<00:02:21.990> will<00:02:22.830> begin<00:02:23.220> to

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
bit further away squid will begin to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.030 
bit further away squid will begin to
spawn<00:02:23.670> inside<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.630> lava<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.680> will<00:02:25.830> knock

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
spawn inside the lava and it will knock

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.340 
spawn inside the lava and it will knock
the<00:02:26.250> minecart<00:02:26.700> off<00:02:26.880> how<00:02:27.510> ridiculous<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.320> that

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
the minecart off how ridiculous is that

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.500 
the minecart off how ridiculous is that
it<00:02:28.740> ruins<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.520> many<00:02:29.700> recordings<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.450> I

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
it ruins so many recordings and I

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.180 
it ruins so many recordings and I
couldn't<00:02:30.810> work<00:02:30.960> out<00:02:31.170> why<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.470> minecart<00:02:32.070> was

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
couldn't work out why the minecart was

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.040 
couldn't work out why the minecart was
never<00:02:32.400> there<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.150> there<00:02:33.300> we<00:02:33.390> go<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.570> ended<00:02:33.990> up

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
never there so there we go I ended up

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.930 
never there so there we go I ended up
solving<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.560> by<00:02:34.890> placing<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.340> minecart<00:02:35.730> here

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
solving it by placing the minecart here

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.040 
solving it by placing the minecart here
but<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.600> was<00:02:36.720> odd

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
but it was odd

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.020 
but it was odd
it<00:02:37.110> took<00:02:37.320> about<00:02:37.470> 20<00:02:38.040> times<00:02:38.190> for<00:02:38.520> me<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.700> realize

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
it took about 20 times for me to realize

it took about 20 times for me to realize

would<00:03:05.310> say<00:03:05.520> this<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.820> probably<00:03:06.000> one<00:03:06.270> of<00:03:06.300> the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
would say this is probably one of the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.940 
would say this is probably one of the
most<00:03:06.510> ugly<00:03:06.930> doors<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:07.260> we<00:03:07.380> had<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.710> video

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
most ugly doors that we had in the video

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.860 
most ugly doors that we had in the video
so<00:03:08.490> I<00:03:08.520> don't<00:03:08.610> think<00:03:09.150> I'm<00:03:09.390> going<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.780> be

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
so I don't think I'm going to be

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.990 
so I don't think I'm going to be
building<00:03:10.080> many<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.440> these<00:03:10.620> in<00:03:11.040> my<00:03:11.520> base<00:03:11.700> so

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
building many of these in my base so

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.970 
building many of these in my base so
moving<00:03:12.330> on<00:03:12.450> we<00:03:12.690> have<00:03:12.930> got<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.350> crowd<00:03:13.650> favorite

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
building it in my base just because of

all the noise that it creates but it's

all the noise that it creates but it's
quite<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.680> cool<00:03:55.950> little<00:03:56.040> concept<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:56.820> if<00:03:57.090> you

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
quite a cool little concept and if you

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.580 
quite a cool little concept and if you
look<00:03:57.330> at<00:03:57.420> it<00:03:57.480> from<00:03:57.600> this<00:03:57.750> angle<00:03:57.810> if<00:03:58.290> we<00:03:58.440> had

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
look at it from this angle if we had

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.930 
look at it from this angle if we had
some<00:03:58.830> form<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.100> pressure<00:03:59.310> plate<00:03:59.580> that<00:03:59.730> just

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
some form of pressure plate that just

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.610 
some form of pressure plate that just
shifted<00:04:00.270> it<00:04:00.360> when<00:04:00.570> you<00:04:00.660> walk<00:04:00.840> over<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.170> it

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
shifted it when you walk over it it

shifted it when you walk over it it
could<00:04:01.890> actually<00:04:02.100> work<00:04:02.370> very<00:04:02.820> nicely<00:04:03.060> indeed

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660

now after that we have got the simple

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
and a little bit of trivia for you is

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.100 
and a little bit of trivia for you is
that<00:04:41.550> this<00:04:41.730> was<00:04:42.000> one<00:04:42.180> of<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.390> few<00:04:42.630> bits<00:04:42.900> of

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
that this was one of the few bits of

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.630 
that this was one of the few bits of
cutout<00:04:43.560> footage<00:04:44.010> because<00:04:44.370> I<00:04:44.460> actually

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
cutout footage because I actually

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.760 
cutout footage because I actually
respawn<00:04:45.300> over<00:04:45.540> here<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:45.900> then<00:04:46.290> I<00:04:46.350> walk<00:04:46.590> over

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
respawn over here and then I walk over

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.160 
respawn over here and then I walk over
realign<00:04:47.700> myself<00:04:47.940> then<00:04:48.510> continue<00:04:48.960> walking

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
realign myself then continue walking

that<00:04:49.560> was<00:04:49.770> completely<00:04:50.220> cut<00:04:50.430> from<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.700> video

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
that was completely cut from the video

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.730 
that was completely cut from the video
because<00:04:51.510> I<00:04:51.600> thought<00:04:51.870> air<00:04:52.050> affected<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.530> flow

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
because I thought air affected the flow

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.770 
because I thought air affected the flow
and<00:04:52.980> I'm<00:04:53.220> very<00:04:53.340> happy<00:04:53.760> that<00:04:53.790> I<00:04:53.910> did<00:04:54.150> that<00:04:54.300> now

on this will be coming out soon because

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.640 
on this will be coming out soon because
I<00:06:06.000> really<00:06:06.480> like<00:06:06.630> her<00:06:06.780> as<00:06:06.840> well<00:06:07.020> what<00:06:07.500> it<00:06:07.620> does

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
I really like her as well what it does

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.710 
I really like her as well what it does
is<00:06:07.950> it<00:06:08.100> shifts<00:06:08.280> the<00:06:08.550> fence<00:06:08.850> posts<00:06:09.300> so<00:06:09.690> that

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
is it shifts the fence posts so that

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.390 
is it shifts the fence posts so that
they<00:06:09.960> don't<00:06:10.170> connect<00:06:10.440> up<00:06:10.620> and<00:06:10.800> then<00:06:11.160> you<00:06:11.250> can

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
they don't connect up and then you can

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.460 
they don't connect up and then you can
walk<00:06:11.580> on<00:06:11.610> through<00:06:12.000> nice<00:06:12.210> and<00:06:12.450> fine<00:06:12.630> after<00:06:13.440> that

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
walk on through nice and fine after that

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.530 
walk on through nice and fine after that
we<00:06:13.740> have<00:06:13.920> got<00:06:14.100> a<00:06:14.220> very<00:06:14.610> old<00:06:14.940> contraption

we have got a very old contraption
indeed<00:06:15.900> this<00:06:16.140> is<00:06:16.200> the<00:06:16.590> 2x2<00:06:17.010> hidden<00:06:17.880> secret

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360

in my recommended videos and I was like

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.810 
in my recommended videos and I was like
I<00:06:24.210> need<00:06:24.390> to<00:06:24.720> put<00:06:24.900> that<00:06:25.080> in<00:06:25.260> my<00:06:25.320> latest<00:06:26.040> twenty

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
I need to put that in my latest twenty

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.340 
I need to put that in my latest twenty
more<00:06:27.030> doors<00:06:27.360> in<00:06:27.570> a<00:06:27.660> hundred<00:06:27.870> seconds<00:06:28.230> video

more doors in a hundred seconds video

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.440 
more doors in a hundred seconds video
because<00:06:29.070> I<00:06:29.100> absolutely<00:06:29.430> love<00:06:30.030> this<00:06:30.240> thing

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 
then after that we have got the 2x2 tiny

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.420 
then after that we have got the 2x2 tiny
hidden<00:06:33.900> staircase<00:06:34.500> that<00:06:34.710> drops<00:06:34.920> us<00:06:35.040> down<00:06:35.070> onto

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
this level into what I am going to call

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.090 
this level into what I am going to call
the<00:06:38.460> squid<00:06:38.850> door<00:06:39.740> obviously<00:06:40.740> I<00:06:40.770> didn't

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
the squid door obviously I didn't

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.040 
the squid door obviously I didn't
plan<00:06:41.280> this<00:06:41.520> I<00:06:41.760> didn't<00:06:42.420> want<00:06:42.570> for<00:06:42.780> there<00:06:42.900> to<00:06:42.930> be

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
plan this I didn't want for there to be

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.290 
plan this I didn't want for there to be
hundreds<00:06:43.620> upon<00:06:43.800> hundreds<00:06:44.340> of<00:06:44.430> squid<00:06:44.760> in<00:06:44.910> this

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
hundreds upon hundreds of squid in this

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.760 
hundreds upon hundreds of squid in this
door<00:06:45.540> but<00:06:45.720> I<00:06:45.750> thought<00:06:45.960> it<00:06:46.110> looked<00:06:46.290> fairly<00:06:46.440> cool

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
door but I thought it looked fairly cool

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.470 
door but I thought it looked fairly cool
in<00:06:47.010> the<00:06:47.280> video<00:06:47.490> with<00:06:47.760> all<00:06:47.880> of<00:06:48.030> those<00:06:48.120> squid

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
in the video with all of those squid

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.570 
in the video with all of those squid
floating<00:06:48.840> about<00:06:49.050> this<00:06:49.500> is<00:06:49.740> the<00:06:49.890> full<00:06:50.160> by<00:06:50.310> full

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
floating about this is the full by full

floating about this is the full by full
water<00:06:50.850> door<00:06:51.120> and<00:06:51.330> as<00:06:51.600> you<00:06:51.750> can<00:06:51.870> see<00:06:52.020> when<00:06:52.200> we

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.230 
water door and as you can see when we

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.610 
walk on through all of the water gets
taken<00:06:53.940> away<00:06:54.150> so<00:06:54.690> we<00:06:54.840> can<00:06:54.960> move<00:06:55.110> on<00:06:55.290> through<00:06:55.530> it

one of those two by two boring doors and

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.010 
one of those two by two boring doors and
then<00:07:01.800> we<00:07:02.130> have<00:07:02.310> ourselves<00:07:02.460> the<00:07:03.390> false<00:07:03.660> alarm

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 
then we have ourselves the false alarm

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.360 
then we have ourselves the false alarm
this<00:07:04.260> got<00:07:04.500> a<00:07:04.530> few<00:07:04.710> of<00:07:04.800> you<00:07:04.950> which<00:07:05.160> I'm<00:07:05.340> very

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.590 
happy to hear about I saw a little bit

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.560 
happy to hear about I saw a little bit
of<00:07:07.650> the<00:07:07.830> rage<00:07:08.040> in<00:07:08.340> the<00:07:08.370> comment<00:07:08.730> section<00:07:09.090> which

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.570 
of the rage in the comment section which

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.510 
of the rage in the comment section which
I<00:07:09.840> always<00:07:10.260> like<00:07:10.500> to<00:07:10.530> see<00:07:10.830> but<00:07:11.040> then<00:07:11.160> after<00:07:11.490> that

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
I always like to see but then after that

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.780 
I always like to see but then after that
we<00:07:12.150> got<00:07:12.390> to<00:07:12.540> the<00:07:12.660> main<00:07:12.990> topic<00:07:13.350> of<00:07:13.650> conversation

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:14.790 
we got to the main topic of conversation

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.850 
we got to the main topic of conversation
the<00:07:15.360> ghost<00:07:15.690> block<00:07:16.050> door<00:07:16.290> and<00:07:16.560> this<00:07:16.680> is

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
the ghost block door and this is

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.890 
the ghost block door and this is
actually<00:07:17.190> very<00:07:17.220> simple<00:07:17.760> indeed<00:07:17.880> it<00:07:18.420> uses<00:07:18.870> a

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:18.900 
actually very simple indeed it uses a

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.330 
actually very simple indeed it uses a
little<00:07:19.200> bit<00:07:19.320> of<00:07:19.380> a<00:07:19.440> command<00:07:19.740> block<00:07:19.860> circuit

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 
little bit of a command block circuit

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.970 
little bit of a command block circuit
down<00:07:20.460> here<00:07:20.760> using<00:07:21.120> a<00:07:21.420> super<00:07:21.780> clock<00:07:22.020> and<00:07:22.200> also

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:22.980 
down here using a super clock and also

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.400 
down here using a super clock and also
some<00:07:23.430> falling<00:07:23.850> sand<00:07:24.150> entity<00:07:24.330> x'<00:07:24.660> it<00:07:25.200> all

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:25.410 
some falling sand entity x' it all

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.500 
some falling sand entity x' it all
sounds<00:07:25.920> fairly<00:07:26.250> complicated<00:07:26.550> but<00:07:27.240> what<00:07:27.420> I'll

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.510 
sounds fairly complicated but what I'll

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.300 
sounds fairly complicated but what I'll
do<00:07:27.660> is<00:07:27.840> I'll<00:07:27.990> link<00:07:28.200> a<00:07:28.350> tutorial<00:07:28.650> to<00:07:28.950> this<00:07:29.070> one

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 
do is I'll link a tutorial to this one
