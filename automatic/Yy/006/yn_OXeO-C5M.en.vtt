00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
kind of kind of hot rod motor it'll be

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.479 
kind of kind of hot rod motor it'll be
power<00:00:41.129> out<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:42.680> obviously<00:00:43.680> if<00:00:44.040> there<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
power out of it obviously if there is a

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.779 
power out of it obviously if there is a
drawback<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:45.450> little<00:00:45.750> rascal<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
drawback this little rascal it's the

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:54.160 
drawback this little rascal it's the
kind<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.910> lack<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.149> power<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:49.579> it<00:00:50.579> don't

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.520 

extraordinarily<00:00:55.170> fast<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:57.289> know<00:00:58.289> there's<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
extraordinarily fast I know there's a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.110 
extraordinarily fast I know there's a
rod<00:00:58.770> somewhere<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.430> probably<00:00:59.699> holds<00:01:00.030> this

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
rod somewhere that probably holds this

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.349 
rod somewhere that probably holds this
up<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:00.570> or<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.109> located<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:02.329> might<00:01:03.329> have

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
up and then or it's located I might have

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.570 
up and then or it's located I might have
to<00:01:03.539> cut<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> camera<00:01:04.170> off<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.559> find<00:01:04.799> it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:20.290 

here<00:01:10.580> it<00:01:10.640> is<00:01:15.460> okay<00:01:18.010> so<00:01:19.010> what<00:01:19.850> do<00:01:19.910> we<00:01:19.940> see<00:01:20.180> if

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
here it is okay so what do we see if

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.660 
here it is okay so what do we see if
