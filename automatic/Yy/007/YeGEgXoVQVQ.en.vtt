00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.330
 equal to boys and girls I'm robbie and 

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.580
 here I am again with all of you and 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.530
 welcome to a new video of gta 5 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.969
 online and now guys I bring you a new 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.129
 gol bridge is a zone of the map 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.450
 that is not accessible in a natural way and 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.009
 that will protect us from the shooting of 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.720
 people from explosions and so on 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.130
 etcetera and that if we are going to be able to shoot 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.689
 to everyone who puts on our 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.580
 path whenever it passes near 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.929
 we and the boys have to have 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.070
 we need the help of a friend was 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.990
 here with status and we have discovered 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.310
 20 while we feel another trick the 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.960
 true that we do not know if in fact 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.699
 existed but we have not found it from 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.410
 pure chance and we will bring it to you 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.079
 it's worth the first thing we need is 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.820
 signs to this location that is a 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.770
 location that is quite close to 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.000
 what is the apartment this more expensive 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.070
 that you already know that in online games 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.079
 the action is usually concentrated enough 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.789
 in this area so we can mess it up 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.520
 pretty short good as I say 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.790
 we analyze the help of a friend we are going to 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.970
 specify 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.530
 one of these ambulance truck 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.720
 agree and if you do not know how 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.250
 get it good not to not get one 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.930
 down the street simply in the 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.760
 contacts we can request it worth 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.830
 we can go to contacts let's what 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.690
 which is the emergency telephone and therefore 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.670
 we request health care in 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.360
 the case that we do not have this contact 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.000
 we just give the keyboard we mark 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.010
 the 911 we call and auto automatically 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.600
 it will be good for us once we have the 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.160
 located or picked up what is the 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.440
 ambulance what we're going to do is leave 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.970
 to this area around here of these garages 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.190
 from here simply and we will use 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.930
 this white line as a reference 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.250
 this sing it as we are used 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.780
 reference was already the friend the father who 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.190
 to do is to throw it back and in the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.690
 moment that we are more or less to the 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.130
 half the way we're going to jump over 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.630
 okay and the friend what you have to 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.860
 to do is to keep throwing back the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.450
 first time it has not come out so 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.700
 simply good then practice 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.720
 how many times until it comes out is it not going to 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.070
 be the time that I do that 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.869
 I just jump to that part of 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.430
 back and how are you going to see it goes up 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.840
 automatically to the top and 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.330
 is already there and we are in the part of 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.160
 wolverine just do not give us that 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.630
 go to the part of the right that there is 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.159
 a hole and as a white ledge of 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.450
 agreement because we are just walking 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.039
 walking little by little yes 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.439
 a little to the right we're going to fall to 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.640
 what is the bottom of the map and 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.869
 let's end up dying so 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.090
 simply what we have to do is 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.530
 put us in this hole that is here 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.420
 little by little until we do not fall there 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.830
 is now very important cycle we have 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.930
 what to do is not to get too close to what 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.280
 which is the wall because if we aim 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.690
 our hands will go out and they will put us 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.680
 shoot as you are right here stratus me 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.390
 is shooting because I am 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.560
 too close to the wall good 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.060
 we are just a little bit to 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.620
 back that already just in this 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.330
 they will not be able to shoot us 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.340
 let's put for any throwing of 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.410
 four grenades rpg t et cetera etcetera 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.970
 that yes do not do what I do that is 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.860
 leave a grenade inside that you're not going to 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.720
 be able to have escape and I'm going to 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.160
 end up killing like an egg how are you going to 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.930
 see below not because simply 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.670
 I want to throw a grenade out this if 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.380
 I get it right but already the next one does not 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.540
 it goes well directly because I take it off 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.500
 inside and I kill myself good guys this is 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.269
