up call to find out who I was my first
memory<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.800> his<00:00:44.070> music<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.820> was<00:00:45.090> when<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
memory of his music is was when I was a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.100 
memory of his music is was when I was a
little<00:00:46.170> girl<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:47.010> thought<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.210> his<00:00:48.600> music

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
little girl and I thought that his music

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.189 
little girl and I thought that his music
went<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.680> beautifully<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.460> nature<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.510> I

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
went so beautifully with nature and I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.510 
went so beautifully with nature and I
learned<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:53.280> baa<00:00:53.730> means<00:00:54.539> stream<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.920> thought

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
learned that baa means stream I thought

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.889 
learned that baa means stream I thought
what<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> coincidence

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
what a coincidence

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.500 
what a coincidence
that<00:00:58.199> because<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.100> felt<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.699> his<00:00:59.940> music<00:01:00.480> was

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
that because I felt that his music was

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.439 
that because I felt that his music was
like<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> stream<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.160> think<00:01:02.609> when<00:01:02.760> Mozart<00:01:02.910> saw

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
like a stream I think when Mozart saw

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.690 
like a stream I think when Mozart saw
his<00:01:03.570> music<00:01:03.899> he<00:01:04.080> said<00:01:04.290> das<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.739> nicht<00:01:04.769> ein<00:01:05.220> Bach

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
his music he said das is nicht ein Bach

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.020 
his music he said das is nicht ein Bach
thus<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:06.990> Mir<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> brook

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
thus it's like Mir this is not a brook

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.990 
thus it's like Mir this is not a brook
this<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.780> an<00:01:09.930> ocean<00:01:10.110> when<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.920> play<00:01:11.189> three

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
this is an ocean when you play three

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.880 
this is an ocean when you play three
measures<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.420> Bach<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.110> who<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.470> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
measures of Bach you know who it is I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.539 
measures of Bach you know who it is I
think<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.369> brings<00:01:14.880> us<00:01:15.180> today<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.549> really

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
think that brings us today and really

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.980 
think that brings us today and really
the<00:01:17.700> question<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.270> power<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.930> music<00:01:19.200> any

them<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:17.490> quite<00:02:17.880> contradictory<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.380> today

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
them it's quite contradictory that today

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.240 
them it's quite contradictory that today
we<00:02:20.160> think<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.610> all<00:02:20.820> these<00:02:21.090> old<00:02:21.810> masters<00:02:22.530> we

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
we think that all these old masters we

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.570 
we think that all these old masters we
have<00:02:23.430> made<00:02:23.780> math<00:02:24.780> Beethoven<00:02:25.470> Mozart<00:02:25.620> iconic

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
have made math Beethoven Mozart iconic

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.880 
have made math Beethoven Mozart iconic
figures<00:02:26.910> which<00:02:27.150> they<00:02:27.360> certainly<00:02:27.660> deserve<00:02:28.200> any

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
figures which they certainly deserve any

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.160 
figures which they certainly deserve any
good<00:02:29.250> music<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.910> Revere's<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.480> past<00:02:30.720> takes

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
good music that Revere's the past takes

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.620 
good music that Revere's the past takes
the<00:02:31.380> past<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.000> reinvents<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.120> for<00:02:33.330> its<00:02:33.450> own

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
the past and reinvents it for its own

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.340 
the past and reinvents it for its own
time

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
time

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.620

I<00:02:34.380> think<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.010> pairing<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.700> an<00:02:35.850> older<00:02:36.240> composer

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
I think the pairing of an older composer

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.230 
I think the pairing of an older composer
like<00:02:36.960> that<00:02:37.290> with<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.710> newer<00:02:38.220> composer<00:02:38.790> like<00:02:38.970> me

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
like that with a newer composer like me

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.890 
like that with a newer composer like me
is<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.480> terrific<00:02:39.720> idea<00:02:40.490> because<00:02:41.490> in<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.570> case

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
is a terrific idea because in that case

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.560 
is a terrific idea because in that case
we<00:02:43.590> play<00:02:43.860> off<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.100> each<00:02:44.370> other<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.850> prefer

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
we play off of each other I prefer

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.210 
we play off of each other I prefer
always<00:02:46.140> when<00:02:46.560> my<00:02:46.770> music<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.630> played<00:02:48.630> with

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
always when my music is played with

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.400 
always when my music is played with
already<00:02:50.220> existing<00:02:50.600> music<00:02:51.600> it's<00:02:51.840> definitely

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
already existing music it's definitely

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.880 
already existing music it's definitely
you<00:02:53.040> know<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.520> challenge<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:55.290> be<00:02:55.470> presented<00:02:55.860> on

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
you know a challenge to be presented on

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.930 
you know a challenge to be presented on
the<00:02:56.010> same<00:02:56.190> program<00:02:56.310> with<00:02:56.550> Johann<00:02:56.760> Sebastian

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
the same program with Johann Sebastian

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.530 
the same program with Johann Sebastian
Bach

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
Bach

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.510 
Bach
because<00:02:57.990> you<00:02:58.290> know<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.740> you<00:02:58.800> can't<00:02:59.070> come<00:02:59.340> out

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
because you know that you can't come out

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.380 
because you know that you can't come out
on<00:02:59.700> top<00:02:59.940> but<00:03:01.580> if<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:02.760> if<00:03:02.940> you're<00:03:03.060> going<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.270> go

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
down what more honorable way to go down

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.460 
down what more honorable way to go down
at<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.420> best<00:03:06.930> ago

at the best ago
I<00:03:07.500> think<00:03:07.950> people<00:03:08.250> should<00:03:08.610> be<00:03:08.760> interested<00:03:09.420> in

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
I think people should be interested in

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.330 
I think people should be interested in
in<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.770> music<00:03:11.130> of<00:03:11.310> today<00:03:12.620> because<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:13.890> the
