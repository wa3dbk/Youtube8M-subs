00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
you can change the orientation so now

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.650 
you can change the orientation so now
it's<00:02:56.630> like<00:02:57.630> horizontal<00:02:59.000> so<00:03:00.000> what<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.390> can<00:03:00.540> do

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
it's like horizontal so what you can do

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
it's like horizontal so what you can do
with<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.900> cameras<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.320> can<00:03:01.620> zoom<00:03:01.890> in

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.870 

I<00:03:04.739> believe<00:03:05.580> it's<00:03:06.019> 2<00:03:07.019> times<00:03:07.320> up<00:03:07.769> 2<00:03:08.370> or<00:03:08.400> 3<00:03:08.700> times

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
I believe it's 2 times up 2 or 3 times

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.320 
I believe it's 2 times up 2 or 3 times
optical<00:03:09.510> zoom<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:11.310> can<00:03:11.459> also<00:03:11.580> take<00:03:11.880> videos

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
optical zoom you can also take videos

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.390 
optical zoom you can also take videos
with<00:03:12.570> this<00:03:12.800> and<00:03:13.800> save<00:03:14.160> them<00:03:14.340> onto<00:03:14.519> an<00:03:14.880> SD<00:03:15.060> card

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400

phone if you remove the back then you

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.800 
phone if you remove the back then you
