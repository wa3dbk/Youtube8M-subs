premade Obi so it's already tied in the
bow<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.990> all<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.349> do<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:31.949> tie

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
this thing on real Obie's will just be a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.709 
this thing on real Obie's will just be a
single<00:00:35.219> piece<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.399> fabric<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.300> and
