different<00:00:22.830> um<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.990> game<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.529> pretty<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
different um so this game is pretty a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.700 
different um so this game is pretty a
typical<00:00:26.720> pretty<00:00:27.720> typical<00:00:27.930> game<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.529> think

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
typical pretty typical game that I think

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.450 
typical pretty typical game that I think
we<00:00:28.769> all<00:00:28.920> have<00:00:29.130> once<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.519> while<00:00:29.670> um<00:00:30.199> it's<00:00:31.199> just

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
death was incredibly frustrating and it

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.250 
death was incredibly frustrating and it
just<00:00:50.309> led<00:00:50.579> me<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.149> more<00:00:51.360> reckless<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.110> I

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
just led me to be more reckless and I

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.319 
just led me to be more reckless and I
just<00:00:52.410> kept<00:00:52.620> dying<00:00:52.860> more<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.280> more<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.640> I

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
just kept dying more and more and I

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.150 
just kept dying more and more and I
ended<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> game<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.379> think<00:00:55.649> eight<00:00:55.860> deaths

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
ended the game with I think eight deaths

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.189 
ended the game with I think eight deaths
and<00:00:56.930> considering<00:00:57.930> i<00:00:58.050> got<00:00:58.199> 29<00:00:58.739> kills<00:00:59.070> in<00:01:00.199> like

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and considering i got 29 kills in like

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.229 
and considering i got 29 kills in like
three<00:01:01.710> minutes<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.460> game<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.820> about<00:01:02.910> five

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
three minutes this game is about five

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.810 
three minutes this game is about five
minutes<00:01:03.449> long<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.930> accrued<00:01:04.379> eat<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:05.430> two

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
minutes long I accrued eat this like two

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.060 
minutes long I accrued eat this like two
minutes<00:01:06.260> still<00:01:07.260> killed<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.560> lot<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.710> people<00:01:07.799> i

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
minutes still killed a lot of people i

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.770 
minutes still killed a lot of people i
think<00:01:08.100> i<00:01:08.310> ended<00:01:08.520> up<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.729> before<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.180> 48

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
think i ended up like before you in 48

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.380 
think i ended up like before you in 48
or<00:01:09.930> 430<00:01:10.500> 98<00:01:10.979> or<00:01:11.070> something<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.390> but

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
or 430 98 or something like that but

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.350 
or 430 98 or something like that but
it's<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.070> rut<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.970> get<00:01:15.210> in

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
it's just it's that rut that you get in

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.080 
it's just it's that rut that you get in
sometimes<00:01:15.810> um<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:17.280> obviously<00:01:17.850> they're

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
sometimes um and obviously they're

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.480 
sometimes um and obviously they're
they're<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.080> definitive<00:01:19.860> choices<00:01:20.340> you

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
they're like to definitive choices you

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.100 
they're like to definitive choices you
can<00:01:20.610> either<00:01:21.290> go<00:01:22.290> ahead<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.540> continue<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.900> play

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
can either go ahead and continue to play

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.730 
can either go ahead and continue to play
smarter<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.860> get<00:01:25.979> frustrated<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.700> keep

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
smarter you can get frustrated and keep

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.640 
smarter you can get frustrated and keep
either<00:01:29.030> dying<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.390> i<00:01:30.810> wanted<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.500> actually

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
either dying or i wanted to actually

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.039 
either dying or i wanted to actually
liken<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> something<00:01:32.790> outside<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.450> black

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
liken this to something outside of black

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.069 
liken this to something outside of black
ops<00:01:34.079> but<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.670> terms<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.150> games<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:36.960> you

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
ops but in terms of games if you if you

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.359 
ops but in terms of games if you if you
get<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.350> an<00:01:37.470> epic<00:01:37.710> win<00:01:37.860> streak<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.189> feel

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
get on an epic win streak you feel

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.600 
get on an epic win streak you feel
invincible<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.470> then<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.619> lose<00:01:40.860> or<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.369> die

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
invincible and then you lose or you die

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.679 
invincible and then you lose or you die
and<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.509> like<00:01:42.680> sort<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.710> puts<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.130> off

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
and it just like sort of puts you off

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.319 
and it just like sort of puts you off
but<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.560> wanted<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.820> one<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> few

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
but I I wanted to this is one of the few

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.060 
but I I wanted to this is one of the few
times<00:01:48.509> when<00:01:48.810> right<00:01:48.960> where<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.470> directly

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
times when right where I can directly

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.800 
times when right where I can directly
compare<00:01:50.490> black<00:01:50.759> ops<00:01:51.000> 2<00:01:51.180> real<00:01:51.299> life<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.720> know

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
compare black ops 2 real life I know

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.149 
compare black ops 2 real life I know
it's<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.110> bit<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.350> stretch<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.560> bear<00:01:52.890> with<00:01:52.920> me

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
it's a bit of a stretch but bear with me

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.710

and<00:04:36.020> it's<00:04:37.430> you<00:04:38.430> can<00:04:38.580> either<00:04:38.699> go<00:04:39.000> about<00:04:39.240> and

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
and it's you can either go about and

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.340 
and it's you can either go about and
continue<00:04:41.520> doing<00:04:41.759> what<00:04:41.880> you're<00:04:41.940> doing<00:04:42.270> or<00:04:42.389> just

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
continue doing what you're doing or just

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.010 
continue doing what you're doing or just
get<00:04:43.500> completely<00:04:43.650> caught<00:04:44.160> up<00:04:44.190> in<00:04:44.490> that<00:04:44.660> it's<00:04:45.660> if

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
get completely caught up in that it's if

get completely caught up in that it's if
you<00:04:46.229> just<00:04:46.440> take<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.710> mental<00:04:47.039> leap<00:04:47.160> to<00:04:47.520> go<00:04:48.060> out

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
you just take the mental leap to go out

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.100 
you just take the mental leap to go out
and<00:04:48.539> do<00:04:49.410> it<00:04:49.440> again<00:04:49.800> you<00:04:50.250> get<00:04:51.180> over<00:04:51.330> that<00:04:51.539> like<00:04:51.840> I

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
and do it again you get over that like I
