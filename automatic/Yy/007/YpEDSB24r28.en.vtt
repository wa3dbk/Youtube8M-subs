degrees<00:00:03.090> of<00:00:03.120> rotation<00:00:03.300> I<00:00:05.120> was<00:00:06.120> gonna<00:00:06.330> take<00:00:06.690> out

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
degrees of rotation I was gonna take out

degrees of rotation I was gonna take out
Energon<00:00:08.250> barricade<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.240> put<00:00:10.050> him<00:00:10.230> next<00:00:10.469> to

truck<00:00:12.420> but<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:14.059> figured<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.179> probably<00:00:15.420> got

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
truck but I figured that probably got

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.189 
truck but I figured that probably got
more<00:00:15.900> time<00:00:16.170> time<00:00:16.410> willing<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.740> give<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.970> uh

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
more time time willing to give it so uh

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.540 
more time time willing to give it so uh

he's had a review already anyway to
start<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> transformation<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.840> guy

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050

what you're going to do is come around
to<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> back<00:00:27.539> right<00:00:27.720> here<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.279> pull<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.580> rear

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
to the back right here and pull the rear

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.139 
to the back right here and pull the rear
sections<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> treads<00:00:30.840> out<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> side

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
sections of the treads out to the side

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.069 
sections of the treads out to the side
you<00:00:33.149> know<00:00:33.239> get<00:00:33.450> them<00:00:33.540> out

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
you know get them out

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.600 
you know get them out
pretty<00:00:34.469> much<00:00:34.620> straight<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.130> side<00:00:35.309> or<00:00:35.460> here

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
pretty much straight to the side or here

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.080 
pretty much straight to the side or here
rotate<00:00:36.570> them<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.520> then<00:00:39.350> it<00:00:40.350> will<00:00:40.620> clip<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
rotate them and then it will clip to the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.090 
rotate them and then it will clip to the
side<00:00:42.360> right<00:00:42.870> here<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:45.829> okay<00:00:46.829> there<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.340> goes

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
side right here so okay there it goes

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.979 
side right here so okay there it goes
rotate<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:52.070> once<00:00:53.070> you've<00:00:53.219> got<00:00:53.370> that

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
rotate this one once you've got that

split his missile rack and put bring it
around<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> front<00:01:00.859> his<00:01:01.859> head<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.670> kind<00:01:02.940> of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
around to the front his head is kind of

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.119 
around to the front his head is kind of
like<00:01:04.080> something<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.439> would<00:01:04.650> come<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:05.070> of

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
like something that would come out of

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.730 
like something that would come out of
Energon<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.740> double-jointed

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.789 
Energon it's on this double-jointed
thing<00:01:08.570> comes<00:01:09.570> forward<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.350> kind<00:01:10.740> of

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
thing comes forward and just kind of

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.250 
thing comes forward and just kind of
rests<00:01:11.250> right<00:01:11.280> there<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.760> doesn't<00:01:11.939> attach<00:01:12.810> down

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260

but these joints are tight enough that

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.170 
but these joints are tight enough that
it<00:01:16.950> holds<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.610> will

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
bad if you keep them turned to that side

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.670

real<00:04:41.860> good<00:04:42.040> poses<00:04:42.550> and<00:04:42.730> like<00:04:43.480> that

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
real good poses and like that

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.100 
real good poses and like that
I<00:04:44.020> think<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.919> the<00:04:45.730> weapon<00:04:45.910> on<00:04:46.180> his<00:04:46.300> back<00:04:46.480> kind

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
I think the the weapon on his back kind

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.740 
I think the the weapon on his back kind
of<00:04:47.200> helps<00:04:47.470> them<00:04:47.590> out<00:04:47.800> some<00:04:48.100> kinda<00:04:48.600> makes<00:04:49.600> them

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
of helps them out some kinda makes them

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.360 
of helps them out some kinda makes them
look<00:04:49.870> that<00:04:50.140> much<00:04:50.380> more<00:04:50.410> determined<00:04:51.160> that<00:04:51.220> the

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
look that much more determined that the

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.370 
look that much more determined that the
job<00:04:51.640> will<00:04:51.940> get<00:04:52.210> done<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.720> nothing<00:04:53.020> is<00:04:53.169> gonna

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
job will get done and nothing is gonna
