00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 no doubt the news of this week was 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.770
 the purchase of palm by hp the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.860
 company founded by engineers 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.790
 hewlett and packard has offered 1200 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.679
 million dollars and now it's 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.059
 waiting for the approval of the entity 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.440
 regulatory and of course the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.680
 shareholders but it is almost certain that the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.449
 purchase is going to be completed there was also 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.430
 bought a couple of weeks ago at tricom 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.500
 that that's once been the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.510
 owner of palm is one of the companies 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.849
 most beloved to be iconic of the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.320
 computer industry is now in 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.399
 hands of one of the greats of the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.980
 computer industry and one of the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.270
 companies with more years in this business 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.040
 until and the news remember that this 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.200
 rare week but that's how it is 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.790
 updates appeared not from 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.010
 security but they have to do with 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.239
 the stability of the system for windows 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.920
 if we are out of the cycle but there 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.739
 appeared and are some accounts would be 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.020
 good that will update the system and what 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.149
 What I have to show you today is a record 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.890
 external hard that sent us western 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.739
 digital to try even if you can not 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.170
 believe in this size there is a terabytes and 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.270
 11 followed by 12 zeros of bytes of 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.340
 information is very much 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.960
 there is a lot of tees that 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.180
 can do on these computers what 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.530
 I say they are always very very fragile yet 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.970
 when it seems very solid the truth that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.620
 It is very well built but you have to 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.480
 avoid the blows especially when 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.820
 they are used and the other we try from 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.470
 then it's the speed of the team in 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.450
 our numbers pretty much was 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.000
 transferring about 30 megabytes per 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.220
 second the fast by no means almost 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.950
 no usb- based system can 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.420
 even equal to an internal hard drive 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.430
 to give you an idea a hard drive 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.400
 more or less slow internal is in more 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.040
 double between 60 and 70 megabytes per 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.050
 second transfer and of course 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.619
 there are much faster discs also the 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.420
 USB-based disks are more demanding 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.860
 as for the use of the microprocessor they go 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.960
 to be consuming more cycles of 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.060
 processor more than double a disk 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.759
 internal based interface that always 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.810
 they have almost always used hard drives 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.180
 internal machines however 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.890
 this with this size one terabyte and 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.380
 only with a cable that with any 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.899
 USB port already reaches to work if 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.970
 even on a laptop it 's really very 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.470
 very comfortable as for the others 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.880
 course brings a software all the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.280
 companies that make this class 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.740
 teams add software to do 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.050
 backup and configure the computer sometimes 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.820
 encrypt with the intention of adding 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.050
 value because the competition is very 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.360
 great but as always what 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.740
 It really is worth the hardware there are good 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.600
 third-party software and in general the 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.030
 software of these non- scotland equipment 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.220
 what I will evaluate therefore is in 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.810
 if the device its speed its 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.230
 ease of connection manufacturing 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.650
 This digital western is easily in 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.650
