00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 all right 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.020
 good morning I'm Juan Alonso de velasco 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.029
 deputy director of marketing communication 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.570
 ecoembalajes spain associated with the animal 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:16.570
 of ecoembes 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.350
 ecoembes as a society without spirit of 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.290
 Profit is made up of practically 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.140
 about 50 companies and associations 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.210
 business that represents everyone 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.220
 the sectors of packaged products 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.130
 that are put on the Spanish market in the 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.110
 present more than 12 thousand companies 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.000
 Spanish women participate and collaborate with 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.480
 Ecoembes to enable the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.580
 containers of all their products can be 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.850
 recover and finally they can be 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.460
 recycled the containers that are recovered 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.079
 in the yellow containers of blue 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.690
 what are we managing on Thursday 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.150
 once we have deposited them they are 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.460
 recovered in trucks and moved to 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.780
 the corresponding plants in order to 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.860
 that these materials can be 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.810
 recycled 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.060
 you have to differentiate blue container 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.130
 where cardboard containers are deposited and 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.619
 paper in terms of containing yellow there 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.910
 and a little more complication the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.910
 yellow container as we know 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.570
 designed to deposit in the packaging of 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.400
 plastic metal containers and containers 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.560
 kind of and it's not the same kind of 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.600
 plastic than another nor a metal like the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.990
 steel with the aluminum therefore before 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.970
 be able to go to the recycling plants 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.240
 all these all these containers must 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.390
 go through a selection plants 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.850
 containers these plants of which in 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.580
 Spain currently there are about 100 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.980
 distributed throughout the geography what 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.500
 that are in charge therefore is to separate 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.210
 the different types of materials in their 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.970
 families once they have been 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.580
 transformed by the recyclers they 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.530
 can use in a multitude of new 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.180
 uses for example the pt of the bottles 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.820
 of soft drinks can be used to 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.160
 manufacture polar liners is a fiber 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.740
 textile 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.020
 these polar linings or sidewalks with the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.390
 cans of aluminum could be manufactured 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.970
 any material that is made of 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.210
 aluminum from the wing of an airplane to 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.310
 Any furniture or any pieces of 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.430
 automobiles made in extras 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.530
 well we wanted to collaborate 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.300
 with mature generation why 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.030
 as we are an entity without spirit 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.540
 of profit and in addition it is very worried in 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.610
 communicate and inform the citizen of 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.950
 Well, everything that can be done in 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.489
 favor of the environment and 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.060
 sustainable development recycling 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.530
 the packaging contributes of course to 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.030
 an important way to development 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.670
 sustainable 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.640
 for example the savings that occurs 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.890
 thanks to recycling in for example the 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.159
 water consumption would mean 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.959
 equivalence of consumption in a city 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.870
 of half a million inhabitants during 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.769
 everything once we join 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.069
 this these recycling habits because we 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.810
 we realize that they do not mean so much 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.000
 work as in an appetite we could 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.849
 think all the materials all the 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.519
 resources that we consume can be 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.889
 recycled can be given a new 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.159
 life and the environment is going to 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.159
 Record
