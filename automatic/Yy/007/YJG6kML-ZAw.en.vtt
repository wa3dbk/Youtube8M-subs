 all the colors of this graphic for

 wear beige and blue black clothes 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.150
 between 20 and 32 distinctive colors in

 this case you belong to the group of 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.110
 three chroma are you that means that 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.230
 you have three different types of cones in 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.049
 the eye in the violet blue green area and

 they enjoy different colors and can

 appreciate the very well close to 50% of 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:18.280
 the population is trichromatic 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.260
 between 32 and 39 distinctive colors of the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.960
 same way that bumblebees are a

 tetra chroma is verbal ensures that this

 kind of people possess four types of 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.500
 cones feel invited with the

 use it about 25 percent 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.840
 of the population is tetra chroma is more 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.510
 of 39 distinctive colors will be better than 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.300
 Nonverbal count again says only 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.730
 There are 39 different colors in the image and 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.160
 probably only 35 are properly
