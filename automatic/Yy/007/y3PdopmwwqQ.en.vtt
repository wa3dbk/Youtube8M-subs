00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
to people might like I was eight years

to people might like I was eight years
old<00:02:28.150> same<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.720> she<00:02:28.959> is<00:02:29.110> when<00:02:29.380> title<00:02:29.769> nine<00:02:29.920> was

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
old same and she is when title nine was

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
important fixture in my growing up but

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.060 
important fixture in my growing up but
it<00:02:37.420> was<00:02:37.600> still<00:02:37.870> something<00:02:38.200> relatively<00:02:38.799> new

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
it was still something relatively new

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.240 
it was still something relatively new
