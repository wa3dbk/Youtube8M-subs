earphones<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:42.910> they<00:02:43.750> kind<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.200> hurt<00:02:44.320> your<00:02:44.500> ear

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
earphones and they kind of hurt your ear

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.870 
earphones and they kind of hurt your ear
this<00:02:46.150> over<00:02:46.600> here<00:02:46.950> really<00:02:47.950> tiny<00:02:48.190> it's<00:02:48.580> the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
this over here really tiny it's the

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.620 
this over here really tiny it's the
microphone<00:02:49.330> so<00:02:50.220> that's<00:02:51.220> pretty<00:02:51.670> pretty<00:02:52.330> cool

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
microphone so that's pretty pretty cool

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.920 
microphone so that's pretty pretty cool
because<00:02:52.870> it's<00:02:53.230> it's<00:02:53.590> small<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.160> it's

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
because it's it's small and it's

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.800 
because it's it's small and it's
supposed<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.050> be<00:02:56.200> an<00:02:56.350> all<00:02:56.590> around<00:02:57.810> microphone

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
supposed to be an all around microphone

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.890 
supposed to be an all around microphone
so<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.860> doesn't<00:03:00.130> matter<00:03:00.220> where<00:03:00.580> you<00:03:00.810> where<00:03:01.810> it

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
so it doesn't matter where you where it

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.160 
so it doesn't matter where you where it
hangs<00:03:02.080> from<00:03:02.470> or<00:03:02.800> where<00:03:03.520> it<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.820> it<00:03:04.330> will<00:03:04.959> pick

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
hangs from or where it is it will pick

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.340 
hangs from or where it is it will pick
up<00:03:05.700> it'll<00:03:06.700> pick<00:03:06.880> up<00:03:06.910> your<00:03:07.239> voice<00:03:07.420> pretty
