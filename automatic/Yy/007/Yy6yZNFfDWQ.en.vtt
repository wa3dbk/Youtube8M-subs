00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.590
 unzip the world let's change the 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:25.190
 one's language we are right click

 and now left click 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.439
 I look for the option that the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.439
 triple directory w 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:42.300
 and I'm going to copy 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.300
 the moodle folder to this directory 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.330
 once you have finished copying the 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.940

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.420
 localhost 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.260
 and we see these projects we do 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.260
 click on the module 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.860
 here we are going to change the language to which 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.650
 you like me I recommend that 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.200
 use international Spanish because in 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.280
 the most complete and updated version of 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.770
 Spanish 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.170
 we wait for a moment to recharge and 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.890
 As you can see the whole installation 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.140
 it was in Spanish click on next 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.310

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.970
 red orange color that remains 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.640
 of green color this indicates that the 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.810
 one is restarting now we click 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.810
 in the reload button 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.960
 Here we leave it as it is and we give it 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.960
 click on next 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.290

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.630
 next here database server 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.310

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.700
 we click on next 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.770
 and we give you continue 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.239
 Here we check the 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.489
 server and if this message appears 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.739
 server environment meets all 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.849
 The minimum requirements we can continue 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:04.190
 the installation of these that appear to us 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.950
 of yellow color are used to connect 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.049
 two or more modules for institutions that 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.660
 many users use but in our 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.850
 case is not necessary so I'll give it 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.390
 click on continue 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.610
 at this moment the wood system is 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.520
 creating the tables in the database 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.720
 this procedure takes between 5 and 10 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.730
 minutes and to finish you're going to 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.010
 see the continue button if you do not 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.750
 see that button wait because you have not 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.750

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:25.520
