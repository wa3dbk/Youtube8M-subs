 to disassemble your screen DeSmonS 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.650
 do you get both parts of deism 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.919
 o'toole present in your box

 shock or scratch unlock the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.329
 chin rest by pressing simultaneously 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.750
 the two buttons and because the ones 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.879
 this opposition then throws davis and the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.730
 btr currency located on the left and right 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.940
 using the btr key or the port of 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.940
 customers 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.530
 then spread the two ends of the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.659
 chin strap to dismount it from the hull 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.540
 the next step is to eclipse 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.700
 the red piece named calm for that 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.650
 use the thin part of the keychain 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.210
 effecter to a brac effort biÃ© 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.150
 at the level of fixing the range 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.360
 so there eclipsed performed the operation 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.100
 on both sides enter your 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.680
 screen and all component parts 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.619
 the seedling mechanism dismissed the whole 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.670
 to extract the tran from the hull 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.090
 your screen is then fully 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.250
 disassembled if you want to mount a 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.560
 screen accessories you will find then 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.770
 the desmo tools already gathered on the one 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.200
 this 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.910
 in all other cases you will have to 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.820
 clip it's the desmo tools on the screen 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.800
 you want to go up the desmo 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.300
 tools is a mounting template it's 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.890
 an imprint of the screen and its 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.539
 mechanism that will allow you to 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.880
 mount your screen properly 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.319
 intuitive way 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.270
 death metal has two parts 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.950
 symbolize a she for the party 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.140
 left and ladies 1st for the party 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.149
 right knowing that the right and the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.450
 left are defined when the helmet and 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.369
 on the head then clip the two 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.820
 death metal parts on either side of 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.590
 the screen all the parts of the mechanism 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.370
 as well as the screen must find their 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.370
 place in the tool 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.400
 try to visualize the fair 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.690
 desmo tools in order to preposition the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.690
 parts to facilitate assembly 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.190
 make sure the desmo toul and 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.900
 properly clipping there is each 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.900
 side four clips is holding 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.140
 once the two parts of death note 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.860
 a climb you must arrive at this 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.860
 configuration 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.870
 then want to eclipse both legs 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.130
 of death metal right and left on 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.130
 the locking fingers of the hull 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.000
 then slide the two parts of 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.750
 your screen left and right on 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.750
 hull axes 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.050
 in order to fix the calm and so 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.150
 khamis my right and left apply 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.710
 strong pressure where indicated 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.540
 until a noise is triggered 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.750
 significant of the good fixation of the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.750
 messianism 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.250
 your screen and your mechanism 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.800
 desmo are suitably ride it takes 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.300
 now extract the death metal for 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.650
 this place your finger on 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.000
 the location of the fixing of the hall 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.430
 cable to hold the mechanism in 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.630
 position then unlock the desmo 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.880
 all the locking fingers of the 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.170
 shell and pull on it to extract it 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.170
 definitively the mechanism 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.170
 you have their art fix your 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.310
 chin strap it must engage this one in 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.920
 vertical position 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.920
 she slipped on the axes of the hull 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.510
 finally please you slip your 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.959
 chin rest left or right 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.670
 without unduly forcing indeed a 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.470
 excessive tightening of the lices may 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.830
 cause difficulty in operating the
