file<00:00:28.109> i've<00:00:28.460> we<00:00:29.460> go<00:00:29.609> into<00:00:29.760> tune<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.410> then<00:00:31.410> we

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
file i've we go into tune and then we

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.720 
file i've we go into tune and then we
select<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.610> it's<00:00:32.730> an<00:00:32.850> e<00:00:32.940> 67<00:00:33.690> or<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> t-38<00:00:34.730> now

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
select that it's an e 67 or a t-38 now

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.229 
select that it's an e 67 or a t-38 now
with<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> GTS<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.780> does<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.680> e<00:00:37.710> 67<00:00:38.550> ECU

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
with a GTS it does have the e 67 ECU

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.119 
with a GTS it does have the e 67 ECU
which<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.870> different<00:00:40.290> than<00:00:40.350> all<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
which is different than all of the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.060 
which is different than all of the
normal<00:00:41.489> V's<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.120> VF<00:00:42.390> s<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.719> they<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.980> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
normal V's and VF s have they have in a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.750 
normal V's and VF s have they have in a
38<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.000> e<00:00:45.030> 67<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.079> visibly<00:00:46.980> different<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.610> in

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
38 the e 67 is visibly different like in

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.410 
38 the e 67 is visibly different like in
this<00:00:47.910> little<00:00:48.149> picture<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.579> if<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.879> had<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
this little picture here and if it had a

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.619 
this little picture here and if it had a
38<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> club<00:00:53.969> sports<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
38 like that like the club sports and

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.959 
38 like that like the club sports and
all<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.289> other<00:00:55.469> Commodores<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.850> would

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
all of the other Commodores it would

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.380 
all of the other Commodores it would
look<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:58.039> we<00:00:59.039> use<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.850> software<00:01:00.149> to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
look like that we use this software to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.180 
look like that we use this software to
read<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> file<00:01:01.350> we're<00:01:01.590> clicking<00:01:01.800> read

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
read out the file we're clicking read

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.359 
read out the file we're clicking read
and<00:01:02.460> then<00:01:03.300> once<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.899> file<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.350> open<00:01:04.710> we're

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
and then once the file is open we're

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.620 
and then once the file is open we're
able<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.790> put<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.810> some<00:01:07.500> editing<00:01:07.860> software

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
able to put it in some editing software

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.789 
able to put it in some editing software
now<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:11.600> file<00:01:12.600> from<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.080> VF<00:01:13.350> GTS<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
now this is the file from a VF GTS a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.249 
now this is the file from a VF GTS a
standard<00:01:14.310> VF<00:01:14.549> GTS<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.950> we<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.189> operate<00:01:18.259> by

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
standard VF GTS and we then operate by

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.980 
standard VF GTS and we then operate by
changing<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.189> lot<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> parameters<00:01:21.630> that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
changing a lot of the parameters that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.270 
changing a lot of the parameters that
you<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> left<00:01:22.830> hand<00:01:23.040> side

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you can see on the left hand side

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.830 
you can see on the left hand side
there's<00:01:23.580> large<00:01:23.850> amounts<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.869> them<00:01:25.700> a<00:01:26.720> lot<00:01:27.720> of

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
there's large amounts of them a lot of

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.859 
there's large amounts of them a lot of
it<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.229> developed<00:01:28.680> over<00:01:28.829> time<00:01:29.750> with<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
it is developed over time with the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.719 
it is developed over time with the
tuning<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.320> these<00:01:31.560> cars<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.310> purely

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
tuning of these cars it's not purely

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.140 
tuning of these cars it's not purely
about<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:34.170> air/fuel<00:01:34.920> mixtures<00:01:35.400> at<00:01:35.670> full<00:01:35.970> load

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
about the air/fuel mixtures at full load

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.569 
about the air/fuel mixtures at full load
on<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.570> dyno<00:01:36.810> or<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.590> timing<00:01:37.860> at<00:01:38.220> full<00:01:38.430> load

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
on the dyno or the timing at full load

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.920 
on the dyno or the timing at full load
on<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> dyno<00:01:39.060> there's<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> lot<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.840> other

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
on the dyno there's a lot of other

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.510 
on the dyno there's a lot of other
settings<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:41.960> make<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.170> behave<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.070> best<00:01:44.280> on

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
settings that make it behave the best on

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.950 
settings that make it behave the best on
the<00:01:44.820> road<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.329> terms<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.780> drivability<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.630> over

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the road in terms of drivability so over

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.630 
the road in terms of drivability so over
time<00:01:49.170> we've<00:01:49.619> developed<00:01:50.070> all<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.490> these

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
time we've developed all of these

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.370 
time we've developed all of these
settings<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.329> change<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.930> all<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.229> our

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
settings that we change in all of our

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.999 
settings that we change in all of our
Tunes<00:01:53.899> so<00:01:54.899> once<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.290> file<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.040> adjusted<00:01:58.009> we

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
Tunes so once that file is adjusted we

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.039 
Tunes so once that file is adjusted we
then<00:01:59.689> save<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.899> as<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.530> new<00:02:01.759> version<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.049> we

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
then save it as a new version and we

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.550 
then save it as a new version and we
flash<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.860> into<00:02:05.130> your<00:02:05.280> vehicle<00:02:05.960> once<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
flash it into your vehicle once the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.300 
flash it into your vehicle once the
vehicle<00:02:08.399> has<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:09.030> new<00:02:09.750> file<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.440> we<00:02:11.099> then

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
vehicle has the new file in it we then

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.460 
vehicle has the new file in it we then
start<00:02:11.670> data<00:02:12.090> logging<00:02:12.450> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
start data logging it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.510 
start data logging it
and<00:02:13.560> from<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.580> data<00:02:14.790> logging<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:17.130> data

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
and from the data logging this is a data

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.000 
and from the data logging this is a data
log<00:02:17.790> from<00:02:18.120> another<00:02:18.450> vehicle<00:02:20.390> we're<00:02:21.390> able<00:02:21.540> to

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
log from another vehicle we're able to

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.700 
log from another vehicle we're able to
use<00:02:23.030> charting<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.510> analyze<00:02:24.900> its<00:02:25.740> errors<00:02:26.100> and

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
use charting to analyze its errors and

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.430 
use charting to analyze its errors and
after<00:02:28.710> each<00:02:28.830> log<00:02:29.160> we're<00:02:29.700> able<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.940> make

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
after each log we're able to make

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.860 
after each log we're able to make
educated<00:02:31.440> adjustments<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.790> tune

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
educated adjustments to the tune

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.280 
educated adjustments to the tune
calibration<00:02:34.430> this<00:02:35.540> initially<00:02:36.540> would<00:02:36.960> happen

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
calibration this initially would happen

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.860 
calibration this initially would happen
on<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.500> dyno<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:38.550> then<00:02:38.910> once<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.240> cars<00:02:39.450> like

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
on the dyno and then once the cars like

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.810 
on the dyno and then once the cars like
spot-on<00:02:40.380> on<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.770> dyno<00:02:40.980> we<00:02:41.340> were<00:02:41.460> then<00:02:41.610> tested

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
spot-on on the dyno we were then tested

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.300 
spot-on on the dyno we were then tested
in<00:02:42.120> normal<00:02:42.450> driving<00:02:42.570> conditions<00:02:43.230> on<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:44.100> road

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
in normal driving conditions on the road

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.800 
in normal driving conditions on the road
with<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.880> data<00:02:45.150> log<00:02:45.800> in<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:47.070> time<00:02:47.630> yeah<00:02:48.630> you'd

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
with a data log in that time yeah you'd

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.040 
with a data log in that time yeah you'd
be<00:02:48.900> looking<00:02:49.230> for<00:02:49.560> things<00:02:49.800> like<00:02:50.010> just<00:02:50.460> how<00:02:51.050> the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
be looking for things like just how the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.320 
be looking for things like just how the
fueling<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.890> coming<00:02:53.520> on<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.910> whether<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
fueling is coming on like whether the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.310 
fueling is coming on like whether the
car<00:02:54.600> has<00:02:55.260> any<00:02:55.470> flat<00:02:55.740> spots<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.730> and

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
car has any flat spots and and and

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.390 
car has any flat spots and and and
non-smooth<00:02:58.320> sort<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.740> issues<00:02:59.070> when<00:02:59.280> it's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
non-smooth sort of issues when it's

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.450 
non-smooth sort of issues when it's
coming<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.820> stop<00:03:00.770> we'd<00:03:01.770> be<00:03:01.860> able<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.100> also

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
coming to a stop we'd be able to also

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.610 
coming to a stop we'd be able to also
adjust<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.970> shift<00:03:03.150> points<00:03:03.600> now<00:03:04.320> in<00:03:04.380> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
adjust the shift points now in the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.060 
adjust the shift points now in the
automatic<00:03:05.010> VF<00:03:05.630> GTS<00:03:06.630> they<00:03:07.020> do<00:03:07.080> go<00:03:07.500> into<00:03:07.680> sixth

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
automatic VF GTS they do go into sixth

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.230 
automatic VF GTS they do go into sixth
year<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.550> bit<00:03:09.090> too<00:03:09.300> early<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:10.770> lot<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.010> the

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
year a bit too early and a lot of the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.210 
year a bit too early and a lot of the
calibrations<00:03:12.240> in<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.420> gearbox<00:03:12.630> we<00:03:13.020> change<00:03:13.350> in

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
calibrations in the gearbox we change in

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.310 
calibrations in the gearbox we change in
a<00:03:14.310> way<00:03:14.520> that<00:03:14.850> we<00:03:15.360> know<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.810> customers

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
a way that we know that the customers

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.810 
a way that we know that the customers
that<00:03:16.560> have<00:03:16.680> got<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.920> cars<00:03:17.130> will<00:03:17.370> be<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.520> lot

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
that have got the cars will be a lot

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.120 
that have got the cars will be a lot
happier<00:03:18.150> with<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.510> shift<00:03:18.720> points<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.320> we

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
happier with the shift points and we

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.800 
happier with the shift points and we
also<00:03:20.610> can<00:03:20.970> get<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.150> little<00:03:21.330> bit<00:03:21.510> quicker

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
also can get a little bit quicker

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.760 
also can get a little bit quicker
shifting<00:03:22.489> without<00:03:23.489> being<00:03:23.730> too<00:03:23.970> firm<00:03:24.470> in<00:03:25.470> the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
shifting without being too firm in the

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.220 
shifting without being too firm in the
gearbox<00:03:25.980> of<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.340> VF<00:03:26.610> GTS<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.870> that's<00:03:28.050> all

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
gearbox of the VF GTS so that's all

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.840 
gearbox of the VF GTS so that's all
that's<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.680> bit<00:03:28.800> of<00:03:28.890> an<00:03:28.950> introduction<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.550> how

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
that's a bit of an introduction to how
