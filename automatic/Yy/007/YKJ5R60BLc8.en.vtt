00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.310
 personal speech of youtube beauty here is the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.710
 marlon of the games channel br bringing 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.439
 For you another video today, bringing 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.390
 More information on gta5 like you 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.400
 know or is already one of the characters in 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.680
 gestation desire is the protagonist is the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.779
 main character you control and 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.149
 it just does not appear gta5 nor 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.980
 participates in nothing at all 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.360
 appear or quote him 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.860
 The truth is that I 'm going to do it. 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.930
 because they themselves said they did not 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.420
 want to mix the two worlds is as if 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.730
 the ancient world until gta san andreas was 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.320
 a universe and from gta almost like 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.000
 If it was a new universe, it would 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.070
 realize this perfectly thanks to the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 map for example gta five map of 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.649
 ten years 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.120
 despite having the same city they are 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.190
 very different is completely 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.070
 different is clear some parts 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.390
 equal for example lot but it equals 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.829
 it is possible that his position is 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.110
 totally different I do not have the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.119
 ventures do not have a wire together right 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.100
 in the same place then as if they were two 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.900
 different universes in this universe if 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.880
 says simply never existed say 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.320
 also with this statement of the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.540
 rockstar saying that the two universes 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.640
 They do not relate to us yet. 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.409
 hope that develops gta5 goes 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.090
 to know if one hour of this rotar decided 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.490
 nothing like with thirst in any of them and 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.259
 when possible, or is there another 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.640
 doubt that perhaps in the lg that will be 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.259
 released until the end of the year 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.850
 if it is released by the end of the year it will 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.680
 being a delight promotes history 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.509
 whether the subject may appear in it or not 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.950
 as we have already said on the channel 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.200
 will it appear in this new 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.549
 deli its not if you accompany the channel 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.590
 you remember you did a video talking 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.630
 About this dlc, I do not speak very well 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.460
 of lc I spoke of a new patent that 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.860
 rockstar record was the gta it distorts 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.450
 and there I commented in this video that maybe 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.490
 could decide to come back 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.229
 anyway but speculations aside in this 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.850
 video I want to tell you that maybe 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.720
 was day in one form or another appeared 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.700
 in 2015 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.090
 why a guy he posted on gta 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.189
 forums his username to a monkey he is 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.829
 character developer already works 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.069
 with the business and he made the cnj in a 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.720
 hd version in a fully 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.780
 remastered how it could be 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.800
 if I lived right if you look like gta5 like 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.210
 he would be 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.650
 What can I guarantee for you before 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.330
 to show the images that were left 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.070
 really damn good 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.170
 but to start telling how he did 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.600
 this first he made a sketch that is 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.490
 what you see now on your screen only 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.710
 sketched to receive face manja much of 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.930
 drawing he made sketches just to have a 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.060
 idea of ​​how he would do 3d modeling 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.550
 12 days later he went through a drawing 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.500
 a bit more complex of the face and how 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.240
 he himself said in a matter of a day and 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.430
 half or so falls more or less 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.100
 that 36 hours of work he already had 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.050
 arrived in this result here with 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.640
 3d modeling in a short time he already had 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.950
 managed to get this result 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.230
 you come now this other image shows 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.120
 a comparison of the old follow side 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.400
 standard world of the ancient universe 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.870
 digital and how it could be if it 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.060
 I was alive today, remembering that 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.700
 original game, that is, he was 23 years old 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.830
 then he tricks the world 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.270
 should be around 45 years old not 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.550
 I stopped to do the calculations but he 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.200
 would be 45 to 50 years old 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.030
 then how is it done and in modeling? 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.140
 already a good age, well 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.700
 next to that 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.440
 then he made an update to 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.040
 improve the expression of this 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.050
 way 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.519
 the end result was the one you see 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.980
 now on your screen 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.590
 It really was incredible it got very very 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.019
 very cool indeed and of course people 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.850
 will be based in gta 5 in the future there is no 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.620
 to be or not in any way it goes 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.940
 appear because he has already 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.989
 here is going to be a mod 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.630
 when we are like this when it was released 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.519
 for pc will have this template even more 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.959
 with the graphics of small is perceive 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.600
 what degrees even better than we have 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.670
 no playstation 3 and xbox 360 pro gta5 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.769
 currently but when released for pc 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.570
 he will do this mode where you go 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.280
 To play with the idiots, yes. 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.260
 another important thing to say is that it 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.970
 tried to create a site and a half-size medium 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.830
 because you remember that there in en action 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.200
 environment for you to leave it fat or 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.910
 skinny he changed the shape of his body 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.190
 he is alone or follow more medium 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.780
 is possible between the two 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.700
 and he was able to succor a 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.010
 very similar man was very fucking 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.320
 which is really an artist and will be 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.390
 very cool to play based in gta 5 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.700
 shakhtar will not put him in some 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.560
 of the kind the modules go 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.419
 end up doing it for her of course already 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.950
 it was expected that this would happen 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.900
 but we did not expect an artist 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.889
 someone who already works with games was 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.659
 do that 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.819
 he says he thought he had action says 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:28.710
 He designed characters for video games. 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:30.539
 so we understand a lot about it and 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.610
 It's there for you. 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.249
 really cool and since people 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.740
 is talking about artwork drawing coming out 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:39.300
 game right after all this up now 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.219
 artist did a modeling some 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.110
 cij drawings to make the mold more 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:44.400
 since we are already in that other topic 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.379
 Very cool thing I wanted to say to you. 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.180
 You 're the one who just left 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.279
 news from a guy who managed to do it 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.310
 Believe if you want the march work of 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:54.180
 michael totally made inside 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.520
 participant that program well 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.560
 simple design of microsoft is very 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.610
 simple very simple even has to 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.349
 make every part of the drawing 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.939
 mainly as pixel per pixel not 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.560
 how to do is a simple program 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:06.900
 too much for you to draw with 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.189
 sure it took the guy a lot of time 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.439
 That's where Eduardo did it. Eduardo 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:12.479
 He has a channel on youtube by 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:14.520
 link in the description the guy sends very well 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.680
 In designing he had already done another 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.779
 artwork with all the gta characters 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.789
 together had also been made at the point 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:22.680
 and this time he made an art work of 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.569
 mico for you were comparing the 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.099
 original image that he used as the basis 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.789
 another that he did totally within the 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.830
 pat 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.659
 The resemblance is incredible and of course the 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.310
 principle only seems but kingfisher cut 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:33.839
 which really impresses early is the 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.639
 that he had done so in the program as 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.750
 simple as punk and the time it took 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.550
 to make it clear 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.680
 according to he has been at least six months 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.120
 work then really really fuck 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.129
 sure what he did and totally in. 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.360
 of the package but basically good staff 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.460
 it was these two things that I wanted 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.050
 say in this video that the two 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.849
 were related to both have to do with 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.770
 drawing and stuff like that for you 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:54.330
 good as always if you like this 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.339
 video helps me a lot in the disclosure if 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.680
