00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.000 

first<00:00:17.130> step<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:18.180> put<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.660> anchor<00:00:19.410> piece<00:00:19.650> on

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
first step is to put the anchor piece on

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.730 
first step is to put the anchor piece on
the<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.850> tampon<00:00:21.300> character<00:00:21.810> itself<00:00:22.380> this

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the the tampon character itself this

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.640 
the the tampon character itself this
keeps<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.490> from<00:00:23.670> slipping<00:00:24.000> once<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.410> get<00:00:25.560> it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
keeps it from slipping once and get it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.040 
keeps it from slipping once and get it
in<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.890> ear<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.550> what<00:00:27.150> we're<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.869> is

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
in the ear so what we're going to do is

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.019 
in the ear so what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:28.260> going<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.529> place<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.099> tampon<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
we're going to place this tampon in the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.990 
we're going to place this tampon in the
dog's<00:00:30.240> ear<00:00:30.480> push<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.199> down<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.619> far<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.730> can

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
dog's ear push it down as far as you can

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.639 
dog's ear push it down as far as you can
almost<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> point<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.500> it's

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
almost to the point that it's

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.069 
almost to the point that it's
uncomfortable<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:36.149> becomes<00:00:36.630> like<00:00:36.899> I

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
uncomfortable and this becomes like I

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.310 
uncomfortable and this becomes like I
say<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.469> anchor<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.550> keep<00:00:38.790> from<00:00:39.210> letting<00:00:40.050> that

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
say the anchor to keep from letting that

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.799 
say the anchor to keep from letting that
slip<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.730> lay<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.300> there

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
slip and we just lay that on there

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.160 
slip and we just lay that on there
never<00:00:43.230> put<00:00:44.070> tape<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.579> too<00:00:44.879> tight<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.960> do

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
never put tape on too tight if you do

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.319 
never put tape on too tight if you do
what<00:00:46.469> will<00:00:46.559> happen<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.579> will<00:00:47.610> cut<00:00:48.210> off

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
what will happen is you will cut off

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.290 
what will happen is you will cut off
circulation<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:50.250> from<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.820> we're<00:00:51.090> just

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
circulation so from here we're just

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.510 
circulation so from here we're just
going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> lay<00:00:52.350> tape<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.980> from<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
going to lay tape on from the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.170 
going to lay tape on from the
herringbone<00:00:53.940> type<00:00:54.539> fashion<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:56.010> we're<00:00:56.789> just

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
herringbone type fashion and we're just

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.860 
herringbone type fashion and we're just
going<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> come<00:00:57.690> across<00:00:58.969> and<00:00:59.969> lay<00:01:00.629> those

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
going to come across and lay those

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.970 
going to come across and lay those
pieces<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.590> there

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
pieces in there

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.899 
pieces in there
keypoint<00:01:02.850> lay<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.600> not<00:01:03.840> tighten<00:01:04.320> them<00:01:04.909> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
keypoint lay do not tighten them the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.030 
keypoint lay do not tighten them the
other<00:01:06.030> key<00:01:06.360> point<00:01:06.689> here<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> at<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> base<00:01:07.710> we

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
other key point here is at the base we

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.130 
other key point here is at the base we
want<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.490> ear<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.939> stand<00:01:09.240> up<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:09.720> we're<00:01:09.960> going

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
want that ear to stand up if we're going

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.929 
want that ear to stand up if we're going
to<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.350> problems<00:01:10.650> it'll<00:01:11.250> tend<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.549> be<00:01:11.700> right

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
to have problems it'll tend to be right

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.910 
to have problems it'll tend to be right
here<00:01:12.180> at<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> base<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:13.439> will<00:01:13.560> happen

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
here at the base and what will happen

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.109 
here at the base and what will happen
and<00:01:14.189> I'm<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.520> show<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> other

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
and I'm going to show you on the other

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.140 
and I'm going to show you on the other
ear<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:16.619> base<00:01:17.009> will<00:01:17.310> kick<00:01:17.520> out<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.000> lay

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
ear is this base will kick out and lay

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.940 
ear is this base will kick out and lay
down<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.380> does<00:01:19.619> two<00:01:19.920> things

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
down like that and that does two things

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.010 
down like that and that does two things
number<00:01:20.490> one<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.970> causes<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> ear<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.810> break

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
number one it causes the ear to break

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.719 
number one it causes the ear to break
over<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.350> top<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.770> head<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.520> more

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
over the top of the head but more

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.340 
over the top of the head but more
importantly<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.420> shortens<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.080> ear

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
importantly it shortens that ear

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.560 
importantly it shortens that ear
considerably<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.610> want<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.000> ear<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.330> stand

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
considerably we want that ear to stand

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.929 
considerably we want that ear to stand
straight<00:01:27.990> up<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.189> make<00:01:29.520> sure<00:01:29.729> that

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
straight up so we have to make sure that

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.840 
straight up so we have to make sure that
we<00:01:30.090> keep<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:31.290> by<00:01:31.860> putting<00:01:32.310> your<00:01:32.490> ear

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
we keep that so by putting your ear

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.030 
we keep that so by putting your ear
piece<00:01:33.210> there<00:01:33.540> by<00:01:33.840> pushing<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.380> hard<00:01:34.619> into<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
piece there by pushing it hard into the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.700 
piece there by pushing it hard into the
ear<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:36.060> also<00:01:36.570> building<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.200> right<00:01:37.500> at<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
ear but also building up right at the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.940 
ear but also building up right at the
very<00:01:38.070> base<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.780> we've<00:01:39.990> got<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.470> couple

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
very base so that we've got a couple

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.310 
very base so that we've got a couple
layers<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.150> causes<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.810> year<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
layers here that causes that year to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.660 
layers here that causes that year to
lift

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
lift

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.790 
lift
now<00:01:45.670> one<00:01:46.210> layer<00:01:46.420> what<00:01:46.780> happens<00:01:47.110> it<00:01:47.350> tends<00:01:47.590> to

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
now one layer what happens it tends to

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.910 
now one layer what happens it tends to
collapse<00:01:48.070> down<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:48.820> so<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:50.440> doesn't<00:01:50.830> have

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
collapse down and so it doesn't have

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.040 
collapse down and so it doesn't have
much<00:01:51.130> stability<00:01:51.400> but<00:01:52.000> if<00:01:52.150> you<00:01:52.300> put<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:52.750> couple

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
much stability but if you put a couple

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.310 
much stability but if you put a couple
of<00:01:53.260> layers<00:01:53.530> of<00:01:53.980> tape<00:01:54.370> on<00:01:54.670> there<00:01:55.630> then<00:01:56.050> that

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
of layers of tape on there then that

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.220 
of layers of tape on there then that
will<00:01:56.530> cause<00:01:56.800> that<00:01:57.070> ear<00:01:57.370> to<00:01:57.730> stand<00:01:58.690> up<00:01:58.900> a<00:01:59.020> little

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
will cause that ear to stand up a little

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.080 
will cause that ear to stand up a little
better<00:01:59.410> and<00:01:59.560> give<00:01:59.740> you<00:01:59.830> a<00:01:59.890> lot<00:02:00.100> more<00:02:00.160> stability

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
better and give you a lot more stability

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.840 
better and give you a lot more stability
on<00:02:01.450> there<00:02:01.660> and<00:02:01.870> just<00:02:02.710> depends<00:02:03.400> on<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.670> dog

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
on there and just depends on the dog

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.969 
on there and just depends on the dog
sometimes<00:02:04.270> I'll<00:02:04.660> put<00:02:04.900> two<00:02:05.110> sometimes<00:02:05.560> I'll

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
sometimes I'll put two sometimes I'll

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.940 
sometimes I'll put two sometimes I'll
put<00:02:06.190> three<00:02:06.490> or<00:02:06.670> four<00:02:06.940> lay<00:02:07.120> layers<00:02:07.510> on<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:08.020> and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
put three or four lay layers on that and

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.440 
put three or four lay layers on that and
then<00:02:09.160> when<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.399> get<00:02:09.490> all<00:02:09.550> done<00:02:09.820> you<00:02:10.060> can<00:02:10.090> see

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
then when you get all done you can see

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.990 
then when you get all done you can see
that<00:02:10.479> ears<00:02:10.899> going<00:02:11.890> to<00:02:11.980> sit<00:02:12.459> up<00:02:12.580> there<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.940> the

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
that ears going to sit up there and the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.210 
that ears going to sit up there and the
dog<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.330> going<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.510> lift<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:14.130> through<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
dog is going to lift this through the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.830 
dog is going to lift this through the
ligament<00:02:15.670> here<00:02:15.850> it's<00:02:16.030> going<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.330> move<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.720> up

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
ligament here it's going to move it up

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.050 
ligament here it's going to move it up
and<00:02:17.020> down<00:02:17.050> which<00:02:17.440> will<00:02:17.620> give<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:18.060> some

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
and down which will give it some

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.790 
and down which will give it some
strength<00:02:19.390> in<00:02:19.570> that<00:02:19.600> ligament<00:02:19.930> we're<00:02:20.650> also

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
strength in that ligament we're also

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.490 
strength in that ligament we're also
keeping<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.430> ear<00:02:21.670> straight<00:02:22.090> up<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.420> down

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
keeping that ear straight up and down

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.780 
keeping that ear straight up and down
then<00:02:23.500> when<00:02:23.650> you're<00:02:23.770> all<00:02:23.800> done<00:02:24.070> I<00:02:24.130> usually<00:02:24.580> just

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
then when you're all done I usually just

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.430 
then when you're all done I usually just
kind<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:25.000> rub<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:25.690> sticks<00:02:26.020> real<00:02:26.260> well

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
kind of rub this so it sticks real well

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.260 
kind of rub this so it sticks real well
and<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:26.770> we<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:27.040> keep<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.459> minimal<00:02:27.880> amount<00:02:28.180> of

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
and so we can keep the minimal amount of

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.720 
and so we can keep the minimal amount of
slippage
