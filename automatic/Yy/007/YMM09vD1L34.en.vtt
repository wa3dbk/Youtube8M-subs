00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.740 

alright<00:03:28.280> if<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.520> guys<00:03:28.670> chose<00:03:28.940> B<00:03:29.240> shoot<00:03:29.600> his

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
alright if you guys chose B shoot his

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.810 
alright if you guys chose B shoot his
teammate<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:30.380> then<00:03:30.500> he<00:03:31.190> gets<00:03:31.340> killed<00:03:31.610> by<00:03:31.730> a

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
teammate and then he gets killed by a

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.000 
teammate and then he gets killed by a
grenade<00:03:32.000> which<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.110> hilarious<00:03:33.560> but<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.800> funny

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
grenade which is hilarious but the funny

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.290 
grenade which is hilarious but the funny
part<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.370> that<00:03:34.430> he's<00:03:34.640> trying<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:34.940> shoot<00:03:35.150> his

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
part is that he's trying to shoot his

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.120 
part is that he's trying to shoot his
own<00:03:35.420> teammate<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:36.170> guess<00:03:36.620> he<00:03:36.740> was<00:03:36.860> a<00:03:36.890> little

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
own teammate I guess he was a little

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.100 
own teammate I guess he was a little
distracted<00:03:37.670> anyway<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:38.360> let's<00:03:38.510> jump<00:03:38.720> into<00:03:38.900> the

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
distracted anyway so let's jump into the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.870 
distracted anyway so let's jump into the
next<00:03:39.470> situation<00:03:39.650> as<00:03:40.100> he<00:03:40.190> can<00:03:40.430> see<00:03:40.550> he's<00:03:40.670> over

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
next situation as he can see he's over

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.670 
next situation as he can see he's over
by<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.030> B<00:03:41.300> flag<00:03:41.630> again<00:03:41.810> Newton's<00:03:42.320> actually

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.440 
by the B flag again Newton's actually
pretty<00:03:42.830> funny<00:03:43.100> because<00:03:43.460> he<00:03:43.640> goes<00:03:43.820> up<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.300> try

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
pretty funny because he goes up to try

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.210 
pretty funny because he goes up to try
to<00:03:44.510> defend<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:45.050> beef<00:03:45.230> flag<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.500> little<00:03:45.800> bit<00:03:45.920> he

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
to defend a beef flag a little bit he

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.710 
to defend a beef flag a little bit he
knows<00:03:46.490> that<00:03:46.730> there's<00:03:46.970> an<00:03:47.060> enemy<00:03:47.360> there<00:03:47.510> and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
sensitivity but here's the point he just

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.880 
sensitivity but here's the point he just
