00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
or if it's powder coated it's certainly

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.520 
or if it's powder coated it's certainly
more<00:01:56.399> durable<00:01:56.820> powder<00:01:57.090> coated<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.540> I'll<00:01:58.320> also

grade that's probably all you can really
expect<00:02:14.550> quartz<00:02:15.510> movement<00:02:15.900> let's<00:02:16.080> actually

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
expect quartz movement let's actually

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.890 
expect quartz movement let's actually
take<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.680> look<00:02:16.890> here<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.400> see<00:02:17.940> what<00:02:18.300> all<00:02:18.600> this

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
take a look here and see what all this

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.170 
take a look here and see what all this
thing<00:02:19.140> sucker<00:02:19.530> does<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:22.850> push<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.150> here

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
thing sucker does the push it in here

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.130 
thing sucker does the push it in here
and<00:02:27.350> quartz<00:02:28.350> movement<00:02:28.770> second<00:02:29.190> hand<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
and quartz movement second hand to the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.510 
and quartz movement second hand to the
the<00:02:31.140> hour<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.860> minute<00:02:31.890> marker<00:02:32.370> our

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
the hour and the minute marker our

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:41.470 
the hour and the minute marker our
candle<00:02:32.850> nice<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.810> wide<00:02:35.030> let's<00:02:36.030> see<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.390> assume

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.910 

looks<00:02:42.480> like<00:02:42.750> somehow<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.350> got<00:02:43.470> into

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
looks like somehow it got into

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.670 
looks like somehow it got into
programming<00:02:44.220> mode<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:46.230> button<00:02:46.560> will

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
programming mode and this button will

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.340 
programming mode and this button will
jump<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.100> around<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:49.050> kind<00:02:49.260> of

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
jump it around and this is kind of

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.540 
jump it around and this is kind of
cycling<00:02:49.800> through<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.040> different<00:02:50.430> features

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
cycling through the different features

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.940 
cycling through the different features
so<00:02:51.290> looks<00:02:52.290> like<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:52.590> might<00:02:52.800> be<00:02:52.830> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
so looks like this might be the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:00.260 
so looks like this might be the
stopwatch<00:02:55.010> pretty<00:02:56.010> typical<00:02:59.060> looks<00:03:00.060> like

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
stopwatch pretty typical looks like

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
stopwatch pretty typical looks like
you've<00:03:00.420> got<00:03:00.600> an<00:03:00.720> analog<00:03:01.320> uh<00:03:02.810> dial<00:03:03.810> but<00:03:04.140> you

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
you've got an analog uh dial but you

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.570 
you've got an analog uh dial but you
also<00:03:04.470> have<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:05.190> digital<00:03:06.030> clock<00:03:06.840> in<00:03:07.140> there<00:03:07.580> looks

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
also have a digital clock in there looks

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.830 
also have a digital clock in there looks
like<00:03:08.790> alarms<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:10.760> up<00:03:11.760> here<00:03:12.000> oh<00:03:12.240> that's<00:03:12.570> kind

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
like alarms and up here oh that's kind

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.290 
like alarms and up here oh that's kind
of<00:03:12.930> pretty<00:03:13.170> cool<00:03:13.410> you've<00:03:13.680> got<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.880> Indiglo

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
of pretty cool you've got the Indiglo

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:24.140
