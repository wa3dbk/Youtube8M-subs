00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
mid-level or mid you know mid-range of

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.530 
mid-level or mid you know mid-range of
gaming<00:00:14.400> laptop<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:14.940> then<00:00:15.030> go<00:00:15.089> up<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.360> some

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
gaming laptop and then go up to some

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.910 
gaming laptop and then go up to some
higher<00:00:15.719> end<00:00:15.960> ones<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.410> will<00:00:16.500> cost<00:00:16.680> you

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
higher end ones that will cost you

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.500 
higher end ones that will cost you
probably<00:00:17.520> about<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.730> thousand<00:00:18.119> dollars<00:00:18.390> or

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
probably about a thousand dollars or

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.420 
probably about a thousand dollars or
more<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.109> I'm<00:00:19.289> gonna<00:00:19.410> start<00:00:19.650> off<00:00:19.740> with<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
more so I'm gonna start off with the the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.010 
more so I'm gonna start off with the the
cheapest<00:00:20.820> one<00:00:20.970> here<00:00:21.150> kind<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.630> budget

cheapest one here kind of the budget

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.019 
cheapest one here kind of the budget
gaming<00:00:22.350> laptop<00:00:22.769> now<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.550> one<00:00:23.670> I've<00:00:23.760> chosen

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
gaming laptop now the one I've chosen

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.230 
gaming laptop now the one I've chosen
here<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.480> Acer<00:00:24.840> Aspire<00:00:25.250> 15.6<00:00:26.250> inch<00:00:26.430> it's

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
here is the Acer Aspire 15.6 inch it's

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.910 
here is the Acer Aspire 15.6 inch it's
actually<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> touchscreen<00:00:28.080> laptop<00:00:28.260> which<00:00:28.800> I

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
actually a touchscreen laptop which I

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.220 
actually a touchscreen laptop which I
can't<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.310> find<00:00:29.580> kind<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.910> funny<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.689> lot<00:00:31.199> of

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
can't I find kind of funny that a lot of

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.959 
can't I find kind of funny that a lot of
these<00:00:31.410> kind<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.769> gaming<00:00:32.009> oriented<00:00:32.550> laptops

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
these kind of gaming oriented laptops

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.670 
these kind of gaming oriented laptops
would<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.210> our<00:00:33.450> touchscreen<00:00:33.960> laptops<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:34.649> I

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
would be our touchscreen laptops but I

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.080 
would be our touchscreen laptops but I
guess<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> little<00:00:35.579> bit<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.730> an<00:00:35.820> added

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
guess just a little bit of an added

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.270 
guess just a little bit of an added
bonus<00:00:36.239> but<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.200> has<00:00:37.410> eight<00:00:37.649> gigabyte<00:00:38.100> eight

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
bonus but it has eight gigabyte eight

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.549 
bonus but it has eight gigabyte eight
gigabytes<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.820> RAM<00:00:39.149> or<00:00:39.420> memory<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.050> 500

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
gigabytes of RAM or memory and a 500

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.889 
gigabytes of RAM or memory and a 500
gigabyte<00:00:40.890> hard<00:00:40.920> drive<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.850> storage<00:00:42.239> now<00:00:42.780> this

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
gigabyte hard drive for storage now this

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.569 
gigabyte hard drive for storage now this
one<00:00:43.050> run<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.379> about<00:00:43.530> six<00:00:43.649> hundred<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.280> fifty

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
one run you about six hundred and fifty

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.660 
one run you about six hundred and fifty
dollars<00:00:45.000> now<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.329> CPU<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
dollars now the CPU on this one is the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.810 
dollars now the CPU on this one is the
fourth<00:00:47.940> gen<00:00:48.210> Intel<00:00:48.600> Core<00:00:48.899> i5<00:00:49.610> 4200<00:00:50.610> u

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
fourth gen Intel Core i5 4200 u

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.000 
fourth gen Intel Core i5 4200 u
processor<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> quad<00:00:52.710> core<00:00:52.949> processor

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
processor so it is a quad core processor

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.760 
processor so it is a quad core processor
and<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.670> also<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.059> current<00:00:54.270> gen<00:00:54.660> Intel<00:00:55.440> Core

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
and it's also the current gen Intel Core

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.250 
and it's also the current gen Intel Core
i5<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.300> an<00:00:57.420> up-to-date<00:00:57.690> processor

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
i5 so it is it's an up-to-date processor

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.750 
i5 so it is it's an up-to-date processor
it's<00:00:58.500> definitely<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.949> get<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> job

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
it's definitely going to get the job

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.819 
it's definitely going to get the job
done<00:00:59.789> for<00:01:00.149> most<00:01:00.359> PC<00:01:00.750> games<00:01:01.050> now<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.590> base

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
done for most PC games now it's base

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.219 
done for most PC games now it's base
clock<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.190> 1.6<00:01:02.879> gigahertz<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.780> actually<00:01:04.110> has

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
clock is 1.6 gigahertz but actually has

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.109 
clock is 1.6 gigahertz but actually has
a<00:01:04.260> turbo<00:01:04.680> boost<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.100> 2<00:01:05.339> point<00:01:05.580> 6<00:01:05.760> gigahertz

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
a turbo boost up to 2 point 6 gigahertz

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.030 
a turbo boost up to 2 point 6 gigahertz
which<00:01:06.420> will<00:01:06.600> again<00:01:07.140> definitely<00:01:07.350> work<00:01:07.830> for

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
which will again definitely work for

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.460 
which will again definitely work for
most<00:01:08.250> games<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.060> play<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:10.049> far

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
most games that you can play now as far

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.140 
most games that you can play now as far
as<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.710> graphics<00:01:11.189> card<00:01:11.430> goes<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.850> actually

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
as the graphics card goes it actually

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.390 
as the graphics card goes it actually
has<00:01:12.299> an<00:01:12.450> integrated<00:01:12.780> graphics<00:01:13.140> card<00:01:13.650> into<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
has an integrated graphics card into the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.730 
has an integrated graphics card into the
CPU<00:01:14.760> or<00:01:14.909> built<00:01:15.150> into<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> CPU<00:01:15.840> which<00:01:16.350> may<00:01:16.530> seem

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
CPU or built into the CPU which may seem

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.679 
CPU or built into the CPU which may seem
like<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> little<00:01:17.100> bit<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.759> downside<00:01:18.479> or

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
like a little bit of a downside or

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.840 
like a little bit of a downside or
turn-off<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.470> most<00:01:19.650> people<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.159> Intel

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
turn-off to most people but Intel

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.219 
turn-off to most people but Intel
actually<00:01:21.000> has<00:01:21.240> some<00:01:21.420> pretty<00:01:21.600> good<00:01:21.750> integrated

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
actually has some pretty good integrated

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.649 
actually has some pretty good integrated

going to high settings I recommend going

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.850 
going to high settings I recommend going
with<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.030> higher-end<00:02:00.240> gaming<00:02:00.780> laptop<00:02:01.140> or<00:02:01.530> even

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
with a higher-end gaming laptop or even

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.499 
with a higher-end gaming laptop or even
building<00:02:02.159> your<00:02:02.310> own<00:02:02.340> gaming<00:02:02.610> desktop<00:02:02.880> but

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
building your own gaming desktop but

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.600 
building your own gaming desktop but
that's<00:02:04.229> basically<00:02:04.439> your<00:02:04.740> first<00:02:04.950> option<00:02:05.250> I

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
that's basically your first option I

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.130 
that's basically your first option I
wouldn't<00:02:05.880> really<00:02:05.969> spend<00:02:06.390> any<00:02:06.479> less<00:02:06.869> money

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
wouldn't really spend any less money

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.359 
wouldn't really spend any less money
than<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.680> because<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.009> probably

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
than this just because you probably

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.070 
than this just because you probably
won't<00:02:08.610> get<00:02:08.819> any<00:02:09.030> better<00:02:09.270> value<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
won't get any better value and

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.680 
won't get any better value and
spend<00:02:11.320> if<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.920> know<00:02:12.040> if<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.730> laptop<00:02:13.330> is<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.510> lot

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
spend if you know if the laptop is a lot

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.760 
spend if you know if the laptop is a lot
worse<00:02:13.870> than<00:02:14.020> this<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.290> probably<00:02:14.530> won't<00:02:14.650> be

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
worse than this you probably won't be

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.770 
worse than this you probably won't be
able<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.920> run<00:02:15.100> too<00:02:15.310> many<00:02:15.430> games<00:02:15.730> but<00:02:16.000> on<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.690> the

on you to actually run the game so you

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
on you to actually run the game so you
don't<00:02:55.990> really<00:02:56.110> need<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.410> upgrade<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.709> I

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
don't really need to upgrade that I

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.620 
don't really need to upgrade that I
wouldn't<00:02:57.310> really<00:02:57.459> recommend<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:58.090> until<00:02:58.510> you

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
wouldn't really recommend it until you

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.020 
wouldn't really recommend it until you
know<00:02:58.720> maybe<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.990> year<00:02:59.290> or<00:02:59.350> so<00:02:59.590> from<00:02:59.740> now<00:02:59.830> so<00:03:00.580> this

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
know maybe a year or so from now so this

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.570 
know maybe a year or so from now so this
one<00:03:01.209> has<00:03:01.450> 40<00:03:01.870> CPU<00:03:02.320> a<00:03:02.410> third<00:03:02.680> generation<00:03:02.980> Intel

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
one has 40 CPU a third generation Intel

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.500 
one has 40 CPU a third generation Intel
Core<00:03:03.820> i7<00:03:04.590> 36:30<00:03:05.590> QM<00:03:06.100> processor<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:06.970> this<00:03:07.360> is

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
Core i7 36:30 QM processor so this is

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.000 
Core i7 36:30 QM processor so this is
the<00:03:07.630> third<00:03:07.840> generation<00:03:07.870> not<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.620> newest

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
the third generation not the newest

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.370 
the third generation not the newest
generation<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:10.120> Intel's<00:03:10.510> processors<00:03:11.080> but<00:03:11.230> it

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
generation of Intel's processors but it

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.199 
generation of Intel's processors but it
still<00:03:11.590> will<00:03:12.010> get<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.280> job<00:03:12.490> done<00:03:12.550> it's<00:03:12.850> base

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
still will get the job done it's base

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.370 
still will get the job done it's base
clock<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.750> 2.4<00:03:14.650> 2.4<00:03:15.550> gigahertz<00:03:15.930> with<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:16.959> turbo

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
clock is 2.4 2.4 gigahertz with a turbo

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.140 
clock is 2.4 2.4 gigahertz with a turbo
boost<00:03:17.500> up<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.800> 3.4<00:03:18.430> gigahertz<00:03:18.760> which<00:03:19.030> is

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
boost up to 3.4 gigahertz which is

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.710 
boost up to 3.4 gigahertz which is
awesome

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
awesome

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.509 
awesome
again<00:03:20.110> it's<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.350> quad<00:03:20.620> core<00:03:20.830> processor<00:03:20.890> I

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
again it's a quad core processor I

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.699 
again it's a quad core processor I
believe<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.180> has<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.390> hyper<00:03:22.900> threading<00:03:23.350> meaning

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
believe it has a hyper threading meaning

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.170 
believe it has a hyper threading meaning
that<00:03:23.830> so<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.100> kind<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.340> tricks<00:03:24.640> your<00:03:24.790> computer

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
that so I kind of tricks your computer

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.910 
that so I kind of tricks your computer
into<00:03:25.420> believing<00:03:25.690> it's<00:03:25.900> an<00:03:25.989> 8<00:03:26.140> core<00:03:26.380> processor

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
into believing it's an 8 core processor

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.490 
into believing it's an 8 core processor
which<00:03:27.430> will<00:03:27.580> help<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.850> lot<00:03:28.120> when<00:03:28.540> on<00:03:28.870> when<00:03:29.230> you

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
which will help a lot when on when you

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.080 
which will help a lot when on when you
know<00:03:29.590> running<00:03:29.769> applications<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.760> require

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
know running applications that require

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.990 
know running applications that require
more<00:03:31.510> more<00:03:32.230> threads<00:03:32.530> or<00:03:32.739> more<00:03:33.000> processing

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
more more threads or more processing

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.850 
more more threads or more processing
power<00:03:34.030> really<00:03:34.510> like<00:03:34.690> rendering<00:03:35.320> videos<00:03:35.680> it

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
power really like rendering videos it

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.710 
power really like rendering videos it
will<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.459> know<00:03:36.489> take<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.760> lot<00:03:36.970> less<00:03:37.150> time<00:03:37.209> and

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
will you know take a lot less time and

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.990 
will you know take a lot less time and
it<00:03:38.530> will<00:03:38.650> help<00:03:38.739> in<00:03:39.040> games<00:03:39.310> in<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.580> future<00:03:39.880> at

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
it will help in games in the future at

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.729 
it will help in games in the future at
least<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.450> again<00:03:41.140> this<00:03:41.230> one<00:03:41.380> has<00:03:41.530> one

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
least and again this one has one

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.110 
least and again this one has one
terabyte<00:03:42.100> of<00:03:42.160> hard<00:03:42.280> drive<00:03:42.489> space<00:03:42.760> which<00:03:43.030> I

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
terabyte of hard drive space which I

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.030 
terabyte of hard drive space which I
would<00:03:43.269> recommend<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.870> would<00:03:44.080> recommend<00:03:44.860> going

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
would recommend it would recommend going

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.009 
would recommend it would recommend going
up<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.459> one<00:03:46.090> terabyte<00:03:46.450> of<00:03:46.510> hard<00:03:46.600> drive<00:03:46.780> space

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
up to one terabyte of hard drive space

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.750 
up to one terabyte of hard drive space
just<00:03:47.350> because<00:03:47.470> games<00:03:47.860> nowadays<00:03:48.340> are<00:03:48.519> starting

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
just because games nowadays are starting

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.550 
just because games nowadays are starting
to<00:03:48.850> take<00:03:49.000> up<00:03:49.150> tons<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:49.930> tons<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.230> tons<00:03:50.320> of

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
to take up tons and tons and tons of

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.320 
to take up tons and tons and tons of
gigabytes<00:03:50.950> so<00:03:51.280> again<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:51.940> recommend

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
gigabytes so again and recommend

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.449 
gigabytes so again and recommend
upgrading<00:03:52.660> to<00:03:53.110> a<00:03:53.140> one<00:03:53.410> terabyte<00:03:53.620> if<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.250> don't

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
upgrading to a one terabyte if you don't

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.610 
upgrading to a one terabyte if you don't
have<00:03:54.670> one<00:03:54.880> now<00:03:55.450> for<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.870> actual<00:03:56.080> graphics

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
have one now for the actual graphics

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.170 
have one now for the actual graphics
card<00:03:56.830> it<00:03:56.950> actually<00:03:57.250> does<00:03:57.430> have<00:03:57.580> a<00:03:57.640> dedicated

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
card it actually does have a dedicated

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.720 
card it actually does have a dedicated
graphics<00:03:58.420> card<00:03:58.690> it's<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.080> nvidia<00:03:59.500> geforce<00:03:59.739> GT

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
graphics card it's the nvidia geforce GT

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.330 
graphics card it's the nvidia geforce GT
650<00:04:01.390> m<00:04:01.570> graphics<00:04:02.140> so<00:04:02.290> it's<00:04:02.440> basically<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:03.010> the

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
650 m graphics so it's basically the the

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.190 
650 m graphics so it's basically the the
650<00:04:03.910> but<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.269> mobile<00:04:04.630> version<00:04:04.959> that's<00:04:05.050> what

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
650 but the mobile version that's what

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.350 
650 but the mobile version that's what
the<00:04:05.290> M<00:04:05.380> stands<00:04:05.680> for<00:04:05.800> it's<00:04:06.190> got<00:04:06.640> 2<00:04:06.820> gigabytes<00:04:07.239> of

the M stands for it's got 2 gigabytes of
dedicated<00:04:07.900> video<00:04:08.110> RAM<00:04:08.320> which<00:04:08.470> will

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
dedicated video RAM which will

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.080 
dedicated video RAM which will
definitely<00:04:09.010> help<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.250> lot<00:04:09.430> when<00:04:09.549> playing<00:04:09.880> a

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
definitely help a lot when playing a

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.479 
definitely help a lot when playing a

settings<00:04:19.900> depending<00:04:20.770> on<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.280> game<00:04:21.489> obviously

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
settings depending on the game obviously

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.150 
settings depending on the game obviously
but<00:04:22.330> this<00:04:22.750> will<00:04:22.900> probably<00:04:22.930> work<00:04:23.470> for<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.800> if

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
but this will probably work for you if

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.690 
but this will probably work for you if
you<00:04:24.310> know<00:04:24.430> your

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
you know your

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.730 
you know your
planning<00:04:24.910> on<00:04:24.970> playing<00:04:25.630> games<00:04:25.750> like<00:04:25.990> you<00:04:26.590> could

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
planning on playing games like you could

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.440 
planning on playing games like you could
probably<00:04:26.890> play<00:04:27.130> black<00:04:27.370> ops<00:04:27.520> 2<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:27.940> medium<00:04:28.300> to

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
probably play black ops 2 and medium to

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.820 
probably play black ops 2 and medium to
high<00:04:28.600> settings<00:04:28.930> and<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:29.590> could<00:04:29.710> probably

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
high settings and you could probably

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.850 
high settings and you could probably
play<00:04:30.250> games<00:04:30.550> like<00:04:30.850> like<00:04:31.810> mana<00:04:32.050> warfare<00:04:32.410> 3<00:04:32.650> on

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
play games like like mana warfare 3 on

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.170 
play games like like mana warfare 3 on
the<00:04:32.950> high<00:04:33.130> settings<00:04:33.580> and<00:04:33.730> games<00:04:33.880> like<00:04:34.030> that

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
the high settings and games like that

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.520 
the high settings and games like that
this<00:04:34.330> should<00:04:34.510> work<00:04:34.660> for<00:04:34.870> anyone<00:04:35.140> who's<00:04:35.320> you

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
this should work for anyone who's you

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.930 
this should work for anyone who's you
know<00:04:35.620> looking<00:04:35.890> to<00:04:36.100> play<00:04:36.340> games<00:04:36.550> like<00:04:36.640> that

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
know looking to play games like that

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.750 
know looking to play games like that
like<00:04:37.150> some<00:04:37.510> FPS<00:04:38.260> is<00:04:38.470> on<00:04:38.710> not<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.220> know<00:04:39.310> totally

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
like some FPS is on not you know totally

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.400 
like some FPS is on not you know totally
maxed<00:04:39.970> out<00:04:40.150> settings<00:04:40.390> but<00:04:40.750> this<00:04:41.140> one<00:04:41.290> actually

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
maxed out settings but this one actually

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.580 
maxed out settings but this one actually
has<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.790> 1920<00:04:42.790> by<00:04:42.820> 1080<00:04:43.390> resolution<00:04:43.510> and<00:04:44.200> LED

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
has a 1920 by 1080 resolution and LED

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.670 
has a 1920 by 1080 resolution and LED
resolution<00:04:45.190> as<00:04:45.340> opposed<00:04:46.150> to<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.540> the

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
resolution as opposed to the the

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.290 
resolution as opposed to the the
previous<00:04:47.680> one<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:47.830> talked<00:04:48.160> about<00:04:48.280> having<00:04:49.120> a

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
previous one I talked about having a

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.180 
previous one I talked about having a
what<00:04:50.020> is<00:04:50.110> it<00:04:50.320> 13<00:04:51.250> what<00:04:51.940> is<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:52.120> 1366<00:04:53.020> by<00:04:53.050> 768<00:04:53.530> or

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
what is it 13 what is it 1366 by 768 or

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.310 
what is it 13 what is it 1366 by 768 or
something<00:04:54.460> which<00:04:54.610> is<00:04:54.640> essentially<00:04:55.600> 720p<00:04:56.170> so

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
something which is essentially 720p so

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.440 
something which is essentially 720p so
this<00:04:56.440> one<00:04:56.560> has<00:04:56.680> 1080p<00:04:57.250> support<00:04:57.670> which<00:04:58.270> you'll

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
this one has 1080p support which you'll

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.850 
this one has 1080p support which you'll
probably<00:04:58.480> have<00:04:58.810> to<00:04:58.840> lower<00:04:59.050> your<00:04:59.170> settings<00:04:59.650> in

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
probably have to lower your settings in

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.620 
probably have to lower your settings in
the<00:04:59.950> games<00:05:00.160> but<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.880> will<00:05:01.000> look<00:05:01.150> a<00:05:01.300> lot<00:05:01.450> nicer

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
the games but it will look a lot nicer

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.290 
the games but it will look a lot nicer
in<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.110> long<00:05:02.500> run<00:05:02.710> so<00:05:02.950> now<00:05:03.400> for<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.760> the<00:05:03.790> last

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
in the long run so now for the the last

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.350 
in the long run so now for the the last
laptop<00:05:04.600> I've<00:05:04.930> chosen<00:05:05.200> here<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:05.680> is<00:05:05.800> an<00:05:05.920> Asus

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
laptop I've chosen here this is an Asus

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.730 
laptop I've chosen here this is an Asus
15.6<00:05:07.360> inch<00:05:07.510> again<00:05:08.170> this<00:05:08.260> is<00:05:08.410> actually<00:05:08.680> a

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
15.6 inch again this is actually a

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.320 
15.6 inch again this is actually a
touchscreen<00:05:09.160> laptop<00:05:09.310> which<00:05:09.760> I<00:05:09.880> find<00:05:10.180> to<00:05:10.300> be

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
touchscreen laptop which I find to be

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.910 
touchscreen laptop which I find to be
kind<00:05:10.750> of<00:05:10.840> weird<00:05:11.020> just<00:05:11.320> because<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:11.710> wouldn't

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
kind of weird just because I wouldn't

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.230 
kind of weird just because I wouldn't
really<00:05:12.160> really<00:05:12.550> wouldn't<00:05:12.760> think<00:05:12.940> that<00:05:13.060> they

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
really really wouldn't think that they

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.070 
really really wouldn't think that they
make<00:05:13.450> um

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
make um

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.840 
make um
these<00:05:14.500> have<00:05:14.650> a<00:05:14.680> laptops<00:05:15.160> touchscreen<00:05:15.640> but

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
these have a laptops touchscreen but

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.090 
these have a laptops touchscreen but
regardless<00:05:16.780> I<00:05:16.870> guess<00:05:17.110> again<00:05:17.530> it<00:05:17.770> is<00:05:17.890> kind<00:05:18.010> of

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
regardless I guess again it is kind of

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.520 
regardless I guess again it is kind of
an<00:05:18.220> added<00:05:18.340> bonus<00:05:18.700> this<00:05:19.240> one<00:05:19.420> as<00:05:19.810> well<00:05:20.050> has<00:05:20.290> 8

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
an added bonus this one as well has 8

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.650 
an added bonus this one as well has 8
gigabytes<00:05:20.950> of<00:05:21.100> memory<00:05:21.160> or<00:05:21.550> 8<00:05:21.790> gigabytes<00:05:22.210> of<00:05:22.360> a

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
space which again is recommended so the

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.370

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
a huge jump you know from 1.8 gigahertz

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.420 
a huge jump you know from 1.8 gigahertz

hyper threading meaning it kind of

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.550 
hyper threading meaning it kind of

you're you know it has eight cores and
again<00:05:49.780> it'll<00:05:49.930> help<00:05:50.140> it<00:05:50.320> with<00:05:50.580> with

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
again it'll help it with with

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.280 
again it'll help it with with
applications<00:05:52.270> like<00:05:52.360> Sony<00:05:52.630> Vegas<00:05:52.780> and<00:05:53.110> stuff

the<00:06:34.660> older<00:06:34.900> games<00:06:35.080> you'll<00:06:35.230> be<00:06:35.320> able<00:06:35.380> to<00:06:35.560> max

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
the older games you'll be able to max

the older games you'll be able to max
out<00:06:36.010> you<00:06:36.220> could<00:06:36.370> probably<00:06:36.550> play<00:06:36.940> games<00:06:37.210> like

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
out you could probably play games like

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.260 
out you could probably play games like
black<00:06:38.170> ops<00:06:38.410> 2<00:06:38.560> in<00:06:38.680> high<00:06:38.830> settings<00:06:39.280> and<00:06:39.580> this

black ops 2 in high settings and this

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.430 
black ops 2 in high settings and this
will<00:06:40.420> definitely<00:06:40.510> get<00:06:40.780> the<00:06:40.870> job<00:06:40.900> done<00:06:41.290> for

even graphically intensive games on the
go<00:06:48.130> which<00:06:48.340> is<00:06:48.370> definitely<00:06:48.640> good<00:06:48.970> that's<00:06:49.150> why<00:06:49.330> a

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
go which is definitely good that's why a

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.300 
go which is definitely good that's why a
lot<00:06:49.960> of<00:06:50.050> people<00:06:50.260> go<00:06:50.410> with<00:06:50.440> the<00:06:50.650> laptop<00:06:51.070> just

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
lot of people go with the laptop just

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.920 
lot of people go with the laptop just
because<00:06:51.520> it's<00:06:51.640> portable<00:06:52.000> and<00:06:52.360> that<00:06:52.780> you<00:06:52.870> know

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
because it's portable and that you know

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.080 
because it's portable and that you know
you<00:06:52.990> can<00:06:53.170> take<00:06:53.350> it<00:06:53.470> wherever<00:06:53.620> you<00:06:53.830> want<00:06:54.070> but<00:06:54.310> ah

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
you can take it wherever you want but ah

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.790 
you can take it wherever you want but ah
if<00:06:55.330> you're<00:06:55.510> really<00:06:55.810> looking<00:06:55.930> you<00:06:56.440> know<00:06:56.530> just

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
if you're really looking you know just

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.800 
if you're really looking you know just
to<00:06:56.980> get<00:06:57.400> a<00:06:57.430> good<00:06:57.610> laptop<00:06:58.030> or<00:06:58.150> a<00:06:58.180> good<00:06:58.360> computer

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
to get a good laptop or a good computer

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.970 
to get a good laptop or a good computer
at<00:06:58.900> least<00:06:58.930> I'd<00:06:59.320> recommend<00:06:59.680> going<00:06:59.740> with<00:06:59.950> a

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980 
at least I'd recommend going with a

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.500 
at least I'd recommend going with a
desktop<00:07:00.460> but<00:07:00.610> if<00:07:00.730> you<00:07:00.850> really<00:07:01.000> want<00:07:01.270> to<00:07:01.390> get

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.510 
desktop but if you really want to get

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.570 
desktop but if you really want to get
laptops<00:07:01.960> then<00:07:02.410> go<00:07:02.620> with<00:07:02.770> these<00:07:02.950> now<00:07:03.220> I'm<00:07:03.400> also

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
laptops then go with these now I'm also

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.220 
laptops then go with these now I'm also
going<00:07:03.790> to<00:07:04.000> link<00:07:04.240> an<00:07:04.390> alien<00:07:04.810> well<00:07:04.960> link<00:07:05.170> to

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
going to link an alien well link to

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.650 
going to link an alien well link to
alien<00:07:05.650> where<00:07:05.860> at<00:07:06.490> least<00:07:06.700> their<00:07:06.940> website<00:07:07.390> I

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.660 
alien where at least their website I

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.180 
alien where at least their website I
really<00:07:08.110> wouldn't<00:07:08.350> recommend<00:07:08.410> alien<00:07:09.040> where

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190 
really wouldn't recommend alien where

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.590 
really wouldn't recommend alien where
just<00:07:09.430> because<00:07:09.640> they<00:07:09.760> cost<00:07:10.000> so<00:07:10.090> much<00:07:10.240> money<00:07:10.480> and

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:10.600 
just because they cost so much money and

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.300 
just because they cost so much money and
you're<00:07:10.720> really<00:07:10.960> aren't<00:07:11.110> getting<00:07:11.500> all<00:07:12.010> too

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.310 
you're really aren't getting all too

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.830 
you're really aren't getting all too
much<00:07:12.460> power<00:07:12.700> for<00:07:12.970> the<00:07:13.060> money<00:07:13.240> it's<00:07:13.450> really<00:07:13.510> not

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 
much power for the money it's really not

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.540 
much power for the money it's really not
that<00:07:14.320> great<00:07:14.470> value<00:07:14.860> but<00:07:15.040> if<00:07:15.220> you're<00:07:15.340> really

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550 
that great value but if you're really

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.490 
that great value but if you're really
looking<00:07:15.730> for<00:07:16.150> an<00:07:16.330> over-the-top<00:07:16.690> laptop<00:07:17.260> then

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
looking for an over-the-top laptop then

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.860 
looking for an over-the-top laptop then
