Larabee my wife and I opened this about
five<00:02:17.790> years<00:02:18.000> ago<00:02:18.260> our<00:02:19.260> background<00:02:20.220> my<00:02:20.430> wife<00:02:20.610> is

years ago from being a Navy SEAL for 20

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.559 
years ago from being a Navy SEAL for 20
years<00:02:25.379> so<00:02:25.590> we<00:02:26.549> have<00:02:26.670> quite<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.000> good<00:02:27.060> experience

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
years so we have quite a good experience

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.690 
years so we have quite a good experience
at<00:02:27.870> hyper<00:02:28.049> airfield<00:02:28.650> science<00:02:29.549> behind

at hyper airfield science behind

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.780 
at hyper airfield science behind
hyperbaric<00:02:30.329> therapy<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:31.250> pretty<00:02:32.250> much<00:02:32.400> when

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
hyperbaric therapy is pretty much when

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.940 
hyperbaric therapy is pretty much when
you<00:02:32.910> go<00:02:33.239> inside<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.720> chamber<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.260> be<00:02:34.440> under

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
you go inside the chamber you be under

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.759 
you go inside the chamber you be under
pressure<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.840> right<00:02:36.840> now<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.349> I<00:02:37.470> breathe

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
pressure and right now you and I breathe

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.410 
pressure and right now you and I breathe
twenty<00:02:38.129> one<00:02:38.250> percent<00:02:38.400> oxygen<00:02:38.760> when<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.269> go

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
twenty one percent oxygen when you go

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.580 
twenty one percent oxygen when you go
inside<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.870> chamber<00:02:40.079> you<00:02:40.379> breathe<00:02:40.560> one

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
inside the chamber you breathe one

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.890 
inside the chamber you breathe one
hundred<00:02:40.980> percent<00:02:41.010> oxygen<00:02:41.540> but<00:02:42.540> when<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.780> go

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
hundred percent oxygen but when you go

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.390 
hundred percent oxygen but when you go
down<00:02:43.049> and<00:02:43.079> pressure<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.799> partial<00:02:44.190> pressure

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
down and pressure the partial pressure

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.050 
down and pressure the partial pressure
of<00:02:44.519> oxygen<00:02:44.639> increase<00:02:45.329> so<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.810> gets<00:02:46.109> to<00:02:46.380> your

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
of oxygen increase so that gets to your

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.210 
of oxygen increase so that gets to your
in<00:02:48.060> your<00:02:48.239> bloodstream<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:49.200> circulation<00:02:50.010> is

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
in your bloodstream the circulation is

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.809 
in your bloodstream the circulation is
improved<00:02:50.750> flow<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.870> blood<00:02:52.489> swelling<00:02:53.489> will<00:02:53.790> go

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
improved flow of blood swelling will go

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.449 
improved flow of blood swelling will go
down<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.930> if<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.349> have<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> post-surgery<00:02:56.130> the

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
down so if you have a post-surgery the

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.180 
down so if you have a post-surgery the
swelling<00:02:56.790> will<00:02:56.880> go<00:02:56.940> down<00:02:57.060> bruising<00:02:58.190> will

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
swelling will go down bruising will

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.879 
swelling will go down bruising will
decrease<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:00.810> we<00:03:00.959> do<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.109> lot<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.319> our<00:03:01.530> sports

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
decrease so we do a lot of our sports

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.620 
decrease so we do a lot of our sports
people<00:03:02.160> here<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.760> we<00:03:02.849> do<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> quite<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.329> few<00:03:03.540> of
