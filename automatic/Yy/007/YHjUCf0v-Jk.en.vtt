00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
be rushed put mine let me look at some

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.590 
be rushed put mine let me look at some
of<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.670> too<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:05.909> you'll<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.270> how<00:01:06.390> they've

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
of you too but you'll see how they've

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.840 
of you too but you'll see how they've
put<00:01:06.810> them<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:07.020> essence<00:01:07.650> shows<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.729> here

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
put them on essence shows out here

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.270 
put them on essence shows out here
exactly<00:01:09.240> where<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.450> put<00:01:09.659> them

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
exactly where to put them

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.830 
exactly where to put them
so<00:01:11.280> looks<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:11.549> actually<00:01:11.880> spells<00:01:12.240> beyblade

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
so looks like actually spells beyblade

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.580 
so looks like actually spells beyblade
there's<00:01:13.110> Hien<00:01:14.299> that<00:01:15.299> closer<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.960> it's

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
there's Hien that closer for you it's

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.920 
there's Hien that closer for you it's
got<00:01:16.770> all<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.920> letters<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.250> beyblade

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
got all the letters of beyblade

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.870 
got all the letters of beyblade
it<00:01:18.930> says<00:01:19.170> attack-type<00:01:19.979> beystadium

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
it says attack-type beystadium

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
it says attack-type beystadium
it's<00:01:21.060> backwards<00:01:21.299> there<00:01:21.659> obviously<00:01:22.140> because<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
it's backwards there obviously because I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.700 
it's backwards there obviously because I
think<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.460> attach<00:01:24.000> these<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> bottom<00:01:25.439> of

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
think you attach these to the bottom of

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.819 
think you attach these to the bottom of
the<00:01:26.189> base<00:01:26.400> Stadium<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.829> beyblade

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the base Stadium so it's the beyblade

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.740 
the base Stadium so it's the beyblade
ease<00:01:29.040> when<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.189> actually<00:01:29.310> battle<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.390> top<00:01:30.630> of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
ease when I actually battle on top of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.859 
ease when I actually battle on top of
the<00:01:30.810> stickers<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:32.220> they're<00:01:33.119> backwards<00:01:33.659> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
the stickers so they're backwards you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.210 
the stickers so they're backwards you
probably<00:01:33.930> peel<00:01:34.259> them<00:01:34.409> off<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.680> then<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
probably peel them off and then the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.770 
probably peel them off and then the
teeth<00:01:35.400> these<00:01:35.939> pieces<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> other<00:01:36.420> side

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
teeth these pieces on the other side

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.050 
teeth these pieces on the other side
used<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> got<00:01:37.890> underneath<00:01:38.280> then<00:01:38.759> I'll<00:01:38.850> be

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
used to got underneath then I'll be

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.420 
used to got underneath then I'll be
right<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.869> correct<00:01:40.110> way

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
right in the correct way

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.620 
right in the correct way
that's<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.729> played<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> couple<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.299> times

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
that's just be played a couple of times

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.300 
that's just be played a couple of times
those<00:01:43.049> are<00:01:43.140> all<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> same<00:01:43.470> couple<00:01:44.070> different

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
those are all the same couple different

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.499 
those are all the same couple different
sizes<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:48.680> let's<00:01:49.680> see<00:01:49.950> let's<00:01:50.220> pry<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.030> Japanese

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
sizes so let's see let's pry on Japanese

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.550 
sizes so let's see let's pry on Japanese
but<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:53.360> kind<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.450> gives<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.140> an<00:01:55.229> idea<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
but it's kind of gives you an idea of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.830 
but it's kind of gives you an idea of
where<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.920> put<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> stickers<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.670> guess<00:01:56.880> but

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
where to put the stickers I guess but

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.120 
where to put the stickers I guess but
I'm<00:01:58.020> sure<00:01:58.200> there's<00:01:58.380> no<00:01:58.500> right<00:01:58.710> or<00:01:58.740> wrong<00:01:58.860> way

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
I'm sure there's no right or wrong way

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.249 
I'm sure there's no right or wrong way
to<00:01:59.159> go<00:01:59.610> about<00:01:59.640> that<00:02:02.360> I'm<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.420> gonna<00:02:03.659> go<00:02:04.140> over

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
to go about that I'm just gonna go over

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.310 
to go about that I'm just gonna go over

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
know but calmly know the best way to go

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.970 
know but calmly know the best way to go
about<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:11.260> I'm<00:03:12.260> not<00:03:12.379> sure<00:03:12.500> if<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.650> really

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980

showed<00:03:13.489> oh<00:03:15.069> okay<00:03:16.069> I<00:03:16.099> hear<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.459> kind<00:03:16.760> of<00:03:16.790> shows

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:21.699 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:23.920 

it<00:03:22.699> so<00:03:22.849> kind<00:03:23.030> of<00:03:23.120> hard<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.299> understand<00:03:23.780> what

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930

that picture is trying to explain feel
free<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.819> do<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:35.229> but<00:03:36.229> I'll<00:03:36.889> take<00:03:37.099> a<00:03:37.129> closer

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
free to do so but I'll take a closer

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.740 
free to do so but I'll take a closer
look<00:03:37.400> at<00:03:37.579> this<00:03:37.669> off<00:03:37.970> camera<00:03:38.299> here<00:03:38.479> and<00:03:38.510> see<00:03:38.690> if

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
look at this off camera here and see if

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.969 
look at this off camera here and see if
I<00:03:38.810> can<00:03:38.959> figure<00:03:39.079> it<00:03:39.199> out<00:03:39.319> tied<00:03:39.799> with<00:03:39.889> the
