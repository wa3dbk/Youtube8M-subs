00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.509
 I would like to take a closer look at enforcement 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.749
 I'll do it. There's a part of the consul that I do not understand. 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.980
 It was edited in video. 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.019
 As for the trot 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.080
 If you use 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.390
 In the case of closed vcm on the subway, 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.149
 This harsh winter, of course, 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.800
 The quality from Turkey to the end 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.730
 Good 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.950
 Conversely, the problem is common 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.950
 Oh, let's see all the problems. 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.340
 It should not have been a slogan on the wrong side. 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.100
 There is a problem that this interval is too wide. 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.100
 Now, Judge, if you get this part of the game, 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.470
 Some people think that they will help you in your life. 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.270
 Because the verdict is six leafy leaves, 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.799
 It is not easy to catch 8 over on Vista now. 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.910
 On the other hand, 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.580
 I know that if you change that assistant, 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.380
 I have. 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.860
 As you have explained, 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.970
 Even if there is no end of the second year 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.970
 This not only makes the structure much more stable 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.369
 The magazine will also be integrated with the new party Fana. 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.750
 In Post Names 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 I'm explaining, but trust me 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.520
 The second in the telecommunications company is said to be today 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.720
 Yes, it is. 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.290
 We have a new meaning to match. 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.430
 You'd better make a prepayment. 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.860
 now 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.219
 So it's bright 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.520
 Become a thief 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.520
 There are also shoes at the Academy of Sciences. 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.800
 I want to protect my second movie for the best codes. 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.510
 Do not forget to get down, yeah. 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.010
 wish
