00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.359
 Hey, what are you guys doing today? 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.700
 I come to teach how to escape the 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.920
 haunted house in the new call dlc 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.140
 of duty for it we will first occupy 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.300
 our friend the big guy if they do not know 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.080
 how to use it I will leave a link 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.080
 in the description 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.220
 once we have the door open 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.830
 let's go to the house and go to 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.800
 see that the witch or ghost is going to start 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.740
 to talk and disappear then we open the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.480
 door and we follow the arrows when 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.850
 let's go in here you have to have a lot 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.559
 be careful because if we get a witch we 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.710
 will remove all the money we have 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.989
 as you can see I have 920 suddenly I 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.210
 touch and I do not have anything at all 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.550
 money 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.920
 well once this is done we have to 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.020
 climb the stairs and enter a 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.570
 room where there is going to be a piece of furniture 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.780
 bookseller and we have to stop next to 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.059
 him to be able to go out as you can see there 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.220
 is the furniture is a bookseller next to the 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.739
 bed and the only thing we're going to have to 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.560
 to do is to stand next to him and he's going to 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.240
 open a secret room there is the only one 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.240
 way by which you will be able to escape 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.479
 we go to the bottom and we go through 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.360
 a series of rooms until you arrive 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.450
 as a nursery type of a garden we go down 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.210
 stairs and there to fund 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.310
 find the cow punch after 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.780
 crossing this labyrinth is not always the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.330
 same way since the doors are 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.540
 move open and close 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.400
 and then to escape waters that are at 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.950
 there is a hole in the bottom and if you fall 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.830
 the game next to pay punch but for 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.540
 get away you have to come to this 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:51.110
 part of here to the opposite side of where 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.110
 we came up a few stairs 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.510
 we climb more stairs 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.320
 we went through this dark tunnel 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.450
 and after walking a while longer 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.929
 We went right in front of the fountain 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.700
