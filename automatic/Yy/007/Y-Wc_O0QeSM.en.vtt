00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 fine 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.429
 Now we're going to screw and more. 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.860
 or less 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.230
 however that this kit with virus he 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.740
 I do not know how much to give in grams. 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:22.710
 I'll ask later to see how much of the handle 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.350
 This much plays in a larger pot now 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.800
 Catch you see him just a little bit that I 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.800
 I will like 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:45.540
 I'll be right back, give me the camera in my hand. 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:49.470
 Now the strong man is going to pick up and go. 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:53.879
 make a joint with her you see him 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.699
 stirring always goes to paste 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.589
 the amount of water is not accurate for 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.760
 each item requires a quantity 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:13.200
 different from water so it will put it in the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:18.170
 ideal filling is to make two people the same 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:23.100
 to a seesaw so take the liberty 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:26.479
 now for a little courage to move 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.479
 to see the people who will give 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:41.580
 always pulling the balls that have 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:49.340
 a little something there I think it spoons 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:59.360
 dick he takes it out of wood password 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:59.360
 continue to tinker another link 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.260
 it is 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.780
 you 're already at the pyramid point 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.980
 although the epilogue kettle 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:45.650
 now puts now puts and margarine 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.200
 margarine and the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:54.080
 egg that amount spent 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:03:02.420
 revenue only missed the first salt of the 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:05.740
 unit of the iaaf is completed with the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.880
 rest of the people we will put there 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.880
 more or less a tablespoon 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:26.280
 then you have to use your hands as if we 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.280
 who will only grow the team used their hands 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:43.659
 then it feels good to mix well 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:55.709
 be well homogeneous and now will get the 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:55.709
 salt starting at the break in this business 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.970
 good forrÃ³ 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:19.160
 at first a tablespoon of salt 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.280
 it depends very much on the taste of each and 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.190
 I like the hand thread with too much salt not 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:33.160
 I would like and put as much as I want 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:33.160
 now it's catch or video 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:59.530
 listening to dry will now slowly go 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.889
 adding by coming while stirring 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.889
 with a spoon 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:27.960
 It's time to feel that it's not over. 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:39.240
 fiddle with the spoon 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:47.180
 You put your hands together while I was there. 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:47.180
 You'll hear the people live. 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:10.539
 is more or less the amount of people who 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:12.460
 you put on the first art is more or 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:21.810
 less the same amount you will 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:50.409
 put on the na in the second free so 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:52.979
 We're going to talk it down a little bit now. 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:57.120
 was more or less the same amount of 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:57.120
 sprinkle that was in the first step 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.570
 but a little bit of saying but it's normal 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:39.290
 Now move well now, let me take it. 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.290
 dry to see if it 's in the 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.650
 Almost almost 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.150
 I think it's already on the point and after that 

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.560
 It cools a little, it will stop. 

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:59.150
 change is at the point 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:08:02.580
 this is the point of mass very close as well 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:04.530
 this is the point that ours is with the 

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:08.250
 ball begins to change in the mouth and not one 

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:13.430
 dough that now grips 

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:13.430
 since then begins as the rolls
