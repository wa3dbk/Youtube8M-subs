00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
backfield and Eric Ebron is gonna get

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.080

that<00:03:17.560> but<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.739> nice<00:03:18.070> touchdown<00:03:18.549> saving<00:03:18.940> tackle

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
that but a nice touchdown saving tackle

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.690 
that but a nice touchdown saving tackle
I<00:03:19.630> think<00:03:20.019> that<00:03:20.140> was<00:03:20.230> by<00:03:20.380> Trey<00:03:20.650> Wayne's<00:03:20.950> as<00:03:21.250> it's

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
I think that was by Trey Wayne's as it's

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.240 
I think that was by Trey Wayne's as it's
