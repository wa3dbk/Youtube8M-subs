inside<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.649> ourselves<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.489> don't<00:00:56.789> feel

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
inside of ourselves we really don't feel

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.760 
inside of ourselves we really don't feel
resolved<00:00:58.730> and<00:00:59.730> have<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.930> healthy<00:01:01.199> sexual

functioning within ourselves so

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.800 
functioning within ourselves so
sometimes<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.670> tend<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.790> distract<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.659> go

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810

was just there was no guidance and so a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.980 
was just there was no guidance and so a
lot<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.490> these<00:01:35.670> times<00:01:35.939> these<00:01:36.299> guys<00:01:36.509> grow<00:01:36.780> up

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
lot of these times these guys grow up

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.440 
lot of these times these guys grow up
and<00:01:37.229> they're<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.310> relationships<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.329> then

and they're in relationships and then

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.480 
and they're in relationships and then
end<00:01:39.630> up<00:01:39.750> developing<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.320> wandering<00:01:40.829> eye<00:01:41.070> or

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
end up developing a wandering eye or

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.840 
end up developing a wandering eye or
getting<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.270> porn<00:01:42.570> or<00:01:43.110> somehow<00:01:43.850> starts

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
getting a porn or somehow starts

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.999 
getting a porn or somehow starts
investing<00:01:45.689> energy<00:01:45.869> outside<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.799> their

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
investing energy outside of their

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.630 
investing energy outside of their
primary<00:01:47.579> relationship<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.570> doesn't

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
primary relationship and that doesn't

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.010 
primary relationship and that doesn't
work<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> long<00:01:51.090> run<00:01:51.119> because<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.899> just

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
work in the long run because it just

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.499 
work in the long run because it just
ends<00:01:52.409> up<00:01:52.530> upsetting<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.880> wife<00:01:54.119> or<00:01:54.270> girlfriend

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
ends up upsetting the wife or girlfriend

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.190 
ends up upsetting the wife or girlfriend
so<00:01:55.100> I<00:01:56.100> think<00:01:56.969> that's<00:01:57.149> definitely<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.049> good

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
so I think that's definitely a good

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.920 
so I think that's definitely a good
point<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.770> think<00:01:59.130> about<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.880> know<00:01:59.909> am<00:02:00.270> I

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
point to think about you know am I

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.170 
point to think about you know am I
unresolved<00:02:01.469> sexually<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.430> there<00:02:02.670> enema<00:02:03.000> see

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
unresolved sexually are there enema see

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.209 
unresolved sexually are there enema see
problems<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.810> my<00:02:03.960> current<00:02:04.229> relationship<00:02:04.439> I

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
problems in my current relationship I

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.310 
problems in my current relationship I
think<00:02:05.759> those<00:02:05.969> are<00:02:06.000> signs<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.810> start<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.200> look

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
think those are signs to start to look

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.420 
think those are signs to start to look
out<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:09.319> when<00:02:10.319> you're<00:02:10.530> looking<00:02:10.890> for<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
out for when you're looking for the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.460 
out for when you're looking for the
underlying<00:02:12.180> issues

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
underlying issues

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.690 
underlying issues
around<00:02:14.310> sexual<00:02:14.910> problems<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.580> just

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
around sexual problems so this is just
