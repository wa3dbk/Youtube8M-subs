00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.840
 i 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.430
 ah 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:19.840
 or they are missing I am that this time 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:23.080
 I bring what would be a mod a 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.000
 new game new so that what 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.539
 download will be in the archives 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.310
 shared neither gamertag is and osman days 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.680
 and they will see it on the screen 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.070
 consist right now they're watching I'm 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.640
 waiting for weapons faster 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.630
 this is divided in two you can expect more 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.030
 quick to arms and you can also the 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.920
 killing when the beams are in 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.570
 slow motion can be seen in detail 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.570
 everything that is happening 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.930
 and you will also notice that the ammunition is 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.300
 infinite they stay there is to recharge 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.850
 nothing can see the top corner 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.780
 left and you may notice that you have all 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.629
 the grenades 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.560
 now appear 60 of the two that 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.619
 they always leave us 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.619
 here for example I'm going to grab this 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.649
 vehicle the box can also see that 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.590
 will shoot very fast so if 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.560
 you put like a road that forms 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.500
 in front of him how to wrap the future 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.800
 I can also point to the sun and there 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.070
 can see 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.040
 they can write and all that too 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.570
 can experiment with other vehicles 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.360
 for example lavanchy also does this 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.320
 the scorpion tank also makes it more 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.910
 I'll show you later in a few clicks 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.890
 that are going to appear here so they can see 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.650
 how is this come to vitaly studying to 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.020
 clouds 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.150
 and now they will see what would be the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.880
 second part which are the murders 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.939
 here are the murders 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.930
 does not have when then with weapons 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.849
 be in zombie mode and return to mode 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.000
 is strong in with murder station 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.760
 and that's how it looks, I'm not doing it 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.069
 to a slow if you will notice it when 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.730
 download in this that I leave in the 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.730
 shared files 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.090
 is I think the only modification that 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.489
 I have but the description of the video 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.120
 there will be a link so that 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.120
 download it 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.560
 you see in detail how they break you 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:42.080
 head and goes spinning almost almost 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.630
 data the turn I also leave another 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.890
 animation when the next animation 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.850
 it's going to be one where 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:55.150
 you're already a clan couple you have to get to her 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.510
 running tt clan on one side and there 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.310
 it's late it takes some time 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.340
 That's when they are very close together 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.200
 spartans is edited appears the typical meme 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.379
 down there on the screen 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.930
 and try to separate the hidden face 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:15.260
 he takes out the knife and he's going to bury him in 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.950
 the eye and that's when it happens that they kill 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.900
 to your carriers 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.620
 when it contains a quick but already 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.190
 you know it 's slow motion 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.780
 and the last the last murder is the 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.640
 that they are going to see right now that is in the air 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.980
 so they see how first there is 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.930
 they broke the shields then it seems that 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.750
 nothing more pink a little with the knife 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.710
 over the shoulder of sporting 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:47.030
 the curtain comes to notice 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.460
 and already with that blow everything is just when 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.580
 they kill him 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.310
 and already in slow motion and the last thing 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.370
 he wants you to notice was this that is like 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:02.200
 a multicolored rainbow made with pure 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:05.050
 bullets or rather they are loads overloads 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.980
 of plasma that uses the vehicle write 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:12.430
 there they will be able to see how it shows 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.020
 Now there 's also the scorpion tank 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.630
 so they can see how he shoots too 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.420
 Quick 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.450
 and I'm going to leave bullet casings 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.420
 there are on the sides if they want to see it and 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.940
 finally I only ask you to leave your 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.190
 like subscribe and share it with your 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.730
 friends and also download see it the 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.730
 super final
