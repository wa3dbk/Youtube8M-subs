no little cranny for these drones to go
into<00:03:33.090> for<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.510> supermicro<00:03:34.260> that<00:03:34.530> use<00:03:34.680> against

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
into for the supermicro that use against

into for the supermicro that use against
quickly<00:03:35.310> yeah<00:03:35.519> that's<00:03:35.700> true<00:03:35.879> so<00:03:36.420> definitely<00:03:36.840> a

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
sudas and he's already getting his urban

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.789 
sudas and he's already getting his urban
speed<00:03:53.930> you<00:03:54.930> know<00:03:55.019> there<00:03:55.170> are<00:03:55.200> going<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.650> be<00:03:55.709> a

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
speed you know there are going to be a

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.149 
speed you know there are going to be a
bunch<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.099> wings<00:03:56.310> popping<00:03:56.609> out<00:03:56.670> for<00:03:56.909> Ragnarok

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
bunch of wings popping out for Ragnarok

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.679 
bunch of wings popping out for Ragnarok
so<00:03:59.159> many<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.370> his<00:03:59.459> drones<00:03:59.670> are<00:03:59.819> low<00:03:59.969> here<00:04:00.269> too

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
so many of his drones are low here too

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.420 
so many of his drones are low here too
yeah<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.170> don't<00:04:01.230> think<00:04:01.829> he's<00:04:02.069> gonna<00:04:02.219> get

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
yeah I don't think he's gonna get

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.069 
yeah I don't think he's gonna get
another<00:04:02.639> one<00:04:02.849> it<00:04:03.359> seems<00:04:03.689> like<00:04:03.780> there's<00:04:04.019> just

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
another one it seems like there's just

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.869 
another one it seems like there's just
too<00:04:04.319> many<00:04:04.409> links<00:04:04.680> here<00:04:04.920> in<00:04:05.069> reg<00:04:05.370> rocks<00:04:05.579> falling

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
too many links here in reg rocks falling

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.819 
too many links here in reg rocks falling
him<00:04:06.060> correctly<00:04:06.359> but<00:04:06.599> um<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:07.560> know<00:04:07.650> his

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
him correctly but um you know his

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.470 
him correctly but um you know his
economy<00:04:08.249> has<00:04:08.340> been<00:04:08.400> pretty<00:04:08.609> shattered<00:04:08.849> it's

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
economy has been pretty shattered it's

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.319 
economy has been pretty shattered it's
look<00:04:10.109> at<00:04:10.200> this<00:04:10.260> he's<00:04:10.469> going<00:04:10.620> into<00:04:10.799> Ling's

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
look at this he's going into Ling's

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.360 
look at this he's going into Ling's
speed<00:04:12.329> plus<00:04:12.599> pain<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.139> against<00:04:13.889> 10<00:04:14.129> drones

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
speed plus pain and against 10 drones

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.140 
speed plus pain and against 10 drones
when<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.359> have<00:04:15.480> two<00:04:15.629> hatches<00:04:16.079> like<00:04:17.090> what<00:04:18.090> do

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
when you have two hatches like what do

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.849 
when you have two hatches like what do
you<00:04:18.180> do<00:04:18.420> here<00:04:18.450> because<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.109> cannot<00:04:19.590> possibly

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
you do here because you cannot possibly

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.319 
you do here because you cannot possibly
defend<00:04:20.400> everything<00:04:20.670> you<00:04:20.850> don't<00:04:21.000> have<00:04:21.150> enough

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
defend everything you don't have enough

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.090 
defend everything you don't have enough
money<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.720> get<00:04:21.989> cleans<00:04:22.350> out<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.770> block<00:04:22.950> the

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
money to get cleans out to block the

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.940 
money to get cleans out to block the
ramp<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.880> can't<00:04:24.540> guard<00:04:24.900> both<00:04:25.139> locations<00:04:25.650> with

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
ramp you can't guard both locations with

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.390 
ramp you can't guard both locations with
spines<00:04:26.450> you<00:04:27.450> can't<00:04:27.750> really<00:04:28.410> even<00:04:28.860> do<00:04:29.220> much

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
spines you can't really even do much

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.860 
spines you can't really even do much
with<00:04:29.550> your<00:04:29.639> gas<00:04:29.820> i<00:04:30.030> guess<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.270> best<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.750> could

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
with your gas i guess the best you could

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.410 
with your gas i guess the best you could
do<00:04:30.990> is<00:04:31.139> go<00:04:31.290> for<00:04:31.440> a<00:04:31.500> family<00:04:31.710> nest<00:04:32.180> but<00:04:33.180> i<00:04:33.240> mean

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
do is go for a family nest but i mean

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.850 
do is go for a family nest but i mean
are<00:04:33.600> you<00:04:33.690> gonna<00:04:33.780> out<00:04:34.080> micra<00:04:34.350> with<00:04:34.440> so<00:04:34.650> Ling's

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
are you gonna out micra with so Ling's

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.640 
are you gonna out micra with so Ling's
in<00:04:34.950> a<00:04:35.010> vane<00:04:35.250> against<00:04:35.820> speedling<00:04:36.810> bane<00:04:37.050> well

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
in a vane against speedling bane well

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.809 
in a vane against speedling bane well
you're<00:04:37.950> definitely<00:04:38.190> going<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.580> lose<00:04:38.610> your

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
you're definitely going to lose your

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:40.999 
you're definitely going to lose your
natural<00:04:39.210> hatchery<00:04:39.569> I<00:04:39.630> would<00:04:39.780> say<00:04:39.990> yeah<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.620> in

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
natural hatchery I would say yeah and in

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.950 
natural hatchery I would say yeah and in
that<00:04:41.039> case<00:04:41.340> it's<00:04:41.669> like<00:04:41.880> your<00:04:42.509> opponent<00:04:42.840> who

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
that case it's like your opponent who

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.530 
that case it's like your opponent who
has<00:04:43.169> more

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
has more

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.270 
has more
drones<00:04:43.750> can<00:04:44.110> just<00:04:44.290> expand<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:44.980> gets<00:04:45.100> ahead

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
drones can just expand and gets ahead

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.460 
drones can just expand and gets ahead
this<00:04:45.460> is<00:04:45.610> it's<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.240> great<00:04:46.390> show<00:04:46.660> up<00:04:46.870> by<00:04:47.020> Sue<00:04:47.230> and

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
this is it's a great show up by Sue and

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.980 
this is it's a great show up by Sue and
I<00:04:47.500> think<00:04:48.400> Ragnarok<00:04:48.850> is<00:04:48.880> in<00:04:49.210> a<00:04:49.270> lot<00:04:49.510> of<00:04:49.570> trouble

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
I think Ragnarok is in a lot of trouble

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.690 
I think Ragnarok is in a lot of trouble
here<00:04:50.170> I<00:04:50.350> think<00:04:50.830> so<00:04:50.980> he's<00:04:51.220> going<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.400> go<00:04:51.550> for

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
here I think so he's going to go for

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.450 
here I think so he's going to go for
that<00:04:51.790> band<00:04:51.970> leanest<00:04:52.950> like<00:04:53.950> actually<00:04:54.280> making

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
that band leanest like actually making

there right now making as much as he can
but<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.050> really<00:05:20.440> like<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.740> choice<00:05:20.950> of<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.220> wall

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
but I really like the choice of the wall

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.860 
but I really like the choice of the wall
and<00:05:21.640> the<00:05:21.820> fact<00:05:22.000> that<00:05:22.060> he's<00:05:22.210> trying<00:05:22.420> to<00:05:22.540> defend

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
and the fact that he's trying to defend

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.270 
and the fact that he's trying to defend
at<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.230> natural<00:05:23.560> with<00:05:23.650> wings<00:05:23.830> on<00:05:23.950> the<00:05:24.010> ramp<00:05:24.160> I

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
at the natural with wings on the ramp I

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.500 
at the natural with wings on the ramp I
think<00:05:24.460> that's<00:05:24.580> really<00:05:25.060> really<00:05:25.240> intelligent

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
think that's really really intelligent

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.400 
think that's really really intelligent
well<00:05:26.290> I<00:05:26.410> don't<00:05:26.620> know<00:05:26.740> jeje<00:05:27.450> thing<00:05:28.450> is<00:05:28.600> you<00:05:29.320> know

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
well I don't know jeje thing is you know

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.130 
well I don't know jeje thing is you know
as<00:05:29.730> everything<00:05:30.730> I<00:05:30.820> explained<00:05:31.480> before<00:05:31.570> really

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
as everything I explained before really

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.680 
as everything I explained before really
points<00:05:32.620> out<00:05:32.790> you<00:05:33.790> know<00:05:33.850> that's<00:05:34.060> it's<00:05:34.390> like<00:05:34.510> an

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
points out you know that's it's like an

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.030 
points out you know that's it's like an
impossible<00:05:34.900> situation<00:05:35.290> how<00:05:35.620> you<00:05:35.680> defend<00:05:35.890> all

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
impossible situation how you defend all

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.250 
impossible situation how you defend all
that<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.400> think<00:05:36.730> it<00:05:36.820> was<00:05:36.970> the<00:05:37.600> right<00:05:37.630> way<00:05:37.900> to<00:05:37.960> try

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
that I think it was the right way to try

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.610 
that I think it was the right way to try
but<00:05:38.590> to<00:05:39.520> just<00:05:39.850> to<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.510> the<00:05:40.600> point<00:05:40.870> there<00:05:41.110> yeah

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
but to just to to the point there yeah

before we go into true vs. trap which is
going<00:06:33.370> to<00:06:33.430> be<00:06:33.490> somewhat<00:06:34.240> difficult<00:06:34.270> to<00:06:34.810> say

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020
