try<00:00:30.510> whistling<00:00:30.900> with<00:00:34.250> and<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:35.460> think

try whistling with and then think

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.150 
try whistling with and then think
carefully<00:00:36.000> about<00:00:36.470> exactly<00:00:37.470> what<00:00:37.829> your<00:00:37.950> tongue

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
carefully about exactly what your tongue

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.590 
carefully about exactly what your tongue
is<00:00:38.309> doing<00:00:38.610> where<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:38.970> moving<00:00:39.360> where<00:00:39.540> it

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
is doing where it's moving where it

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.750 
is doing where it's moving where it
touches<00:00:39.870> inside<00:00:40.380> your<00:00:40.620> mouth<00:00:40.800> where<00:00:41.670> it

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
touches inside your mouth where it

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.490 
touches inside your mouth where it
touches<00:00:41.969> your<00:00:42.239> teeth<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.020> then<00:00:43.230> think<00:00:43.440> about

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
touches your teeth and then think about

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.990 
touches your teeth and then think about
what<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> air<00:00:44.070> will<00:00:44.219> be<00:00:44.340> doing<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.820> goes

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
what the air will be doing as it goes

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.790 
what the air will be doing as it goes
over<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> top<00:00:45.540> of<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:45.960> tongue<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.590> is

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
over the top of your tongue and is

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.880 
over the top of your tongue and is
focused<00:00:47.250> right<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> front<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> mouth

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
focused right to the front of the mouth

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.770 
focused right to the front of the mouth
also<00:00:49.890> think<00:00:50.100> about<00:00:50.160> how<00:00:50.309> much<00:00:50.640> air<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.180> or<00:00:51.540> in

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
also think about how much air is or in

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.959 
also think about how much air is or in
fact<00:00:52.020> isn't<00:00:52.260> being<00:00:52.620> used<00:00:52.710> there's<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.610> tiny

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
fact isn't being used there's a tiny

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.729 
fact isn't being used there's a tiny
amount<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.510> air<00:00:54.629> when<00:00:54.930> we're<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.170> our<00:00:55.320> whistle

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
amount of air when we're in our whistle

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.830 
amount of air when we're in our whistle
position<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.149> exactly<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.660> same

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
position and this is exactly the same

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.380 
position and this is exactly the same
when<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.289> add<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.010> saxophone<00:01:02.460> take

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
when we add this to the saxophone take

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.990 
when we add this to the saxophone take
an<00:01:03.510> easy<00:01:03.600> fingering<00:01:04.170> for<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> harmonic<00:01:05.000> octave

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
an easy fingering for a harmonic octave

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.419 
an easy fingering for a harmonic octave
key<00:01:06.210> from<00:01:06.929> F<00:01:07.200> should<00:01:07.859> give<00:01:08.009> you<00:01:08.130> something

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:08.429 
key from F should give you something

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:14.190 
key from F should give you something
approaching<00:01:08.639> a<00:01:08.880> high<00:01:08.999> D

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.300 

and<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:15.290> should<00:01:15.440> learn<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.620> generate<00:01:15.860> that

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
and you should learn to generate that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.580 
and you should learn to generate that
flexibility<00:01:16.910> by<00:01:17.240> moving<00:01:17.570> your<00:01:17.690> tongue<00:01:18.020> not

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
flexibility by moving your tongue not

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.300 
your jaw if I move my jaw the note
simply<00:01:25.400> stops<00:01:25.760> all<00:01:26.690> of<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.130> control<00:01:28.130> of<00:01:28.160> the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
sound and the control of the pitch is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.440 
sound and the control of the pitch is
done<00:01:30.620> with<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.220> area<00:01:31.550> of<00:01:31.670> very<00:01:31.910> front<00:01:32.240> of<00:01:32.330> your

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.280 
mouth as it enters enters the saxophone
itself<00:01:36.850> it's<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.210> important<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:38.990> get<00:01:39.140> this

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
itself it's so important to get this

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.790 
itself it's so important to get this
right

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
right

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.350 
right
but<00:01:40.070> once<00:01:40.220> you've<00:01:40.370> learned<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:40.760> generate<00:01:41.180> the

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
but once you've learned to generate the

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.480 
but once you've learned to generate the
pitch<00:01:41.570> using<00:01:42.110> your<00:01:42.380> tongue<00:01:42.560> in<00:01:42.710> this<00:01:42.830> way<00:01:43.040> you

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
pitch using your tongue in this way you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.370 
pitch using your tongue in this way you
can<00:01:43.640> override<00:01:43.970> pretty<00:01:44.540> much<00:01:44.720> every<00:01:45.020> fingering

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
can override pretty much every fingering

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.200 
can override pretty much every fingering
on<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.530> saxophone<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.700> you<00:01:46.820> can<00:01:46.970> buy<00:01:47.060> any

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
on the saxophone and you can buy any

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:57.470 
on the saxophone and you can buy any
harmonic<00:01:47.570> with<00:01:48.050> anything

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.180 

depending<00:01:58.480> on<00:01:58.570> where<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:58.990> focus<00:01:59.410> the<00:01:59.560> air<00:01:59.710> as

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
depending on where you focus the air as

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.550 
depending on where you focus the air as
the<00:02:00.490> node<00:02:00.910> where<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.450> waveform<00:02:01.960> starts<00:02:02.410> is

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
the node where the waveform starts is

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.500 
the node where the waveform starts is
inside<00:02:03.010> your<00:02:03.190> mouth<00:02:03.340> on<00:02:03.640> your<00:02:03.880> tongue<00:02:04.150> this

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
inside your mouth on your tongue this

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.360 
inside your mouth on your tongue this
overrides<00:02:05.230> pretty<00:02:05.650> much<00:02:05.800> everything<00:02:06.190> on<00:02:06.280> the

overrides pretty much everything on the
