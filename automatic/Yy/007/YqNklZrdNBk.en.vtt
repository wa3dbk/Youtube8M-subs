weather tires we're going to carry out
two<00:00:55.280> tests<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:56.330> first<00:00:56.600> is<00:00:56.809> a<00:00:56.870> braking<00:00:57.409> test

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
two tests the first is a braking test

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.079 
two tests the first is a braking test
which<00:00:58.010> will<00:00:58.190> show<00:00:58.369> clearly<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.909> difference

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
which will show clearly the difference

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.240 
which will show clearly the difference
in<00:00:59.449> stopping<00:01:00.019> distances<00:01:00.500> for<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.769> two<00:01:00.949> tires

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
in stopping distances for the two tires

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.549 
in stopping distances for the two tires
the<00:01:01.879> second<00:01:02.269> is<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.420> cornering<00:01:02.960> test<00:01:03.229> which

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
the second is a cornering test which

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.109 
the second is a cornering test which
will<00:01:03.739> show<00:01:03.890> how<00:01:04.129> effective<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.760> different

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
will show how effective the different

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.160 
will show how effective the different
tires<00:01:05.360> are<00:01:05.570> at<00:01:05.750> gripping<00:01:06.229> in<00:01:06.320> cold<00:01:06.590> conditions

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.630 

so<00:01:12.170> let's<00:01:12.560> show<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.890> difference<00:01:13.280> with<00:01:13.490> two

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
so let's show the difference with two

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.580 
so let's show the difference with two
virtually<00:01:14.090> identical<00:01:14.600> cars<00:01:14.840> except<00:01:15.500> the
