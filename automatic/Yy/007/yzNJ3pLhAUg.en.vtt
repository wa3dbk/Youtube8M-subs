00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
and we'll do a position hold so position

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.200 
and we'll do a position hold so position
hold<00:00:53.590> and<00:00:53.890> return<00:00:54.640> to<00:00:54.730> home<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:57.730> very<00:00:57.940> slow

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
okay so so we're heading up nice and

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.430 
okay so so we're heading up nice and
slow<00:01:51.400> I'm<00:01:51.880> not<00:01:52.060> touching<00:01:52.300> anything<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.140> we

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
slow I'm not touching anything and we

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.370 
slow I'm not touching anything and we
hit<00:01:53.590> altitude<00:01:54.070> hold<00:01:54.510> now<00:01:55.510> it'll<00:01:55.750> just<00:01:55.960> hold<00:01:56.200> at

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
hit altitude hold now it'll just hold at

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:04.350 
hit altitude hold now it'll just hold at
that<00:01:56.590> altitude<00:01:57.480> maybe<00:02:02.730> ok<00:02:03.730> so<00:02:03.790> it's<00:02:04.090> having<00:02:04.300> a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
that altitude maybe ok so it's having a

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.650 
that altitude maybe ok so it's having a
bit<00:02:04.480> of<00:02:04.510> an<00:02:04.660> issue<00:02:04.750> today<00:02:05.940> we<00:02:06.940> do<00:02:07.150> a<00:02:07.180> position

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
bit of an issue today we do a position

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.520 
bit of an issue today we do a position
hold<00:02:07.930> so<00:02:08.890> that's<00:02:09.100> just<00:02:09.190> holding<00:02:09.550> position

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
hold so that's just holding position

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.320 
hold so that's just holding position
when<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.650> settles<00:02:11.890> give<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.790> time<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.120> settle

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
when it settles give it a time to settle

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.720 
when it settles give it a time to settle
doesn't<00:02:13.750> just<00:02:13.930> do<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.200> instantly<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:15.580> we'll

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
doesn't just do it instantly and we'll

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.670 
doesn't just do it instantly and we'll
do<00:02:15.850> an<00:02:15.970> altitude<00:02:16.270> hold<00:02:16.630> now<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.050> should<00:02:17.260> just

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
do an altitude hold now that should just

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.300 
do an altitude hold now that should just
stay<00:02:18.340> down<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.730> sky<00:02:20.190> once<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.340> settles<00:02:21.580> itself

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
stay down the sky once it settles itself

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.930 
stay down the sky once it settles itself
okay<00:02:24.310> so<00:02:24.370> we<00:02:24.640> do<00:02:24.760> now<00:02:24.910> return<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.330> home<00:02:26.940> and

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
okay so we do now return to home and

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.660 
okay so we do now return to home and
we'll<00:02:28.900> turn<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.260> mag<00:02:29.470> on<00:02:29.770> now<00:02:30.070> see<00:02:30.370> how<00:02:30.610> the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
we'll turn the mag on now see how the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.000 
we'll turn the mag on now see how the
mag<00:02:31.270> points<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:31.930> back<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.440> direction<00:02:32.620> that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
mag points it back in the direction that

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.160 
mag points it back in the direction that
it<00:02:33.280> was<00:02:33.490> armed<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.420> it's<00:02:34.600> coming<00:02:34.870> back<00:02:35.020> two

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
it was armed in so it's coming back two

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.400 
it was armed in so it's coming back two
million<00:02:35.440> greens<00:02:35.710> of<00:02:35.860> front<00:02:37.170> she'll<00:02:38.170> come<00:02:38.380> back

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
million greens of front she'll come back

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.990 
million greens of front she'll come back
around<00:02:38.710> and<00:02:39.010> then<00:02:39.160> it'll<00:02:39.400> point<00:02:39.640> because<00:02:39.850> of

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
around and then it'll point because of

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.730 
around and then it'll point because of
that<00:02:40.150> was<00:02:40.330> armed<00:02:40.540> that<00:02:40.720> way<00:02:40.930> it'll<00:02:41.260> turn<00:02:41.530> that

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
that was armed that way it'll turn that

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.510 
that was armed that way it'll turn that
way<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.900> she<00:02:47.560> should<00:02:47.770> turn<00:02:47.980> about<00:02:48.280> now

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
way and she should turn about now

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.110 
way and she should turn about now
somewhere

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.300 

kind<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.810> make<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:53.959> liar<00:02:54.230> out<00:02:54.260> of<00:02:54.500> me<00:02:54.620> here<00:02:55.099> she

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
kind of make a liar out of me here she

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.680 
kind of make a liar out of me here she
goes<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:58.280> they<00:02:58.459> teamed<00:02:58.519> facing<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.510> way<00:02:59.629> she

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
goes so they teamed facing the way she

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.339 
goes so they teamed facing the way she
came

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.750 

so<00:03:05.349> we're<00:03:05.470> just<00:03:05.620> pulling<00:03:05.800> my<00:03:05.950> particularly<00:03:06.610> of

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
so we're just pulling my particularly of

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.630

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.910 

goes<00:03:31.450> there<00:03:31.840> okay<00:03:32.320> it's<00:03:32.530> pretty<00:03:32.740> reactive

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
goes there okay it's pretty reactive

I put the base on upside down so so it's
bolted<00:04:23.680> in<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.070> board's<00:04:24.370> bolted<00:04:24.730> on<00:04:24.820> the

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880

and the yellow light is changed mode so
if<00:04:51.400> i<00:04:51.550> go<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.850> my<00:04:52.240> wine<00:04:53.230> arm<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.650> because<00:04:53.830> i'm

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
if i go to my wine arm it because i'm

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.160 
if i go to my wine arm it because i'm
out<00:04:54.070> of<00:04:54.100> battery<00:04:54.520> but<00:04:54.670> basically<00:04:55.120> yeah<00:04:55.780> that's

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
out of battery but basically yeah that's

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.930 
out of battery but basically yeah that's
how<00:04:56.320> she<00:04:56.380> works<00:04:56.650> okay<00:04:57.460> we'll<00:04:57.610> throw<00:04:57.760> another

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
how she works okay we'll throw another

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:17.390 
how she works okay we'll throw another
battery<00:04:58.330> in<00:04:58.390> a<00:04:58.450> year<00:04:58.660> ago

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.030 

so<00:05:18.400> we'll<00:05:18.520> do<00:05:18.640> a<00:05:18.670> bit<00:05:18.850> of<00:05:18.880> a<00:05:19.710> returner<00:05:20.710> launch

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
so we'll do a bit of a returner launch

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.600 
so we'll do a bit of a returner launch
just<00:05:21.400> make<00:05:21.580> sure<00:05:21.790> it's<00:05:21.940> all<00:05:22.060> working<00:05:22.330> properly

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
just make sure it's all working properly

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.740 
just make sure it's all working properly
from<00:05:24.610> there<00:05:24.820> so<00:05:25.120> return<00:05:25.900> a<00:05:25.930> launch<00:05:26.200> come<00:05:26.830> back

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
from there so return a launch come back

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.540 
from there so return a launch come back
so<00:05:28.750> should<00:05:29.140> come<00:05:29.380> back<00:05:29.560> it's<00:05:29.830> set<00:05:30.040> at<00:05:30.070> 6<00:05:30.370> meters

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
so should come back it's set at 6 meters

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.930 
so should come back it's set at 6 meters
a<00:05:30.760> second<00:05:31.270> so<00:05:31.590> there<00:05:32.590> you<00:05:32.740> go<00:05:33.300> well<00:05:34.300> good<00:05:34.510> so

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
meant was there's the PID is all I've

meant was there's the PID is all I've
done<00:05:45.850> is<00:05:45.910> adjusted<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:46.810> pitch<00:05:47.050> PID<00:05:47.680> from<00:05:48.070> two

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
done is adjusted the pitch PID from two

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.390 
done is adjusted the pitch PID from two
are<00:05:48.730> from<00:05:49.120> 3.5<00:05:49.750> to<00:05:50.290> 2.5<00:05:50.980> because<00:05:51.190> they<00:05:51.250> had

anyway we started our mission let's here

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.960 
anyway we started our mission let's here
we<00:06:11.550> go<00:06:11.670> with<00:06:11.880> that<00:06:11.910> we<00:06:12.120> got<00:06:12.150> the<00:06:12.360> 25<00:06:12.810> meters<00:06:13.970> we

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
we go with that we got the 25 meters we

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.580 
we go with that we got the 25 meters we
should<00:06:15.150> go<00:06:15.270> over<00:06:15.390> the<00:06:15.480> corner<00:06:15.810> of<00:06:15.900> the<00:06:15.990> farm<00:06:16.290> I

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
should go over the corner of the farm I

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.740 
should go over the corner of the farm I
always<00:06:17.040> had<00:06:17.250> my<00:06:17.400> finger<00:06:17.730> ready<00:06:17.940> to<00:06:18.210> take<00:06:18.510> it

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
always had my finger ready to take it

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.920 
always had my finger ready to take it
out<00:06:18.990> of<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.260> mode<00:06:19.590> and<00:06:19.980> give<00:06:20.250> it<00:06:20.280> some<00:06:20.520> juice

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
out of the mode and give it some juice

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.480 
out of the mode and give it some juice
even<00:06:21.930> though<00:06:22.050> it's<00:06:22.170> flying<00:06:22.470> by<00:06:22.860> itself

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
even though it's flying by itself

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.400 
even though it's flying by itself
because<00:06:24.330> you<00:06:24.420> will<00:06:24.600> notice<00:06:24.840> that<00:06:25.020> it<00:06:25.230> does

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
because you will notice that it does

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:31.580 
because you will notice that it does
tend<00:06:25.710> to<00:06:25.830> sometimes<00:06:26.310> duck<00:06:26.940> down<00:06:27.180> and<00:06:30.140> and<00:06:31.140> it

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
tend to sometimes duck down and and it

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.320 
tend to sometimes duck down and and it
doesn't<00:06:31.980> fly<00:06:32.160> exactly<00:06:32.640> how<00:06:32.790> you<00:06:32.850> think<00:06:33.150> when

over the spot with enough a millimeter
well<00:06:40.200> no<00:06:41.010> it<00:06:41.160> doesn't<00:06:41.520> do<00:06:41.700> that<00:06:41.880> actually<00:06:42.330> I

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360

it's<00:07:06.030> going<00:07:06.210> to<00:07:06.240> go<00:07:06.300> now<00:07:06.920> hopefully<00:07:07.920> it<00:07:08.040> might

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
it's going to go now hopefully it might

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:14.140 
it's going to go now hopefully it might
head<00:07:08.520> over<00:07:08.550> sort<00:07:09.240> of<00:07:09.440> go<00:07:10.440> that<00:07:10.680> way<00:07:10.890> come<00:07:11.280> on

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.150 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.400 

I'll<00:07:15.150> turn<00:07:15.390> it<00:07:15.570> off<00:07:15.630> an<00:07:15.840> hour<00:07:15.960> what<00:07:16.230> it's<00:07:16.380> doing

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.410 
I'll turn it off an hour what it's doing

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.200 
I'll turn it off an hour what it's doing
however<00:07:19.410> that<00:07:19.440> GPS<00:07:20.070> unit<00:07:20.460> is<00:07:20.580> playing<00:07:20.910> up<00:07:21.060> with

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.210 
however that GPS unit is playing up with

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:27.560 
however that GPS unit is playing up with
it<00:07:25.310> so<00:07:26.310> we'll<00:07:26.490> land<00:07:26.670> and<00:07:27.120> we'll<00:07:27.240> turn<00:07:27.510> it

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:27.570 
it so we'll land and we'll turn it

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.420 
it so we'll land and we'll turn it
though<00:07:27.780> their<00:07:27.960> GPS<00:07:28.440> unit<00:07:28.830> off<00:07:28.980> it<00:07:29.130> might<00:07:29.310> be

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:29.430 
though their GPS unit off it might be

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.140 
though their GPS unit off it might be
interfering<00:07:29.790> whether<00:07:30.060> he<00:07:30.240> knows

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.150 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:45.790 

you

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.860
