00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:31.339 
which shouldn't be too difficult because

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.460 
which shouldn't be too difficult because
all<00:00:31.519> of<00:00:31.550> this<00:00:31.699> is<00:00:31.880> just<00:00:31.910> teal<00:00:32.330> a<00:00:32.599> raspberry

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
all of this is just teal a raspberry

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.380 
all of this is just teal a raspberry
purple<00:00:33.830> and<00:00:34.010> then<00:00:34.129> a<00:00:34.220> deep<00:00:34.430> purple<00:00:34.699> a<00:00:35.030> deep

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
purple and then a deep purple a deep

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.030 
purple and then a deep purple a deep
eggplant<00:00:35.629> purple<00:00:35.989> in<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.320> outer<00:00:36.470> corner<00:00:36.920> and

I'm<00:02:46.530> going<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:46.890> start<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.310> blend<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.640> well

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
I'm going to start to blend that well

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.140 
I'm going to start to blend that well
into<00:02:48.780> my<00:02:48.810> crease<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:50.310> we<00:02:50.430> get<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.610> really<00:02:51.120> really

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
into my crease so we get a really really

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.890 
into my crease so we get a really really
