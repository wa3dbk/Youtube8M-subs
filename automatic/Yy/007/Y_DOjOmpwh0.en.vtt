men kill streak it is awesome and I
really<00:02:34.350> highly<00:02:35.310> recommend<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:36.500> as<00:02:37.500> one<00:02:37.800> of

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
really highly recommend that as one of

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.650 
really highly recommend that as one of
your<00:02:37.950> kill<00:02:38.130> streaks<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.060> think

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
your kill streaks and if you think

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.660 
your kill streaks and if you think
you're<00:02:40.290> good<00:02:40.440> enough<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.310> want<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.550> go

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
you're good enough and you want to go

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.000 
you're good enough and you want to go
for<00:02:41.850> nukes<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.540> think<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.500> use<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.650> pave

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
for nukes I think if you use the pave

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.030 
for nukes I think if you use the pave
low<00:02:44.250> instead<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.880> Harrier<00:02:45.180> strike<00:02:46.040> that

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
low instead of the Harrier strike that

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.250 
low instead of the Harrier strike that
is<00:02:47.370> going<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.820> almost<00:02:48.210> a<00:02:48.570> guaranteed<00:02:49.050> new

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
is going to be almost a guaranteed new

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.760 
is going to be almost a guaranteed new
every<00:02:49.770> single<00:02:49.800> time<00:02:50.250> because<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.360> thing

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
every single time because that thing

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.990 
every single time because that thing
it's<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:53.070> much<00:02:53.250> better<00:02:53.400> than<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.730> Harrier

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
it's so much better than the Harrier

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.790 
it's so much better than the Harrier
strike<00:02:54.270> it's<00:02:54.450> incredible<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.470> there<00:02:55.740> are

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
strike it's incredible that there are

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.410 
strike it's incredible that there are
only<00:02:55.860> two<00:02:56.160> kills<00:02:56.430> apart<00:02:56.990> to<00:02:57.990> get<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:59.580> as<00:03:00.360> you

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
only two kills apart to get and as you

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.730 
only two kills apart to get and as you
can<00:03:00.540> see<00:03:00.570> him<00:03:00.840> getting<00:03:01.020> clean<00:03:01.260> more<00:03:01.470> kills

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
can see him getting clean more kills

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.080 
can see him getting clean more kills
from<00:03:02.280> my<00:03:02.520> on<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.970> back<00:03:03.290> side<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.850> all<00:03:05.850> these
