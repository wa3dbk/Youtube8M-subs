00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.889
 johann people and herzl comes to new 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.629
 video today in this video shows the 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:12.800
 Well tempered glass protective film for that 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:14.420
 iphone 6 have fun then I would 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.070
 say we also start directly and 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.050
 so that we can arrive here at all 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.200
 panzerglas protective films because yes it is 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.560
 two and we have to first 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.440
 cut this glue with one 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.940
 a scissors or with a knife and 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.440
 then up and down are two 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.509
 You also have to keep the adhesive strips 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.739
 just removed and we can see 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.020
 then it can be quite chic 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.660
 how to open a book and there we have 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.820
 then once again cleaning cloths around 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.710
 Ever the display from the iphone too 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.230
 then clean one more 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.000
 a single microfiber cloth here 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.559
 you can see with this one then 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.430
 also again the display of 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.320
 free coarse dust and then go 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.809
 down a little tape around that 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.670
 clean the display again and then here 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.969
 at the bottom we can see wrapped up 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.649
 twice the panzerglas protective films and 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.239
 they have the first impression to me 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.069
 So much already say something very much 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.659
 skinny and very light too 

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:11.240
 I've been pleasantly surprised 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.770
 and yes, well, now I would say 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.209
 we like the whole thing here too 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.509
 must be prescribed with first 

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:20.600
 the cloth resp 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.249
 with the wet she cleans we have to 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.479
 First of all, the display like 

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.969
 said wet or 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.279
 the cleaning and that I would first 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.049
 that a bit difficult here this the 

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:32.149
 story but to take that is here 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.549
 is almost something , so to speak 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.499
 sticks together and it is almost reached 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.329
 So herewith simply grossly once the 

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.789
 were about the complete conversation and 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.130
 Thoroughly polish everything with it 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.039
 ever that one or the other dust 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.810
 just removed and then we can do that 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.819
 still do it with the drive 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.770
 left now have this dry 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.389
 cloth that is exactly the same as 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.450
 just dry we have to do that too 

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:57.889
 open it once and then we can 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.479
 pull the whole thing out already 

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:01.579
 put the rest aside and here now 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.779
 just dry the display and here 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.099
 It really should be very thorough 

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:05.509
 when she should look that at everyone 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.909
 In case the display is completely dry 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.619
 and at the same time with a good light 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.730
 Relationship look that all too 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.260
 dust grains and so on are removed 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.000
 no hair or any 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.220
 eyelashes of you just on the display 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.260
 then they will interfere later 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.650
 and for connection we can then here 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.599
 participate again this song or 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.930
 in addition to these known adhesive strips 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.970
 because hereby we can do that 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.360
 display again, yes, I'll tell you 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.280
 right now thoroughly clean and 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.080
 single dust grains removed in the same way 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.849
 individual levels are as in the 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.440
 pocket the top or the top 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.769
 earcup you can do that here with then 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.239
 do it again you should do that 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.950
 actually everything is best of all 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.959
 I had to do a bath or something else 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.849
 Just make it in my room 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.140
 because of the video but if you have the 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.209
 possibility you have it where on 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.319
 at least dust is and if you are 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.060
 sure you are not really 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.260
 Dust can be more on the device then 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.440
 can you already have the panzerglas 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.579
 Protective film to take the hand and the first 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.640
 times from these individual slides 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.930
 get out and then the front full 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.060
 I'll tell you about this tank 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.739
 Remove the tattoo to show it 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.599
 have the tape with the other 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.010
 hand could still like which 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.420
 single places are these again 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.310
 clean as any puzzle or 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.590
 remove something else and we see 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.180
 now synonymous already the film or synonymous 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.160
 armored glass so you see who speaks 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.139
 this is not a sweet foil 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.840
 but that's just what it is 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.430
 glass and even otherwise it is 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.870
 it really looks really easy 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.130
 yes in the right position at times 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.989
 me it's a bit to the left what 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.660
 but does not do anything and then easy 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.630
 Let go and be magical 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.160
 the whole now just yourself 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.889
 Office eyes, so to speak, as you have afterwards 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.930
 not a single , not a single bubble 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.970
 more or anything else really 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.290
 really good and then it must be in the 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.790
 Do not do anything at all afterwards 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.220
 Other slides that will be all 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.470
 done by itself as it were 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.840
 now it looks like it is now at the end 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.480
 then, too, you can do that on the top 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.950
 to see a little business class 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.319
 can be seen everywhere have to be content above and 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.910
 Below is a bit more extreme though 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.750
 is normal in this bulletproof glass sheets 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.190
 but still 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.840
 she really got very thin 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.129
 she is really very easy than me 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.780
 I still remember that you earlier 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.220
 it was really fat 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.019
 very good and I already have the one 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.660
 or other test now now with 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.070
 this slide through and it really does 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.440
 I really like it 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.000
 very very good 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.980
 not only do we recommend are the left 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.090
 description and you can do something too 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.750
 already with the video and that's me 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.980
 saying goodbye 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.980
 bye and bye
