swing power swing projects the ball down
the<00:01:12.650> lane<00:01:12.800> much<00:01:13.100> longer<00:01:13.730> so<00:01:13.940> when<00:01:14.120> the<00:01:14.210> ball<00:01:14.390> is

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
the lane much longer so when the ball is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.050 
the lane much longer so when the ball is
rolling<00:01:14.810> too<00:01:15.140> early<00:01:15.620> you<00:01:16.070> need<00:01:16.310> more<00:01:16.550> swing

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
rolling too early you need more swing

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.110 
rolling too early you need more swing
and<00:01:17.420> you<00:01:18.080> need<00:01:18.290> less<00:01:18.620> hand<00:01:19.160> now<00:01:19.640> hold<00:01:19.910> on<00:01:20.090> a

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
and you need less hand now hold on a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.050 
and you need less hand now hold on a
minute<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:21.290> back<00:01:21.500> ends<00:01:21.950> are<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.250> hand<00:01:22.550> so<00:01:22.910> the

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
minute the back ends are the hand so the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.840 
minute the back ends are the hand so the
first<00:01:23.330> 45<00:01:23.750> feet<00:01:24.290> is<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:25.040> swing<00:01:25.370> from<00:01:25.760> the

feet let's say it another way let's say
the<00:01:33.050> lanes<00:01:33.290> are<00:01:33.500> real<00:01:33.710> slick<00:01:34.190> slow<00:01:35.120> down<00:01:35.450> that

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
the lanes are real slick slow down that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.530 
the lanes are real slick slow down that
swing<00:01:36.290> when<00:01:37.190> that<00:01:37.340> swing<00:01:37.700> is<00:01:37.730> going<00:01:38.150> by<00:01:38.330> your

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
swing when that swing is going by your

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.990 
swing when that swing is going by your
ankle<00:01:38.810> because<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.740> ankle<00:01:40.040> too<00:01:40.250> fast<00:01:40.670> you

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
ankle because the ankle too fast you

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.300 
ankle because the ankle too fast you
don't<00:01:41.180> have<00:01:41.300> time<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.630> catch<00:01:42.020> much<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:42.710> so

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
don't have time to catch much and so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.280 
don't have time to catch much and so
when<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:43.640> watch<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.240> players<00:01:44.600> that<00:01:44.870> really

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
wrist action on dry lanes speed up your

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.080 
wrist action on dry lanes speed up your
swing<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.830> then<00:02:45.980> you'll<00:02:46.130> have<00:02:46.310> less<00:02:46.610> hand<00:02:46.910> and

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
swing and then you'll have less hand and

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.450 
swing and then you'll have less hand and
wrist<00:02:47.270> action<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.110> huge<00:02:48.560> information<00:02:49.310> on

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
wrist action that is huge information on

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.890 
wrist action that is huge information on
playing<00:02:49.730> different<00:02:50.090> lanes<00:02:50.270> so<00:02:50.450> we<00:02:50.570> have<00:02:50.750> the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
playing different lanes so we have the
