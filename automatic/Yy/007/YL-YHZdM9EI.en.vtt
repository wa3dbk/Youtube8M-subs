00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
Chargers in the USB cable so you don't

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.889 
Chargers in the USB cable so you don't
need<00:01:22.399> to<00:01:22.520> worry<00:01:22.549> about<00:01:22.729> getting<00:01:23.149> stuff<00:01:23.659> lost

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
need to worry about getting stuff lost

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.889 
need to worry about getting stuff lost
oh<00:01:24.200> cool<00:01:24.859> living<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.369> oh<00:01:26.149> cool<00:01:26.420> they've

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
oh cool living and oh cool they've

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.130 
oh cool living and oh cool they've
gotten<00:01:27.259> you<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:28.420> replacement<00:01:29.420> back<00:01:29.810> cover<00:01:30.049> and

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
gotten you a replacement back cover and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.230 
gotten you a replacement back cover and
an<00:01:30.469> extra<00:01:30.740> back<00:01:30.890> over<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:31.880> I<00:01:31.909> guess<00:01:32.090> you<00:01:32.210> could

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
an extra back over so I guess you could

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.910 
an extra back over so I guess you could
choose<00:01:32.749> between<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.200> black<00:01:33.439> or<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.770> white

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
choose between the black or the white

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.880 
choose between the black or the white
the<00:01:34.670> black<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.840> black<00:01:36.049> seems<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.560> have<00:01:36.710> this

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
the black the black seems to have this

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.429 
the black the black seems to have this
kind<00:01:37.070> of<00:01:37.219> grainy<00:01:37.490> finish<00:01:38.170> which<00:01:39.170> I<00:01:39.289> guess

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
kind of grainy finish which I guess

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.539 
kind of grainy finish which I guess
would<00:01:39.590> make<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:39.950> lot<00:01:39.979> more<00:01:40.130> scratch

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
would make it a lot more scratch

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.039 
would make it a lot more scratch
resistant<00:01:40.969> in<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.179> white<00:01:41.359> which<00:01:41.689> has<00:01:41.899> the

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
resistant in the white which has the

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.380 
resistant in the white which has the
usual<00:01:42.439> something<00:01:42.909> glossy<00:01:43.909> finish<00:01:46.179> okay<00:01:47.179> and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
usual something glossy finish okay and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.279 
usual something glossy finish okay and
they've<00:01:47.539> included<00:01:48.020> this<00:01:49.090> god<00:01:50.090> this<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.869> really

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
they've included this god this is really

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.539
