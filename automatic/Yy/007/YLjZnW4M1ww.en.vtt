00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 not so long ago when I 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.799
 spoke 2.6 10.10 I told you 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.670
 what does it plan to prepare a beta for 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.649
 the general public 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.460
 and that's it the beta version came out 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.440
 so today I 'm going to show you 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.900
 how to install on everything all he 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.219
 need to know to install it and that's the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.660
 first thing very important to know 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.460
 is that public beta does not want 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.189
 to say stable peta so it's still full 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.570
 of bugs so the ideal it would be 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.340
 install it on an external drive 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.039
 and if you install it on a year on 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.269
 your macintosh disk hd mostly made 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.500
 a backup and do not come to you 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.449
 complain if you have problems 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.550
 because here I am warning you 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.890
 install it on the macintosh hd it's 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.030
 really not a good idea 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.469
 second little information is that if 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.000
 you have problems with your mac 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.059
 well, we will not have to go crying 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.350
 at apple no more since the apple 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.480
 store can not do anything for you 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.910
 that's your problem then if you have 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.690
 a little go see on the internet about 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.430
 forums etc 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.930
 because the apple store will not be able to 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.949
 not help you 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.050
 why these risks and install the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.399
 beta on your macintosh HD drive all 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.050
 simply because you will not hurt 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.420
 of slow stuff history in plo 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.980
 understood slowly that submits fights of 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.409
 software that will not be compatible on 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.060
 is nothing right after and also 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.610
 bugs there are among others a lot of bugs 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.290
 with safari if you use netflix 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.210
 there are also blogs with photos 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.100
 with iphoto aperture the sharing of 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.729
 photos icloud is steep europe which 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.290
 not working well 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.600
 are a lot of things like that which 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.710
 really does not work well you will 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.420
 of course as I told you these 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.850
 applications will not work then 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.830
 his little parenthesis also was not going 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.570
 spam developers with emails 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.950
 yeah it does not work and everything is 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.119
 normal it's a beta so that's 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.460
 means that the developers are in 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.630
 preparing their applications 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.079
 for versions 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.159
 the final version 2010 so voila 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.960
 you will have applications that 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.289
 will not work applications that 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.430
 will work badly with stuff like that 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.079
 by the way if you want to know a 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.429
 little what works and what does not 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.630
 not work there is a great site for 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.729

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.710
 with jose noon so here I have the list 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.789
 applications that starts with so 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.200
 when there is a little thing like that it's 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.819
 that it works and as you can 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.340
 to see it there are not any masses that 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.410
 works with liu zhenmin so that's it 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.549

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.049
