00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.819
 beautiful boys more commercially 604 e 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.620
 today we are here with a new episode of 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.150
 probable days repaid by fifa 15 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.160
 before starting I wanted as usual 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.810
 remember that in the description there is the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.750
 link the infants meeting toys.com now 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.430
 prices are really cheap and there is 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.789
 even my facebook page was born in 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.920
 I like it a lot and we can do more 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.160
 say that we can start immediately with the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.450
 first player paid today that is 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.809
 mattia de sciglio many to de sciglio 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.309
 the omitted left-back 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.260
 however he also played right 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.710
 so I don't know where they can put it 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.070
 I think they put a left back on it 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.480
 however really great class player 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:57.030
 1992 complain a bit to the speed 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.609
 let's put the passage a little and increase it 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.260
 I don't think of dribbling in one 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:09.030
 rare gold card I think they leave one 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.890
 card of this kind however good if 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.229
 they do it to left- back because sino 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.009
 left there's really nothing in 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.770
 Italy in series could therefore be 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.570
 really a good a good player given 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.750
 that on the right wing spurs 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.340
 the silver that weakens the abbot 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.780
 could get to cost the best 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.600
 I hope 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.270
 usually avati 75 so wet as the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.490
 beast 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.659
 sorry marked the beast and therefore 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.659
 we hope so 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.479
 so nothing I think is more than that 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.970
 right for him a weight they will do 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.799
 the stronger he plays in my Italian 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.420
 as god just said really a 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.060
 prospectus that could become one 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.789
 of the best Italian fullbacks a few years 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.000
 is that there are devastating fullbacks 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.280
 Italians how it goes well 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.489
 let's move on to a later player today 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.780
 that lazar markovic recently passed to 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.150
 liverpool for a stratospheric figure 25 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.709
 million euros 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:23.010
 absurd Serbian player played in the 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.569
 partizan belgrade it seems to me they had to 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.130
 starting from belgrade 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.989
 now I will have made a filler of the 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:34.709
 madonna we bring back the speed 90 a 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.150
 85 of the dribbling dribbles a 70 to 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.810
 shot that can be since I anyway 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.920
 paid a pass 75 I put it c 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:50.850
 or c my nose circi though this year 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:52.980
 14 was cf ie it seems to me attino though 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.110
 anyway if you have seen some games 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.840
 of the benigi benigi let us say that yes 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.700
 caroused all that area of ​​the field 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.310
 he played both wide on the right and in the middle 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.750
 as a trequartista it is wide on the left 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.230
 let's say he can't 4 2 3 1 he can 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.680
 cover all the roles behind the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.540
 tip 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.230
 so i think the right role for him 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.960
 both cerci then anyway could also 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.710
 sms as left wing 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.180
 then anyway it will be all to see how 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.090
 also said this could be a 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.880
 nice playmaker to try the new one 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.680
 playmaker try in premier and nothing 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.900
 we are just waiting for the exit light of 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.840
 cards came out to see 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.930
 how this player will look for 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.310
 I really strong too in 1994 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:47.760
 cited kovacic is devastating 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.170
 so let's move on to the last player of 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.870
 today 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.590
 and here it is here remi cabella rhythmic beautiful 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.630
 I put 80 although now that I 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.520
 I think it could also be little 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.090
 because anyway this player 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.650
 playing as a playmaker playing too 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.220
 in the mon pays and this year has made one 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.110
 shitty season has made 14 goals 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:15.090
 playing as an attacking midfielder as if 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.500
 we do not know that now I do not come 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.730
 no team playing like that in mind 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.820
 playmaker in Italy comes to me 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.100
 in mind we kind of like the inter ok that 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.570
 he has never played pro alvarez since 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.850
 playing between the tip 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.590
 ok it's the cigo al alvarez there is 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.990
 something that will never exist because 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.010
 bitterness will never give a fuck why but 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.560
 pippo absurd however to make to understand 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.660
 playing as a playmaker he made 14 goals 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.010
 that is, they are really many 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.230
 so many even a little 80 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.090
 overall, however, was purchased by 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.110
 newcastle 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.300
 then another French player who 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.680
 goes to my cast I'm now ceased to 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.630
 team could make a team 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.670
 entirely of French we almost bring back 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.140
 speed 85 because it is very fast 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.150
 we report an excellent dribbling and a 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.760
 fair shot and a decent pass 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.890
 this player could fremm could 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.900
 be the heir of naseri because 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.630
 probably tapes this year 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.280
 they will do enough in winter 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:26.510
 who made a season quite of 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.890
 shit we repeat shit everywhere he doesn't 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.930
 played a great season then 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.630
 he could be the new one 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.740
 paid playmaker of the premier who if 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.470
 nasseri was we preferred 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.200
 however in the last two years but 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:44.000
 this is not beautiful we could leave 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:46.360
 so amazed really so also for 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.780
 this video or add to the term 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.150
 as usual 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.830
 put me like it if you liked the 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.660
 video put the no I like if it is not there 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.070
 liked the video if you didn't like it 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.880
 the video also write me a comment on 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.640
 what to improve 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.040
 I accept all the criticisms because I don't 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.490
 they do nothing but make me understand what 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.490
 I'm wrong in the videos anyway for the audio 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.830
 I bought some headphones recommended by 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.050
 another very nice youtuber than me 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.590
 he recommended it and I paid 55 euros 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.210
 I don't think of doing an unboxing fuck at 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.270
 nobody 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:25.150
 these should should come 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:27.920
 Thursday, July 24th so it will be a lot e 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.870
 so these on this can be if not 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.820
 is the last one will be one of the profits with 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:37.360
 shitty sound so I think I have 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.980
 having said all, write me in the comments if 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.930

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.450
 bank that I could insert into 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.640
 next episode so let me know 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:50.690
