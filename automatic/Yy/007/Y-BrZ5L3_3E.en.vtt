00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.360
 hello to all so I find you 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:15.299
 do a little trick is how 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.359
 can watch on his console xbox one 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.830
 or 360 then ps3 and weights 4 I do not know 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.419
 it works not because I'm so 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.769
 I consulted this frame but finally ps3 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:29.970
 but I have not tried but in any case 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.090
 on 360 and one can watch a movie 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.430
 from his pc directly on these consoles 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.850
 without seeing any connection 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.649
 deal because it uses the dlna system 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.879
 so I advise you to go these 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.940
 wanted to know how it works 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.519
 go to wikipedia and you are looking for the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.780
 functioning of this thing even though 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.769
 it's not very very conclusive 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.250
 it's because it's very technical 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.570
 when explanations and so it can be learned 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.809
 site what it is to be able to read 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.250
 a file from his pc to his console and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.710
 so power to see him on the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.870
 TV knowing that the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.750
 televisions that make this system there too 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.790
 now actually it's more or less 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.500
 electronic devices that gets going 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.030
 two valleys of societies that are put 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.050
 agree that the devices 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.100
 electronic devices are compatible between 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.960
 they are applied there so that this finding 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.260
 what's this trick so there if you have 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.160
 a video on your pc by doing you 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.650
 see what you do in right click 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.590
 and play to jamaica de cloyne de 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.790
 propose which is called xbox systems 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.100
 criminal and xbox young and so there in 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.020
 getting going there you see enter 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.630
 in contact with the device and 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.580
 network and you and that my film starts 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.560
 and it starts or starts on my xbox 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.530
 one no i can see with my pc 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.970
 finally i can see a movie of my pc on 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.800
 my console 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.530
 after I'm going to stop because the movie 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.210
 who starts my television on my console 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.310
 without any cable settings any 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:13.349
 simply the wifi system of the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:14.400
 of the internet box and so the swiss 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.750
 so here I will explain on 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.090
 windows 8 because excuse me but 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.200
 it's possible on windows 7 but since 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.290
 I do not have me I can not show you 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.040
 images so on windows 8 makes you 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.200
 then you do how so be there 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.569
 where you open your file directly 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.340
 video if you have the play to ben here 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.470
 you're just doing this attack 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.640
 tackle so it's done alone 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.280
 what else do you go on settings 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.360
 change pc pc settings and 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.910
 cableway devices is there if 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.160
 you do not have all your xbox you 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.209
 do added a device and your 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.250
 pc will fetch all peripherals 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.400
 accepting rubs the system ttm 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.709
 not 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:09.720
 ah and no but after that it takes only a 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.579
 gang there it'll find everything closed and so 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.640

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.760
 can quietly download 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.830
 movies but be careful you have to have 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:24.620
 the original at home here it is done 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.390

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.820
 thousands and thousands and thousands 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.250
 they come in simpler well let's admit 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.490
 I've never had a funny bird more 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.970
 and download i will download here 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.740
 a file there I type 5.87 shown there it 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.350
 offers a link I'm going club 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.610
 gt that and it's going to hold such a load of 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.530
 flip here but must know necessarily 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.980
 young I do not know because I do not 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.940
 the beloved not I do not have the original reason 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.180
 it's the conditions of use of the 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.140
 site 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.260
 it 's having origins she at the 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.160
 home the voice you french you 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.750
 authorizes to download a file 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.840
 only following an original process 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.220
 so here I can tell you that I have 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.669
 the original of all these films no need 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.360
 to ask me 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.890
 I would say yes so here is in 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.689
 hoping this little video you 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.149
 will have 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:22.799
 you will be served to be able to watch a 

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:24.729
 film and images systems running 

00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:26.199
 must know other sex sell for 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.269
 the moment we can read that of which 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:31.149
 some video files and some 

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:32.889
 image files but afterwards we 

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:36.360
 may perhaps see for example the 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:38.169
 desk here his pc purchase on his console 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.749
 after a good update according to 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.879
 franÃ§oise did the minimum possible 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:44.619
 so here is youth and hoping 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.579
 it was what you know about 

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:47.579
 to say good evening
