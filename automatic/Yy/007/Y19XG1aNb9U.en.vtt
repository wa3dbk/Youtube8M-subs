steering<00:00:33.600> wheel<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.410> steering<00:00:34.470> wheel<00:00:34.890> is

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
steering wheel the steering wheel is

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.850 
steering wheel the steering wheel is
something<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.970> touch<00:00:36.230> 100%<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.440> time<00:00:37.650> so

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
something you touch 100% of the time so

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.070 
something you touch 100% of the time so
it's<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.070> most<00:00:38.250> important<00:00:38.790> part<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.840> car

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
it's the most important part of the car

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.770 
it's the most important part of the car
as<00:00:40.590> for<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> driver<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.000> connection<00:00:42.660> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
as for the driver with the connection to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.979 
as for the driver with the connection to
the<00:00:42.900> road<00:00:43.220> so<00:00:44.220> that<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.850> terra<00:00:45.090> feel<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.809> it

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
the road so that I can terra feel of it

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.810 
the road so that I can terra feel of it
is<00:00:46.309> absolutely<00:00:47.309> great

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
is absolutely great

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.420 
is absolutely great
then<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.170> center<00:00:49.500> line<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.280> red

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
then you have to the center line the red

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.270 
then you have to the center line the red
line<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.780> racing<00:00:52.110> car<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:53.100> that

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
line just like in a racing car and that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.590 
line just like in a racing car and that
gives<00:00:53.519> you<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.699> really<00:00:54.000> good<00:00:54.120> feel<00:00:54.570> of

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
gives you a really good feel of

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.070 
gives you a really good feel of
direction<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.800> where<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> handle<00:00:56.580> is<00:00:57.080> the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
direction and where the handle is the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.540 
direction and where the handle is the
other<00:00:58.260> thing<00:00:58.559> that's<00:00:58.739> really<00:00:58.830> important<00:00:59.430> for

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
other thing that's really important for

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.930 
other thing that's really important for
the<00:00:59.730> interior<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.330> a<00:01:00.420> car<00:01:00.589> is<00:01:01.589> the<00:01:01.799> seat<00:01:02.040> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the interior of a car is the seat the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.789 
the interior of a car is the seat the
seat<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.479> also<00:01:03.900> another<00:01:04.140> very<00:01:04.379> important

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
seat is also another very important

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.469 
seat is also another very important
connection<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.489> road<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.970> for<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
connection to the road and for the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.690 
connection to the road and for the
feeling<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> driver<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:08.520> this

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
feeling of the driver and here with this

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.359 
feeling of the driver and here with this
mismo<00:01:09.450> seeds<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.740> really<00:01:11.010> good<00:01:11.159> side

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
mismo seeds you have a really good side

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.730 
mismo seeds you have a really good side
support<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:13.110> when<00:01:13.260> you're<00:01:13.380> cornering

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
support and so when you're cornering

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.500 
support and so when you're cornering
fast<00:01:14.100> you're<00:01:14.610> always<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> same<00:01:15.330> position

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
fast you're always in the same position

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.140 
fast you're always in the same position
and<00:01:16.020> your<00:01:16.650> balance<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.220> always<00:01:17.430> straight<00:01:18.090> with

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
and your balance is always straight with

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.810 
and your balance is always straight with
the<00:01:18.420> body<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.500> engine<00:01:19.830> not<00:01:20.130> only<00:01:20.460> makes<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the body the engine not only makes a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.910 
the body the engine not only makes a
great<00:01:21.030> sound<00:01:21.270> because<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.290> different

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
great sound because of the different

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.850 
great sound because of the different
exhaust<00:01:23.280> system<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.330> also<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.020> has<00:01:25.170> 16<00:01:25.619> horse

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
exhaust system but also it has 16 horse

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.109 
exhaust system but also it has 16 horse
powers<00:01:26.250> more<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.470> more<00:01:28.470> torque<00:01:29.010> it<00:01:29.820> doesn't

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
powers more and more torque it doesn't

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.260 
powers more and more torque it doesn't
sound<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.479> big<00:01:30.810> numbers<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.100> total<00:01:32.490> this

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
sound like big numbers but in total this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.539 
sound like big numbers but in total this
is<00:01:33.420> at<00:01:33.539> a<00:01:33.630> lower<00:01:33.810> revs<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.679> the<00:01:34.799> drivability<00:01:35.159> of

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
is at a lower revs so the drivability of

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.940 
is at a lower revs so the drivability of
the<00:01:35.729> car<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.570> much<00:01:36.780> better<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.500> when<00:01:37.679> we<00:01:37.799> go

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
the car is much better so when we go

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.099 
the car is much better so when we go
from<00:01:38.189> two<00:01:38.789> or<00:01:38.850> three<00:01:39.000> thousand<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.570> third<00:01:39.869> gear

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
from two or three thousand in third gear

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.770 
from two or three thousand in third gear
I'll<00:01:40.979> show<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.820> acceleration<00:01:42.390> is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
I'll show you that the acceleration is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.950 
I'll show you that the acceleration is
really

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
really

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.160 
really

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
[Music]

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.370 
[Music]
you<00:01:47.740> really<00:01:48.280> feel<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:49.270> power<00:01:49.509> coming

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.789 

absolutely<00:01:53.380> great<00:01:53.650> feeling<00:01:54.159> this<00:01:54.970> is<00:01:55.119> really

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
absolutely great feeling this is really

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.039 
absolutely great feeling this is really
super<00:01:56.799> fast<00:01:57.040> so<00:01:57.790> you<00:01:58.149> think<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.540> numbers<00:01:58.869> are

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
super fast so you think the numbers are

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.530 
super fast so you think the numbers are
not<00:01:59.200> big<00:01:59.409> but<00:01:59.950> actually<00:02:00.520> you<00:02:00.939> feel<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.299> over

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
not big but actually you feel it over

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.749 
not big but actually you feel it over
the<00:02:01.630> whole<00:02:01.780> rest<00:02:02.049> range<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.649> that<00:02:03.549> makes

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
the whole rest range and that makes

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.999 
the whole rest range and that makes
driving<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:04.659> much<00:02:04.810> more<00:02:05.020> fun<00:02:05.259> especially

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
driving so much more fun especially

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.889 
driving so much more fun especially
because<00:02:06.159> as<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.820> move<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.210> throttle<00:02:07.360> you

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
because as you move the throttle you

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.580 
because as you move the throttle you
have<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.229> responsiveness<00:02:09.000> instantly<00:02:10.000> there

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
have to responsiveness instantly there

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.100 
have to responsiveness instantly there

40 percent I actually was involved in

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.240 
40 percent I actually was involved in
some<00:02:21.640> testing<00:02:22.090> on<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.750> race<00:02:22.930> tracks<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:24.130> do

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
some testing on the race tracks to do

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.820 
some testing on the race tracks to do
the<00:02:24.370> final<00:02:24.610> fine-tuning<00:02:25.540> in<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.840> but<00:02:26.709> that's

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
the final fine-tuning in it but that's

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.970 
the final fine-tuning in it but that's
not<00:02:26.980> all<00:02:27.340> we<00:02:27.580> have<00:02:28.569> also<00:02:28.900> bigger<00:02:29.319> tires<00:02:29.650> on<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
not all we have also bigger tires on the

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.350 
not all we have also bigger tires on the
rear<00:02:30.100> light<00:02:30.519> alloy<00:02:30.970> wheels

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
rear light alloy wheels

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.020 
rear light alloy wheels
that<00:02:31.660> means<00:02:31.900> it's<00:02:32.410> unsprung<00:02:32.950> mass<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.819> car

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
that means it's unsprung mass so the car

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.910 
that means it's unsprung mass so the car
accelerates<00:02:34.600> quicker<00:02:34.870> because<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.350> we

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
accelerates quicker because of that we

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.470 
accelerates quicker because of that we
have<00:02:36.069> more<00:02:36.280> grit<00:02:36.580> because<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.269> wider

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
have more grit because of the wider

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.820 
have more grit because of the wider
tires<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:39.010> because<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.239> chassis<00:02:41.049> change

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
tires and because of the chassis change

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.620 
tires and because of the chassis change
of<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.250> stiffness<00:02:42.489> we<00:02:43.120> have<00:02:43.239> much<00:02:43.420> more

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
of the stiffness we have much more

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.820 
of the stiffness we have much more
stability<00:02:44.220> in<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.280> corners<00:02:45.819> on<00:02:46.060> top<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.510> that

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
stability in the corners on top of that

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.830 
stability in the corners on top of that
we<00:02:47.830> have<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.010> revised<00:02:48.640> aero<00:02:49.090> package<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.750> the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
we have a revised aero package on the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.500 
we have a revised aero package on the
car<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.709> airflow<00:02:51.130> under<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.670> car<00:02:51.910> is<00:02:52.269> now

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
car the airflow under the car is now

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.080 
car the airflow under the car is now
much<00:02:52.780> smoother<00:02:53.110> faster<00:02:53.880> creating<00:02:54.880> more

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
much smoother faster creating more

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.410 
much smoother faster creating more
downforce<00:02:55.599> in<00:02:56.320> total<00:02:56.739> so<00:02:57.280> more<00:02:57.700> stability<00:02:58.030> on

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
downforce in total so more stability on

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.440 
downforce in total so more stability on
high<00:02:58.630> speed<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.290> much<00:03:00.250> more<00:03:00.489> stability<00:03:00.640> in

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
high speed and much more stability in

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.479 
high speed and much more stability in
cornering<00:03:02.079> because<00:03:02.829> the<00:03:02.980> car<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.370> much

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
cornering because the car is so much

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.870 
cornering because the car is so much
faster<00:03:03.850> in<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.930> cornering<00:03:05.370> on<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.579> straights

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
faster in the cornering on the straights

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.509 
faster in the cornering on the straights
it<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.720> crucial<00:03:08.049> that<00:03:08.440> we<00:03:08.829> have<00:03:08.920> good<00:03:09.130> braking

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
it is crucial that we have good braking

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.460 
it is crucial that we have good braking
so<00:03:10.090> also<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.540> brake<00:03:10.720> performance<00:03:10.930> has<00:03:11.440> been

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
so also the brake performance has been

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.979 
so also the brake performance has been
up<00:03:11.739> but<00:03:12.310> not<00:03:12.489> only<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.910> performance<00:03:13.420> also<00:03:13.660> the

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
up but not only the performance also the

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.560 
up but not only the performance also the
feel<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.650> brake<00:03:14.859> has<00:03:15.340> changed<00:03:15.790> quite<00:03:16.209> a

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
feel of the brake has changed quite a

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.380 
feel of the brake has changed quite a
lot

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
lot

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.690 
lot
so<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.510> whole<00:03:18.660> package<00:03:19.080> of<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.410> car<00:03:19.620> with<00:03:20.550> the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
so the whole package of the car with the

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.240 
so the whole package of the car with the
suspension<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.569> aerodynamic<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.010> wheels

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
suspension the aerodynamic the wheels

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.780 
suspension the aerodynamic the wheels
the<00:03:23.910> wider<00:03:24.150> tires<00:03:24.540> makes<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.860> really<00:03:26.340> fun<00:03:26.610> to

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
the wider tires makes it a really fun to

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
the wider tires makes it a really fun to
drive<00:03:27.000> package<00:03:27.900> on<00:03:28.730> its<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.970> highway<00:03:30.360> or<00:03:30.750> on

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
drive package on its the highway or on

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.440 
drive package on its the highway or on
the<00:03:31.140> mountain<00:03:31.530> road<00:03:31.819> or<00:03:32.819> even<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.209> city

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
the mountain road or even the city

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.690 
the mountain road or even the city
because<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.290> suspension<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.950> set<00:03:35.130> up<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:35.670> that

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
because the suspension is set up so that

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.030 
because the suspension is set up so that
it's<00:03:36.000> not<00:03:36.330> giving<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.810> big<00:03:37.019> shocks<00:03:37.319> so<00:03:37.890> when

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
it's not giving you big shocks so when

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.240 
it's not giving you big shocks so when
you<00:03:38.160> drive<00:03:38.340> with<00:03:38.610> your<00:03:39.860> girlfriend<00:03:40.860> or<00:03:41.069> wife

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
you drive with your girlfriend or wife

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.880 
you drive with your girlfriend or wife
you<00:03:41.610> have<00:03:42.480> no<00:03:42.630> trouble<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.769> get

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
you have no trouble that you get

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.670 
you have no trouble that you get
complaints<00:03:44.310> because<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.870> will<00:03:46.019> be<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.410> smooth

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
complaints because it will be a smooth

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.550 
complaints because it will be a smooth
ride<00:03:46.709> without<00:03:47.700> being<00:03:48.000> too<00:03:48.209> harsh<00:03:48.510> all<00:03:49.290> right

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560

now<00:03:49.890> I<00:03:49.920> explained<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.519> lot<00:03:50.640> about<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.030> car<00:03:51.239> how

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
now I explained a lot about the car how

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.870 
now I explained a lot about the car how
good<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.870> let's<00:03:52.530> put<00:03:52.739> it<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.040> test
