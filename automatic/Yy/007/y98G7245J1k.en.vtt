00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.770
 This looks awful with jochen 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.750
 Now just put the mirror 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.730
 which we want today over pirates 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.530
 Talk about one of the first open 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.120
 world games ever being the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.790
 matter of opinion is one could also say 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.520
 that elite 1984 the first open world 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.740
 Game was this space open world 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.470
 then you can only play the game in 1987 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.119
 True, I was 19 780 eight years old 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.269
 and I actually at eight 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.769
 played and it is the first game in 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.910
 I'm so really right 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.619
 lost in there 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.059
 yes, you can really get in there 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.180
 lose that is the completely free 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.149
 drivable Caribbean game between 1560 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.340
 and 1680 also really realistic 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.020
 colonial powers spain is in progress 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.700
 this age consider these six time 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.989
 the one experienced there ever weaker this 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.489
 at the nation holland england and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.050
 france while at the same time always 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.910
 more powerful than he has this historic 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.829
 background and at the same time an open 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.180
 world in which all this takes place and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.739
 what I find funny all along 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.850
 history is that that too 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.050
 bit as additional 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.789
 difficulty level worked 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.780
 age in the rhine is rising there 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.219
 although still different 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.809
 difficulty levels you at the beginning 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.180
 but if you can to 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.830
 example 560 game does not exist at all 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.600
 dutch settlement throughout 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.460
 Caribbean There are only a few and completely 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.140
 poor English and French masters 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.090
 and this makes the game clear 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.530
 harder the first time such a 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.670
 order basis 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.659
 Ever want all the plunder 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.939
 to sell 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.110
 But where did you want to capture what to play 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.729
 because there is a pirate at all 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.680
 natural for me are the pirates 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.659
 most terrible possible scenario of 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.009
 I have to say honestly I have to 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.600
 but honestly say that paris 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.520
 definitely has its appeal because of this 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.500
 game world is simply dynamic and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.240
 feels alive when so im constantly 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.799
 any random events or 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.270
 Cities are from other nations 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.170
 conquered and that's how it feels 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.299
 just real 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.710
 for those times this was this 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.180
 whole dynamic world hand too 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.619
 completely innovative I still can 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.960
 Remember 1 of the most shocking 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.610
 The experiences of my life were as 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.799
 I am after the kaperfahrt with a 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.750
 huge booty drove back and from 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.369
 barbados what my home port so to speak 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.350
 was decided and then 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.409
 realized that there was the Spanish 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.610
 flag over it now awful but 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.159
 really shocking than shocking 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.880
 every plot twists and actually it is 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.319
 also so that game was playful 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.030
 very very diverse has very many 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.370
 different levels there are yes there 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.590
 sea ​​battles there are land battles 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.310
 there are even light ones 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.080
 roleplaying when you have skills 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.840
 could vote so somehow 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.130
 or ray charles so charisma with the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.450
 At that time I never found out fans 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.370
 That's why I do not have that 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.870
 by the way, just like skeleton 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.970
 Madison where I always thought 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.220
 what should i do with medicine junk but that 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.840
 not unimportant because of your career 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.069
 continue on a certain number of 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.959
 years limited 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.250
 then you will indeed forcedly moderate to rest 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.050
 you have to stop it that much 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.610
 capture as until then only somehow 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.690
 possible and if the skeleton madison 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.910
 you have taken longer 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.080
 but held on knew eight year old 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.660
 Do not sleep and that's why 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.190
 taken private TV but then comes 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.569
 always fighting a good one 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.739
 make a cut or listen to me with one 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.910
 good cut on when you're on 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.650
 the end of such an extended one 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.030
 kaperfahrt wanted to share the booty then 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.890
 have, depending on the degree of difficulty in addition 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.120
 so get some percentage of it 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.310
 a little yoke clever and has become 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.720
 I think I 'll do it now 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.829
 inland only fights with one 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.110
 single one I take myself 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.640
 survive then run and ship were 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.440
 he can not go to the next possible 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.790
 English city and get the whole thing 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.920
 but no, I still only have 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.049
 30% know what to do with the 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.220
 remaining 70 happened scandal 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.019
 the interesting also that every game 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.609
 one was already quite worked out 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.560
 this one was flat for example because 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.690
 It is important to pay attention to where 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.920
 the wind blows and when you go against the 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.389
 wind drives it is pretty much impossible 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.290
 means thick ship has a small one 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.060
 small fast ship again 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.959
 so you had to catch that real 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.519
 also tackle tactically 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.019
 Incidentally, this also applies to one's own 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.430
 crew because the cards 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.290
 So if you eat too little, for example 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.459
 or you have too many men on board 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.200
 you have and you look metered there is 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.340
 yes not yes they do indeed when 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.200
 Too many men is what I am 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.049
 wanted to say and does not do enough 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.160
 booty in a long time then wanted 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.780
 he is a lieutenant then you have to stop 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.040
 fight the fight and if you 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.650
 you win a very short one 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.209
 time lapse time for the cause of this 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.350
 otherwise they put the 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.000
 Just relax on a lonely island 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.350
 and you lose a few years of play 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.049
 scandal 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.500
 there was a remake of pirate then one 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.359
 It was cold in 1993, though 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.340
 almost congruent with the original 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.599
 has now super vga graphic one 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.669
 Mouse support was available in the 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.120
 original was not too pretty 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.919
 but get us I do not believe 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.530
 there was an infinite time to record 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.570
 namely much later in the year 2004 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.430
 one more complete 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.270
 revised remakes sid meier's 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.530
 pirates but already told meyer is 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.479
 patricia developed by cit meier's 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.410
 civilization creator In 2004 he became himself 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.020
 then finally sat down and said 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.910
 Now I have to say it again 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.380
 has aged remarkably well yes that is 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.729
 one of the very few players too 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.220
 that time is a bit like that 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.320
 for you so a transitional time where it is 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.550
 Some play difficult today 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.880
 to play even more graphic 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.050
 respect 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.550
 and that is one of the very few 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.320
 players from this time still today 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.460
 just as much fun as it was then 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.260
 especially since it is still a bit 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.669
 have expanded than the country more 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.289
 ships as in the original 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.639
 plus a ship upgrade for example 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.500
 you could install hammocks then 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.240
 you can catch up with more crew members 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.010
 or different types of ammunition 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.139
 invite for example canton balls the 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.430
 then the sails have shredded and also 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.720
 the roleplaying elements of what 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.190
 before that, the cells had become 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.750
 expanded so there were special items 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.760
 you get in the course of the game 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.169
 could the armor pistols the constant 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.310
 before intellectual then has automatically 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.560
 once shot what the advantage 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.510
 But the funniest thing I found 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.070
 the special items actually 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.930
 were not implemented in the game 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.400
 because you could find objects 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.560
 the call with the indians and 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.180
 Jesuit factions have increased but there 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.950
 the fractions installed correctly 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.849
 you could actually have the de facto 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.130
 do not buy a call 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.289
 the items were or the scandal 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.419
 as in the original you can sud meier's 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.310
 pirates also marry the beautiful ones 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.180
 governor's daughter for it one must 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.919
 but a pretty difficult one 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.830
 minispiel exist where possible 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.690
 She has to dance perfectly with her and there is 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.810
 quite a few players I want now 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.150
 no names 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.289
 this game abysmal I find 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.240
 it's still great today I mean it is 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.710
 really such a demanding one 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.389
 mini game in that you the game yes 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.099
 also indicates which button you are on now 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.630
 just has to push but you can do it 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.660
 also completely after the clock of the music 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.250
 and it works as well 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.320
 Do you have them for meier's pirates? 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.190
 story extended in the original was her only 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.570
 rudimentary 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.250
 there was always a bit more 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.780
 meat stream it was lost 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.070
 find family members 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.870
 But it was cooler that you too 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.340
 historical pirates could meet in the 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.440
 for example, children or chains 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.940
 By the way, henry morgan are all driving 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.620
 a very special ship that exists 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.430
 only once the whole internet 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.200
 take over 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.370
 and each of them has one too 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.260
 random the game 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.460
 hiding your own treasure and at 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.560
 I have to appreciate that again now 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.630
 Original thinking because I was there then 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.900
 yourself a map painted this game world 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.979
 I knew them by heart after that 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.930
 so four or five parts of the 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.370
 sweetheart and I always have only one 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.930
 in part because I really needed each 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.729
 rapids knew or have one 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.710
 Seeing the rapids is at 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.760
 cartagena I have that intense 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.340
 played madness 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.720
 Last but not least there are usually too 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.919
 more dynamic events in the world 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.600
 then a bit too 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.919
 became more alive and you could do this 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.790
 dynamic events also more 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:06:59.600
 intervention 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.190
 for example the one in the 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.320
 troop transporter the Spaniard boarded 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.150
 does not have the English port 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.320
 reach and conquer with it 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.820
 So you could do that a bit more 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.220
 Overall, one can say 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.380
 pirates actually a legendary series 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.740
 a legendary game with a very 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.910
 good remake that you should know if 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.800
 to make computer games 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.180
 Finally, I would like to 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.620
 Mentioned the remake has almost now 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.880
 ten years on the hump this is again 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.919
 is played by the one I find one 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.070
 It may be necessary to remake this 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:31.210
 would be quasi sid meier's pirates gold 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.210
 I have to go
