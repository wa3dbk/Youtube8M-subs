00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
beyond the status quo and looked at the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.389 
beyond the status quo and looked at the
facts<00:00:39.180> Massey<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.290> probably<00:00:40.649> as<00:00:40.829> efficient<00:00:41.309> if

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
facts Massey is probably as efficient if

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.280 
facts Massey is probably as efficient if
not<00:00:41.579> more<00:00:41.790> efficient<00:00:42.180> than<00:00:42.300> John<00:00:42.480> Deere<00:00:42.719> fuel

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
not more efficient than John Deere fuel

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.029 
not more efficient than John Deere fuel
efficiency<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.190> 3/10<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.300> 1/2<00:00:46.050> gallon<00:00:46.800> per

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
efficiency is 3/10 to 1/2 gallon per

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.660 
efficiency is 3/10 to 1/2 gallon per
acre<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:48.450> my<00:00:48.690> John<00:00:49.530> Deere<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.100> was<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
acre and with my John Deere it was a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.700 
acre and with my John Deere it was a
gallon<00:00:51.149> two<00:00:51.300> acre<00:00:51.480> no<00:00:51.750> matter<00:00:51.989> what<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.500> did

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
we like the horsepower on it because

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.779 
we like the horsepower on it because
we're<00:00:54.989> pulling<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.350> 30-foot<00:00:55.829> butterfly<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.640> we

now<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.540> other<00:02:00.810> companies<00:02:01.229> come<00:02:01.409> along<00:02:01.680> and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
now the other companies come along and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.859 
now the other companies come along and
jump<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.610> act<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:02.969> wow<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.509> invented

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
