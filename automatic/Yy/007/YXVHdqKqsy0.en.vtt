00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.730
 Hello guys 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.620
 this video is showing you how to do 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.929
 here the configuration of your printer 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.070
 epson xp so it does not ask for more 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.050
 update 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.090
 so I came here on the control panel 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.990
 if you do not have access here you can come 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.300
 here to start printer device 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.699
 if you have the control panel you 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.170
 comes here to show people in 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.700
 devices and you will have your 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.260
 printer installed 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.020
 so I came here on the clock side is going 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.460
 select that arrow and will have 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.660
 printer can do this 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.629
 procedure here 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.309
 right-clicking 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.489
 software update setup 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.230
 This will click to never ever 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.000
 request to upgrade but even 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.160
 thus had some cases of clients who 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.809
 had using an informed 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.760
 update so I'll just put it here 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.879
 do not want to rock update 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.070
 so she did not ask for the update if you 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.270
 does not have this click on the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.070
 right here on top of 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.500
 device in your printer. 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.130
 printer in case the preference of 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.100
 printing is that on the maintenance and 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.119
 here is the information to epson states 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.509
 monitor 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.509
 you can see the level of this type and 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.939
 here from the software update 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.470
 this version here version 7 rondônia has 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.380
 nothing to do with the update so 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.970
 then you can not be quiet around the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.950
 6.9 7.12 then this would take the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.659
 that there is a new version of the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.509
 software update with the intention to legalize 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.810
 Coca not so good I do not even want it 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.270
 update because it has a training 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.930
 liquid as in the case the former president 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.149
 is not updated so will let 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.159
 that even if you do not have this information 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.409
 It's not me I came here again to 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.500
 update without it will look for the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.939
 update and will want to update it 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.179
 be software update 3rd eps software 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.429
 downloading 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.230
 just wait that he is 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.959
 updating a software update that this 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.959
 here father is looking for 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.659
 software updates remind me that 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.010
 I'm making a model xp 411 she like you 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.420
 410 né 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.939
 so you have to be very careful because 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.189
 have some of the updates that are the 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.739
 big and you have to have that key 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.290
 to do the de- actualizing that is by 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.829
 ic reset so be very careful to 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.099
 updating this here is the pharma mip date 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:46.010
 Here's the driver for the 7.13 printer. 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:48.109
 so here version 7.12 version 7.11 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.220
 the printer driver has nothing to 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.439
 watch with farmer 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.069
 so many people in many seedlings 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:57.439
 product resellers selling book 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.109
 rechargeable cartridges thing so he 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:02.209
 was stressed in this update here does not have 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.430
 nothing to see this update that is just the 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.709
 software and whether this software 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.290
 management of the printout is 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.680
 you have all the options are and then 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.489
 this option as the fábio is even this 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.829
 numbering at 0m 03 in the case of 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.280
 so sakineh has several models is 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.150
 mirror 211 and 214 81 among others 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.220
 right models 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.169
 here is asking you to update you will never 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.819

 Automatic Update 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.329
 this will leave arm locations in and 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.540
 never leaves ok here another method is 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.489
 time to go out if it was closed 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.650
 here is no longer to update if 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.040

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.500
 we can explain at the moment but avoid 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.060
 do this procedure right there for her 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.069

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.169
 to recognize the nozzle cartridges kit 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.479
 rechargeable battery which in this case is 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.799
