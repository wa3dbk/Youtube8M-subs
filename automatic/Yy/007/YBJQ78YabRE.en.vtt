00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 very good I am me so is the 7 and 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.390
 well we are in another video I have 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.640
 a long time without uploading a video 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.130
 and I 'm sorry but it's because of lack of 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.430
 time and among other things because it did not go up 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.020
 no good video 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.860
 in this video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.110
 download the 1 resident for pc 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.690
 it's really for playstation 1 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.220
 but we are going to emulate it so that it works 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.080
 in our pc 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.920
 Well, I raised the fire and the 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.620
 emulator is worth a mega and good 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.170
 you give to download and good will 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.650
 download a file and when 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.020
 have 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.020
 there will be something like this 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.440
 we will have something exactly like this 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.629
 worth a rare winrar file worth and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.180
 well then when we have this 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.360
 file what we are going to do is fold 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.360
 right click to extract here we extract 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.670
 we hope a little that has just been extracted 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.130
 since the game occupies a bit it does not reach 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.939
 the 2 gigas but good 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.149
 when we have downloaded from the 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:26.180
 file we will have two folders one 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.179
 that is called ps 177 emulator and others 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.050
 'resident evil' 1 towards the killer 7 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:35.780
 well then we open this emulator ps1 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.970
 and we will have all these files good 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.520
 we give to this who is the executor of 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.200
 click xvii emulator double click 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.039
 then the emulator will open 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.990
 so now we give the file 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:55.320
 insert cd images 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.560
 and then we have to go to whatever 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.720
 from the beginning 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.229
 we give him a desk and from the 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.630
 We look for the folder that we have 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.229
 extracted before that is the president see 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.989
 a series of 7 then we open and it will be 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.250
 what is the file of the game we give 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.550
 Double click 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.220
 and the game will open 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.640
 ok wait a bit and the game will be 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.640
 will open automatically 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.640
 Well now would have to wait a bit 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.880
 there is always that these games taking 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.300
 load good but you can see it simple 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.980
 capcom 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.600
 this is an intro 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.820
 and there it is 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.430
 the typical scene of this game because what 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.189
 it starts 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.260
 then to any button from the 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:54.230
 new game and well then I think that 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.519
 it's worth not then something else if you want 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.519
 configure the controls 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.720
 well here waiting for oslo I say 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:10.140
 configuration file 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.660
 and then here to controls and here and 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.830
 adjustments to your liking I'm not going to 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.590
 teach because it 's pretty easy 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.050
 you will only click where you want 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.820
 change and then type the key 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.820
 corresponding and you are 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.940
