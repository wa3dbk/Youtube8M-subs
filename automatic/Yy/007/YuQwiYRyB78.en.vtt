00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.130
 as part of the presentation to the scion the customer chooses windows to 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.590
 shutters all vinyl with a glass of water where there is double glazing 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.710
 before starting to work it to bonn is up to it must check 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.599
 one last time all the measures 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.800
 if ever it was an error 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.759
 it is better to see it before dismantling the old window of such 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.539
 precautions are part of the work routine in order to have 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.430
 the assurance of being so satisfying 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.470
 m 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.030
 in brest to the actor must dismount the existing window by taking all 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.559
 the necessary precautions not to damage the structure in place 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.620
 and sales definition parts be reinstalled 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.220
 In general, we strongly recommend changing the framework of 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.770
 old windows indeed the space between the old villemure and 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.059
 rarely well airtight and watertight 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.940
 which may increase heating costs 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.480
 more remove the frame is the only way to detect problems 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.590
 hidden such as the internal rot of the ca brive or the structure of the building 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.300
 old frames will only be kept when it is a question of 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.320
 old structure for particular 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.320
 it's hard to touch you 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.380
 Many installers thoroughly inspect the rough opening in order to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.700
 make sure all materials and parts in the wall are in good condition 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.560
 it is then possible to make the necessary repairs so that the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.560
 old problem does not happen again with new window 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.510
 the stat the earth will finish preparing the opening so as to ensure 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.650
 then an effective and durable support at the new window 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.040
 this step determining the performance of the window 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.310
 after installation 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.670
 without definitively fixing the window is put in place 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.630
 ideal in the opening 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.680
 the location will be chosen so that the glazing is located at 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.420
 maximum in the warm part of the opening 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.499
 this is for the purpose 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:05.359
 to reduce heat loss hessic condensation inside 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.629
 in the step of setting the anchor it is important to plan the space 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.149
 necessary on each side for the window to accept normal movements 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:19.390
 framing without being stuck 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.110
 installers will have to put in the right place buses and 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.229
 quality 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:28.169
 in order to ensure the proper functioning of the windows it is important that it be 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:32.349
 aisle level stone aida clan ie among other things that runners 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.269
 must be perfectly 90 degrees 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.060
 it is best to drill pilot holes in window frames 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:40.499
 and use clues 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:44.059
 this allows a better fit in andrew threads by unscrewing 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.909
 the installation is more solid and the window does not undergo a truce when 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.909
 temperature changes 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:57.879
 there are several methods and products of isolation an analysis 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.069
 done during the initial visit of the installer will allow him to 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.459
 advise the best solution for your home 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.829
 as part of this estimation we have chosen to use from the eu the 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.139
 states to conduct as insulation this will ensure we 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.139
 adequate sealing against air infiltration 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.430
 in order to make sure of the finish the installer wear a care 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.619
 particular to the establishment of hatred 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.829
 he will have to use the caulking product whose elasticity 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.849
 will accept without taking off the differences in the expansion of 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.509
 classroom materials 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:37.439
 the caulking will therefore pass the watertightness you will play between 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.920
 the frame of the window 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.879
 and the exterior siding 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.160
 the size of the day 1a very important promises the day a lack 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.130
 adhesion 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.130
 too much maybe it lacks elasticity 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.920
 at the initial meeting the installer will discuss with you 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.299
 definition ethics that you would like to have this type of framing that's 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.959
 window extension 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.309
 in the case of the presence of facilities the customer has chosen a 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:07.460
 extension covered with vinyl 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.880
 and wooden framing with them after as interior finish 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.749
 the installer will be that precise cuts have been made in order to 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:18.749
 guarantee that a neat finish 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.580
 the installer this will leave the premises in the same state it was 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.870
 at the beginning of the works 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.849
 he will take care of picking up construction debris 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.849
 the daÃ¯ras the cleanliness of the places 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.880
 a subscriber installers will perform do you have inspection for 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.990
 the approval of the works he will make sure to explain the functioning of the 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.690
 Windows 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.150
 to examine together the guarantees offered 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.220
 and give you specific maintenance advice to the type of 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.199
 installed products
