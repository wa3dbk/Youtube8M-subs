00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.830
 not then there and someone that delivers 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.070
 headset must come 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.200
 thus the already excelsior striker scores against 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.490
 are for the club in the freezer 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.140
 [Music] 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.519
 [Applause] 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.550
 all right 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.630
 marion you tomorrow again yes indeed is the 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.849
 time taken and yes I was the problem 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.130
 pep if you sit there is marne this 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.890
 valve and then you have all expectations 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.050
 from playing and playing so much 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.910
 enjoy here and in addition to a social six 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.079
 games on the side there are word 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.030
 you are still limited 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.670
 I think that along with technical staff 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.950
 well resolved that I am following another 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.020
 program where d and so thick original 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.629
 remained at the same level 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.370
 and lens shame that every saturday 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.140
 the last training before the match and 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.680
 yes then it is my white open i have 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.329
 no 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.370
 key in in three quarters and that they are like that 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.810
 difficult for you then less a part 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.420
 from the group 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.290
 yes a bit because yes you do your training 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.450
 focused on something 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.059
 you train to get better but 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.850
 not because that shows on some 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.170
 then and that is the most difficult than if 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.899
 we return to reality 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.490
 ajax there is yes at the door 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.780
 everyone a special competition 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.990
 absolutely you it lives here in the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.060
 city ​​also in the group with us and yes already 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.709
 from actually last week as after the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.659
 now he is also talking about it 

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:24.340
 what two actually also vvd first 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.439
 had afterwards it is a shame that 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.479
 happens then but I think we have some 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.409
 very good chance to get that right 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.420
 to put 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.920
 the away match against ajax played for years 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.060
 unexpected for peer that match then 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.520
 to experience 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.529
 yes no the trainer that they got from the son 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.939
 which was not so nice and the cda 

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:44.920
 then it becomes choose whether now and I had to 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.099
 him just my garden and I had you go 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.539
 fairly resolved once you have the choice 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:52.119
 card or prefer to play 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.069
 then where should you give everything and 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.159
 had then done so is right 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:00.130
 ajax out and also play well 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.139
 and still am to a different club and 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.719
 yes on a different system than at that time 

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:06.880
 excelsior then that is still on 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.920
 confirming that the remainder is the good one 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.010
 is going in that direction and that is a good step 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.790
 who just what you expect without me 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.040
 think 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.110
 quite a hope contest in the side 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.580
 must and we very much want one 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.209
 actually also have to finish it for sure 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.680
 walked without and he children as a result 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.900
 that it will be a great match a lot 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.400
 a lot of tension anyway a lot of struggle 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.380
 and 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.380
 yes i hope more goals from seven
