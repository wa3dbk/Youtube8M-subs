00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.180
 Y 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.920
 As this girl I am Raquel, this is the 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.160
 nail art design we're going to be 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.779
 doing now let's start the enamel 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.259
 color that I will be using be 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.250
 from in wise and that is called love letters 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.679
 I'm going to apply this enamel 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.750
 going to the side of my nail followed 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.940
 by this using a black color together 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.250
 with my brush to outline I'll be 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.460
 making a limit remarking the area 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.750
 where you apply the back in pink 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.370
 using the same brush I will start 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.129
 to paint my smile line 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.680
 French design with the same black color 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.210
 and I want the lines on the sides 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.210
 be enough highlighted 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.930
 using the same black color I will 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.530
 fill this whole area 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.530
 all right 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.370
 again using my brush to 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.410
 delineate together with the black color I'm going to 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.940
 make a series of black lines going 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.480
 to the side 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.480
 ah 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.049
 now going to the opposite side I'm going to 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.610
 do exactly the same thing but 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.490
 this time nothing else I will be doing 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.259
 three lines this is the design that I have 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.540
 on all my nails in the area of 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.100
 back with the first design with which 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.250
 let's start is with the one who has the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.869
 green leaf vineyard for my little 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.240
 French design and coming to the side 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.460
 I'm going to paint a curved line going 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.229
 up using the same brush 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.240
 to delineate together with the green color 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.780
 I'm going to make a series of green leaves 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.780
 Y 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.870
 starting towards the side of my design 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.540
 French I'll be doing a line 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.849
 of little white dots outlining my design 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.620
 French starting towards the side of the 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.519
 vineyard I will do exactly the same 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.110
 thing another line of white dots 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.849
 using my brush to outline I'll 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.920
 be using a green color in a 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.900
 stronger tone and nothing else I will do 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.540
 a limited finite in the center of each 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.670
 one of the green leaves and that's it 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.440
 for this design of the green vineyard now 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.040
 let's start working on the other 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.079
 design that is the freehand rose 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.840
 I'm going to start by dipping my brush 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:47.900
 half in white and the other half in a 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.540
 violet color what I'm going to do now 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.879
 is to put pressure on my little plate and carry 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.219
 brush it aside and I'm going to do 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.739
 this several times this assures me that 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.299
 my brush is well loaded I'm going to 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.480
 flip and I'll do exactly what 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.700
 same thing I'm going to submerge again at 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.060
 back to white and violet 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.790
 go over the brush for my saucer once 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.379
 more causing pressure this too 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.379
 Make sure the colors are right 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.319
 mixed and you look prettier the flower and 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:21.109
 I'm ready to use my brush 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.540
 I'm going to touch my brush with my nail 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:27.169
 little pressure and start taking it 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.650
 towards the east side is the first petal 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:33.109
 of my rose nothing more with a movement 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.299
 very slowly I'm taking my brush 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.519
 towards the side moving from above towards 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.760
 down and moving my brush finishing 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.459
 there I will be going over one more time 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.919
 this petal so that the color looks more 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.730
 vibrant now it's time to start with 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.800
 the second 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.810
 I'm going to do exactly the same thing 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.450
 but this petal I want to take it more 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.849
 towards the center of my nail 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.629
 I'm doing exactly the same thing 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:02.030
 moving my brush slowly from side to 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.970
 side up down and moving it from 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.310
 side at the same time 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.810
 and there is the petal the end of the 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.540
 area of ​​the soloist of my French design 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.670
 I'm going to review this flower once more 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.890
 again doing the same thing so that it 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.890
 see more petal this petal 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.950
 now it's time to work the third 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.050
 petal I move my brush to the side and 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.050
 I do exactly the same thing 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.130
 again I will also go over this flower 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.130
 once again 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.509
 now it's time to start working on 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.449
 a second line and this petal is going to be 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:42.700
 smaller, going more towards the center 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.590
 of the flower 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.550
 I'm going to start working on the second 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.440
 petal doing the same thing but with 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.660
 smaller movements so that this 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.010
 petal is smaller and this petal 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.010
 I'll go over it one more time 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.530
 now I'm going to work the third petal 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.120
 I'm doing exactly the same thing 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.310
 ending there 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.139
 now I'm going to work on my third line 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.940
 these are going to be two petals nothing more and 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.139
 I'm doing the same thing but the 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.889
 petals have to be even more 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.889
 little ones 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.440
 your rose could already be finished 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.449
 center but I like to add a 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.160
 a little more detail using a 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.289
 brush for the workshop I'm painting a 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.570
 letter is looking down and another 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.130
 looking up now what I'm going to 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.949
 make my flower look more 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.560
 detailed and more in 3-d what I'm going to 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:42.320
 to do is delineate each petal of my flower 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.300
 with a white color and for this I am 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.300
 using my brush to draw 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.100
 it's time to start painting the vineyard 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.260
 going to the side of the nail I'm 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.310
 using my brush to draw together 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.530
 with a green acrylic paint 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.200
 you can decide to paint your vineyard 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.970
 as you want once your vineyard 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.050
 is painted it's time to add the 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.050
 little green leaves 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.120
 using my brush to draw together 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.139
 with an acrylic green color in a tone 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.910
 stronger 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.349
 I will be painting in the finite line 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.599
 in the center of each of the leaves 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:58.880
 green now I will be adding 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:58.880
 little white dots on certain areas 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:04.809
 in the end I decided to add one more vignette 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.520
 together with a green leaf in the center 

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:09.069
 I'm going to be painting 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.659
 one limits in a stronger green tone and 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:12.580
 that's it, that 's how they're going to achieve 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:14.949
 This nail art design appliques 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.659
 his coat of brightness to finish I hope 

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:18.339
 who have enjoyed this video and who 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:20.409

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:23.819
