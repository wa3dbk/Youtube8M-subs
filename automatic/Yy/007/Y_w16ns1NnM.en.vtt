 beach of san bartolo 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.190
 this epic route dates from the beginning of the 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.890
 nineties and was initiated by pioneers the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.250

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:08.420
 melé and alfonso rodas who after several 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.660
 attempts managed to unite what is today 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.730
 considered a classic and obligatory route 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.190

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.780
 that you feel you have gone through a path 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.780

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.120
 thread of the road and there go the 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.090
 I do not see it flying around 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.750
 out there not to take out because some do not 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.750

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:54.830
 I was so shattered 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.850
 there are huge walls that are formed and 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.850
 the vehicles can not pass 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.510

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.289
