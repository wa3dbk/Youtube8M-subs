00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.370
Sup homegirl? This week we gettin’
in to some devil’s bidness with Doctor Faustus

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.660
by Christopher Marlowe.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.300
Now befo’ we get started, I gotta
lay down some truth real quick. There are

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.470
actually two different versions of this text-
A and B. This summary gonna cover the A- text.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.770
So, Doc Faustus chillin at his spot
one day bored as hell. Brutha starts crackin

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.860
open a few books- “hmm Logic? Meh. Medicine?
Done that. Law? Psh. Maynee this is some basic-ass

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.010
sh**.” So he holla at his servant: “WAGNER!
Get yo ass in here! Grab dem two magician

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.120
boys Valdes and Cornelius, cuz those shady
cats prolly know a thing or two bout where

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.570
a brutha can learn some conjurin, you get
me?”

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.500
When Sigfried and Roy drop in, they
hook Doc Faustus up with some Magic 101. So

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.070
the Doc fu**in round with his new magic when
ZAP! A demon named Mephistophilis pop up and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.740
all like “yo!” Faustus like: “say bruh.
Think when you go back to hell you can do

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.280
me a solid and axe Satan if we can do some
bidness? Maybe trade my Soul for some BANGIN

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.450
SUPERPOWERS? Naw sayin? Mephistophilis like:
“Fo Sho.”

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.829
So Mephistophilis talks to da big
man downstairs and a deal is struck: Faustus

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.960
gonna have 24 years of livin’ tha’ baller’s
dream, but at the end, he gonna have to hand

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.039
over his Soul.
￼

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.740
Since the devil got plenty of lawyers in hell
with him, he make Faustus sign a contract

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.829
wit his own blood. But when the doc try to
sign dat pap, his blood start congealin- like

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.249
it tellin him “hold up son! Da hell you
think you doin?!” Eventually, though, he

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:49.170
gets deem juices flowin’ and sells his soul
fo’ da world.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.090
Erry now and then, Faustus be wonderin’
if he can axe God fo’ forgiveness and back

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.439
outta the deal with the devil- but whenever
he do, brutha either say “Nah... fu** it,”

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.740
or a scary-ass demon pop up outta nowhere
and be like “boo muthafu**a!” Other than

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.359
that, tho, it’s straight up partying like
it don’t even matta’. Mephistophilis like

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:11.860
“Hey Pssst. Lemme give u da lowdown on some
of da universe’s secrets, padna,” then

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.200
takes Faustus to the Vatican, where they turn
invisible and mess wit da Pope.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.550
When they done wit dat, they head to the German
Emperor’s digs. The emperor wanna meet an

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.080
OG ruler, so he axe Faustus to conjure up
of Alexander The Great. Faustus oblige a brutha

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.720
best he can, and errybody eatin it up, cept
one knight who frontin’ like “Psh. Dat

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.230
ain’t even tight.” Faustus like “What
you say?” and ZOW- gives dat hater a pair

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.310
of horns. COLD BLOODED.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.450
Afta dey peace out, the doc sells a horse
to some bruh, but it turn in to hay as soon

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.470
as it get wet. When da horse-man try to get
his cash back from a snoozin’ Faustus, he keep screamin

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.420
and hollerin’ at the doc tryin to get him
to wake up. Eventually, he pull his leg- which

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.010
pops RIGHT OFF. Turn out Faustus was trollin
him double time. Daym this cat is cold.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.930
￼Later, Faustus chillin wit his scholar
homies when an old geezer pop in and say “You

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.270
best get off yo ass and repent if you wanna
see Heaven mayne.” Faustus jus’ bout to

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.230
sh** his pants with dat clock tickin down,
and starts to get his repentance on; but Mephistophilis

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.450
bust in and be like “Faustus I will jack
yo white ass UP if you don’t chill.” At

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.550
11 o’clock, Faustus realize he only got
one mo’ hour til he gotta give up his soul.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.120
IT’S GETTIN REAL UP IN HERE

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.870
Fo Faustus, dat last hour feel longer than
the last than last 24 years combined. But

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.820
time don’t stop fo’ nobody. So when da
clock strikes 12, Faustus start cryin out

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:42.590
like a lil bitch, and the demons drag his
magical ass to hell.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.660
This play has stirred up mad controvery over
da years. Like I said earlier, there are actually

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.760
two different versions of it- and Ain’t
nobody know which one is da legit version.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.500
Scholars been all up on eachotha’s nuts
bout it fo’ years.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.570
Da first one hit da scene in 1604, called
the A-text, and the otha’ dropped bout 12

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.240
years later, called the B-text. Some cats
think the A text is messy, repetitive, and

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.640
goofy as fu** compared to the B text. Even
tho there’s only bout a 600 line difference

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.070
between the two, peeps think dat pretty much
changes the whole game.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.650
￼
Some thugs thinkin dat 600 lines are the difference

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.819
between Faustus CHOOSIN’ to sell his soul
and bein TRICKED in to doin it... like somebody

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:25.120
pullin his strings.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.210
Since Faustus CHOOSES damnation in text A,
most of the sufferin’ he beast through is

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.440
psychological; so all throughout da play he
goin back and forth between rollin wit da

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.490
devil’s crew, or jumpin ship and reppin
God’s people.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.400
“My heart’s so hardened I cannot repent.
/ Scarce can I name salvation, faith, or heaven,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.540
/ But fearful echoes thunder in mine ears,
/ ‘Faustus, thou art damned.’” (2.3.18-

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.290
21)
“But Faustus’ offence can ne’er be pardoned.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.880
The serpent that tempted Eve may be saved,
but not Faustus.” (5.2.15-16)

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.590
Sho, the B-text got plenty o’ dat too. But
it got a greater focus on dat physical pain.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.500
That’s why at the end of the B-text, Faustus
don’t just get carried away. Nah blood.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.600
Brutha gets his ass TO UP by demons.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.820
But the controversy don’t stop there, sucka.
Some scholars sayin’ this is one of da most

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.310
Satanic dramas eva’. Others think it’s
one of da most Christian. WHAT? Others arguin’

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.350
bout which denomination and often pullin in
ideas of Calvinist Predestination up in here.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.160
￼Predestination basically mean that some
hustlas are so legit that they are destined

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.620
from day one to get in to heaven, whereas
errybody else is damned to hell for all eternity

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.780
and there’s NOTHING they can do about it.
God’s choice. THAT’S RIGHT. No matter

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.320
if you savin’ the whales, feedin’ the
poor, or pre-ordering the Thug Notes book-

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.660
It don’t matter, you ain’t never gettin’
past dem Pearly Gates unless you got da hookup.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.450
So is Faustus condemned to hell cuz he actin’
out? Or is he actin’ out cuz he condemned

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.210
to hell? Is the play sayin’ dat you gonna
get put in yo place if you try to mess with

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.260
God’s laws, or is it way mo’ fu**ed up
than that? Maybe Marlowe sayin’ dat God’

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.480
“divine will” is crooked as hell. Is it
possible fo’ Faustus to repent like da Good

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.139
Angel and da Old Man tellin’ him? Or is
salvation impossible fo’ him no matter what?

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:14.050
Well I sho as hell don’t know da answer
to all dem questions. But as far as I’m

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.970
concerned, I’ll put my money on da old man.
“O gentle Faustus, leave this damned art,

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.270
/ This magic, that will charm thy soul to
hell / And quite bereave thee of salvation.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.169
/ Though thou hast now offended like a man.
/ Do not persever in it like a devil. (5.1.34-38)

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:33.320
Erry one of us gonna make mistakes- and sometimes
dem mistakes gonna be so big and bad dat we

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.520
don’t think it’ll ever get better. Thing
is, you really can save yo’self.: Even if

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.900
it feels like it’ll take an act of God to
do it, you just gotta step off all dat and

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.510
switch lanes to the righteous path. Naw mean?

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.750

as I dive in to Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut.
