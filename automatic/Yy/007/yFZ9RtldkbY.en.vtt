00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.900
 but you see this hole that very old and 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:10.880
 little use of the environment for this charge 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:15.309
 long time that is for let's see 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.309
 the spark plug number 2 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:28.360
 and here we are let's see how are you 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.110
 see you side electrode in good 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.500
 state 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.160
 central electro 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.010
 worn for very little 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.610
 fuel consumption is something 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.800
 but it can be more than anything by losses 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.290
 of compression because here you also see 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.630
 very black or the car has been a lot 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.140
 stopped time 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.140
 or 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.370
 and begins to pass oil the step of 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.960
 oil remember up very fast 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.960
 the catalina converter 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.220
 how 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.480
 let's see this station has two fans 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.980
 but you as it is excessively 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.920
 black woman because it is so excessive 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.830
 gasoline consumption 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.600
 by in this case they and the others whose 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.780
 they left welfare because more black 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.810
 called a valve or is it happening 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.110
 too much oil is how it is 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.149
 black the internal pottery the electors 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.350
 central sides are also very 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:38.330
 black if you have many pieces of coal 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.020
 the coal remember not gasoline is 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.030
 sea ​​oil if two is already happening 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.799
 a lot of oil the most that passes the floor 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.170
 number three 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.429
 let's see reach to see these lines 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.429
 that are next to my nail 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.310
 if you see them well 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.240
 see you that means that the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.780
 current is jumping from here 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.780
 Asia 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.270
 our nut where to squeeze is low 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:16.150
 of the oxide can be by bad spark plug or 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.390
 cable in poor condition are usually the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.050
 Spark plugs can become wires 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.810
 let's throw it away and here's another brightness 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.330
 here if it happens to you to descend and 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.350
 then the nail will feel like there 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:36.270
 be like that very pitted tear is 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.270
 when the media stream jumps
