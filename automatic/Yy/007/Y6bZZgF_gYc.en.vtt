00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.029
 carried out

 The anesthetic is called by a specialist name or a specialist

 likewise in the field of anesthesia falls the representation of the heart

 by means of a tram in the sofa like an echo 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.570

 Cardiac Surgeons Cardio anesthesiologists and cardiotechnicians on the one hand 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.920
 very safe operations and narcosis publishing 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.530
 In addition, the anesthesiologists have set the goal not only patients 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.880
 to provide the highest level of security 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.930
 especially in the operations as comfortable as possible

 In the intensive care unit, the anesthesia is continued for a few hours 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.390
 to allow gentle stress and painless waking up 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.180
 When they wake up from anesthesia they will notice 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.210
 that they are connected to devices via different lines 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.330
 This is quite normal and serves their safety and well-being

 and the organism is supplied with medicines and nutrients 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.350
 Painkillers are administered as needed so that they breathe well 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.160
 and from post can 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.870
 on the first or second day after the operation, the transfer to the 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.340
 normal station
