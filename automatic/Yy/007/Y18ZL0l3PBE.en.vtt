looked at the product and i said well

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.160 
looked at the product and i said well
maybe<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.160> work<00:00:38.309> let's<00:00:38.579> give<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.910> try

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
maybe a work let's give it a try

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.660 
maybe a work let's give it a try
basically<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.320> did<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.070> we<00:00:41.250> looked<00:00:41.460> at<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
basically we did and we looked at the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.030 
basically we did and we looked at the
results<00:00:41.820> after<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> very<00:00:43.200> intensive<00:00:43.770> clinical

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
results after a very intensive clinical

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.790 
results after a very intensive clinical
study<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:45.570> surprised<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.710> were

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
study and really surprised so we were

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.650 
study and really surprised so we were
very<00:00:46.920> excited<00:00:47.070> about<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.879> initial<00:00:48.239> results

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
very excited about the initial results

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.720 
very excited about the initial results
on<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.020> study<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.559> think<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> most<00:00:50.340> profound

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
on this study I think the most profound

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.000 
on this study I think the most profound
findings<00:00:51.300> were<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.930> saw<00:00:52.140> significant

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
findings were that you saw significant

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.660 
findings were that you saw significant
loss<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.760> body<00:00:54.120> fat<00:00:54.469> number<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.680> number<00:00:56.039> two<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
loss of body fat number one number two a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.869 
loss of body fat number one number two a
body<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.780> weight<00:00:58.050> cut<00:00:58.410> down<00:00:58.680> number<00:00:59.520> three<00:00:59.550> it

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
body of weight cut down number three it

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.819 
body of weight cut down number three it
went<00:01:00.120> down<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> torso<00:01:00.930> area<00:01:01.289> which<00:01:01.680> is

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
went down in the torso area which is

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.429 
went down in the torso area which is
really<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.129> problem<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:03.270> many<00:01:03.600> health<00:01:03.989> related

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
really a problem in many health related

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.060 
really a problem in many health related
issues<00:01:04.939> and<00:01:05.939> pathologies<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.530> product

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
issues and pathologies it's a product

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.240 
issues and pathologies it's a product
that<00:01:08.130> had<00:01:08.580> no<00:01:09.030> real<00:01:09.360> side<00:01:09.960> effects<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.650> was

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that had no real side effects and was

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.880 
that had no real side effects and was
safe<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.700> use<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.180> also<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.290> looks<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.710> it

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
safe to use and also it looks like it

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.230 
safe to use and also it looks like it
will<00:01:14.040> be<00:01:14.100> able<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.580> used<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:15.000> long-term

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
will be able to be used in long-term

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.810 
will be able to be used in long-term
weight<00:01:15.930> loss<00:01:15.990> programs<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:17.369> saw<00:01:17.580> very

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
weight loss programs we saw very

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.210 
weight loss programs we saw very
effective<00:01:18.570> changes<00:01:19.049> over<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> couple<00:01:20.159> of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
effective changes over a couple of

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.219 
effective changes over a couple of
months<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.759> think<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.240> could<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.479> continued

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
months I think this could be continued

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.859 
months I think this could be continued
over<00:01:22.560> water<00:01:23.009> curtain<00:01:23.369> time<00:01:23.759> as<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.180> physician<00:01:24.509> I

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
over water curtain time as a physician I

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.899 
over water curtain time as a physician I
get<00:01:25.049> asked<00:01:25.380> daily<00:01:25.740> about<00:01:26.070> how<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.340> lose<00:01:26.700> weight

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
get asked daily about how to lose weight

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.789 
get asked daily about how to lose weight
and<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.840> difficult<00:01:28.020> question<00:01:28.439> because

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
and it's a difficult question because

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.289 
and it's a difficult question because
there's<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> good<00:01:29.520> answer<00:01:29.700> there's

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
there's not a good answer there's

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.690 
there's not a good answer there's

the<00:02:51.670> fact<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:52.030> we<00:02:52.510> do<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:52.900> over<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.200> slower

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
the fact that we do this over a slower

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.990 
the fact that we do this over a slower
period<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:53.980> time<00:02:54.130> we're<00:02:54.400> more<00:02:54.579> likely<00:02:54.849> to

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
period of time we're more likely to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.069 
period of time we're more likely to
maintain<00:02:55.630> our<00:02:55.870> weight<00:02:56.110> loss<00:02:56.579> with<00:02:57.579> max<00:02:57.910> WLX<00:02:58.810> it

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
maintain our weight loss with max WLX it

maintain our weight loss with max WLX it
is<00:02:59.260> very<00:02:59.380> important<00:02:59.890> that<00:02:59.950> we<00:03:00.280> remain

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
is very important that we remain

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.120 
is very important that we remain
