misty effect and it doesn't end up

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.860 
misty effect and it doesn't end up
looking<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:23.729> I<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:26.520> you<00:04:26.970> know<00:04:27.000> overall<00:04:27.540> it

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:05:11.120 

all

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.810 

pretty<00:05:12.130> much<00:05:12.340> done<00:05:14.040> already<00:05:15.040> I'm<00:05:15.220> gonna<00:05:15.430> start

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
pretty much done already I'm gonna start

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.650 
pretty much done already I'm gonna start
peeling<00:05:16.300> up<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:16.900> masking<00:05:17.770> tape<00:05:18.390> and<00:05:19.390> you<00:05:19.540> guys

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
peeling up the masking tape and you guys

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.870 
peeling up the masking tape and you guys
might<00:05:19.870> be<00:05:19.900> wondering<00:05:20.020> what<00:05:20.530> kind<00:05:20.770> of<00:05:20.880> masking

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
might be wondering what kind of masking

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.780 
might be wondering what kind of masking
tape<00:05:21.910> I'm<00:05:22.270> using<00:05:22.480> this<00:05:22.930> is<00:05:23.080> actually<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:24.580> chip

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
tape I'm using this is actually the chip

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.210 
tape I'm using this is actually the chip
is<00:05:24.940> kind<00:05:25.180> of<00:05:25.300> Alex<00:05:25.840> we<00:05:26.080> taped<00:05:26.470> that<00:05:26.680> I<00:05:26.770> get<00:05:26.950> fine

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
is kind of Alex we taped that I get fine

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.340 
is kind of Alex we taped that I get fine
from<00:05:27.400> the<00:05:27.580> local<00:05:28.060> hardware<00:05:28.390> store<00:05:28.840> and<00:05:29.080> done

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
from the local hardware store and done

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.130 
from the local hardware store and done
but<00:05:30.220> I've<00:05:30.370> done<00:05:30.520> here<00:05:30.760> is<00:05:30.910> I've<00:05:31.180> actually<00:05:31.480> cut

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
but I've done here is I've actually cut

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.300 
but I've done here is I've actually cut
it<00:05:32.260> in<00:05:32.500> 2<00:05:33.430> min<00:05:33.610> emitter<00:05:33.850> strands<00:05:34.420> and<00:05:34.830> then<00:05:35.830> use

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
it in 2 min emitter strands and then use

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.710 
it in 2 min emitter strands and then use
that<00:05:36.340> to<00:05:36.780> first<00:05:38.550> mask<00:05:39.550> the<00:05:39.820> outlines<00:05:40.270> and<00:05:40.540> then

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
that to first mask the outlines and then

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.840 
that to first mask the outlines and then
fill<00:05:41.350> the<00:05:41.500> middle<00:05:41.650> parts<00:05:44.190> and<00:05:45.190> for<00:05:45.460> reason<00:05:45.700> for

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
fill the middle parts and for reason for

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.020 
fill the middle parts and for reason for
that<00:05:45.940> being<00:05:46.210> is<00:05:46.390> that<00:05:46.680> when<00:05:47.680> you<00:05:47.770> have<00:05:47.920> a<00:05:48.280> thin

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
that being is that when you have a thin

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.260 
that being is that when you have a thin
strand<00:05:49.510> it's<00:05:49.900> much<00:05:50.080> more<00:05:50.290> easier<00:05:50.680> for<00:05:51.270> having

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
strand it's much more easier for having

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.550 
strand it's much more easier for having
a<00:05:52.540> contour<00:05:53.230> that<00:05:53.260> is<00:05:53.590> a<00:05:53.830> little<00:05:54.220> bit<00:05:54.340> of<00:05:54.550> a

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
a contour that is a little bit of a

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.310 
a contour that is a little bit of a
curved<00:05:56.560> nature<00:05:56.860> like<00:05:57.400> on<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:58.570> middle<00:05:59.140> bar

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
curved nature like on the middle bar

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.830 
curved nature like on the middle bar
it's<00:05:59.680> a<00:05:59.800> little<00:06:00.010> bit<00:06:00.130> it<00:06:00.580> has<00:06:00.820> a<00:06:00.850> curve<00:06:01.240> on<00:06:01.450> it

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
it's a little bit it has a curve on it

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.310 
it's a little bit it has a curve on it
so<00:06:02.440> you<00:06:03.400> don't<00:06:03.580> end<00:06:03.730> up<00:06:03.910> having<00:06:04.120> wrinkles<00:06:05.110> on

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
so you don't end up having wrinkles on

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.540 
so you don't end up having wrinkles on
it<00:06:05.350> when<00:06:06.010> you<00:06:06.100> have<00:06:06.280> a<00:06:06.310> thin<00:06:06.880> strand<00:06:07.360> of

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
it when you have a thin strand of

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.020 
it when you have a thin strand of
electric<00:06:09.550> tape<00:06:10.620> so<00:06:11.620> that's<00:06:12.280> a<00:06:12.490> really<00:06:12.880> good

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
electric tape so that's a really good

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.880 
electric tape so that's a really good
tip<00:06:13.270> that<00:06:13.660> I've<00:06:13.780> actually<00:06:13.990> learned<00:06:14.500> from<00:06:14.680> my

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
the tension down and just sweep across

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.410 
the tension down and just sweep across
the<00:06:45.930> denture<00:06:46.930> and<00:06:47.370> by<00:06:48.370> night<00:06:48.580> not<00:06:48.940> to<00:06:49.210> make<00:06:49.390> a
