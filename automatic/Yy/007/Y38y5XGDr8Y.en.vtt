00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 please thank you president 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.610
 my agenda always concerns 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.130
 the sale of bankitalia 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.080
 we demand the government's commitment to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.299
 to adopt for matters of competence 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.550
 initiatives so that the participants on 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.260
 share capital of the bank of italy 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.180
 can be distributed 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.670
 only annual dividends a 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.529
 apply to net profits for an amount 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.390
 no more than a percentage of 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.640
 share capital equal to the average rate 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.040
 weighted recognized on the securities of the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.809
 public debt with no longer duration 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.890
 per year issued in the calendar year 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.230
 precedent of the Italian state e 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.270
 let 's talk about money, money and resources 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.070
 they are very important above all 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.320
 precisely when it comes to emergency 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.450
 that's why I want to make a comparison 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.940
 on the words spent by the prefect 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.640
 gabrielli of civil protection a 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.230
 Modena who says here was there 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.870
 I have a flood in management 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.120
 currently 12 the protection fund 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.890
 civilian already exhausted or we take 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.379
 aware that we live a long time 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.810
 complicated or we can not understand the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.670
 gabrielli then dedicated attention 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.290
 continues and says it hurt me that yes 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.450
 be controversial about the president of 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.549
 republic that you remembered 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.310
 of the flood only five days later 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.240
 no we all know that we can 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.590
 forget 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.320
 besides having forgotten the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.049
 earthquake in his year-end speech 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.670
 last year and errani that also said 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.799
 head bowed we are content with 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.420
 crumbs because in short every time 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.229
 you even get a crumb him it 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.140
 calls a great success in the moment in 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.570
 which one country continues on January 26th 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.729
 gabrielli the fund for emergencies is 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.200
 already exhausted then in all of us 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.259
 a legitimate question should be triggered 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.270
 maybe we are a bit unlucky because there 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.890
 there are so many emergencies perhaps also because 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.180
 the country lives under the profile of 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.759
 public finance 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.979
 a moment of particular hardship says 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.079
 I realize that for those at two meters 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.420
 of water in the house the entrepreneur who has 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.770
 had the earthquake and approved with all 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.990
 the strength to start again 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.630
 these arguments are difficult 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.429
 says all those around 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.860
 these people should help us do 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.360
 so that the controversies are the right and 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.980
 that at least the effort is recognized 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.140
 because in these periods i 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.240
 money does not pay attention says gabriele 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.590
 bomporto bastiglia citizens not 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.100
 they will be left alone 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.230
 craftsmen are good for merchants 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.500
 entrepreneurs these speeches are not 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.700
 difficult they are impossible and they are 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.210
 impossible president because they have 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.790
 always paid taxes always have 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:44.320
 worked hard for the state there 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.260
 left alone, they are desperate 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.720
 because they have millions of euros in damages e 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.630
 many will close because they don't know how 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.190
 to start again 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:59.709
 six months of tax suspension six months 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.340
 of tax suspension 19 million 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.570
 EUR 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.360
 you are ridiculous and shameful 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.610
 tell the Italians you're losing 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.400
 7.5 billion of them to give them 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.110
 private shareholders of that bank 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.970
 citizens who on their investments to 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.530
 not the zero point per cent that summer 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.790
 guaranteeing shareholders a return 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.799
 even 6 percent without risk 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.600
 450 million taken from the cash desks of the 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.280
 state 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.660
 450 million which it should cover with 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.060
 new taxes while those same banks 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.660
 they did not start from fault 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.209
 your 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.160
 mortgages on unusable homes after the 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.470
 Government had given a favorable opinion to 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.390
 one of our dg going into this one 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.090
 direction had to suspend mortgages 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.280
 on unusable houses or I ask you 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.230
 it seems fair to pay a mortgage on one 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.340
 house where you can't enter 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.110
 it seems right to you that you are not ashamed 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.980
 realize that by bad faith or 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.810
 stupidity the emilia is on her knees and there 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.269
 money must be put there 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.970
 resources to restart the economy for 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.010
 restart the country 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.950
 and you instead give them away again 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.930
 banks those banks that put the 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.250
 kneeling country and that they have it 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.890
 sunk you are simply vomiting 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.160
 and I want to close with a message well 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.419
 precise president can tell me 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.300
 vademecum of words that do not 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.629
 they can say 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.000
 because of concluding vomiting that 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.800
 they say that you throw up with a 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.330
 very clear message other than that 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.789
 that my fellow gentlemen gave 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.669
 need to give less money to banks and 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:43.180
 more money to flood victims 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.099
 less money for the more solid banks 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.159
 deputy remove his cartel 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:52.569
 thanks i take it takes it committed 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.569
 asks to remove the signs
