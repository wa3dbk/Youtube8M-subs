00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.170 

Julian<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:38.530> really<00:04:39.530> liked<00:04:39.740> his<00:04:39.950> um<00:04:40.400> tiling<00:04:41.150> here

so I think don't we have Chi supposed to

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.129 
so I think don't we have Chi supposed to
be<00:04:57.669> like<00:04:57.850> in<00:04:58.120> a<00:04:58.240> love<00:04:58.600> triangle<00:04:59.050> like<00:04:59.800> Elly<00:05:00.130> and
