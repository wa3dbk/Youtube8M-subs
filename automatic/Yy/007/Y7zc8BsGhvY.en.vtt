00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
about my color process and stuff you can

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.680 
about my color process and stuff you can
see<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:48.230> with<00:01:48.680> this<00:01:48.800> one<00:01:49.510> obviously<00:01:50.510> all<00:01:50.540> the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
see that with this one obviously all the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.260 
see that with this one obviously all the
Endermen<00:01:50.990> were<00:01:51.110> going<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:51.380> be<00:01:51.470> purple<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.270> so

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
Endermen were going to be purple and so

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.810 
Endermen were going to be purple and so
I<00:01:53.300> wanted<00:01:53.480> to<00:01:53.570> keep<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:53.780> background<00:01:54.820> what's

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
I wanted to keep the background what's

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.940 
I wanted to keep the background what's
known<00:01:56.000> as<00:01:56.150> analogous<00:01:56.750> color<00:01:57.080> palette<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:57.740> with

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
known as analogous color palette so with

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.940 
known as analogous color palette so with
the<00:01:58.130> with<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.610> purple<00:01:59.060> there<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.480> then<00:01:59.600> also

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
the with the purple there and then also

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.520 
the with the purple there and then also
with<00:02:01.390> we'd<00:02:02.390> like<00:02:02.510> to<00:02:02.630> dark<00:02:02.840> blues<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.320> stuff

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
with we'd like to dark blues and stuff

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.560 
with we'd like to dark blues and stuff
and<00:02:03.710> then<00:02:03.860> I<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.580> really<00:02:05.030> wanted<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.330> use<00:02:05.450> like<00:02:05.540> a

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
and then I I really wanted to use like a

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.560 
and then I I really wanted to use like a
complementary<00:02:06.230> color<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.650> make<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:07.210> skin<00:02:08.210> the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
complementary color to make the skin the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.770 
complementary color to make the skin the
guy<00:02:09.260> was<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.440> water<00:02:09.650> bucket<00:02:09.800> really<00:02:10.100> pop<00:02:10.369> off<00:02:10.780> so

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
guy was a water bucket really pop off so

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.720 
guy was a water bucket really pop off so
then<00:02:11.990> you<00:02:12.080> know<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.650> draws<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.920> eye<00:02:13.130> makes<00:02:13.580> us

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
then you know it draws the eye makes us

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.450 
then you know it draws the eye makes us
sort<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:14.000> stand<00:02:14.240> out<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:15.010> so<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:16.310> that's

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
sort of stand out and so that so that's

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.280 
sort of stand out and so that so that's
sort<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.240> technique<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.840> talk<00:02:18.080> we're

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
sort of the technique that I talk we're

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.080 
sort of the technique that I talk we're
keeping<00:02:18.590> everything<00:02:18.830> in<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.820> sort<00:02:20.060> of

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
keeping everything in that sort of

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.730 
keeping everything in that sort of
analogous<00:02:20.450> couple<00:02:20.900> zone<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.350> then<00:02:21.470> using

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
analogous couple zone and then using

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.000 
analogous couple zone and then using
that<00:02:21.890> green<00:02:22.310> as<00:02:22.580> like<00:02:23.300> am<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.990> call<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.740> a<00:02:24.800> sort

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
that green as like am I call it a sort

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.920 
that green as like am I call it a sort
of<00:02:25.040> just<00:02:25.280> make<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.460> to<00:02:25.940> make<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.330> really<00:02:26.660> stand

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
of just make it to make it really stand

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.800 
of just make it to make it really stand
out<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:28.760> yeah<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.000> hope<00:02:29.210> you<00:02:29.330> guys<00:02:29.420> like<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:29.660> a

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
out so so yeah I hope you guys like it a

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.780 
out so so yeah I hope you guys like it a
bit<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.230> an<00:02:30.320> eerie<00:02:30.500> one<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:30.980> they'll

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790
