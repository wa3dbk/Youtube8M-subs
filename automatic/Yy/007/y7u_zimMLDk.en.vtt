00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello without sergio insect and I'm not going to 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:11.400
 tell you that is how the tea works 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.889
 of asos and those for digital television 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.570
 open is to say air channels that already 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.920
 they have spoken to us but digital ie 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.260
 that they will have a better compression 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.119
 for image sound and it's open 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.769
 for anyone in the country that has a 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.689
 antenna and a decoder that can 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.699
 translate that signal and turn them into 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.960
 images for dallas on your television the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.519
 tedera works thanks to different 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.140
 antenna that was installed in 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.110
 different provinces and different 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.370
 locations across the country if 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.110
 you do not know if you have an antenna 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.780
 working in your locality or in your 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.309
 sector, wherever you are, I'll leave a 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.200
 link in the description with a map of 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.020
 coverage in turn as a map of 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.640
 antennas where there are antennas better said 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.120
 and what are the antennas that are in 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.539
 construction and where are they working 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.730
 immediately you notice 15 signs of 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.879
 national way is to say for all to 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.710
 all the country and also local channels 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.750
 depending on the region or each place 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.460
 where one is 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.560
 in the description would leave a link with the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.030
 animal guide nationwide as 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.300
 so also the channel guide for each 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.300
 Province 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.420
 as I told you, this system is open 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.070
 says they are like some old channels of 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.600
 air that we knew before when 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.119
 we had cables and we had to plug in 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.070
 the antenna to see air channels 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.110
 which generally it would be very bad good 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.600
 this works exactly the same have 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.670
 coinciding an antenna that can capture 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.870
 I will show these signs with 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.210
 which can be 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.160
 and a decoder some tele that already 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.050
 come with unique built-in indicator 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.530
 you just have to take the antenna and 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.080
 plug it in and you just need that to 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.090
 can see on your TV these 15 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.010
 signs that are nationally in addition 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.770
 channels as I told you if there were 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.020
 this province the tea does not have any 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.940
 say cost is totally free 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.370
 decoder as much as the antenna gets you 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.590
 can be delivered to you if you were 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.270
 beneficiary of a social plan and so on 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.730
 I will also leave you a link the description 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.410
 with all the information or also the 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.880
 you can get in any of the 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.130
 main appliance chains 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.080
 of the country both the decoder and the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.240
 cable has to be a rg6 coax cable 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.500
 important this data also as the 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.040
 antenna that can be induced in any 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.540
 hardware store and even 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.099
 I will also leave a link to the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.530
 description of a video of how it 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.340
 they need to put these things together so that 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.989
 pointer function 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.670
 there are now this divisions that today by 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.890
 today they come with the tea or with the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.720
 embedded encoder you only need 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.510
 connect an antenna that adapts to 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.200
 such purpose and being able to do with a small 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.700
 Scan of channels have available 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.650
 these 15 signs so you can 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.750
 observe 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.750
 among them it is worth noting that we have 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.099
 two channels that stand out because they are 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.760
 two channels that transmit the full hd 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.379
 both in public matters in full hd well 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.599
 also as a sport that is a channel 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.659
 of sports obviously also in full 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.180
 hd the other channels look very good 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.430
 to do an air broadcast if 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.390
 they are compared to what the channels were 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.910
 of cable that we all know nowadays 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.740
 and something more important of all this 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.050
 currently free in these 15 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.459
 air signals that are open to 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.920
 everyone does not have to pay any 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.890
 fertilizer or anything like that to have 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.840
