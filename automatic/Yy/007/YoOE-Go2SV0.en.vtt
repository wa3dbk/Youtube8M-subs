 familiar with his country where 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.330
 considered due to send it to 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:48.130
 olympiad but at the panamerican games

 first round more than 5 points com scored 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.640
 Venezuela did not particularly resist 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.780
 letting your rival 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.190
 shaft after shaft is not even screwed 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.190
 sweated on my tedeev 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.610
 and the trainer's question is tired or not 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.410
 lazily head shook without anything here 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.410

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.180

 does not understand 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.550
 how to deal with tedeeva in venezuela 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.570
 the most he did for you in 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.979
 as dominant as 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.200
 O dominant is that it is necessary to 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.720
 stand and everything is just how to stand here 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.720
 when when tedeev 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:22.380
 so diverse acts 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.440
 so we are still two on the cat 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.800

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:52.960
 I'm not at all, it seemed to me that 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:58.320
 there should have been two tricks but 30 on 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.320
 scoreboard means it counted the arbiter that 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.450
 one of the tricks performed by tag 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.450
 can not be considered 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.269
 such an adventurous attempt 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.269
 pass at the feet of the Venezuelans 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.000
 so are you now one more point and gay 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.000

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:36.990

 especially not zealous and so everything is clear in 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.960
 this fight 10 seconds left 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.630
