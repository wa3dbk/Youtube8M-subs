00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.360
 welcome to another comes up 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.540
 my channel in the background you one 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.430
 gameplay with currently 25 on the map 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.050
 maker and in the game mode multi team 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.270
 order I have the time 25 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.160
 with fast magazine creates the 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.710
 volksbank as well as rest hardliner 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.170
 plunderer and toughness then i had 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.090
 cup still feels and the c4 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.040
 yes I have here without the third work 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.900
 So played without the third perks 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.570
 I really like lotto that way 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.960
 Well , I have a gameplay with that 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.820
 index dance and the fx rice played on 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.909
 Everybody needs very very correct people 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.409
 It is definitely said that way and yes 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.890
 I may today for the first part 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.039
 Welcome to this new series here nuclear 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.420
 with the assault rifle I call that and yes 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.119
 maybe you can do that behind yet 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.109
 spread to the mps and so on 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.530
 then we will see everything 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:37.759
 In any case, yes , today is happy 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.619
 So talk about it again so now 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.789
 So precedes what is now pointing to 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.899
 my channel will come 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.969
 or how I do that with the 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.399
 want to do series because I want now 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.310
 actually on my channel first 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.139
 really just cod that means something 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.560
 is called uncharted for the first time 

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:56.110
 probably not bring more 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.299
 simply for the reason is me 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.890
 no fun anymore people when i am 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.899
 Videos to all seen by uncharted 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.549
 I thought that makes me 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.880
 Playstation plays immediately then starts 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.459
 that will be cool and now so I see 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.899
 uncharted gameplay souvenir under it 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.810
 you can already commentary 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.280
 do not answer anymore because that's uncharted 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.019
 Gameplay then I do that 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.330
 Gameplay mostly gone and just listen to me 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.090
 the things at the respective comment 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.770
 says 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.690
 only the comments of june from 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.400
 uncharted but is also another 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.480
 Thing 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.660
 that is why in any case only black 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.069
 ops what will eventually happen 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.010
 turn something to commented 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.890
 but that will probably come first 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.200
 I will not be like that, of course 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.790
 Something else because a series can 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.170
 Of course not enough when you are 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.810
 really only bring cod first 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.959
 no, there must be something else and we have to 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.910
 now have a team of four from the 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.670
 impact clear found something on everyone 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.670
 play case competitive and yes we 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.810
 we'll pull that off 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.160
 17h competitive tonight 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.799
 start because he's the new season 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.660
 starts and we want so stop me 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.750
 will make a new series road to 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.160
 Master wrestling will not be that hard 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.959
 his boys thought they had that 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.819
 ever done and then we want 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.690
 maybe still top 20 come that 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.250
 then it gets a bit heavier 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.590
 yes that's such a small thing at the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.859
 love cookies has also made it believable 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.730
 I do not know if that's still going on 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.350
 I think in any case a horny 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.109
 cause because there are far too few 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.780
 competitive gaming on youtube resp 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.740
 so in German 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.010
 That's why we just wanted that 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.690
 make a go is definitely a whole 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.660
 cool thing because league actually makes 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.630
 always bock that is always cool 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:50.200
 and yes , we definitely have it 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.160
 then that will be the impact xrs of the 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.500
 impact ex-prince 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.170
 and in the bag and I will that 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.970
 be there then play together 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.150
 I'll play it afterwards 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.680
 I then afterwards from the cinema mode 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.840
 filming but we are the way 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.390
 already comment live 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.470
 so very easy that's not synonymous 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.840
 I can play you 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.420
 now already explained more memorial 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.100
 not a problem 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.109
 and then I will give you each one 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.350
 case the classification games and upload 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.760
 then after that, play the relative 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.230
 So, I'm interesting 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.910
 Just run scalp recorder 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.480
 I'll leave that behind anyway 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.149
 also in the cinema mode must film then 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.139
 is that I believe no problem 

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:37.509
 again something to the gameplay one sees 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.399
 Of course, no good opponents for it 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:42.819
 is it a weapon, what is it? 

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:44.889
 become a 740 quite a lot or 49 becomes 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:46.899
 In any case, the title is here 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.249
 already nuclear I have that before 

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:51.729
 of course cut out because that was 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:52.959
 right there nothing happened you have to 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.519
 I see them here right now 

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:57.360
 optical advantages here too , we too 

00:04:54.519 --> 00:05:02.309
 have been directly the next editions 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.759
 that really hits and blows 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:05.139
 it was probably now 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:09.389
 a bit delayed that I said 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.389
 i do not care about the nuclear here 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.509
 You know sometimes when you go to 

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:15.339
 commented then it is not quite 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:20.199
 No reason is right here with us 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:21.849
 luckily and yes it all works i have 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.099
 I pop right now with cod 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.839
 to start both I'm in 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.759
 moment for the play because of the 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:32.769
 plan and all that packs in any case 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:34.419
 right and i would say if you 

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:35.829
 the video liked then goes the 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.740
 thumbs up, I hope we can do it today 

00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:41.229
 times 150 likes for the gameplay but that 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.529
 is quite a new gameplay find 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.459
 So I think yes 150 lexware 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:49.409
 definitely cool 

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:52.839
 So we can do the chip meyer 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.069
 and I still have the song of 

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:57.179
 beginning to end 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:57.179
 so party 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:13.320
 the therapist 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.320
 ddp 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.840
 more 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:38.969
 for both would have been the game 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.160
 the researcher 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:43.360
 the chance 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.360
 on strike
