visceral fat is metabolically active and
what<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.120> means<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.660> actually

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
what that means is that actually

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.440 
what that means is that actually
secretes<00:01:10.290> hormones<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.160> what<00:01:11.970> what<00:01:12.330> can

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
secretes hormones and what what can

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.030 
secretes hormones and what what can

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
condition it might make that worse so

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
condition it might make that worse so
it's<00:01:29.610> definitely<00:01:30.120> something<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:31.290> take<00:01:31.470> very

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
you're eating too much food so the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.510 
you're eating too much food so the
second<00:03:03.410> part<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.650> losing<00:03:03.950> your<00:03:04.040> visceral<00:03:04.370> fat

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
second part of losing your visceral fat

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.320 
second part of losing your visceral fat
is<00:03:04.790> you've<00:03:04.970> got<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.390> watch<00:03:05.570> your<00:03:05.750> diet<00:03:06.020> and

is you've got to watch your diet and

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.460 
is you've got to watch your diet and
when<00:03:08.330> you're<00:03:08.510> whenever<00:03:08.959> you're<00:03:09.140> exercising

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
when you're whenever you're exercising

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.949 
when you're whenever you're exercising
the<00:03:10.220> key<00:03:10.459> is<00:03:10.790> that<00:03:10.820> you<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:11.480> do<00:03:11.720> enough

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
the key is that you you do enough

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.810 
the key is that you you do enough
exercise<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.800> you<00:03:12.860> eat<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.070> certain<00:03:13.370> amount<00:03:13.640> of

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
exercise and you eat a certain amount of

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.080 
exercise and you eat a certain amount of
calories<00:03:14.090> per<00:03:14.510> day<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:15.320> that<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.830> are<00:03:16.220> on<00:03:17.060> a

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
calories per day so that you are on a

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.850 
calories per day so that you are on a
deficit<00:03:17.780> of<00:03:17.810> about<00:03:17.989> five<00:03:18.380> hundred<00:03:18.590> calories

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
deficit of about five hundred calories

maybe<00:04:53.360> 15<00:04:53.870> minutes<00:04:54.230> of<00:04:54.320> waves<00:04:54.530> and<00:04:55.040> that's

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
maybe 15 minutes of waves and that's

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.370 
maybe 15 minutes of waves and that's
good<00:04:56.270> too<00:04:56.450> because<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:56.810> want<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.050> build<00:04:57.200> those

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
good too because you want to build those

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.140 
good too because you want to build those
muscles<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.920> those<00:04:58.010> muscles<00:04:58.250> can<00:04:58.550> help<00:04:58.760> you

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
muscles and those muscles can help you

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.670 
muscles and those muscles can help you
your<00:04:59.390> metabolism<00:04:59.630> increase<00:05:00.260> a<00:05:00.290> little<00:05:00.500> bit

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
your metabolism increase a little bit

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.440 
your metabolism increase a little bit
and<00:05:01.130> maybe<00:05:01.760> even<00:05:01.880> increase<00:05:02.300> your

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
and maybe even increase your

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.350 
and maybe even increase your
testosterone<00:05:02.570> and<00:05:03.290> so<00:05:03.380> forth<00:05:03.710> and<00:05:03.920> so<00:05:03.980> you<00:05:04.820> do

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
testosterone and so forth and so you do

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.760 
testosterone and so forth and so you do
want<00:05:05.540> to<00:05:05.570> mix<00:05:05.780> in<00:05:05.960> weights<00:05:06.200> but<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:06.590> don't

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
want to mix in weights but you don't

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.130 
want to mix in weights but you don't
want<00:05:07.160> to<00:05:07.430> just<00:05:07.700> do<00:05:07.970> weights<00:05:08.240> only<00:05:08.480> cardio

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
want to just do weights only cardio

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.990 
want to just do weights only cardio
vascular<00:05:09.620> tends<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.490> burn<00:05:10.610> a<00:05:10.640> lot<00:05:10.940> more

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
vascular tends to burn a lot more

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.060 
vascular tends to burn a lot more
calories<00:05:11.210> within<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.020> same<00:05:12.230> time<00:05:12.470> period<00:05:12.890> so

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
calories within the same time period so

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.400 
calories within the same time period so
say<00:05:13.280> you<00:05:13.820> might<00:05:14.000> do<00:05:14.210> 30<00:05:14.780> minutes<00:05:15.140> of<00:05:15.230> cardio

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
say you might do 30 minutes of cardio

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.220 
say you might do 30 minutes of cardio
and<00:05:15.770> burn<00:05:15.980> two<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.580> 300<00:05:16.760> calories<00:05:17.090> whereas<00:05:18.020> 30

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
and burn two to 300 calories whereas 30

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.080 
and burn two to 300 calories whereas 30
minutes<00:05:18.620> of<00:05:18.740> lights<00:05:18.980> may<00:05:19.250> only<00:05:19.400> burn<00:05:19.640> half<00:05:19.940> of

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
minutes of lights may only burn half of

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.900 
minutes of lights may only burn half of
that<00:05:20.270> so<00:05:21.140> cardiovascular<00:05:22.010> exercise<00:05:22.460> tends<00:05:22.790> to

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
that so cardiovascular exercise tends to

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.400 
that so cardiovascular exercise tends to
be<00:05:23.030> much<00:05:23.180> more<00:05:23.390> effective<00:05:23.840> in<00:05:23.930> losing<00:05:24.200> weight

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
be much more effective in losing weight

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.970 
be much more effective in losing weight
one<00:05:25.190> thing<00:05:25.370> that's<00:05:25.550> not<00:05:25.700> going<00:05:25.910> to<00:05:26.000> work<00:05:26.180> is

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
one thing that's not going to work is

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.410 
one thing that's not going to work is
spot<00:05:27.980> reduction<00:05:28.520> which<00:05:28.700> is<00:05:28.880> like<00:05:29.090> so<00:05:29.270> you<00:05:29.300> have

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
spot reduction which is like so you have

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.140 
spot reduction which is like so you have
the<00:05:29.660> big<00:05:29.810> beer<00:05:30.050> belly<00:05:30.290> thing<00:05:30.820> and<00:05:31.820> you<00:05:31.940> begin

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
the big beer belly thing and you begin

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.330 
the big beer belly thing and you begin
to<00:05:32.270> do<00:05:32.390> crunches<00:05:32.690> well<00:05:33.590> you're<00:05:33.920> going<00:05:34.070> to<00:05:34.130> burn

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
to do crunches well you're going to burn

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.850 
to do crunches well you're going to burn
calories<00:05:34.670> and<00:05:35.150> crunches<00:05:35.630> but<00:05:36.170> you're<00:05:36.710> only

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
calories and crunches but you're only

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.470 
calories and crunches but you're only
going<00:05:37.070> to<00:05:37.130> burn<00:05:37.280> so<00:05:37.520> many<00:05:37.610> calories<00:05:37.760> and<00:05:38.360> burn

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
going to burn so many calories and burn

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.000 
going to burn so many calories and burn
so<00:05:38.720> much<00:05:38.840> fat<00:05:39.140> when<00:05:39.320> you<00:05:39.410> do<00:05:39.530> that<00:05:39.710> and<00:05:39.950> you

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
so much fat when you do that and you

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.410 
so much fat when you do that and you
will<00:05:40.160> build<00:05:40.400> up<00:05:40.520> your<00:05:40.640> muscles<00:05:40.700> in<00:05:41.120> your<00:05:41.240> abs

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
will build up your muscles in your abs

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.390 
will build up your muscles in your abs
but<00:05:41.660> your<00:05:41.960> muscles<00:05:42.140> will<00:05:42.470> be<00:05:42.590> outside<00:05:43.130> of<00:05:43.190> that

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
but your muscles will be outside of that

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.580 
but your muscles will be outside of that
visceral<00:05:43.820> fat<00:05:44.090> that<00:05:44.330> visceral<00:05:44.660> fat<00:05:44.930> inside

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
visceral fat that visceral fat inside

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.860 
visceral fat that visceral fat inside
deep<00:05:45.950> in<00:05:46.130> your<00:05:46.220> intestines<00:05:46.820> and<00:05:47.030> just<00:05:47.720> your

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
deep in your intestines and just your

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.500 
deep in your intestines and just your
whole<00:05:48.020> visceral<00:05:48.500> region<00:05:49.150> and<00:05:50.150> that's<00:05:50.390> what

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
whole visceral region and that's what

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.730 
whole visceral region and that's what
you<00:05:50.600> got<00:05:50.720> to<00:05:50.810> get<00:05:50.900> to<00:05:51.080> you<00:05:51.200> got<00:05:51.320> to<00:05:51.350> get<00:05:51.500> to<00:05:51.620> that

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
you got to get to you got to get to that

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.890 
you got to get to you got to get to that
and<00:05:52.040> the<00:05:52.310> only<00:05:52.370> way<00:05:52.610> to<00:05:52.670> do<00:05:52.850> that<00:05:53.030> is<00:05:53.300> eating

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
and the only way to do that is eating

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.630 
and the only way to do that is eating
below<00:05:54.110> your<00:05:54.290> calorie<00:05:54.650> intake<00:05:54.890> and<00:05:55.400> using

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
below your calorie intake and using

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.400 
below your calorie intake and using
exercise<00:05:56.150> to<00:05:56.330> get<00:05:56.450> that<00:05:56.660> calorie<00:05:56.990> number<00:05:57.230> down

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
exercise to get that calorie number down

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.650 
exercise to get that calorie number down
to<00:05:58.010> where<00:05:58.130> you're<00:05:58.280> about<00:05:58.490> 500<00:05:59.090> calories<00:05:59.480> or<00:05:59.630> so

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
to where you're about 500 calories or so

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.840 
to where you're about 500 calories or so
less<00:06:00.110> per<00:06:00.440> day<00:06:00.620> and<00:06:00.890> that's<00:06:01.430> going<00:06:01.640> to<00:06:01.730> help

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
less per day and that's going to help

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.940 
less per day and that's going to help
you<00:06:01.970> burn<00:06:02.150> about<00:06:02.330> one<00:06:02.870> pound<00:06:03.140> per<00:06:03.530> week<00:06:03.560> and

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
you burn about one pound per week and

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.100 
you burn about one pound per week and
once<00:06:04.430> you<00:06:04.550> burn<00:06:04.730> you<00:06:05.060> know<00:06:05.090> 510<00:06:05.690> pounds<00:06:05.870> you

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
once you burn you know 510 pounds you

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.600 
once you burn you know 510 pounds you
want<00:06:06.200> to<00:06:06.290> go<00:06:06.440> back<00:06:06.620> to<00:06:06.800> the<00:06:06.890> calorie<00:06:07.220> counter

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
want to go back to the calorie counter

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.550 
want to go back to the calorie counter
and<00:06:07.820> enter<00:06:08.510> your<00:06:08.660> new<00:06:08.840> weight<00:06:09.050> and<00:06:09.380> it<00:06:09.470> will

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
and enter your new weight and it will

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.740 
and enter your new weight and it will
readjust<00:06:10.310> because<00:06:10.910> each<00:06:11.090> time<00:06:11.330> you<00:06:11.540> lose

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
readjust because each time you lose

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.420 
readjust because each time you lose
weight<00:06:12.020> your<00:06:12.320> body<00:06:12.380> require<00:06:12.920> even<00:06:13.250> less

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
weight your body require even less

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.340 
weight your body require even less
calories<00:06:13.970> to<00:06:14.150> sustain<00:06:14.630> that<00:06:14.660> current<00:06:15.170> weight

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
calories to sustain that current weight

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.480 
calories to sustain that current weight
so<00:06:16.040> you<00:06:16.130> have<00:06:16.280> to<00:06:16.400> adjust<00:06:16.520> it<00:06:16.850> every<00:06:17.030> few<00:06:17.270> weeks

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
so you have to adjust it every few weeks

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.770 
so you have to adjust it every few weeks
so<00:06:19.490> that's<00:06:19.640> the<00:06:19.910> gist<00:06:20.210> of<00:06:20.450> how<00:06:20.570> you're<00:06:20.690> going

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
so that's the gist of how you're going

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.270 
so that's the gist of how you're going
to<00:06:20.870> lose<00:06:21.050> that<00:06:21.080> miss<00:06:21.410> or<00:06:21.560> fad<00:06:21.770> now<00:06:21.950> another

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
to lose that miss or fad now another

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.650 
to lose that miss or fad now another
thing<00:06:22.550> I'll<00:06:22.670> say<00:06:22.700> about<00:06:22.880> visceral<00:06:23.360> fat<00:06:23.480> that's

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
thing I'll say about visceral fat that's

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.990 
thing I'll say about visceral fat that's
really<00:06:23.930> interesting<00:06:24.140> is<00:06:24.620> it<00:06:24.860> a<00:06:25.430> lot<00:06:25.730> is

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
really interesting is it a lot is

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.880 
really interesting is it a lot is
involved<00:06:26.600> with<00:06:26.720> genetics<00:06:27.170> of<00:06:27.380> how<00:06:27.530> your<00:06:27.740> body

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:27.890 
involved with genetics of how your body

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.360 
involved with genetics of how your body
puts<00:06:28.220> on<00:06:28.370> fat<00:06:29.050> I'm<00:06:30.050> a<00:06:30.110> rather<00:06:30.440> skinny<00:06:30.830> guy<00:06:31.040> I'm

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
puts on fat I'm a rather skinny guy I'm

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.120 
puts on fat I'm a rather skinny guy I'm
almost<00:06:31.700> 6<00:06:32.000> 1<00:06:32.270> I<00:06:32.570> weigh<00:06:32.720> about<00:06:32.750> 158<00:06:33.560> pounds<00:06:33.860> or

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
almost 6 1 I weigh about 158 pounds or

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.250 
almost 6 1 I weigh about 158 pounds or
so<00:06:34.340> and<00:06:34.670> whenever<00:06:35.210> I<00:06:35.420> team<00:06:35.810> to<00:06:35.930> gain<00:06:36.050> weight

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
so and whenever I team to gain weight

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.900 
so and whenever I team to gain weight
and<00:06:36.440> the<00:06:36.800> most<00:06:37.070> I've<00:06:37.220> ever<00:06:37.340> weighed<00:06:37.610> is<00:06:37.729> about

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
and the most I've ever weighed is about

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.330 
and the most I've ever weighed is about
170<00:06:38.810> and<00:06:39.169> that<00:06:39.410> may<00:06:39.530> not<00:06:39.680> sound<00:06:39.830> like<00:06:39.919> a<00:06:40.040> lot<00:06:40.100> of

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
170 and that may not sound like a lot of

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.439 
170 and that may not sound like a lot of
weight<00:06:40.490> but<00:06:40.760> I<00:06:40.820> was<00:06:40.940> putting<00:06:41.210> a

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
weight but I was putting a

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.450 
weight but I was putting a
wait<00:06:41.809> right<00:06:42.110> here<00:06:42.139> in<00:06:42.559> my<00:06:42.650> visceral<00:06:43.069> region

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
wait right here in my visceral region

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.059 
wait right here in my visceral region
and<00:06:43.749> so<00:06:44.749> your<00:06:45.259> genetics<00:06:45.710> is<00:06:45.830> going<00:06:46.009> to

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:46.069 
and so your genetics is going to

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:47.409 
and so your genetics is going to
determine<00:06:46.370> a<00:06:46.550> lot<00:06:46.580> where<00:06:46.879> you<00:06:46.969> put<00:06:47.120> on<00:06:47.210> the<00:06:47.300> way

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:47.419 
determine a lot where you put on the way

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:49.179 
determine a lot where you put on the way
because<00:06:47.749> even<00:06:48.020> though<00:06:48.169> I<00:06:48.379> wasn't<00:06:48.710> I<00:06:48.919> wasn't

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:49.189 
because even though I wasn't I wasn't

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:50.499 
because even though I wasn't I wasn't
really<00:06:49.279> gaining<00:06:49.520> much<00:06:49.729> weight<00:06:49.909> my<00:06:50.059> arms<00:06:50.360> and

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:50.509 
really gaining much weight my arms and

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:52.510 
really gaining much weight my arms and
legs<00:06:50.659> or<00:06:50.900> face<00:06:51.080> but<00:06:51.620> I<00:06:51.650> was<00:06:51.800> I<00:06:51.830> was<00:06:52.249> getting<00:06:52.339> a

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
legs or face but I was I was getting a

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.309 
legs or face but I was I was getting a
little<00:06:52.610> bit<00:06:52.789> of<00:06:52.879> a<00:06:52.969> potbelly<00:06:53.210> on<00:06:53.659> me<00:06:53.839> and<00:06:54.020> I<00:06:54.139> had

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 
little bit of a potbelly on me and I had

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:56.409 
little bit of a potbelly on me and I had
to<00:06:54.349> get<00:06:54.979> control<00:06:55.370> my<00:06:55.520> diet<00:06:55.759> and<00:06:56.029> I<00:06:56.089> brought<00:06:56.300> it

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:56.419 
to get control my diet and I brought it

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:58.420 
to get control my diet and I brought it
down<00:06:56.449> and<00:06:56.779> right<00:06:56.900> now<00:06:57.020> I'm<00:06:57.080> about<00:06:57.289> 158<00:06:57.889> I<00:06:58.069> don't

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
down and right now I'm about 158 I don't

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.969 
down and right now I'm about 158 I don't
really<00:06:58.639> have<00:06:58.789> a<00:06:58.819> visceral<00:06:59.089> fat<00:06:59.330> problem<00:06:59.979> at

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
really have a visceral fat problem at

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.420 
really have a visceral fat problem at
all<00:07:01.279> so<00:07:02.289> that's<00:07:03.289> a<00:07:03.379> genetic<00:07:03.770> thing<00:07:03.800> my<00:07:04.159> father

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
all so that's a genetic thing my father

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.149 
all so that's a genetic thing my father
I've<00:07:04.669> noticed<00:07:05.089> even<00:07:05.599> though<00:07:05.900> my<00:07:06.710> mother<00:07:06.919> and

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:07.159 
I've noticed even though my mother and

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:08.439 
I've noticed even though my mother and
my<00:07:07.219> father<00:07:07.370> divorced<00:07:07.729> when<00:07:07.909> I<00:07:07.969> was<00:07:08.089> young<00:07:08.240> and

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:08.449 
my father divorced when I was young and

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:09.700 
my father divorced when I was young and
he<00:07:08.569> moved<00:07:08.749> away<00:07:08.870> but<00:07:09.050> anyway<00:07:09.439> I<00:07:09.469> seen<00:07:09.680> a

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:09.710 
he moved away but anyway I seen a

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.110 
he moved away but anyway I seen a
picture<00:07:09.919> of<00:07:10.039> him<00:07:10.099> when<00:07:10.309> he<00:07:10.339> was<00:07:10.550> older<00:07:10.819> and<00:07:10.849> he

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
picture of him when he was older and he

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.329 
picture of him when he was older and he
had<00:07:11.240> a<00:07:11.270> really<00:07:11.599> just<00:07:12.259> a<00:07:12.379> really<00:07:12.680> large<00:07:12.949> belly

00:07:13.329 --> 00:07:13.339 
had a really just a really large belly

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:15.459 
had a really just a really large belly
and<00:07:13.639> that<00:07:14.180> was<00:07:14.389> just<00:07:14.479> this<00:07:14.810> real<00:07:15.050> fat<00:07:15.259> right

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:15.469 
and that was just this real fat right

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:17.079 
and that was just this real fat right
there<00:07:15.680> and<00:07:15.919> that's<00:07:16.430> what<00:07:16.580> I've<00:07:16.699> got<00:07:16.729> to<00:07:16.969> watch

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:17.089 
there and that's what I've got to watch

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:18.219 
there and that's what I've got to watch
out<00:07:17.240> personally<00:07:17.629> because<00:07:17.870> that's<00:07:17.990> the<00:07:18.080> way<00:07:18.199> I

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:18.229 
out personally because that's the way I

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.659 
out personally because that's the way I
gained<00:07:18.620> weight<00:07:18.800> some<00:07:19.099> people<00:07:19.339> in<00:07:19.430> the<00:07:19.520> gang

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:19.669 
gained weight some people in the gang

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:20.619 
gained weight some people in the gang
way<00:07:19.849> they're<00:07:20.060> getting<00:07:20.300> a<00:07:20.449> lot<00:07:20.599> of

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:20.629 
way they're getting a lot of

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:22.749 
way they're getting a lot of
subcutaneous<00:07:21.409> fat<00:07:21.650> and<00:07:21.979> not<00:07:22.460> so<00:07:22.610> much

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 
subcutaneous fat and not so much

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:24.820 
subcutaneous fat and not so much
visceral<00:07:23.180> fat<00:07:23.330> that's<00:07:23.599> actually<00:07:23.960> safer<00:07:24.469> fat

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830 
visceral fat that's actually safer fat

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.820 
visceral fat that's actually safer fat
so<00:07:25.729> those<00:07:26.689> are<00:07:26.839> just<00:07:26.930> some<00:07:27.110> facts<00:07:27.620> about

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:27.830 
so those are just some facts about

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.070 
so those are just some facts about
visceral<00:07:28.550> fat<00:07:28.759> if<00:07:29.089> you<00:07:29.240> have<00:07:29.449> this<00:07:29.629> real<00:07:29.870> fat

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 
visceral fat if you have this real fat

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.679 
visceral fat if you have this real fat
or<00:07:30.259> a<00:07:30.319> pot<00:07:30.560> belly<00:07:30.740> watch<00:07:31.580> out<00:07:31.819> another<00:07:32.150> thing<00:07:32.419> I

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:32.689 
or a pot belly watch out another thing I

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:34.719 
or a pot belly watch out another thing I
want<00:07:32.899> to<00:07:33.020> warn<00:07:33.589> you<00:07:33.649> about<00:07:33.740> is<00:07:34.189> alcohol

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:34.729 
want to warn you about is alcohol

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:36.820 
want to warn you about is alcohol
alcohol<00:07:35.330> that's<00:07:36.020> why<00:07:36.169> they<00:07:36.319> call<00:07:36.499> it<00:07:36.529> a<00:07:36.620> beer

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:36.830 
alcohol that's why they call it a beer

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.379 
alcohol that's why they call it a beer
belly<00:07:36.979> Rob<00:07:37.310> because<00:07:37.520> it<00:07:37.759> tends<00:07:37.939> to<00:07:38.029> add<00:07:38.180> a<00:07:38.240> lot

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:38.389 
belly Rob because it tends to add a lot

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:41.619 
belly Rob because it tends to add a lot
of<00:07:38.419> calories<00:07:38.629> and<00:07:39.819> so<00:07:40.819> if<00:07:41.089> you're<00:07:41.240> drinking<00:07:41.419> a

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:41.629 
of calories and so if you're drinking a

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:43.209 
of calories and so if you're drinking a
lot<00:07:41.749> of<00:07:41.809> alcohol<00:07:41.960> you<00:07:42.469> probably<00:07:42.889> want<00:07:43.039> to<00:07:43.099> cut

00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:43.219 
lot of alcohol you probably want to cut

00:07:43.219 --> 00:07:44.709 
lot of alcohol you probably want to cut
back<00:07:43.249> on<00:07:43.490> your<00:07:43.550> alcohol<00:07:43.939> intake<00:07:43.969> I<00:07:44.509> don't

00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:44.719 
back on your alcohol intake I don't

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:47.379 
back on your alcohol intake I don't
drink<00:07:44.899> alcohol<00:07:45.259> at<00:07:45.469> all<00:07:45.499> and<00:07:46.029> I<00:07:47.029> don't<00:07:47.089> really

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:47.389 
drink alcohol at all and I don't really

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:49.179

advocate alcohol so I'm not going to

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:50.980 
advocate alcohol so I'm not going to
preach<00:07:49.399> to<00:07:49.639> you<00:07:49.849> but<00:07:50.060> if<00:07:50.360> you<00:07:50.629> drink<00:07:50.779> alcohol

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:50.990 
preach to you but if you drink alcohol

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.899 
preach to you but if you drink alcohol
you<00:07:51.680> want<00:07:51.889> to<00:07:51.949> consider<00:07:52.249> getting<00:07:52.490> rid<00:07:52.669> of<00:07:52.699> that

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:52.909 
you want to consider getting rid of that
