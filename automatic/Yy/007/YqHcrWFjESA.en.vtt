00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.610

than<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.770> evo<00:02:41.160> 4G<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.630> in<00:02:42.780> downloading<00:02:43.350> you

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
than the evo 4G so in downloading you

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.680 
than the evo 4G so in downloading you
may<00:02:43.710> notice<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.280> little<00:02:44.550> bit<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.850> delay<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.420> lag

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
may notice a little bit of delay and lag

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.970 
may notice a little bit of delay and lag
