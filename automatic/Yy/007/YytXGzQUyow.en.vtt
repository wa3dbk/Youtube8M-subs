00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.860
 all these things are what hold 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.110
 start I'm already bored that I 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.660
 send order so today I will do 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.010
 a custom rack to fit 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.769
 all these things and that of sight 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.769
 much more orderly 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.769
 to 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:39.100
 then I'm going to need two tables of 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:42.610
 45 x 27 3 tables of 70 x 27 4 tables of 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.420
 20 and 27 and finally a table of 40 x 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.420
 27 centimeters 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.579
 before I love I will paint the pieces of 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.920
 Various colors 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.190
 webber latex and I'll give you two hands of 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.190
 painting 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.980
 life 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.550
 just to paint the song that looks 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.990
 When the paint is dry, time 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.590
 will begin to be the furniture the first thing that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.899
 I'm going to build is the framework 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.060
 and then I'm putting the pieces 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:37.460
 interiors what I can not forget 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.460
 is that those that are in sight 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.229
 and now you have to burn with tips and with the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.229
 cool 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.720
 of the leaves 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.290
 the position of the shelves will depend 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.730
 of what you want to save for example 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.430
 here I go to good folders 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.100
 and if you notice that a space here I'm going to 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.670
 put another check to save the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.670
 babies 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.900
 to 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.049
 in the space of the web saves my 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.620
 pictures a notebook measures roughly 25 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:30.310
 centimeters so here I'm going to leave 26 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.310
 centimeters of space 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.870
 to be able to place the shelf and give it a 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.939
 little bit more stability I'm going to put 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.709
 a rear piece of 3 millimeters of 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:46.450
 thickness is something very important is to go 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.450
 marking where I work 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.280
 these are digene test hooks but 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.760
 can occupy any type of software 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.810
 it's good now I have the review ready 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.810
 so best of my good
