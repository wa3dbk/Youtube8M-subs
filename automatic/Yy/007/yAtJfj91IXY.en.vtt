00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.410
 well 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.759
 it is important to wash 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.480
 since if we have the guard his life we â€‹â€‹will work more shoulders than if 

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:23.720
 we have the guard down 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.480
 we started with a kid 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.480
 I returned direct good hand soft 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.689
 what is to return with hands behind 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.070
 ascending fist 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.070
 straight to the jaw 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.160
 next we will join legs 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.190
 and we will make a hit with the bonnet of the hand 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.750
 to return again to the guard 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.710
 In this work the intensity is very important 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.110
 the more speed i will dry transports 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.110
 more heat wear we will have 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
 according to the combination of 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.420
 we started with ya 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.850
 it's the direct hit 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.390
 low 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.390
 sculpt with the back 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.950
 ascending elbow blow 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.080
 elbow the lateral 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.590
 and we go back to the guard 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.290
 it's important again 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.299
 The intensity 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.109
 an important note to keep in mind 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.549
 is that when making fist punches 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.829
 we completely throw the elbow joint as it can 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.219
 harm 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.219
 we achieved a little bit the costs made 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.799
 this is it 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:33.699
 incidents 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.099
 hard 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.529
 hard 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:39.259
 hard
