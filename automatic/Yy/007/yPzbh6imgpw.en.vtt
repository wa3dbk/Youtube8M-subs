00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.320
 games like london paper would never enter the list of 100 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.300

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.479
 this game of fighting show and that has been placed among the most downloaded 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:47.290
 Tuesday I honestly do not know why but you have to have a 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.820
 with this requirement that get to draw the attention of Argentine players 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.750
 also Argentine worrisome data 2 in kingdoms fight to get to the 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.550
 opposing castle the objective of the game which is to entertain enemy forces 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.580
 and move forward making use of the soldiers that we are producing is to say that 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.170
 we have to create soldiers in those areas where we are least 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.170
 advantaged to prevent further progress 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.850
 The more points we have or the more types of soldiers we will have, as each one 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.320
 has its own scale of damage and resistance grobas the purchase books 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.659
 and if it really is like to be one of the games before you get more downloaded 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.439
 p 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:48.009
 2 little surprise I've taken today to know possible applications is a 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.580
 pottery simulator as well as listening lists 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.170
 two 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.910
 two 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.390
 they are not willing to start 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.530
 there are also computer practices and we can use an environment of 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.069
 ceramics and design our own vase to the purest 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.719
 God's style we start with 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:15.649
 a smooth clay tube and from there everything depends on creativity or 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:20.680
 the ability of everyone to create vases and pretty girls the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.680
 Argentina is facing environmental processing 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.430
 to shape the clay we have to press with your finger on an area and 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.449
 I decided to bring it in the right direction for the result that 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:37.979
 we wanted for example if we want to increase the height we press and say 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:39.739

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:46.379
 out gently 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.859
 the best thing is that when we finish shaping our basic cup we can 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:52.670
 simulate the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.260
 cooking process to see the final result in 3d curious

 two 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.909
 2 but for useful applications and brandon roy this network grant 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.209
 maybe more than one have thought about the idea but until the arrival of this 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.760
