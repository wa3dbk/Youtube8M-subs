00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
let's pull out the head joint and see

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.170 
let's pull out the head joint and see
what<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> head

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
what you can do with that so the head

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.959 
what you can do with that so the head
joint<00:01:57.479> has<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:58.049> lip<00:01:58.680> plate<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.520> part<00:01:59.850> right

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
joint has a lip plate this part right

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.700 
joint has a lip plate this part right
here<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.259> embouchure<00:02:01.560> hole

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
here and this is the embouchure hole

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.620 
here and this is the embouchure hole
that<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.159> blow<00:02:02.399> across<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.299> you've<00:02:03.479> got<00:02:03.600> a

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
that you blow across and you've got a

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.539 
that you blow across and you've got a
cap<00:02:03.930> which<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.380> closed<00:02:04.710> part<00:02:05.070> right<00:02:05.310> there

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
cap which is a closed part right there

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.490 
cap which is a closed part right there
then<00:02:06.000> you've<00:02:06.119> got<00:02:06.299> an<00:02:06.390> open<00:02:06.780> part<00:02:07.020> down<00:02:07.200> here

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
then you've got an open part down here

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.080 
then you've got an open part down here
so<00:02:07.649> take<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.009> open<00:02:08.340> part<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.700> put<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.000> your

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
so take the open part and put it in your

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.070

right hand

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.230 
right hand
and<00:02:10.170> then<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> cap<00:02:11.100> should<00:02:11.640> go<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.940> your<00:02:12.060> left

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240

and then the cap should go in your left
hand<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.130> automatically<00:02:14.130> forces<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090
