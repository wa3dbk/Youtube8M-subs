hello and welcome to Mirror Lake this is

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.029 
hello and welcome to Mirror Lake this is
my<00:00:25.199> jxd<00:00:25.800> little<00:00:26.220> jxd<00:00:26.970> 392<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.869> really<00:00:28.679> like<00:00:28.830> this

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.939 
my jxd little jxd 392 I really like this
little<00:00:29.279> quadcopter<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.720> think<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.740> a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
little quadcopter it's I think it's a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.860 
little quadcopter it's I think it's a
really<00:00:32.400> good<00:00:32.580> buy<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.060> what<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.570> get<00:00:33.690> for

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
really good buy for what you get for

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.980 
really good buy for what you get for
around<00:00:34.260> $40<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.850> get<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.060> quadcopter<00:00:36.360> that's

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
around $40 you get a quadcopter that's

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.940 
around $40 you get a quadcopter that's
very<00:00:37.200> responsive<00:00:37.920> very<00:00:38.430> tough<00:00:39.350> very<00:00:40.350> agile

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
very responsive very tough very agile

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.530 
very responsive very tough very agile
and<00:00:41.390> it<00:00:42.390> comes<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.020> bonus<00:00:43.470> with<00:00:43.830> a<00:00:43.860> camera

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
and it comes as a bonus with a camera

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.340 
and it comes as a bonus with a camera
really<00:00:45.540> there's<00:00:45.720> only<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:45.930> thing<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.290> don't

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
really there's only one thing I don't

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.500 
really there's only one thing I don't
like<00:00:46.620> about<00:00:46.740> this<00:00:47.220> quadcopter<00:00:47.490> and<00:00:48.120> that's

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
like about this quadcopter and that's

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600 
like about this quadcopter and that's
the<00:00:48.720> angle<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.380> camera<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:50.160> pointed

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the angle of the camera it's pointed

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.630 
the angle of the camera it's pointed
slightly<00:00:50.790> downwards<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.780> when<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.140> fly

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
slightly downwards so that when you fly

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.370 
slightly downwards so that when you fly
forward<00:00:53.640> all<00:00:53.880> you're<00:00:54.150> seeing<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.660> lot<00:00:54.810> of<00:00:54.870> is

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
forward all you're seeing a lot of is

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.330 
forward all you're seeing a lot of is
just<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.130> ground<00:00:56.630> but<00:00:57.630> there<00:00:58.380> is<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.560> way<00:00:58.890> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
just of the ground but there is a way to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.300 
just of the ground but there is a way to
level<00:00:59.580> off<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.120> video<00:01:00.950> let<00:01:01.950> me<00:01:02.070> get<00:01:02.220> it

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
level off that video let me get it

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.270 
level off that video let me get it
flying<00:01:02.580> and<00:01:02.820> I'll<00:01:02.880> demonstrate<00:01:03.450> that<00:01:07.280> okay

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
flying and I'll demonstrate that okay

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.530 
flying and I'll demonstrate that okay
turning<00:01:08.579> on<00:01:08.789> the<00:01:08.969> camera<00:01:09.149> right<00:01:09.479> now

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.330 

if<00:01:11.960> you<00:01:12.110> notice<00:01:12.410> right<00:01:12.560> now<00:01:12.620> all<00:01:13.130> you're

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
if you notice right now all you're

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.100 
if you notice right now all you're
seeing<00:01:13.520> in<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.790> camera<00:01:14.210> is<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.510> ground<00:01:14.780> and

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
seeing in the camera is the ground and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.490 
seeing in the camera is the ground and
me<00:01:15.520> flying<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.700> quadcopter<00:01:17.080> but<00:01:18.080> there<00:01:18.260> is<00:01:18.470> a

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
me flying the quadcopter but there is a

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.690 
me flying the quadcopter but there is a
way<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:19.280> level<00:01:19.790> this<00:01:20.110> camera<00:01:21.110> off<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:21.620> that<00:01:22.520> is

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
way to level this camera off and that is

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.760 
way to level this camera off and that is
simply<00:01:23.150> without<00:01:23.570> any<00:01:23.780> modifications<00:01:24.500> to<00:01:24.590> the

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
simply without any modifications to the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:32.190 
simply without any modifications to the
quadcopter<00:01:24.980> simply<00:01:25.730> to<00:01:26.150> fly<00:01:26.420> backwards

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.350 

now<00:01:32.740> flying<00:01:32.979> backwards<00:01:33.520> isn't<00:01:33.670> as<00:01:33.939> hard<00:01:34.150> as<00:01:34.270> it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
now flying backwards isn't as hard as it

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.560 
now flying backwards isn't as hard as it
sounds<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.979> controls<00:01:36.400> work<00:01:36.970> exactly<00:01:37.360> the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
sounds the controls work exactly the

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.719 
sounds the controls work exactly the
same<00:01:37.689> way<00:01:38.140> as<00:01:38.710> if<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.009> were<00:01:39.130> flying<00:01:39.369> forward

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
same way as if you were flying forward

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.580 
same way as if you were flying forward
if<00:01:39.939> you<00:01:40.060> want<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.270> turn<00:01:40.450> right<00:01:40.720> you<00:01:41.229> turn<00:01:41.439> the

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
if you want to turn right you turn the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.820 
if you want to turn right you turn the
rudder<00:01:41.740> right<00:01:42.009> if<00:01:42.759> you<00:01:43.000> want<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.240> turn<00:01:43.420> left

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
rudder right if you want to turn left

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.730 
rudder right if you want to turn left
you<00:01:44.830> turn<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.220> rudder<00:01:45.369> left<00:01:46.409> everything<00:01:47.409> else

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
you turn the rudder left everything else

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.969 
you turn the rudder left everything else
stays<00:01:47.979> exactly<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.580> same<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.920> only

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
stays exactly the same the only

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.039 
stays exactly the same the only
difference<00:01:51.159> is<00:01:51.670> instead<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.330> getting<00:01:52.509> giving

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
difference is instead of getting giving

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.350 
difference is instead of getting giving
forward<00:01:53.470> pitch<00:01:53.680> for<00:01:54.220> flight<00:01:54.460> you're<00:01:55.119> giving

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
forward pitch for flight you're giving

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.810 
forward pitch for flight you're giving
reverse<00:01:55.630> Pitts

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.810 

backward<00:02:00.690> pitch

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.940 

now<00:02:06.360> obviously<00:02:06.900> this<00:02:07.050> isn't<00:02:07.260> for<00:02:07.530> beginners

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
now obviously this isn't for beginners

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.900 
now obviously this isn't for beginners
to<00:02:08.130> try<00:02:08.570> I'm<00:02:09.570> going<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.810> have<00:02:09.930> to<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.170> some

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
to try I'm going to have to have some

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.020 
to try I'm going to have to have some
knowledge<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.240> being<00:02:12.630> able<00:02:12.990> to<00:02:13.170> fly<00:02:13.850> based<00:02:14.850> on

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
knowledge of being able to fly based on

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.570 
knowledge of being able to fly based on
movement<00:02:15.300> alone<00:02:16.010> maintaining<00:02:17.010> orientation

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
movement alone maintaining orientation

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.820 
movement alone maintaining orientation
on<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.730> quadcopter<00:02:18.080> just<00:02:19.080> by<00:02:19.230> its<00:02:19.410> movement

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
on the quadcopter just by its movement

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.250 
on the quadcopter just by its movement
alone<00:02:20.360> as<00:02:21.360> seen<00:02:21.630> in<00:02:21.750> one<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.930> my<00:02:22.020> other<00:02:22.170> videos

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
alone as seen in one of my other videos

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.050 
alone as seen in one of my other videos
I<00:02:22.740> don't<00:02:22.800> know<00:02:22.980> if<00:02:23.040> everybody's<00:02:23.820> seen<00:02:24.030> that

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
I don't know if everybody's seen that

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.200 
I don't know if everybody's seen that
yet<00:02:24.480> but<00:02:25.130> if<00:02:26.130> you're<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.730> see<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.000> quadcopter

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
yet but if you're you see the quadcopter

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.390 
yet but if you're you see the quadcopter
off<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.020> distance<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.560> it's<00:02:28.710> turning<00:02:29.070> left

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
off in a distance and it's turning left

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.700 
off in a distance and it's turning left
in<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.730> distance<00:02:30.120> just<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.900> turn<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.530> bring

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
in the distance just to turn it to bring

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.230 
in the distance just to turn it to bring
it<00:02:31.800> back<00:02:31.920> toward<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.460> all<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.700> got<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.970> do<00:02:33.090> is

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
it back toward you all you got to do is

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.700 
it back toward you all you got to do is
turn<00:02:33.600> left<00:02:33.930> turn<00:02:34.290> in<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.500> same<00:02:34.650> direction

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
turn left turn in the same direction

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.740 
turn left turn in the same direction
that<00:02:35.220> you're<00:02:35.400> moving<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.880> distance<00:02:36.240> if

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
that you're moving in the distance if
