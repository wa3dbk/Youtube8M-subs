00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.840
 good is a surgery that consists of 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.070
 resect half of the liver more than 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.000
 america minority resect 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.610
 called enlarged right hepatectomy is 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.820
 the term 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.820
 medical hepatectomy right 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.960
 like the lady is a lady of 58 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.450
 young years with colorectal metastases is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.840
 with a malignant tumor that are metastases 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.910
 that compromise the right side of the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.420
 liver 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.790
 the main cause of commitment of 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.620
 watering the main malignant cause of 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.950
 liver are the metastases that comes from 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.950
 colon 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.770
 obviously the lady had four 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.520
 big lessons so we could 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.980
 make her take out the half bundled right 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.590
 and that favors the lady very much 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.420
 because keep in mind that if one does not 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.620
 the opera has no longer a survival of 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.590
 one year 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.200
 if not the opera dies within a year 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.600
 and here operates with chemotherapy 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.149
 postoperative which is a survival of the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.460
 30 to 40 percent so much more broad 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.810
 at 5 years 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.450
 we are talking about 30 percent of 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.640
 patients who are operated on 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.530
 prescribed the entire tumor lesion and 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.420
 exhibition pyme therapy then 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.219
 obviously a big difference in the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.000
 first time this surgery is done in 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:36.009
 rock in the can rionegro the first 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.130
 time and one of the first neuquén not 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.009
 I'm aware of both the neuquén 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.770
 the amount of patek tommy as but not 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.530
 there is no specialized surgeon 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.329
 except two or one is not easy is not 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.799
 easy logistics because really to 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.270
 operate the liver we need many 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.939
 devices made one of the devices 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.350
 that we brought brought from buenos aires 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.880
 then you have to first 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.070
 you have to think that you have to 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.900
 cut the liver and day two an organ 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.020
 It has a lot of blood 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.520
 heavy bleeding obviously to avoid 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.470
 blood we need different types of 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.600
 appliances one of the appliances is what 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.050
 is called 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.300
 argon plasma tell me if there will be or not the 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.160
 argon plan that is accumulating that only 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.930
 we have back Buenos Aires that in the 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.860
 zone in all that patagonia still 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.540
 is not the plasma something is not called like that in 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.040
 the patagonia everything no longer exists and we are 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.330
 achieving after to have it because 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.700
 obviously this type of surgery are 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.739
 leaving much more frequent now 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.420
 this is the second one every surgery is 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.550
 big said the third surgery program 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.250
 great let's say but is I think the most 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.650
 big of all 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.870
 and we need another type of material that 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.600
 we have it here that really the 23 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.490
 It was very well very well equipped for 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.520
 this except that team that we're going 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.410
 to have but we are really fine 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.850
 the artistic part today missing little things 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.580
 as everyone knows it is 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.130
 personnel training instrumentation 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.560
 Etc. anesthesia age therapy 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.420
 intensive but a 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.950
 very good team in what surgery I say 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.390
 of pancreas for people is very intense 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.610
 and there are many pathologies there are many 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.650
 many patients who can not go to 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.060
 buenos aires then people who do not want 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.480
 nor have a possible to solve it here 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.660
 it's very good how stable is the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.060
 Patient's idea is stuart what 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.610
 means take out the respirator in still 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.870
 she is asleep but she is already quite 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.790
 try reacting in fact I already had 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.350
 communicating with her that she is 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.600
 raising and I did not have any unforeseen 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.700
 for now we are talking about 24 hours 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.560
 of surgery obviously do not know the 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.810
 first 72 hours are the most important 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.370
 still planned can always see but by 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.260
 now comes a very good evolution is 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.000
 a patient that we operate very healthy then 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.830
 that is very good 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.260
 everything your laboratory is well 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.930
 everything the population is well that 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.340
 it's very important so good now 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.560
 waiting for the patient to evolve 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.560
 slowly I think it's going to be very good
