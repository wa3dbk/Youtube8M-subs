00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.550
 hello everyone with you ivan tos and i have to 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.189
 make news for you i'm moving 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.849
 look at all these boxes look 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.020
 on this whole room are big and you never 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.849
 will not see 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.570
 but I still have one 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.969
 unfinished business namely number 29 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.399
 marvel aj et collection at first i'm very 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.040
 I was very surprised why the book is called 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.770
 demon in a bottle 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.570
 Well, I don’t think right away 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.450
 you can see that the comic itself came out earlier 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.210
 90's it means no references to the mode 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.390
 Well, there should not be but everything is very 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.120
 just what's the joke you ask you all 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.770
 understand to start the plot wants 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.190
 demonstrate the villain by name 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.410
 justin hummer he wants to destroy stark 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.670
 industries and assign yourself an iron 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.009
 man well then no one seems to be 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.960
 did not know that tony stark is iron 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.930
 man and no matter how it was 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.090
 trite but still good triumphs over evil 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.750
 but Justin Hamer in my opinion here 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.479
 complete bullshit because normal 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.170
 villain and very strong for tony stark 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.450
 In my opinion this alcohol is for sure you 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.390
 already understand why the plot is called 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.200
 demon bottles our great tony stark 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.200
 very much starts to drink and each 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.560
 day even find some stupid about 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.270
 this is exactly the last issue dedicated 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.180
 alcohol math his friends 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.970
 dissuade god stop beating well what are you 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.460
 per person well help us at least 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.500
 if you don't know what to do from him 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.009
 even the butler himself jar will not give 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.830
 Well, it’s still at the end of the number itself 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.549
 and he is somehow persuaded to quit 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.740
 alcohol and 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.900
 yes maybe i already slept through rifle 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.780
 ending but i'm not really all 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.929
 told so best to you yourself 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.430
 I can only buy 29 guest rooms 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.959
 present nemo darling 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.549
 residents no one else there and there is no particular 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:23.069
 screenwriter is david thinking for 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:26.290
 play there by artists karmaine infantino 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.959
 correct uttered and john ramir then 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.769
 younger so stop wait this very 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:36.459
 amazing let me see 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:39.939
 so so so so so oddly enough 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:43.840
 but not a single resource from ronert younger i 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:47.349
 I did not find your new errors sooner 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.840
 maybe maybe the only ones 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.790
 than I was upset is the fact that in 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.400
 additional materials are present 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.169
 only the story of the iron man 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.709
 that is, how it was created 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.340
 and the commentary writer well and then already 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.069
 advertising 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.250
 means not only mistakes but also name 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.400
 publishers and what can I say about 29 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.409
 number mark patch collection 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.260
 maybe not everyone will like the plot because 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:18.069
 that he is as trite as the other scenes 20 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.979
 century but still the demon in the bottle is 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.799
 another conversation this number itself wants 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:26.790
 say that you do not decide anything with alcohol 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.470
 it's like a symbiote on a spiderman 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.930
 I think that's what's wrong with that 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.319
 I dressed in black outfit just changed 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.260
 image but in fact everything is much worse 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.659
 the same thing is done in the bottle well 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.019
 think well, gave a sip or what 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:45.009
 Togo 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:49.120
 and then went into hard drinking so best of all 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:52.329
 never start drinking unless 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.759
 Champagne can and Vincent but still 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.040
 not worth it anyway in spite of 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:58.620
 I recommend my banality to everyone 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.690
 buy 29 number 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.629
 well, in the next issue we will have 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.519
 continuation of the planet hulk and before 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.819
 how to finish the video 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:11.069
 a little bit of announcements probably nearest 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.860
 two weeks that's for sure I can hardly 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.510
 engage in video filming well, that is, 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.169
 other comic type 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.600
 ultimate saga clones death to stacy family 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.310
 and so on and so forth because 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.310
 like i said he 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.620
 to move we are going to the nearest 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.430
 week I will live with my own 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.820
 relatives 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.190
 the same goes for game reviews on my 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.470
 own channel do not think that I 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.229
 scored on and the games are just no 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.620
 special time and a little bit finally 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.190
 lobster gallon cycle drink publishers 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.880
 exmo 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.039
 why did you do a general publishing house 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.669
 reported on the open sale 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:56.850
 books will come well really only for now 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:59.190
 which is not accurate information but if it is 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:04.889
 prove to be true then I simply 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:06.810
 I'll take and put out the block it's a bluff but 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.450
 somehow you don't really want everything in the maze 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.900
 so order it believe me then 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.979
 I think I’ve all said 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.389
 subscribe to the channel you want more 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:22.310
