00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 or add it I am sexy and I am rafita and 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.879
 welcome to a video about dragon ball 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.280
 it's a tribute to you already know that this is a 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.110
 game that will come out for nintendo 3ds what 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.120
 you are watching is part of a trailer 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.950
 that has come out I can not put the trailer 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.420
 full since Nintendo already know 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.070
 how is nintendo with these things and see 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.449
 if I saw her to bundle anyway of the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.609
 description you will have a link to the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.070
 trailer that is in Japanese because this one does not 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.570
 will leave on June 11 in Japan still 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.970
 it does not know if it will reach the territory of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.099
 America or Europe, please come 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.050
 which I find very interesting to see no 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.610
 it's no joke no better comes to the level 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.680
 of the psp games but for my point 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.719
 of view I find it very interesting and 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.760
 striking because yes it does like a 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.410
 little the effect of the old games 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.760
 of gago a returns super nintendo to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.530
 less for my point of view but already 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.360
 have been improved there is a detail 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.030
 quite curious and is that with the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.410
 definitive will have super saiyans some 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.270
 final goal that can reform in 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.489
 super saiyan curious the less the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.469
 you have not seen much this was seen in 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.760
 the beers movie but I do not think 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.320
 I just had to have put in but there are yes 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.300
 they want to put it on twitter there will be 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.149
 transformation into in game this is very 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.040
 well and a positive point compute to super 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.689
 saiyan and fell that if I'm not wrong juan 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.960
 for example the little one would have his 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.000
 dam 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.440
 of level 2 had a only appears in 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.030
 his prey already so he had to have 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.010
 transformations but the characters 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.450
 let's say base then they will have their 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.280
 transformation and you can transform 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.050
 in the middle of the gameplay that's very good 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.700
 goku super headquarters level has so 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.430
 you see in the video only will appear 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.930
 as last you will use let's say the last 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.369
 and I 'm with super saiyans and that's a 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.229
 little his presidency transformed the super 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.300
 they are before and now the last and this already 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.220
 happened in the super sonic warri warriors 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.690
 who went out to play up say warrior 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.909
 what sandro for came out for nintendo ds 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.470
 where he had the final with super goku 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.539
 Saiyan was like his own freedom 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.100
 being a super face of mine here I suppose 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.050
 what exactly else will happen 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.179
 very curious detail is that it will appear 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.310
 bard with super saiyan this seems to me 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.020
 pretty curious will be base and you what 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.420
 you can transform into super saiyan be 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.330
 living in the image there will be more than 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.830
 20 characters there will be 24 but well let's go 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.580
 to analyze the 20 characters that are 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.729
 I was super saiyan small second the 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.780
 final plan bills vegeta piccolo 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:10.860
 gotÃ©s napa ying jeou bard freezer guard 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.569
 of young broli 618 ra dickey 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.390
 cri link and goku super saiyan level 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.610
 god for now there are 20 characters but in 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.470
 there are really 24 and if we go to your page 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.010
 web where we are having the characters 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.060
 that are coming out 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.540
 there are 24 holes or there are 4 more characters 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.610
 that have not yet come to say I 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.980
 I think your four characters will be 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.870
 chilet to fight let's say against bard 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.239
 and the other three characters will be the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.130
 new guru the new vegetable and the new 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.870
 freezer transformation the truth is 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.300
 that would be a campus they are not much 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.570
 character but he's pretty interested in 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.040
 the truth is they are not much nor neither 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.660
 good time that I put if that I 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.610
 I would have put having character 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.860
 it would have been quite good another detail 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.510
 what it has is that there will be many mushrooms 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.769
 and that will be characters that will appear 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.810
 to help you in the middle of the screen 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.370
 this people who are already done what 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.600
 they should have put the 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.819
 I really would have liked a lot 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.830
 this game had good character and 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.959
 final will also include the vote of 2 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.160
 if I'm not wrong for certain copies of 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.380
 Japan 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.020
 a detail that did not quite giving me a lot 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.310
 is that it is not attended to covers much the 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.900
 screen or occupy too much the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.100
 screen and you do not get your vision 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.140
 of what he is doing in the middle of 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.640
 gameplay removes our little things I think 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.020
 that will be a good game and the truth is 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.630
 what is it but please leave in 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.130
 europe I think we will get at least 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.840
 until Europe comes out good and in 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.810
 america man that less will not leave until 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.120
 that the new movie premieres 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.620
 in Latin America and in Spain is that a 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.050
 monkey in spain in europe until that 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.970
 moment I think it will not come out let's say 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.530
 this game for these places 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.670
 I hope this video let's say and if it has 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.720
 liked town in putting me the 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.850
 comments if it has caught your attention 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.830
 this game because for my point of view 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.450
 it's quite interesting it 's very 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.130
 striking this big game those who 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.300
