00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.769 
downswing twitch there are three reasons
why<00:00:16.640> I<00:00:16.670> have<00:00:16.699> really<00:00:17.300> favored<00:00:17.539> this

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
why I have really favored this

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.380 
why I have really favored this
presentation<00:00:18.320> one<00:00:19.070> is<00:00:19.340> that<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:19.820> fish<00:00:20.150> see

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
presentation one is that the fish see

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.779 
presentation one is that the fish see
the<00:00:20.449> fly<00:00:20.720> first<00:00:21.109> rather<00:00:21.410> than<00:00:21.560> tip<00:00:22.009> it<00:00:22.160> so<00:00:22.310> that

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
the fly first rather than tip it so that

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.179 
the fly first rather than tip it so that
cue<00:00:23.150> feet<00:00:23.330> conceals<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:24.109> fact<00:00:24.320> that<00:00:24.470> it's<00:00:24.980> a

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
cue feet conceals the fact that it's a

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.429 
cue feet conceals the fact that it's a
fishing<00:00:25.880> an<00:00:26.029> artificial<00:00:26.509> fly<00:00:26.689> weather<00:00:26.990> and

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
fishing an artificial fly weather and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.800 
fishing an artificial fly weather and
natural<00:00:27.619> fly<00:00:28.039> the<00:00:28.730> other<00:00:28.759> is<00:00:29.119> that<00:00:29.330> working

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
natural fly the other is that working

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.720 
natural fly the other is that working
against<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.289> current<00:00:30.619> makes<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.369> hackle

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
against the current makes the hackle

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.370 
against the current makes the hackle
pulsate<00:00:32.180> a<00:00:32.210> lot<00:00:32.390> more<00:00:32.599> of<00:00:32.810> making<00:00:33.170> it<00:00:33.290> look

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
pulsate a lot more of making it look

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.440 
pulsate a lot more of making it look
like<00:00:33.440> a<00:00:33.590> real<00:00:33.980> swimming<00:00:34.370> inside<00:00:34.730> another<00:00:35.330> one

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
like a real swimming inside another one

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.110 
like a real swimming inside another one
is<00:00:35.720> that<00:00:36.160> most<00:00:37.160> people<00:00:37.310> don't<00:00:37.490> fish<00:00:37.820> that<00:00:38.030> way

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
is that most people don't fish that way

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.670 
is that most people don't fish that way
so<00:00:38.180> I<00:00:38.360> just<00:00:38.390> think<00:00:38.870> it<00:00:39.050> gives<00:00:39.170> you<00:00:39.410> an

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
so I just think it gives you an

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.370 
so I just think it gives you an
advantage<00:00:40.160> on<00:00:40.640> heavily<00:00:41.600> fished<00:00:41.810> waters<00:00:42.230> and

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
advantage on heavily fished waters and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.900 
advantage on heavily fished waters and
most<00:00:42.500> people<00:00:42.740> just<00:00:42.830> get<00:00:43.100> dressed<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:43.670> they

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
most people just get dressed and they

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.820 
most people just get dressed and they
don't<00:00:44.060> move<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.360> fly<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:44.930> that<00:00:45.380> can<00:00:45.530> be<00:00:45.560> real

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
don't move the fly so that can be real

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.689 
don't move the fly so that can be real
advantage<00:00:46.340> on<00:00:46.760> pressured<00:00:47.150> waters

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.150 

okay<00:00:50.420> let's<00:00:50.629> take<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:50.899> look<00:00:51.199> at<00:00:51.320> a<00:00:51.350> side<00:00:51.800> view<00:00:51.829> of

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
okay let's take a look at a side view of

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.590 
okay let's take a look at a side view of
that<00:00:52.250> you<00:00:52.429> can<00:00:52.609> see<00:00:52.789> I'm<00:00:52.879> just<00:00:53.089> very<00:00:53.449> very

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
that you can see I'm just very very

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.619 
that you can see I'm just very very
gently<00:00:54.260> pulsing<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.550> rod<00:00:55.760> which<00:00:56.210> is<00:00:56.359> making

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
gently pulsing the rod which is making

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.119 
gently pulsing the rod which is making
that<00:00:56.750> fly<00:00:57.019> swim<00:00:57.440> in<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.620> water<00:00:57.829> and<00:00:58.039> the

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
that fly swim in the water and the

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.819 
that fly swim in the water and the
hackle<00:00:58.460> open<00:00:58.729> and<00:00:58.879> close<00:00:59.109> now<00:01:00.109> I'll<00:01:00.350> very<00:01:00.620> this

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
hackle open and close now I'll very this

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.829 
hackle open and close now I'll very this
retrieve<00:01:01.280> depending<00:01:01.820> on<00:01:01.969> how<00:01:02.179> fast<00:01:02.420> or<00:01:02.690> slow

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
retrieve depending on how fast or slow

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.810 
retrieve depending on how fast or slow
the<00:01:02.870> water<00:01:03.199> is<00:01:03.469> so<00:01:04.009> sometimes<00:01:04.519> they'll<00:01:04.670> do<00:01:04.790> a

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
the water is so sometimes they'll do a

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.999 
the water is so sometimes they'll do a
little<00:01:05.210> bit<00:01:05.390> faster<00:01:05.869> sometimes<00:01:06.380> I'll<00:01:06.830> do<00:01:06.979> a

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
little bit faster sometimes I'll do a

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:08.800 
little bit faster sometimes I'll do a
little<00:01:07.130> bit<00:01:07.340> slower<00:01:07.610> until<00:01:08.090> I<00:01:08.299> find<00:01:08.539> out<00:01:08.659> what

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
little bit slower until I find out what

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.489 
little bit slower until I find out what
works

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:12.499 

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:14.929 

now<00:01:13.499> this<00:01:13.859> is<00:01:13.979> actually<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.399> different<00:01:14.759> pool

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
now this is actually a different pool

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.399 
now this is actually a different pool
but<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.630> wanted<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.960> give<00:01:16.109> you<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> little

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
but I just wanted to give you a little

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.050 
but I just wanted to give you a little
bit<00:01:16.590> more<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.829> a<00:01:16.890> close-up<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.460> what<00:01:17.670> I'm<00:01:17.789> doing

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
bit more of a close-up of what I'm doing

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.270 
bit more of a close-up of what I'm doing
with<00:01:18.210> my<00:01:18.240> hand<00:01:18.569> my<00:01:19.409> bridegroom<00:01:19.679> you<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.069> see

with my hand my bridegroom you can see
him<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:20.399> very<00:01:21.240> very<00:01:21.509> very<00:01:22.079> slightly<00:01:22.380> pulsing

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
him just very very very slightly pulsing

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.249 
him just very very very slightly pulsing
the<00:01:23.250> rod<00:01:23.429> doesn't<00:01:24.119> take<00:01:24.240> much<00:01:24.420> movement<00:01:24.659> you

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the rod doesn't take much movement you

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.319 
the rod doesn't take much movement you
don't<00:01:25.409> want<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> move<00:01:25.709> it<00:01:25.829> too<00:01:26.009> far<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.729> couple

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
don't want to move it too far a couple

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:39.640 
don't want to move it too far a couple
inches<00:01:27.509> or<00:01:28.049> 4<00:01:28.590> inches

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.780 

all<00:01:40.650> right<00:01:40.890> let's<00:01:41.100> go<00:01:41.280> back<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> original

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
all right let's go back to the original

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.130 
all right let's go back to the original
pool<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.570> watch<00:01:42.870> the<00:01:43.200> technique<00:01:43.710> pay<00:01:43.980> off
