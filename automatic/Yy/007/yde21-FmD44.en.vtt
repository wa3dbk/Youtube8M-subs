00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.690 
window net down was taking his helmet
off<00:01:39.620> amazing<00:01:40.620> I<00:01:40.740> think<00:01:40.830> he<00:01:41.130> got<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.550> back

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
off amazing I think he got in the back

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.180 
off amazing I think he got in the back
of<00:01:41.730> Nelson<00:01:42.210> Piquet<00:01:42.360> Jr<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:43.110> when<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.650> did<00:01:43.890> when

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
of Nelson Piquet Jr and when it did when

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.219 
of Nelson Piquet Jr and when it did when
he<00:01:44.280> did<00:01:44.550> that<00:01:44.760> slowed<00:01:45.300> his<00:01:45.510> momentum<00:01:45.690> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
he did that slowed his momentum and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.140 
he did that slowed his momentum and
that's<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.560> think<00:01:46.770> James<00:01:47.010> butcher<00:01:47.460> got<00:01:47.850> into

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
that's I think James butcher got into

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.810 
that's I think James butcher got into
him<00:01:48.270> watch<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.560> look<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.250> hard<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.520> see

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
him watch it's not look it's hard to see

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.030 
him watch it's not look it's hard to see
you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.210> see<00:01:51.479> right<00:01:51.660> there<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.680> could<00:01:52.830> see

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
you can see right there you could see

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.770 
you can see right there you could see
you<00:01:53.220> could<00:01:53.340> see<00:01:53.400> BK<00:01:54.210> get<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> little<00:01:54.660> bit

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
you could see BK get a little bit

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.440 
you could see BK get a little bit
sideways<00:01:55.160> that's<00:01:56.160> real<00:01:56.490> time<00:01:56.790> speed<00:01:57.180> right

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
sideways that's real time speed right

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.090 
sideways that's real time speed right
there<00:01:57.690> but<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.960> don't<00:01:58.080> know<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.710> those<00:01:58.800> trucks

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
there but I don't know if those trucks

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.219 
there but I don't know if those trucks
make<00:01:59.280> condos<00:01:59.729> BK<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.420> got<00:02:00.600> sideways<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.140> then

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
make condos BK you got sideways and then

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.870
