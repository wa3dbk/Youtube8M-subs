00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
of the store so I figured I'd just put

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.120 
of the store so I figured I'd just put
tutorial<00:00:33.600> up<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.870> how<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.079> do<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.469> cuz<00:00:34.739> I've<00:00:34.980> had

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
tutorial up on how to do it cuz I've had

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.590 
tutorial up on how to do it cuz I've had
a<00:00:35.160> few<00:00:35.370> people<00:00:35.730> over<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> last<00:00:36.239> week

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
a few people over like the last week

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.979 
a few people over like the last week
asked<00:00:37.020> me<00:00:37.110> ask<00:00:37.890> me<00:00:38.100> how<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.510> figured

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
asked me ask me how I do it so I figured

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.930 
asked me ask me how I do it so I figured
I'd<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.070> makes<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.460> bit<00:00:41.579> easier

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
I'd do this so it makes it a bit easier

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.299 
I'd do this so it makes it a bit easier
than<00:00:42.120> sending<00:00:42.450> out<00:00:42.570> loads<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.930> messages<00:00:43.309> so

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
than sending out loads of messages so

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.010 
than sending out loads of messages so
you<00:00:44.370> go<00:00:44.579> down<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.910> network<00:00:45.210> settings<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.899> then

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
you go down to network settings and then

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.490 
you go down to network settings and then
you<00:00:46.110> go<00:00:46.200> down<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> third<00:00:46.829> option<00:00:48.410> it<00:00:49.410> will

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
you go down to the third option it will

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.400 
you go down to the third option it will
sign<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.129> PSN<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.329> usually<00:00:52.260> you'd

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
sign you out of PSN so usually you'd

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.410 
sign you out of PSN so usually you'd
click<00:00:52.620> easy<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.059> want<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.300> go

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
click easy here but you want to go

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.529

until you get to DNS setting and then

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.790 
until you get to DNS setting and then

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
that was amazing there we go there's the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.440 
that was amazing there we go there's the
numbers<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.080> 208<00:01:16.619> 1<00:01:16.860> 2<00:01:17.100> 2<00:01:17.310> 2<00:01:17.340> 3<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.060> 2<00:01:18.210> 2

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
numbers so it's 208 1 2 2 2 3 and 2 2

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.280 
numbers so it's 208 1 2 2 2 3 and 2 2
for<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.720> primary<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.350> 208<00:01:20.009> 1<00:01:20.310> 2<00:01:20.520> 2<00:01:20.729> 2<00:01:20.759> 3<00:01:21.060> 2<00:01:21.540> 3<00:01:21.720> for

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
for the primary in 208 1 2 2 2 3 2 3 for

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.700 
for the primary in 208 1 2 2 2 3 2 3 for
the<00:01:22.380> secondary<00:01:24.200> there's<00:01:25.200> only<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> one

the secondary there's only the one

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.440 
the secondary there's only the one
difference<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> digit<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.150> not<00:01:27.299> that

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
difference in the digit so it's not that

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.600

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.840 
come on video I'm going to fast my video
right<00:03:34.170> back<00:03:34.380> over<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.799> network<00:03:35.100> settings<00:03:35.130> and

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
right back over to network settings and

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.330 
right back over to network settings and
then<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.900> go<00:03:37.079> on<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.440> third<00:03:37.530> option<00:03:37.889> again

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
then you go on to the third option again

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.400 
then you go on to the third option again
and<00:03:38.579> this<00:03:38.850> time<00:03:38.910> rather<00:03:39.450> than<00:03:39.660> go<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:39.930> custom

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
and this time rather than go and custom

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.099 
and this time rather than go and custom
all<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.889> do<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.190> just<00:03:41.459> say<00:03:41.609> it<00:03:41.639> to<00:03:41.880> easy<00:03:42.109> it

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
all you do is just say it to easy it

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.509 
all you do is just say it to easy it
would<00:03:43.260> just<00:03:43.440> automatically<00:03:44.010> set<00:03:44.280> all<00:03:44.400> your

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
would just automatically set all your

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.129 
would just automatically set all your
settings<00:03:44.730> back<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.209> what<00:03:45.359> they<00:03:45.510> were<00:03:45.569> so<00:03:46.049> you

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
settings back to what they were so you

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.259 
settings back to what they were so you
can<00:03:46.290> up<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.590> same<00:03:46.799> DNS<00:03:47.730> is<00:03:47.880> what<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.150> were

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
can up the same DNS is what you were

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.330 
can up the same DNS is what you were
originally<00:03:48.389> ad<00:03:48.840> or<00:03:48.989> whatever<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.739> you're

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
originally ad or whatever and you're

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.830 
originally ad or whatever and you're
gonna<00:03:50.430> have<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.760> UK<00:03:51.060> version<00:03:51.239> at<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.600> store

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
gonna have the UK version at the store

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.990 
gonna have the UK version at the store
again<00:03:52.079> but<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:52.829> mean<00:03:53.220> obviously<00:03:53.370> if<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.819> want

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
again but I mean obviously if you want

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.220 
again but I mean obviously if you want
to<00:03:54.060> go<00:03:54.150> back<00:03:54.359> on<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.630> American<00:03:55.079> version

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
to go back on the American version

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.930 
to go back on the American version
you're<00:03:55.650> gonna<00:03:55.739> have<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.130> put<00:03:56.489> these<00:03:56.639> signs

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
you're gonna have to put these signs

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.300 
you're gonna have to put these signs
back<00:03:57.269> in<00:03:57.450> so<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:57.840> probably<00:03:58.079> a<00:03:58.139> good<00:03:58.889> idea<00:03:58.950> to

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
back in so it's probably a good idea to

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.710 
back in so it's probably a good idea to
write<00:03:59.639> the<00:03:59.760> numbers<00:04:00.060> down<00:04:00.239> somewhere<00:04:00.660> and

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
write the numbers down somewhere and

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.500 
write the numbers down somewhere and
just<00:04:01.049> have<00:04:01.319> it<00:04:01.440> at<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.650> side<00:04:02.030> but<00:04:03.030> yeah<00:04:03.180> if<00:04:03.389> you

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
just have it at the side but yeah if you

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.059
