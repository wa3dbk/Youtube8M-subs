achieving a super modern smooth finish

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.620 
achieving a super modern smooth finish
say<00:00:46.930> that<00:00:47.200> three<00:00:47.469> times<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.820> chalk<00:00:49.329> type

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
say that three times with chalk type

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.369 
say that three times with chalk type
paints<00:00:50.079> so<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:51.430> first<00:00:51.760> tip<00:00:52.120> is<00:00:52.390> to<00:00:52.480> have<00:00:53.140> a

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
paints so the first tip is to have a

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.549 
paints so the first tip is to have a
quality<00:00:54.160> brush<00:00:54.610> so<00:00:55.120> don't<00:00:55.450> use<00:00:55.870> one<00:00:56.320> of<00:00:56.410> those

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
quality brush so don't use one of those

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.209 
quality brush so don't use one of those
cheap<00:00:56.860> chip<00:00:57.250> brushes<00:00:57.610> because<00:00:58.800> those<00:00:59.800> brushes

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
cheap chip brushes because those brushes

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.979 
cheap chip brushes because those brushes
tend<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:00.820> be<00:01:00.969> a<00:01:01.000> little<00:01:01.329> more<00:01:01.510> coarse<00:01:01.899> than

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
tend to be a little more coarse than

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.049 
tend to be a little more coarse than
wiry<00:01:02.469> so<00:01:03.309> it's<00:01:03.460> going<00:01:03.579> to<00:01:03.640> be<00:01:03.760> a<00:01:03.789> real

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
wiry so it's going to be a real

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.480 
wiry so it's going to be a real
challenge<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:05.019> get<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.379> super<00:01:05.830> smooth<00:01:06.100> finish

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.199 
to brush that on and that is going to
give<00:02:32.010> me<00:02:32.370> an<00:02:33.650> ultra<00:02:34.650> smooth<00:02:34.980> finish<00:02:35.010> with<00:02:35.849> my

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
give me an ultra smooth finish with my

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.069 
give me an ultra smooth finish with my
brush<00:02:37.019> strokes<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:38.430> reason<00:02:38.760> why<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:38.970> don't<00:02:39.180> dip

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
brush strokes the reason why I don't dip

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.920 
brush strokes the reason why I don't dip
the<00:02:40.410> brush<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.040> water<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.940> then<00:02:42.690> dip<00:02:42.870> it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
the brush in the water and then dip it

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.319 
the brush in the water and then dip it
in<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.290> can<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.890> because<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.760> water<00:02:45.000> can

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
in the can is because the water can

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.600 
in the can is because the water can
contaminate<00:02:45.750> your<00:02:46.170> entire<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:46.920> paint<00:02:47.280> and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
contaminate your entire can of paint and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.569 
contaminate your entire can of paint and
so<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.780> next<00:02:49.019> time<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.379> open<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.890> up<00:02:50.069> the

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
so the next time you open it up the

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.630 
so the next time you open it up the
bacteria<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.329> germs<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.930> are<00:02:52.019> in<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.319> water

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
bacteria and germs that are in the water

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.729 
bacteria and germs that are in the water
unfortunately<00:02:53.750> will<00:02:54.750> make<00:02:54.930> your<00:02:55.170> can<00:02:55.560> of

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
unfortunately will make your can of

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.979 
unfortunately will make your can of
paint<00:02:55.950> go<00:02:56.160> bad<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:56.970> when<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.359> open<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.810> up

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
it can smell like a sewer so make sure

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.819
