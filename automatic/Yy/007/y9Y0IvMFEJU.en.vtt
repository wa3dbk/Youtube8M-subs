00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.250
 in your visit white bay we talked 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.250
 with the chef pablito martÃ­n 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.560
 Conscious feeding is 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.750
 just be aware of what 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.809
 each one is consuming I do not say that 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.280
 it is okay or bad to consume a soda 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.580
 now you are aware what that has 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.230
 gas or soda not to say alfajores 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.210
 to industrialized sciences and so on 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.820
 etcetera now you are aware what 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.470
 be consumed in day to day and month and if not 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.230
 I really have no idea how to start 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.720
 the labels the product forward you 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.030
 I can say that it is super healthy healthy 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.760
 etc. etcetera and will give pure sarasa 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.730
 turns ingredients 2 points and there 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.460
 I started reading and from consciousness one 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.559
 decide if you are going to consume that food 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.360
 Many people tell me if I am aware 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.640
 what has an alfajor but I like it and 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.200
 I want to consume it and that's fine now 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.000
 yes, you are aware that this is what 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.340
 bring your favorite alfajor to your 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.619
 family there you are in the oven then 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.690
 be conscious be aware of what you 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.050
 It goes to your body when you consume 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.490
 dairy products are aware of what 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.680
 It happens to your body when you consume 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.050
 different types of meats conscious 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.209
 when to consume a little flour 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.840
 integrated refining and what you 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:33.210
 pass 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.950
 that is conscious feeding to 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.679
 difference of live food in 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.420
 conscious feeding and cooking 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.100
 we overcome the 40 45 degrees there not 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.229
 we have no problem that's why we do 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.539
 rice risotto call and we do 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.520
 different lentil stews pizzas 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.709
 whole grilled 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.959
 we have a super varied diet 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:55.740
 but we do not forget the raw quota 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.720
 that is conscious feeding 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.210
 the big question is this feeding 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.720
 masks this food carries more 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.119
 time in the kitchen this feeding is 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.729
 bored bland and I have to not that 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.280
 it's a great myth of that because you can 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.830
 prepare a super dinner in less than 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.460
 five or ten minutes 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.880
 how much does an alfajor cost you? 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.340
 an alfajor and how much is paying the kilo 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.020
 of that alfajor for example let's do 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.200
 average as only fast the gingerbread 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.480
 can cost 10 pesos is alfajor weighs 40 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.100
 50 grams or 100 grams of 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.240
 alfajor is paying 20 pesos per kilo 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.600
 200 pesos 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.180
 how much does a kilo of walnuts cost? 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.550
 pesos and when the alfajor is 15 pesos 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.530
 you are going to pay 30 to 100 grams and 300 in 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.600
 kilos and nuts will be 300 pesos 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.940
 the kilo or for what some people 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.120
 agrees they tell you price per kilo and what 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.640
 they do not throw you 40 50 grams then 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.870
 this diet is not much more expensive 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.300
 see how much it costs you a big 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.550
 mozzarella in a pizzeria and when a 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.500
 olive oil and olive oil you 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.390
 It yields months then if you are 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.580
 smart you're going through different 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.690
 places buying good food 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.700
 genuine that you close your pocket to the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.459
 long this feeding is much more 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.140
 cheap maybe it's hard for you to start over 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.390
 dietetics there are things that are very expensive 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.860
 good buy 34 little things the seeds of 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.360
 sunflower cost 5 cbs 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.940
 that what is nuts and almonds 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.880
 then buy more sunflower than nuts 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.860
 shopping more linen what chia that more or 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.360
 less have more properties but the 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.880
 Flax seeds are a lot more 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.070
 I buy my son who is a 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.530
 serial super cheap brown rice 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.360
 it costs the same as the refined one then 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.620
 if one is intelligent and goes through 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.050
 different places 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.650
 this food is rbara is at 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.150
 cooking time nothing 5 10 15 minutes 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.370
 as much and you already have the food 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.160
 solved in fact I'm preparing my 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.110
 next book that will be released at the end of the year 33 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.420
 I am going to ask for a few minutes of conscience 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.360
 each would do super recipes 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.550
 practices and with respect to taste is not 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.010
 that healthy eating is synonymous with 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.810
 everything boiled the opposite I would 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.200
 food generally in a way 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.959
 conscious healthy and really my meals 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.000
 They are very tasty because because I put 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.590
 wave you have to put wave you have to 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.680
 put love and you have to understand that 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.530
 we are what we eat and what they do 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.690
 to the benefits of fruit consumption and 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.669
 assiduously good vegetable first 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.070
 we have to understand that our device 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.280
 digestive is not designed to process 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.650
 to meats of animal origin logically 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.389
 dairy then if you're going to do it in 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.280
 small quantities increase the 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.250
 vegetables increase the fruit everything 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.139
 raw goes before from my sixth side already 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.669
 recommend that you consume every day 5 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.919
 portions of raw fruit and vegetables 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.020
 you want to cook some some 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.780
 perfect vegetables cereals vegetables 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.789
 what are the benefits first the 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.830
 fruit and the raw vegetable oxygenates and 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.590
 that's good to understand it does not oxygenate you 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.400
 gives you life gives you energy the fruit and 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.110
 vegetable detoxifies you detoxifies 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.349
 you can do a weekly fast 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.860
 biweekly monthly or seasonal 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:14.070
 for example the 21 of every 4 months do 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.009
 sorry every four months you make a change 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:20.229
 no autumn winter spring summer 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.509
 then you make a great adjustment means 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.130
 this good you wake up and consume the 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.139
 fruit that you want and the amount that 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.550
 you want for example opera but it operates 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.890
 opera fill me the ready 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.080
 I'm hungry and did not spend two hours 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.540
 the last intake continued with the pear 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.130
 Pear Pear Pear Terry again have 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.260
 hunger already spent the two hours there yes 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.600
 I can change fruit and if I want I'll go 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.340
 for the strawberry banana peach apple 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.730
 what always has seasonal fruit 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:48.880
 and so you're going to be helping with fruits 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.680
 throughout the day and the next day ret and 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.600
 you go from fasting consuming some 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.580
 vegetable a raw salad and then 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.520
 you will always consume your intake of 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.310
 day by day the long-lived villages are 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.920
 large consumers of fruit vegetables 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.770
 raw fermented or that is 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.620
 ferment the cabbage for example to 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.020
 make sauerkraut ferment two nodules 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.940
 that if for example good the big ones 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.650
 Long-lived villages are consumers 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.540
 fermented if it is raw fruit and vegetables 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.090
 that's why it's fundamental and indispensable 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:22.720
 to have a conscious diet 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.550
 healthy consume every day fruits and 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.710
 vegetables 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.840
 one says good is much, much easier 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.760
 consume some cookies open the package 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.440
 biscuits gas hand tomato and sestao 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.530
 with coffee or tea that you you want 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.760
 it's easier to go to god than to buy 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.010
 biscuit packages or one 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.410
 grocery store buy a banana but the 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.450
 havana or eat the banana or look 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.120
 because sometimes they put us in the head 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.220
 that it is more complicated to consume a fruit 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.290
 be a mandarin you are on the street 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.510
 you're hungry you go to a greengrocer 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.250
 you buy one or two tangerines and it's a lot 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.500
 cheaper than going to a kiosk 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.480
 an alfajor and much more nutritious 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.810
 then let's be aware what we're going 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.970
 to consume, let's decide on a day-to- day basis 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.710
 the positive and not the negative and 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.750
 let's understand that hippocratic phrase that 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.880
 we are what we eat to which I 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.890
 I added a phrase if it 's more at the end 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.600
 what we eat and what we 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.900
 we obviously do part of the 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:20.310
 feeding 80% and 20% activity 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.310
 physical and spiritual part
