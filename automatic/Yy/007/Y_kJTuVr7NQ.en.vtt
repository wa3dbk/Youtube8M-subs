00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.319 
does shed very minimal and I think it's
because<00:02:13.959> I<00:02:14.200> cut<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:15.040> wet<00:02:15.310> when<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.700> was<00:02:15.940> making

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
because I cut the wet when I was making

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.750 
because I cut the wet when I was making
this<00:02:16.480> way<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.440> can<00:02:17.680> be<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:18.010> but<00:02:18.160> it's<00:02:18.340> nothing

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
this way that can be it but it's nothing

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.849 
this way that can be it but it's nothing
too<00:02:19.060> much<00:02:19.299> you<00:02:19.870> know<00:02:19.989> is<00:02:20.110> not<00:02:20.200> something<00:02:20.530> that

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:20.859 
too much you know is not something that

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.509 
too much you know is not something that
is<00:02:21.600> unbearable<00:02:22.600> very<00:02:23.470> minimum<00:02:23.920> shedding<00:02:24.340> and

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
is unbearable very minimum shedding and

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:55.399 
is unbearable very minimum shedding and
definitely<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.090> would<00:02:25.239> recommend<00:02:25.750> his<00:02:26.049> hair

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.960 

basically<00:02:56.409> that's<00:02:56.560> how<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:56.799> choose<00:02:57.159> the<00:02:57.430> curls

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
basically that's how I choose the curls

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.649 
basically that's how I choose the curls
and<00:02:58.269> then<00:02:58.659> I<00:02:58.989> use<00:02:59.620> this<00:02:59.980> big<00:03:00.430> tooth<00:03:00.849> comb<00:03:01.360> and

and then I use this big tooth comb and

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.559 
and then I use this big tooth comb and
then<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.019> just<00:03:02.080> basically<00:03:02.739> brushed<00:03:03.640> out<00:03:03.940> cone

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
then I just basically brushed out cone

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.199 
then I just basically brushed out cone
down<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.019> curls<00:03:05.319> like<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:05.920> just<00:03:06.310> like<00:03:06.519> so<00:03:06.819> then
