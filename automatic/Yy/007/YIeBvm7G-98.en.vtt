00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.420
 Hello to you, and even kamikaze 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.450
 live a mod called there craft 4 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.380
 in this part i will show you how to study 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.080
 there are tips 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.720
 luggage for the rod 9 laps of hell as well 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.930
 magical fur which will speed up our 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.390
 hellish stove and so go on to study 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.000
 the fact that I'll talk to you today 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.670
 and so the very first one I drained it 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.350
 there tips are one of the hardest 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.410
 in the fourth to sew well we 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.620
 Of course ken you need aspect 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.789
 tool aurum aspect of metal and 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.610
 everything seems to be so that I tried everything 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.420
 gone this aurum instrument and metal 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.690
 here so everything is done is built and 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.289
 even 4 roles are not required and 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.539
 we all take our study and study 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.250
 and let's see what it is 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.119
 others are added to us in this 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.650
 appears there tips mean there 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.630
 it is known its ability to absorb 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.070
 and hold magic with what is one 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.290
 from the best materials and create 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.909
 the tip of the rod the same sound will be 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.610
 energy transfer is very efficient 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.259
 aspects means it turns out that rather 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.939
 just more effective means to be 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:28.829
 quickly assemble an aura aura of the site well, 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.439
 and I understand this improved most likely 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.750
 there is a tip and this is normal there 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.100
 tip so let's continue to teach 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.890
 there goes you further 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.400
 next let's take the magic fur 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.100
 It means and here we take a little 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.650
 here and try as A.R. this is very 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.049
 easy to dial and how much car and also 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.090
 you will need aspects of movement 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.729
 also as you can see there are two aspects left 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.560
 use maybe what you do 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.920
 it's somehow simpler even he's some aspect 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.100
 don't need you 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.590
 that is, it refers to the stove throwing out 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.460
 let's see what it is to lend us 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.979
 of this invention 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.760
 there is a branch from hellish liver and 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.760
 see what it is so usually in 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.760
 in general, they will accelerate your speed 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.180
 furnace melting is made easy 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:29.510
 do here they are in this thing. and 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:32.269
 now instantly take we approach our 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.310
 pechen on all you need friction mechanics 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.799
 cling like this this is here these 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.910
 holes to this tag and here to this hole and 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.769
 then you have 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:45.410
 the stove will be much faster 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:48.680
 In general, what shall we see now? 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.360
 to do well, that is, one-two and instantly 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.750
 practically 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.280
 we go further we have it 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.040
 trunk for life 9 laps hell in my opinion 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.489
 the coolest knob for well for 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.079
 groups 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:09.500
 so for this, ignis alter and 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:12.140
 200 activate the alter ego among the well then 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.250
 I have been here all spread pick 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.500
 we study this study we throw it out 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.130
 open our what we for a moment he opened 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.080
 to the same 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.200
 and here we see that we have here again on 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.720
 tower to 9 circles of hell poles end 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.239
 the world you often bumping into the cooled 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.160
 now you now you have opened the way to 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.480
 how to invoke and incite these 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.780
 Mice on your enemies 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.030
 smart means to do it in the inferno well 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.849
 as there altar southern I do not remember 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.200
 called in this thing 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.220
 doing this is required 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.760
 some aspect 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.190
 it is necessary to grief or change everything why are you 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.610
 shown in general now we take off 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.610
 our summer resident take a little so 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.330
 for using for one mouse will be us 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.180
 Rodin A.R. 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.380
 War super-ditey dress means no 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.390
 here this one means with our our us 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.370
 the market is all going to be done a little 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.940
 cheaper 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.739
 so landing means here it is to you 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.660
 find an enemy who we will be all 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:26.590
 start bloodsucking 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.250
 we are funny, for example, hay,, 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.830
 hike 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:35.260
 and we have nothing idol mode well 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.690
 helped so we set them up and we donâ€™t 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:42.010
 we know the truth reeds and us flies mouse 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:45.190
 which flies you our enemy yet 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:48.190
 just run a random house in my opinion they want 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.500
 send someone to eat she bites and 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.440
 something like this in general so you can run 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.150
 you to a maximum of 9 and although there is 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.080
 gurtam process 3 maiden mean here 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.600
 depend on 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.550
 your park as far as it can 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.410
 miss them for as long as you want 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:08.070
 and as you can see the danger of 5 damage 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.070
 bad thing i'll tell you 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.320
 happy life 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.840
 but basically not a bad thing 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.139
 give hour we will achieve our hay zombies 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.999
 everything 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.650
 and there are no more and the remaining mice will be 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:30.610
 sdyhat also these bags in my will 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.610
 die under the water as I remember 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.390
 should not including houses under water now 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.000
 I will try here two here 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.680
 but everything is in principle the further he became 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.950
 In principle, this is all that he is strong 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.320
 prepared everything then 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.320
 since this is all well prepared for today 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.480
 The next part is about trying more than 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.230
 I also want to gain all kinds of studies 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.810
 quickly finish it there just 4 already 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.550
 It came out a long time ago that 41 is necessary 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.100
 take it specifically 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.570
 study it fully show you how and 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.060
 what is studied in it 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.280
 maybe there is still a little mean 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.310
 chat nicks left this park 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.800
 gonna study and they needless bag golem 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:18.580
 dinner is not there would have thought easily 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.010
 and here it is all there too below than soon
