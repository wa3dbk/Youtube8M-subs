if you come into this soft tissue behind

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.900 
if you come into this soft tissue behind
the<00:01:03.860> elbow<00:01:05.770> and<00:01:06.770> I<00:01:06.920> often<00:01:07.100> do<00:01:07.400> it<00:01:07.550> with<00:01:07.700> one

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
the elbow and I often do it with one

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.060 
the elbow and I often do it with one
hand<00:01:07.940> but<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:08.660> but<00:01:09.110> it<00:01:09.229> also<00:01:09.380> works<00:01:09.740> really

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
hand but it but it also works really

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.440 
hand but it but it also works really
well<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.490> do<00:01:10.610> it<00:01:10.670> with<00:01:10.790> two<00:01:11.030> hands<00:01:11.270> so

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
well to do it with two hands so

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.020 
well to do it with two hands so
especially<00:01:12.080> if<00:01:12.170> your<00:01:12.640> muscles<00:01:13.640> aren't<00:01:13.790> used

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
especially if your muscles aren't used

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.450 
especially if your muscles aren't used
to<00:01:14.150> doing<00:01:14.720> some<00:01:15.020> of<00:01:15.050> this<00:01:15.200> stuff<00:01:15.470> it<00:01:15.650> can<00:01:16.340> be

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
to doing some of this stuff it can be

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.870 
to doing some of this stuff it can be
easier<00:01:16.850> on<00:01:16.910> your<00:01:17.680> body<00:01:18.680> to<00:01:19.040> use<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.490> two<00:01:19.670> hands

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
easier on your body to use the two hands

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.150 
easier on your body to use the two hands
together<00:01:20.119> so<00:01:20.600> they<00:01:20.750> just<00:01:20.930> kind<00:01:21.170> of<00:01:21.229> one<00:01:21.860> fist

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
together so they just kind of one fist

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.830 
together so they just kind of one fist
inside<00:01:22.369> of<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.760> other<00:01:22.910> like<00:01:23.869> that<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:26.720> you

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
inside of the other like that and you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.109 
inside of the other like that and you
just<00:01:26.869> compress<00:01:27.830> in<00:01:28.040> a<00:01:28.190> little<00:01:28.460> bit<00:01:28.640> not<00:01:28.910> as

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
just compress in a little bit not as

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.210 
just compress in a little bit not as
deeply<00:01:29.479> as<00:01:29.720> in<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.080> tricep<00:01:30.350> that<00:01:30.979> we<00:01:31.070> did

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
deeply as in the tricep that we did

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.280 
deeply as in the tricep that we did
before<00:01:31.610> because<00:01:31.759> there's<00:01:32.509> bone<00:01:32.780> right<00:01:33.020> under

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
before because there's bone right under

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.680 
before because there's bone right under
here<00:01:33.470> but<00:01:34.009> still<00:01:34.250> enough<00:01:34.580> just<00:01:34.820> kind<00:01:35.240> of<00:01:35.330> hook

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
here but still enough just kind of hook

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
into the soft tissue that is there and

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.380 
into the soft tissue that is there and
then<00:01:38.450> just<00:01:39.040> kind<00:01:40.040> of<00:01:40.100> bend<00:01:40.369> your<00:01:40.580> knees<00:01:41.000> keep

like a glide stroke sort of yeah going
up<00:02:00.289> going<00:02:00.619> up<00:02:01.569> I'm<00:02:02.569> just<00:02:02.660> going<00:02:02.929> to<00:02:02.959> follow

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
up going up I'm just going to follow

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.180 
up going up I'm just going to follow
this<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:05.119> along<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.569> back<00:02:08.860> if<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:09.979> want<00:02:10.130> to

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
this you along the back if you want to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.440 
this you along the back if you want to
back<00:02:10.280> them<00:02:10.490> up<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.700> further<00:02:10.940> away<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.150> Linda

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
back them up a further away to Linda

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.930 
back them up a further away to Linda
graphically<00:02:11.959> it<00:02:12.470> might<00:02:12.650> be<00:02:12.860> working<00:02:13.190> so

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
graphically it might be working so

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.809 
graphically it might be working so
that's<00:02:14.660> about<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.740> speed<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:16.160> often<00:02:16.640> do

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
that's about the speed that I often do

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.699 
that's about the speed that I often do
but<00:02:17.150> all<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.930> I'll<00:02:18.080> go<00:02:18.260> through<00:02:18.530> more

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
but all that I'll go through more

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.740 
but all that I'll go through more
quickly<00:02:18.980> for<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.340> second<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.060> if<00:02:20.240> I<00:02:20.360> want<00:02:20.599> to<00:02:20.660> go

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
quickly for a second so if I want to go

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.050 
quickly for a second so if I want to go
faster<00:02:21.349> and<00:02:21.620> still<00:02:21.860> have<00:02:22.069> it<00:02:22.099> be<00:02:22.190> pleasant<00:02:22.849> for

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
faster and still have it be pleasant for

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.510 
faster and still have it be pleasant for
them<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.450> have<00:02:23.599> some<00:02:23.840> benefits<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.560> guess<00:02:25.280> I

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
them and have some benefits I guess I

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.980 
them and have some benefits I guess I
can<00:02:25.790> do<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:25.970> faster<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.390> just<00:02:26.630> use<00:02:26.810> less

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
can do it faster and just use less

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.530 
can do it faster and just use less
pressure<00:02:27.319> so<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.280> can<00:02:28.490> I<00:02:28.670> can<00:02:28.940> just<00:02:29.150> kind<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.420> go

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
pressure so I can I can just kind of go

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.479 
pressure so I can I can just kind of go
up<00:02:29.690> like<00:02:30.470> this

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.399 

and<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:37.430> then<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.790> into<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.720> back<00:02:39.900> muscles

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
and and then that into the back muscles

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.600 
and and then that into the back muscles
here<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.650> don't<00:02:40.739> have<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.040> go<00:02:41.129> all<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.370> way<00:02:41.400> up

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
here I don't have to go all the way up

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.910 
here I don't have to go all the way up
and<00:02:42.120> through<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.720> back<00:02:42.870> muscles<00:02:43.290> but<00:02:43.500> into

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
and through the back muscles but into

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.949 
and through the back muscles but into
them<00:02:44.159> here<00:02:44.519> because<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.330> top<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.780> ribs

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
them here because the top of the ribs

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.839 
them here because the top of the ribs
are<00:02:46.170> basically<00:02:46.590> about<00:02:46.830> here<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:47.580> then<00:02:47.760> they

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
are basically about here but then they

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.399 
are basically about here but then they
go<00:02:48.180> in<00:02:48.360> deeply<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.170> vertebra<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:51.409> these

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
go in deeply to the vertebra so these

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.979 
go in deeply to the vertebra so these
muscles<00:02:52.769> are<00:02:53.190> coming<00:02:53.909> on<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.269> ribs<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.840> in

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
muscles are coming on to the ribs and in

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.750 
muscles are coming on to the ribs and in
between<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.409> ribs<00:02:55.620> these<00:02:56.010> muscles<00:02:56.519> are<00:02:56.640> in

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
between the ribs these muscles are in

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.640 
between the ribs these muscles are in
this<00:02:56.909> big<00:02:57.150> trough<00:02:57.980> along<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.480> vertebrae<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:01.620> I

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
this big trough along the vertebrae so I

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.970 
this big trough along the vertebrae so I
usually<00:03:02.489> just<00:03:03.060> take<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.450> up<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:04.140> into<00:03:04.500> those

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
usually just take it up and into those

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.380 
usually just take it up and into those
back<00:03:05.400> muscles<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:06.690> then<00:03:06.900> stop<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.910> then

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.460 

going<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.420> keep<00:03:12.599> this<00:03:12.720> head<00:03:12.900> up

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.810 

you<00:03:15.680> can<00:03:17.440> have<00:03:18.440> some<00:03:18.710> freedom<00:03:18.920> too<00:03:19.250> if<00:03:19.670> he

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
you can have some freedom too if he

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.920 
you can have some freedom too if he
needs<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.210> turn<00:03:20.390> around<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.780> tell<00:03:20.900> me

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
needs to turn around and tell me

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.820 
needs to turn around and tell me
something<00:03:21.350> but<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:22.960> gets<00:03:23.960> quite<00:03:24.350> sticky

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
something but that gets quite sticky

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.400 
something but that gets quite sticky
there<00:03:28.330> but<00:03:29.330> I'm<00:03:29.420> also<00:03:29.570> using<00:03:29.810> more<00:03:30.170> pressure

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
there but I'm also using more pressure

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.260 
there but I'm also using more pressure
so<00:03:30.590> again<00:03:31.010> if<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:31.250> want<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.520> speed<00:03:31.760> up<00:03:31.910> I<00:03:32.060> can

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
so again if I want to speed up I can

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.680 
so again if I want to speed up I can
lighten<00:03:32.600> up<00:03:33.580> are<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:34.700> between<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.240> ribs<00:03:35.450> are

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
lighten up are you between the ribs are

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.990 
lighten up are you between the ribs are
on<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.020> ribs<00:03:36.230> I'm<00:03:36.440> over<00:03:37.130> two<00:03:37.430> or<00:03:37.580> three<00:03:37.820> ribs

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
on the ribs I'm over two or three ribs

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.140 
on the ribs I'm over two or three ribs
at<00:03:38.210> a<00:03:38.300> time<00:03:38.650> if<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:39.920> want<00:03:40.070> to<00:03:40.220> work<00:03:40.400> between<00:03:40.910> the

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
at a time if I want to work between the

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.480 
at a time if I want to work between the
ribs<00:03:41.360> I'll<00:03:42.260> show<00:03:42.500> you<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.709> in<00:03:42.770> just<00:03:43.040> a<00:03:43.100> second

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
ribs I'll show you that in just a second

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.540 
ribs I'll show you that in just a second
and<00:03:44.120> are<00:03:44.450> there<00:03:44.630> muscles<00:03:45.050> on<00:03:45.320> under<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.280> skin

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
and are there muscles on under the skin

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.280 
and are there muscles on under the skin
along<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.180> whole<00:03:47.390> room<00:03:47.720> yep<00:03:49.750> yep<00:03:50.750> some<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.230> the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
along the whole room yep yep some of the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.590 
along the whole room yep yep some of the
muscles<00:03:51.680> are<00:03:51.980> running<00:03:52.610> just<00:03:52.820> between<00:03:53.239> each

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
muscles are running just between each

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.660 
muscles are running just between each
set<00:03:54.020> of<00:03:54.140> ribs<00:03:54.670> but<00:03:55.670> there's<00:03:55.880> also<00:03:57.670> there's

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
set of ribs but there's also there's

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.550 
set of ribs but there's also there's
also<00:04:01.510> abdominal<00:04:02.510> muscles<00:04:02.900> coming<00:04:03.200> over<00:04:03.470> the

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
also abdominal muscles coming over the

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.010 
also abdominal muscles coming over the
top<00:04:03.590> of<00:04:04.010> here<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:05.060> latissimus<00:04:05.780> dorsi

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
top of here and the latissimus dorsi

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.830 
top of here and the latissimus dorsi
coming<00:04:06.860> over<00:04:07.070> the<00:04:07.160> top<00:04:07.220> of<00:04:07.489> it<00:04:07.580> here<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.540> this

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
coming over the top of it here and this

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.690 
coming over the top of it here and this
bulging<00:04:09.260> muscle<00:04:09.650> comes<00:04:09.860> down<00:04:10.100> onto<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.520> ribs

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
bulging muscle comes down onto the ribs

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.240 
bulging muscle comes down onto the ribs
from<00:04:11.030> under<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:11.480> scapula<00:04:12.489> so<00:04:13.489> then<00:04:14.090> this<00:04:14.270> this

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
from under the scapula so then this this

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.770 
from under the scapula so then this this
position<00:04:16.250> just<00:04:16.280> kind<00:04:16.640> of<00:04:16.669> follows<00:04:17.000> up<00:04:17.180> the

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
position just kind of follows up the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.740 
position just kind of follows up the
last<00:04:18.049> ribs<00:04:18.350> right<00:04:18.620> there<00:04:18.859> on<00:04:19.190> him<00:04:19.720> like<00:04:20.720> a

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
last ribs right there on him like a

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.469 
last ribs right there on him like a
little<00:04:21.109> what's<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.919> business<00:04:22.130> position<00:04:22.790> this

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
little what's the business position this

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.840 
little what's the business position this
is<00:04:25.990> and<00:04:26.990> it's<00:04:27.560> in<00:04:27.710> your<00:04:27.830> handout<00:04:28.280> about<00:04:28.640> the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
is and it's in your handout about the

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.250 
is and it's in your handout about the
ribs<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:30.550> so<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.729> ribs<00:04:31.970> one<00:04:32.900> of<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.110> big

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
ribs and so the ribs one of the big

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.080 
ribs and so the ribs one of the big
benefits<00:04:33.740> for<00:04:33.979> the<00:04:34.070> ribs<00:04:34.280> besides<00:04:34.760> the<00:04:34.970> whole

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
benefits for the ribs besides the whole

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.700 
benefits for the ribs besides the whole
breathing<00:04:35.540> thing<00:04:35.750> which<00:04:35.990> is<00:04:36.169> huge

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
breathing thing which is huge

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.440 
breathing thing which is huge
but<00:04:37.220> we<00:04:37.370> talked<00:04:37.640> about<00:04:37.729> that<00:04:38.030> one<00:04:38.240> more

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
but we talked about that one more

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.280 
but we talked about that one more
already<00:04:39.550> but<00:04:40.550> also<00:04:40.729> in<00:04:41.270> terms<00:04:41.600> of<00:04:41.780> benefits

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
already but also in terms of benefits

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.980 
already but also in terms of benefits
for<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.590> back<00:04:42.890> each<00:04:43.310> rib<00:04:43.700> comes<00:04:44.060> up<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.510> joins

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
for the back each rib comes up and joins

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.270 
for the back each rib comes up and joins
and<00:04:45.410> where<00:04:46.100> two<00:04:46.310> vertebrae<00:04:46.820> join<00:04:47.810> together

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
and where two vertebrae join together

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.790 
and where two vertebrae join together
and<00:04:49.330> form<00:04:50.330> a<00:04:50.419> joint<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:53.690> rib<00:04:54.290> comes<00:04:54.620> up

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
and form a joint and the rib comes up

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.320 
and form a joint and the rib comes up
and<00:04:55.010> joins<00:04:55.220> right<00:04:55.580> in<00:04:55.760> between<00:04:56.090> them<00:04:56.300> so

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
and joins right in between them so

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.870 
and joins right in between them so
there's<00:04:56.600> actually<00:04:56.960> three<00:04:57.260> joints

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
there's actually three joints

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.550 
there's actually three joints
articulating<00:04:58.880> with<00:04:58.970> each<00:04:59.120> other<00:04:59.360> at<00:04:59.960> every

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
articulating with each other at every

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.000 
articulating with each other at every
rib<00:05:00.919> head<00:05:01.160> so<00:05:02.150> if<00:05:02.330> you<00:05:02.450> get<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.870> tension<00:05:03.770> in<00:05:03.890> the

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
rib head so if you get a tension in the

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.560 
rib head so if you get a tension in the
ribs<00:05:04.220> where<00:05:04.520> they're<00:05:04.669> holding<00:05:05.090> and<00:05:05.360> they're

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
ribs where they're holding and they're

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.610 
ribs where they're holding and they're
not<00:05:06.490> using<00:05:07.490> the<00:05:08.450> mobility<00:05:09.020> of<00:05:09.050> those<00:05:09.350> joints

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
not using the mobility of those joints

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.800 
not using the mobility of those joints
well<00:05:09.919> and<00:05:10.490> they<00:05:10.760> get<00:05:10.940> stagnant<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:11.570> stuck

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
well and they get stagnant and stuck

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.540 
well and they get stagnant and stuck
over<00:05:12.080> time<00:05:12.260> and<00:05:12.530> they<00:05:12.590> can<00:05:12.800> have<00:05:12.979> chiropractic

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
over time and they can have chiropractic

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.460 
over time and they can have chiropractic
issues<00:05:13.790> too<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.150> actually<00:05:14.270> get<00:05:14.630> subluxation

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
issues too and actually get subluxation

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.730 
issues too and actually get subluxation
but<00:05:15.860> even<00:05:16.070> if<00:05:16.190> they<00:05:16.310> don't<00:05:16.690> aren't<00:05:17.690> out<00:05:18.020> per<00:05:18.530> se

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
but even if they don't aren't out per se

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.200 
but even if they don't aren't out per se
in<00:05:19.070> a<00:05:19.130> rib<00:05:19.340> they<00:05:19.700> can<00:05:19.940> just<00:05:20.150> be

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
in a rib they can just be

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.600 
in a rib they can just be
reduce<00:05:23.169> range<00:05:23.499> of<00:05:23.710> motion<00:05:24.069> and<00:05:24.369> then<00:05:24.490> the

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
reduce range of motion and then the

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.629 
reduce range of motion and then the
tissues<00:05:24.969> all<00:05:25.150> around<00:05:25.479> that<00:05:25.809> joint<00:05:26.080> get<00:05:26.639> more

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
tissues all around that joint get more

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.059 
tissues all around that joint get more
of<00:05:27.759> a<00:05:27.909> tension<00:05:28.539> holding<00:05:28.900> pattern<00:05:29.349> and<00:05:29.589> then<00:05:29.680> we

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
of a tension holding pattern and then we

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:31.609 
of a tension holding pattern and then we
talked<00:05:30.339> about<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:30.639> circulation<00:05:31.300> circulation

00:05:31.609 --> 00:05:31.619 
talked about the circulation circulation

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:33.540 
talked about the circulation circulation
decreases<00:05:32.619> because<00:05:32.740> the<00:05:32.889> movements<00:05:33.399> not

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
decreases because the movements not

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.850 
decreases because the movements not
happening<00:05:34.059> and<00:05:34.409> that's<00:05:35.409> going<00:05:35.619> to<00:05:35.680> be

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
happening and that's going to be

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.249 
happening and that's going to be
affecting<00:05:36.279> the<00:05:36.490> spine<00:05:36.939> then<00:05:37.210> and<00:05:37.779> that's<00:05:37.990> also

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
affecting the spine then and that's also

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.290 
affecting the spine then and that's also
ready<00:05:38.529> to<00:05:38.680> room<00:05:38.889> close<00:05:39.279> it<00:05:39.490> without<00:05:39.729> a<00:05:39.909> big<00:05:40.149> the

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
ready to room close it without a big the

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.159 
ready to room close it without a big the

ability to round up oh yeah yeah and and

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.689 
ability to round up oh yeah yeah and and
it<00:05:47.169> also<00:05:47.319> affects<00:05:47.529> all<00:05:47.860> the<00:05:48.009> nerves<00:05:48.219> coming<00:05:48.550> at

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
because the nerves are coming out of the

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.489 
because the nerves are coming out of the
spine<00:05:50.169> in<00:05:50.469> those<00:05:50.710> same<00:05:50.919> areas<00:05:52.409> serving<00:05:53.409> the
