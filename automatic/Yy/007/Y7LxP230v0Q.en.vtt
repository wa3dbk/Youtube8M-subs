00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
yeah absolutely before and during

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.549 
yeah absolutely before and during
exercise<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.270> one<00:00:39.540> category<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.200> after

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
exercise is one category and after

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.590 
exercise is one category and after
exercises<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> other<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.239> first<00:00:42.480> thing

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
exercises the other and the first thing

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.940 
exercises the other and the first thing
I<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> say<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.440> when<00:00:43.649> most<00:00:43.829> people

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
I like to say is this when most people

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.130 
I like to say is this when most people
think<00:00:44.190> about<00:00:44.460> sport<00:00:45.000> nutrition<00:00:45.539> they<00:00:45.899> think

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
think about sport nutrition they think

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.630 
think about sport nutrition they think
about<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> Olympians<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.309> pro

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
about the Olympians and the pro

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.220 
about the Olympians and the pro
basketball<00:00:47.850> players<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.510> baseball<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
basketball players in baseball and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.869 
basketball players in baseball and
hockey<00:00:49.350> or<00:00:49.649> whatever<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.520> not<00:00:50.700> just

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
hockey or whatever and it's not just

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.580 
hockey or whatever and it's not just
about<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.629> like<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.870> think<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.469> as

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
about that we like to think of it as

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.069 
about that we like to think of it as
exercise<00:00:52.940> nutrition<00:00:53.940> because<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:54.899> what

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
exercise nutrition because really what

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.510 
exercise nutrition because really what
these<00:00:55.199> athletes<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.710> doing<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.250> fueling

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
these athletes are doing is just fueling

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.130 
these athletes are doing is just fueling
they're<00:00:56.789> exercising<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.629> recovering<00:00:58.050> from

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
they're exercising and recovering from

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.380 
they're exercising and recovering from
their<00:00:58.350> exercise<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.640> anyone<00:01:00.180> who

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
their exercise just like anyone who

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.180 
their exercise just like anyone who
would<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.690> go<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> gym<00:01:01.109> or<00:01:01.530> go<00:01:01.680> for<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> run

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
would just go to the gym or go for a run

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.310 
would just go to the gym or go for a run
so<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> idea<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.629> use<00:01:03.870> some<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.170> those

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
so the idea is we can use some of those

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.800 
so the idea is we can use some of those
