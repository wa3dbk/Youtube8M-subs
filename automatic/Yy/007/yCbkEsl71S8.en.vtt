00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
 although anyway again two games where Strobel after the 3 3 in Essen now so well 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.640
 With 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.049
 looking for 3 so far, the colorful Janko has come back again and again 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.150
 but the pressure is getting bigger now 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.869
 where that is from game goals of 7 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.179
 getting closer 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.630
 and to have the break that has too 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.179
 Just shown this game is just a Moammar advantage 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.499
 if you can then create a Hanau game so 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.860
 Kick off path can shoot 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.360
 the 1 is dropped it is now as on the 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.920
 Sawai the blue ball 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.920
 and there he has a problem 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.860
 two obscured he plays a push loud 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.650
 7 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.470
 and the lifted 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.890
 can now decide anywhere he enough guest or set balls 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.590
 Nonsense you have done well 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.760
 If you prefer to continue playing, that's exactly what he chooses because he's the one to two 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.760
 Of course, it does not get up 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.790
 yes and is complicated 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.070
 therefore 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.070
 also expensive toll 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:15.339
 for Dennis Euro Cologne now twice the time 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:22.519
 8th 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.419
 I'm not at the start 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.419
 wanted to refuel at the Campari Qiang Koebnick 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.639
 Qiagen big sees there's something else 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.639
 from the blue 2 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.639
 WoW that's a very small off affair 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.019
 more relaxed than in court 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:41.339
 Rise in the first row close enough of this 2's to work 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.129
 Of course it worked 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.779
 here in this game, however, the ball did not spread so well 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.710
 like in the game before 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.319
 So that's a bit more work 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.319
 for Dennis ob Couleur 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.680
 the ball has to go far enough into the table with it 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.680
 brown 7 gets 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.919
 he just has to play on the corner points so he can 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.919
 come to 8 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.819
 Jam without has protected itself from it 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.989
 has concentrated the filing at Roche 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.529
 and there he goes 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:35.529
 the brown ball coach in front of the hole 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.219
 in the long bank 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.180
 Nokian cool now just needs to say thank you 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.099
 because the bigger problems on the table 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:54.589
 she already has Dennis Euro Colo 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:57.589
 solved for him 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.740
 yes, you should not underestimate such a ball now either 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.980
 and he has not done anything he allows himself small mistakes 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.169
 down there metro keep the act lying on the floor shorten this one 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:52.949
 the idea of ​​this colo on 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:57.300
 come to five Karajan he sits his countryman so 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:01.680
 continue to win in the neck area unimportant game 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:06.379
 for Doreen here at the head here in this semi-final 

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:10.110
 is definitely 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.309
 open to the eye on the coach protocol gate
