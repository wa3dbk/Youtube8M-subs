so it's not too boring but basically

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.320 
so it's not too boring but basically
what<00:05:47.660> i<00:05:47.720> did<00:05:47.930> was<00:05:48.020> i<00:05:48.169> I<00:05:48.410> gem<00:05:49.220> rushed<00:05:49.610> mecha<00:05:50.090> man

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
what i did was i I gem rushed mecha man

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.050 
what i did was i I gem rushed mecha man
then<00:05:50.510> I<00:05:50.539> saw<00:05:50.720> this<00:05:50.930> disaster<00:05:51.620> here<00:05:51.889> too<00:05:52.099> and

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
then I saw this disaster here too and

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.320 
then I saw this disaster here too and
and<00:05:53.830> basically<00:05:54.830> farmed<00:05:55.550> a<00:05:55.639> bunch<00:05:55.820> of<00:05:55.910> gold<00:05:56.150> so

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
and basically farmed a bunch of gold so

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.790 
and basically farmed a bunch of gold so
that<00:05:56.450> I<00:05:56.479> could<00:05:56.570> afford<00:05:56.750> some<00:05:57.260> of<00:05:57.349> those<00:05:57.440> gold

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
that I could afford some of those gold

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.950 
that I could afford some of those gold
and<00:05:58.099> then<00:05:58.190> all<00:05:58.900> 1485<00:05:59.900> gems<00:06:00.560> all<00:06:01.450> mecha<00:06:02.450> man<00:06:02.780> up

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
and then all 1485 gems all mecha man up

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.589 
and then all 1485 gems all mecha man up
to<00:06:03.110> five<00:06:03.500> which<00:06:04.010> opens<00:06:04.460> up<00:06:04.550> ornithopter<00:06:05.240> one

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:05.599 
to five which opens up ornithopter one

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.390 
to five which opens up ornithopter one
which<00:06:05.840> gives<00:06:06.050> you<00:06:06.139> like<00:06:06.289> a<00:06:06.320> double<00:06:06.800> might<00:06:07.070> hit

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
which gives you like a double might hit

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.950 
which gives you like a double might hit
so<00:06:08.090> there<00:06:08.270> i'm<00:06:08.360> at<00:06:08.479> 38<00:06:10.060> 407<00:06:11.060> and<00:06:11.210> I<00:06:11.450> sorta

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
so there i'm at 38 407 and I sorta

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.040 
so there i'm at 38 407 and I sorta
cheated<00:06:12.410> by<00:06:12.620> Jim<00:06:13.010> rushing<00:06:13.460> magic<00:06:14.120> like

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
cheated by Jim rushing magic like

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.409 
cheated by Jim rushing magic like
disaster<00:06:15.530> three<00:06:16.280> I<00:06:16.310> think<00:06:16.700> was<00:06:16.849> in<00:06:17.030> there<00:06:17.060> too

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
disaster three I think was in there too

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.300 
disaster three I think was in there too
and<00:06:17.889> mecha<00:06:18.889> mensa<00:06:19.490> sort<00:06:19.729> of<00:06:19.820> a<00:06:20.020> inglorious

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
and mecha mensa sort of a inglorious

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.270 
and mecha mensa sort of a inglorious
ending<00:06:22.310> to<00:06:22.610> all<00:06:22.639> of<00:06:22.970> that<00:06:23.000> but<00:06:23.800> it<00:06:24.800> says<00:06:25.099> I

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
ending to all of that but it says I

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.190 
ending to all of that but it says I
could<00:06:25.340> have<00:06:25.669> leveled<00:06:26.000> up<00:06:26.060> that<00:06:26.270> Cupid<00:06:26.780> they

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
could have leveled up that Cupid they

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.200 
could have leveled up that Cupid they
get<00:06:27.349> another<00:06:27.590> hundred<00:06:27.919> might<00:06:28.220> 20<00:06:28.970> levels

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
get another hundred might 20 levels

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.020 
get another hundred might 20 levels
times<00:06:29.690> 5<00:06:29.960> might<00:06:30.260> per<00:06:30.500> level<00:06:30.710> on<00:06:31.010> legendary<00:06:31.370> and

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
times 5 might per level on legendary and

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.700 
times 5 might per level on legendary and
I<00:06:32.120> could<00:06:32.360> have<00:06:32.450> brought<00:06:32.570> his<00:06:32.750> ability<00:06:33.229> up<00:06:33.380> but

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
I could have brought his ability up but

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.990 
I could have brought his ability up but
you<00:06:34.070> know<00:06:34.159> that<00:06:34.370> probably<00:06:34.550> would<00:06:34.789> have<00:06:34.849> taken

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
you know that probably would have taken

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.300 
you know that probably would have taken
a<00:06:35.210> few<00:06:35.390> more<00:06:35.539> days<00:06:35.780> just<00:06:36.409> to<00:06:36.469> get<00:06:36.650> the<00:06:36.860> Erie

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
a few more days just to get the Erie

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.959 
a few more days just to get the Erie
monster<00:06:37.700> runs<00:06:37.940> in<00:06:38.150> and<00:06:38.300> whatnot

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:38.969 
monster runs in and whatnot

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:42.759 
monster runs in and whatnot
so<00:06:39.839> I<00:06:39.869> just<00:06:40.289> didn't<00:06:40.619> feel<00:06:40.919> like<00:06:40.949> that<00:06:41.189> was<00:06:41.489> a

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:42.769 
so I just didn't feel like that was a

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:45.729 
so I just didn't feel like that was a
good<00:06:43.769> option<00:06:44.009> because<00:06:44.279> I<00:06:44.729> am<00:06:44.969> extremely

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:45.739 
good option because I am extremely

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:51.259 
good option because I am extremely
impatient<00:06:47.269> as<00:06:48.269> you<00:06:49.169> know<00:06:49.789> that's<00:06:50.789> why<00:06:50.999> i<00:06:51.029> use

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:51.269 
impatient as you know that's why i use

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:53.449 
impatient as you know that's why i use
frenzy<00:06:51.869> so<00:06:52.049> much<00:06:52.229> in<00:06:52.409> dungeons<00:06:52.829> not<00:06:53.039> because<00:06:53.429> i

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:53.459 
frenzy so much in dungeons not because i

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:58.579 
frenzy so much in dungeons not because i
have<00:06:53.819> to<00:06:54.089> but<00:06:54.389> just<00:06:54.719> because<00:06:55.049> I<00:06:55.709> can<00:06:57.199> sew<00:06:58.199> and

00:06:58.579 --> 00:06:58.589 
have to but just because I can sew and

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:00.109 
have to but just because I can sew and
you<00:06:58.709> know<00:06:58.799> I<00:06:58.829> noticed<00:06:59.219> it<00:06:59.339> here<00:06:59.459> I<00:06:59.519> got<00:06:59.759> four

00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:00.119 
you know I noticed it here I got four

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:02.149 
you know I noticed it here I got four
out<00:07:00.239> of<00:07:00.269> five<00:07:00.599> here<00:07:00.899> I<00:07:00.929> want<00:07:01.199> to<00:07:01.289> say<00:07:01.529> I<00:07:01.739> think<00:07:01.860> I

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:02.159 
out of five here I want to say I think I

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:04.969 
out of five here I want to say I think I
lost<00:07:02.309> one<00:07:02.789> of<00:07:02.819> these<00:07:03.059> is<00:07:03.479> my<00:07:03.539> first<00:07:04.139> 5s<00:07:04.709> Duke

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 
lost one of these is my first 5s Duke

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:07.129 
lost one of these is my first 5s Duke
the<00:07:05.189> real<00:07:05.429> reason<00:07:05.819> you<00:07:05.939> farm<00:07:06.239> up<00:07:06.419> loop<00:07:06.629> is<00:07:06.869> so

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 
the real reason you farm up loop is so

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:08.979 
the real reason you farm up loop is so
you<00:07:07.229> can<00:07:07.379> do<00:07:07.529> better<00:07:07.709> in<00:07:08.009> the<00:07:08.159> arena<00:07:08.549> and

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:08.989 
you can do better in the arena and

00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:11.449 
you can do better in the arena and
there's<00:07:09.989> going<00:07:10.169> to<00:07:10.259> be<00:07:10.289> I<00:07:10.439> think<00:07:10.559> one<00:07:11.099> match

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:11.459 
there's going to be I think one match

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:13.699 
there's going to be I think one match
here<00:07:11.969> probably<00:07:12.389> that<00:07:12.959> one<00:07:13.199> where<00:07:13.469> I<00:07:13.499> just

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:13.709
