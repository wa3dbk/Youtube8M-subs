00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.660
 this time we will learn to play 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.580
 the manson theme in health which I give you 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.900
 makes a somewhat atypical video lesson 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.209
 what we have been seeing now since 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.760
 he still knows a lot chord okay we're going to 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:21.150
 forget about power chords version 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.300
 in acoustic the first riff we started to 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.520
 suspended second and we alternated with 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.529
 a to minor the only thing that we have to 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.770
 do is fingers two and three is worth after 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.620
 32 of the strings 3 and 4 and the finger 1 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.120
 serves to hammer one of the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.120
 two rope that will give us the lowest 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.710
 it seems here we do it a couple of times 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.250
 We got the sun if we transition 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.250
 cost 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.470
 the first the first strum we can 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.350
 do in gel we can do it only with 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.540
 fingers 1 and 2 positioned is worth as 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.640
 you already know fret 2 of the string 5 fret 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.340
 3 of the string 6 and then we put the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.310
 finger 4 on the fret 1 on the fret 3 of 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.150
 according to that same thing we do it again 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.290
 what happens that we finished has suspended 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.100
 second 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.100
 to see see 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.689
 twice to the suspended second and 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.689
 we go to the minor 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.410
 and this is a valhondo c 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:06.940
 efe funk to get my recommendation 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:11.230
 in this topic but one traded from 1 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.020
 frets 1 of the agreement to 1 2 and 3 of 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.850
 2 2 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.490
 in fret 2 of rope 3 and 2 3 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.140
 in fret 3 of the rope 4 is worth this 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.140
 it is one of the forms of that reason 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.720
 because from here we go to do as the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.769
 we take out then these two fingers raise one 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.299
 rope each one and this one goes to the bottom 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.580
 one of the two rope is worth the 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.900
 shorter travel to spend a fret 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.900
 of a comma 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.069
 and to finish this corner this same 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.200
 position of the fingers that is the two 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.610
 we went down to fret three the finger one and the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.850
 two others we keep it to the same 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.850
 distance 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.840
 and that's a g7 minus 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.670
 after this we in a couple of 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.490
 Sometimes the two parties are two 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.190
 Longest of 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.630
 of the subject and then comes some kind of 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.820
 point and the point I will explain 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.100
 but before that just tell you that 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.750
 come a succession of chords 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.400
 repetitive four chords four 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.400
 good times starts with a lower 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.480
 and then it comes with a scene 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.540
 and then with a lower value 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.670
 gimeno although it is the only one that happens 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.270
 we have seen so far after 32 of 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.300
 the strings 5 ​​and 4 and fret 1 of the 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:53.130
 rope 3 is like it was minor but going up 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:57.390
 the little fingers is worth it 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:00.660
 this risk I repeat again at lower g 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.090
 efe minor has a point and I can 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.400
 leave them from the placed ones worth the finger 1 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.850
 we put it on the 8th fret of the rope 1 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.700
 finger 3 on the fret 10 of the rope 2 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.030
 and finger 2 on the fret 9 of the string 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.030
 3 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.979
 alright then here is a small 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.140
 with this small contribution that the dream that 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.980
 is with the four finger hammer the fret 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.980
 10 of the rope 1 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.069
 and that I do at the end of the river 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.599
 it something good what you understood this 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.639
 is in the shadow of dead marilin menson 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.110
 I do not expect that I have served you 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.699
 it became clear the truth is that explain 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.389
 the subject of chords happens we do not know 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:12.610
 You give me expressly well but good yet 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.130
 so after forever I hope you like it 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.870
 criticize and insult do what you give 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.400
 win for you not to stop visiting life 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.400
 to the sky dotcom greetings
