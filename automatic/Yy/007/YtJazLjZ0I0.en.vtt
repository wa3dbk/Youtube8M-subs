other as the 8-pin 12-volt power uses

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.410 
other as the 8-pin 12-volt power uses
two<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.999> them<00:00:51.149> i'll<00:00:51.359> be<00:00:51.629> using<00:00:51.870> both<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.499> them

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
two of them i'll be using both of them

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.579 
two of them i'll be using both of them
save<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.629> earth<00:00:54.659> or<00:00:55.050> supplies<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.010> then

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
save my earth or supplies that and then

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.059 
save my earth or supplies that and then
you<00:00:58.589> get<00:00:58.940> EVGA<00:00:59.940> x58<00:01:00.659> three<00:01:01.469> at<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.769> light

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:02.069 
you get EVGA x58 three at the light

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:08.420 
you get EVGA x58 three at the light
classified<00:01:02.699> limited<00:01:03.629> edition<00:01:05.780> number<00:01:06.780> 71<00:01:07.740> so

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
classified limited edition number 71 so

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.600 
classified limited edition number 71 so
I<00:01:08.460> guess<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.329> is<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.570> number<00:01:10.439> 71<00:01:11.130> motherboard

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
I guess this is a number 71 motherboard

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:21.340 
I guess this is a number 71 motherboard
I'm<00:01:14.610> especially<00:01:14.969> showing<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:18.439> so<00:01:19.439> yeah
