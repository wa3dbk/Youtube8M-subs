00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:39.309
 let's send the xbox the first let's talk about the 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:44.129
 count of monet an uncomfortable boys 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:50.109
 we must specify that it is mine, however 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:53.309
 convention or you need manual 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:57.629
 then we see that there is education 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.629
 usual shit from those who do not read anyone 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.600
 bof the ass here I expect to spell out 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.590
 that I took the efforts of the train menu 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.690
 for the game but because the sticker is cool 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.510
 that is out there now I want to see here 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.880
 but let's get out but let's go and see 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.600
 after this he recalled especially the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.950
 scotch gabbo hands and game play 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.970
 in Italian a fuck it is not the game 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.920
 there are codes for women that they are 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.280
 the avatar 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:37.409
 male avatar female the gray avatar 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:41.810
 now I don't know what the fuck is going here 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.810
 both while the double bottom is the ship 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.490
 nor to see here are two joysticks e 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.240
 of the new ones that are raised 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.350
 listicket joypad not joystick for ipad 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.840
 sorry roby look here it's good to see 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.630
 it sucks if they pull these on me 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:07.910
 it seems that it is done with the fake steel of 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:13.440
 they break or turn here turns 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:15.660
 fade away there are two so following 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.110
 as a joystick it's not really nice now 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.440
 aesthetically beautiful 4 I spoke the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.750
 then institutional friends phenomenon 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.120

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.709
 mainly with code 2 jersey has 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.570
 said here is the power supply but because it is 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.880
 a little bit of making a box you are with 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.630
 above it goes from the face of all times 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:44.640
 here are the headphones with the chat 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:48.090
 vocal and then here there is the cable 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.350
 a cast I call if not by chance they are two 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.260
 hunt the xbox I take it off and made them there 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.359
 enhance this waste 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.079
 oh well, there was not a shit anymore 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:03.989
 look at the smallpox panorama launched 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:07.730
 then we go to the approach 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.190
 which boxes the team that answered 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.010
 the brothel from means cost the little arms 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.670
 maybe in shy meniscus it's ok 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.030
 a bit of advertising taken the world war 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.920

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.879

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.680
 it's not perfect but to see the slim at xbox 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:32.330
 at 320 gb 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.430
 here why not, I don't pay for it 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.500
 on the old play I put it under the play 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.190
 that moment I have it under the sleeve box 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.620

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:47.329
 make the first one is the first one 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.650
 just run here if we have cables here 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.440
 it takes a liberation 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.319
 the optical cable then there is the dmi water and the 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.590
 component that should be yes va well 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:01.040
 we understood here it took it 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.030
 ethernet and what are the usb ports then 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:13.069
 here we have that really puts it 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:17.030
 beautiful hangman and almost are others 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:21.079
 usb ports and unfortunately here if we have it 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:24.770
 the ignition button is the compartment of the 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.840
 disc arriving the compartment 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.599
 then later I don't really know how that is 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.320
 it turns on but I only know that there and there is the 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:37.070
 bottoncino quacks turns to 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.660
 already perfect little button should 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.599
 almost oh well there are the vents and 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.190

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.900
 nothing to do will heat up party if 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.979
 here is the shoot yourself as you see call of 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.470

 as you can see guys just with him tmv 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.720
 including from what I understand when 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.160
 turn on makes the sound of the earth viewer 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.990
 it seems to me when it turns on that 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.310
 duty 4 then when it opens though 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.400
 open the disk compartment makes another 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.610
 sound that being less girl yes 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.170

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.920
 video course in the next I'll show you 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.540
 however, some of the sounds it makes you know 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.720
 even when it happens from the outside they seem 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.880
 have understood perfectly 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.220
 there is the cultured vargas base knife 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:35.400
 you have even seen me before him before I 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:44.320
 good for use more you can see a little 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:45.880
 a use fluctuated enough to play at 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.160
 empty 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.860

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.900

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.540
 add all the gentlemen why 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.970
