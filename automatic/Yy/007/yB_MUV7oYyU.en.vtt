actually learned that there are a lot of
things<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.150> we<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.450> chasing<00:01:00.989> these

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
things that we do here chasing these

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.650 
things that we do here chasing these
cutthroat<00:01:01.800> trout<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.820> translate<00:01:03.450> to

cutthroat trout that translate to

cutthroat trout that translate to
saltwater<00:01:04.640> now<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.000> those<00:01:06.119> things<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
saltwater now one of those things is the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.690 
saltwater now one of those things is the
accuracy<00:01:06.990> cast<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.680> it's<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.979> cast<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.460> don't

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
accuracy cast and it's a cast I don't

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.070 
accuracy cast and it's a cast I don't
think<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.940> lot<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.210> saltwater<00:01:09.479> anglers<00:01:09.930> do

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
think a lot of saltwater anglers do

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.109 
think a lot of saltwater anglers do
particularly<00:01:10.619> well<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.759> cast

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
particularly well but it is a cast

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.060 
particularly well but it is a cast
you're<00:01:12.360> going<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.660> need<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.020> many<00:01:13.320> situations

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you're going to need in many situations

you're going to need in many situations
on<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> salt<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.240> want<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.479> offer<00:01:15.690> a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
on the salt so I just want to offer a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.690 
on the salt so I just want to offer a
few<00:01:16.110> tips<00:01:16.410> that<00:01:16.650> might<00:01:17.040> help<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.400> get<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> more

few tips that might help you get a more

few tips that might help you get a more
accurate<00:01:17.970> cast<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.259> present<00:01:19.830> flies<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.400> a

accurate cast and to present flies at a
shorter<00:01:20.850> distance<00:01:21.240> than<00:01:21.330> most<00:01:21.570> saltwater

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
shorter distance than most saltwater

anglers<00:01:22.410> are<00:01:22.560> used<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.090> now<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> saltwater

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
anglers are used to now as a saltwater

anglers are used to now as a saltwater
angler<00:01:25.200> generally<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.190> would<00:01:26.340> cast<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
angler generally we would cast with the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.050 
angler generally we would cast with the
rod<00:01:27.630> tilted<00:01:28.050> out<00:01:28.170> at<00:01:28.350> 45<00:01:28.860> degrees<00:01:29.310> off<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
rod tilted out at 45 degrees off the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.710 
rod tilted out at 45 degrees off the
side<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.660> the<00:01:30.720> body<00:01:31.100> like<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.390> it's<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.509> great

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
side of the body like this it's a great

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.950 
side of the body like this it's a great
way<00:01:33.899> to<00:01:33.930> love<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.470> decent<00:01:35.160> hunker<00:01:35.490> line<00:01:35.840> not<00:01:36.840> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
way to love it decent hunker line not to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
way to love it decent hunker line not to
use<00:01:37.140> too<00:01:37.170> much<00:01:37.590> muscle<00:01:38.010> memory<00:01:38.490> or<00:01:38.640> muscles

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
use too much muscle memory or muscles

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.450 
use too much muscle memory or muscles
it's<00:01:39.330> relaxed<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.590> also<00:01:40.710> good<00:01:41.070> when<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
it's relaxed it's also good when the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.670 
it's relaxed it's also good when the
wind<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.120> your<00:01:42.300> casting<00:01:42.720> shoulder<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
wind is on your casting shoulder it's a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.830 
wind is on your casting shoulder it's a
great<00:01:43.920> cast<00:01:44.190> generally<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:45.330> thing<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.690> isn't

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
great cast generally one thing it isn't

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.920 
great cast generally one thing it isn't
is<00:01:46.260> extremely<00:01:47.040> accurate<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.390> reason<00:01:48.750> is

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
is extremely accurate and the reason is

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.500 
is extremely accurate and the reason is
if<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.560> tilt<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.920> rod<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.280> at<00:01:50.460> an<00:01:50.520> angle<00:01:50.850> then

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
if you tilt the rod out at an angle then

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.870 
if you tilt the rod out at an angle then
the<00:01:51.990> line<00:01:52.260> and<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.620> leader<00:01:52.830> will<00:01:53.250> kick<00:01:53.520> around

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the line and the leader will kick around

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.030 
the line and the leader will kick around
at<00:01:54.090> an<00:01:54.210> angle<00:01:54.510> when<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.260> cast<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.710> finished

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
at an angle when the cast is finished

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.440 
at an angle when the cast is finished
and<00:01:56.280> you've<00:01:56.549> probably<00:01:56.729> noticed<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.299> before

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and you've probably noticed that before

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.210 
and you've probably noticed that before
the<00:01:57.840> actual<00:01:58.110> leader<00:01:58.350> will<00:01:58.560> kick<00:01:58.740> round<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
the actual leader will kick round to the

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.520 
the actual leader will kick round to the
side<00:01:59.400> that's<00:01:59.970> not<00:02:00.210> very<00:02:00.450> accurate<00:02:00.659> what<00:02:01.380> we

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
side that's not very accurate what we

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.380 
side that's not very accurate what we
need<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.670> try<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:02.970> get<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> loop

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
need to do is to try and get the loop

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
path that way when the fly kicks out it

kicks out in a straight path the way to

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.680 
kicks out in a straight path the way to
achieve<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.549> rather<00:02:17.970> than<00:02:18.120> turning<00:02:18.450> side

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
achieve that is rather than turning side

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.500 
achieve that is rather than turning side
on<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:19.560> try<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:19.890> rotate<00:02:20.220> our<00:02:20.400> body<00:02:20.640> around<00:02:20.970> so

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
on we try and rotate our body around so

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.390 
on we try and rotate our body around so
the<00:02:21.660> chest<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.080> forward<00:02:22.320> now<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:22.980> can<00:02:23.160> stand

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
the chest is forward now you can stand

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.039

doesn't<00:02:25.080> matter<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.100> need<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.340> try<00:02:26.549> and

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
doesn't matter but you need to try and

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.610 
doesn't matter but you need to try and
bring<00:02:26.790> your<00:02:26.880> body<00:02:27.060> more<00:02:27.269> forward<00:02:27.380> now<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.470> one

thing<00:02:28.799> we<00:02:28.950> need<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.280> do<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.670> line<00:02:29.880> up<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.209> rod

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
thing we need to do is line up the rod

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.350 
thing we need to do is line up the rod
and<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.140> line<00:02:31.380> with<00:02:31.830> our<00:02:31.950> line<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.340> sight<00:02:32.580> you

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
and the line with our line of sight you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.449 
and the line with our line of sight you
don't<00:02:33.570> fire<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> gun<00:02:34.080> out<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:35.160> bring<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
don't fire a gun out here you bring the

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.890 
don't fire a gun out here you bring the
gun<00:02:35.580> up<00:02:35.760> where<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.269> actually<00:02:36.420> look<00:02:36.660> down

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
gun up where you can actually look down

gun up where you can actually look down
the<00:02:37.049> side<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:37.890> no<00:02:38.070> different<00:02:39.019> my

you<00:02:43.060> put<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.450> camera<00:02:43.750> on<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.349> he<00:02:45.040> always<00:02:45.220> does

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
you put a camera on and he always does

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.070 
you put a camera on and he always does
this<00:02:45.760> never<00:02:46.060> catches<00:02:46.330> anything<00:02:46.750> when<00:02:46.989> the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
this never catches anything when the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.759 
this never catches anything when the
cameras<00:02:47.409> off

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
cameras off

anyhow<00:02:48.370> we'll<00:02:48.970> get<00:02:49.120> back<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.420> our<00:02:49.569> tips<00:02:50.370> so

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
anyhow we'll get back to our tips so

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.869 
anyhow we'll get back to our tips so
anyhow<00:02:52.830> what<00:02:53.830> we<00:02:53.950> want<00:02:54.129> to<00:02:54.220> do<00:02:54.340> is<00:02:54.549> bring<00:02:54.760> the

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
anyhow what we want to do is bring the

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.520 
anyhow what we want to do is bring the
rod<00:02:55.090> up<00:02:55.269> into<00:02:55.569> our<00:02:55.690> line<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:56.019> sight<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.409> the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
rod up into our line of sight and the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.220 
rod up into our line of sight and the
way<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.250> do<00:02:57.519> that<00:02:57.700> is<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.480> actually<00:02:58.629> do<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.019> thing

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
way to do that is to actually do a thing

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.470 
way to do that is to actually do a thing
I<00:02:59.319> call<00:02:59.500> triangulation<00:03:00.340> where<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:01.060> wrist<00:03:01.269> and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
I call triangulation where the wrist and

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.289 
I call triangulation where the wrist and
reel<00:03:01.690> your<00:03:02.590> eyes<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.280> your<00:03:03.579> elbow<00:03:03.879> create<00:03:04.269> a

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
reel your eyes and your elbow create a

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.479 
reel your eyes and your elbow create a
triangle<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.049> the<00:03:05.709> cast<00:03:05.950> looks<00:03:06.220> somewhat

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
triangle and the cast looks somewhat

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.839 
triangle and the cast looks somewhat
like<00:03:06.700> this<00:03:07.349> what<00:03:08.349> I'm<00:03:08.470> doing<00:03:08.829> is<00:03:09.489> watching

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
like this what I'm doing is watching

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.149 
like this what I'm doing is watching
straight<00:03:10.390> down<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:10.750> path<00:03:10.959> of<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.290> line<00:03:11.500> so<00:03:12.129> I

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
straight down the path of the line so I

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.550 
straight down the path of the line so I
can<00:03:12.400> watch<00:03:12.879> the<00:03:13.120> loop<00:03:13.299> unfilter<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.140> target

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
can watch the loop unfilter the target

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.990 
can watch the loop unfilter the target
and<00:03:14.709> that's<00:03:14.859> what<00:03:15.040> fly<00:03:15.220> casting<00:03:15.609> is<00:03:15.790> it's

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
and that's what fly casting is it's

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.530 
and that's what fly casting is it's
unrolling<00:03:16.599> a<00:03:16.959> loop<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.500> target<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.329> couple<00:03:19.329> of

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
unrolling a loop to a target a couple of

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.650 
unrolling a loop to a target a couple of
key<00:03:19.690> points<00:03:19.959> firstly<00:03:20.799> use<00:03:21.549> your<00:03:21.760> elbow<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.269> get

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
key points firstly use your elbow to get

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.569 
key points firstly use your elbow to get
power<00:03:22.930> in<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.230> cast<00:03:23.470> if<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.829> need<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.190> it

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
power in the cast if you need it it

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.240 
power in the cast if you need it it
gives<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.090> straighter<00:03:25.629> stronger<00:03:26.260> cast<00:03:26.920> as

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
gives you a straighter stronger cast as

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.099 
gives you a straighter stronger cast as
well<00:03:27.400> if<00:03:27.879> you<00:03:27.970> just<00:03:28.180> use<00:03:28.390> your<00:03:28.569> wrist<00:03:28.780> there's

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
well if you just use your wrist there's

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.830 
well if you just use your wrist there's
a<00:03:29.200> tendency<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:29.950> dip<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.400> back<00:03:30.549> cast<00:03:30.819> by<00:03:31.510> using

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
a tendency to dip the back cast by using

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.440 
a tendency to dip the back cast by using
your<00:03:31.959> elbow<00:03:32.290> we<00:03:32.769> actually<00:03:33.129> push<00:03:33.790> up<00:03:34.000> with<00:03:34.359> the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
your elbow we actually push up with the

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.849 
your elbow we actually push up with the
tip<00:03:34.629> of<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.810> rod<00:03:34.959> there's<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.349> slight<00:03:35.650> upward

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
tip of the rod there's a slight upward

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.430 
tip of the rod there's a slight upward
stab<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.579> then<00:03:37.180> use<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.510> elbow<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.900> come<00:03:38.200> down

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
stab and then use the elbow to come down

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.369 
stab and then use the elbow to come down
now<00:03:39.220> for<00:03:39.459> a<00:03:39.489> short<00:03:39.549> cast<00:03:40.180> we're<00:03:40.840> going<00:03:41.019> to<00:03:41.109> tilt

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
now for a short cast we're going to tilt

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.979 
now for a short cast we're going to tilt
the<00:03:41.799> rod<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:42.640> that<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.970> straight<00:03:43.390> path<00:03:43.659> of<00:03:43.900> the

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
the rod so that the straight path of the

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.089 
the rod so that the straight path of the
rod<00:03:44.170> tip<00:03:44.409> goes<00:03:44.950> down<00:03:45.720> at<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.959> front<00:03:47.169> and<00:03:47.410> very

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
rod tip goes down at the front and very

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.250 
rod tip goes down at the front and very
high<00:03:48.400> at<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.669> back<00:03:48.819> as<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.690> cast<00:03:49.959> gets

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
high at the back as the cast gets

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.199 
high at the back as the cast gets
further<00:03:50.620> from<00:03:50.950> us<00:03:50.980> we're<00:03:51.609> going<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.849> tilt<00:03:52.060> the

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
further from us we're going to tilt the

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.360 
further from us we're going to tilt the
straight<00:03:52.480> line<00:03:52.690> path<00:03:52.989> a<00:03:53.349> little<00:03:54.010> more<00:03:54.160> like

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
straight line path a little more like

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.430 
straight line path a little more like
this<00:03:54.609> so<00:03:54.880> that<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.150> front<00:03:55.329> cast<00:03:55.660> is<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:55.930> little

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
this so that the front cast is a little

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.280 
this so that the front cast is a little
higher<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:58.180> back<00:03:58.359> cast<00:03:58.629> is<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:58.900> little

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
higher and the back cast is a little

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.930 
higher and the back cast is a little
lower<00:03:59.470> so<00:04:00.129> it<00:04:00.250> looks<00:04:00.400> like<00:04:00.579> this<00:04:01.200> long<00:04:02.200> cast

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
lower so it looks like this long cast

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.559 
lower so it looks like this long cast
closer<00:04:04.079> closer<00:04:05.190> closer<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:06.639> this<00:04:07.269> would<00:04:07.450> be

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
closer closer closer and this would be

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.569 
closer closer closer and this would be
the<00:04:07.690> front<00:04:07.870> cast<00:04:08.139> down<00:04:08.440> low<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:08.889> the<00:04:09.430> back

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
the front cast down low and the back

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.550 
the front cast down low and the back
cast<00:04:09.819> up<00:04:10.090> high<00:04:10.299> and<00:04:10.569> it<00:04:10.750> looks<00:04:10.930> like<00:04:11.019> this<00:04:11.349> this

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
cast up high and it looks like this this

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.879 
cast up high and it looks like this this
is<00:04:11.739> about<00:04:11.949> a<00:04:12.010> 20-foot<00:04:12.489> cast<00:04:13.410> high<00:04:14.410> at<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.709> back

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
is about a 20-foot cast high at the back

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.089 
is about a 20-foot cast high at the back
low<00:04:15.310> at<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.579> front<00:04:15.849> as<00:04:16.060> I<00:04:16.449> slip<00:04:16.870> line<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.410> little

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
low at the front as I slip line a little

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.740 
low at the front as I slip line a little
lower<00:04:18.250> at<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.519> back<00:04:18.669> a<00:04:18.910> little<00:04:19.150> higher<00:04:19.419> at<00:04:19.630> the

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
lower at the back a little higher at the

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.860 
lower at the back a little higher at the
front<00:04:19.989> as<00:04:20.229> I<00:04:20.500> slip<00:04:20.889> more<00:04:21.039> line<00:04:21.419> I'm<00:04:22.419> going<00:04:22.780> to

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
front as I slip more line I'm going to

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.990 
front as I slip more line I'm going to
come<00:04:23.289> out<00:04:23.320> a<00:04:23.740> little<00:04:23.949> lower<00:04:24.310> at<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.490> back<00:04:24.699> and

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
come out a little lower at the back and

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.120 
come out a little lower at the back and
a<00:04:25.330> little<00:04:25.360> higher<00:04:25.720> at<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:25.960> front<00:04:26.229> I'm

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
a little higher at the front I'm

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.339 
a little higher at the front I'm
watching<00:04:27.520> down<00:04:27.699> the<00:04:27.910> line<00:04:28.150> I'm<00:04:28.539> unfurling<00:04:29.139> a

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
watching down the line I'm unfurling a

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.140 
watching down the line I'm unfurling a
loop<00:04:29.530> to<00:04:29.680> a<00:04:29.710> target<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:30.310> I'm<00:04:30.610> using<00:04:30.849> a<00:04:30.970> little

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
loop to a target and I'm using a little

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.330 
loop to a target and I'm using a little
bit<00:04:31.270> of<00:04:31.360> elbow<00:04:31.599> to<00:04:31.840> control<00:04:32.289> the<00:04:32.440> cast<00:04:32.680> the

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
bit of elbow to control the cast the

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.120 
bit of elbow to control the cast the
main<00:04:33.580> thing<00:04:33.789> is<00:04:33.910> I'm<00:04:34.090> triangulating<00:04:35.130> and

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
main thing is I'm triangulating and

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.409 
main thing is I'm triangulating and
getting<00:04:36.340> control<00:04:36.699> over<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.090> rod<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.330> the

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
getting control over the rod and the

getting control over the rod and the
line<00:04:37.599> the<00:04:38.080> last<00:04:38.260> point<00:04:38.500> I<00:04:38.620> would<00:04:38.680> add<00:04:38.919> is<00:04:39.130> I'm

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
line the last point I would add is I'm

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.790 
line the last point I would add is I'm
not<00:04:40.060> going<00:04:40.270> to<00:04:40.360> teach<00:04:40.570> you<00:04:40.780> specific<00:04:41.410> ways<00:04:41.590> to

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800

not going to teach you specific ways to
hold<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:42.190> rod<00:04:42.370> there<00:04:42.849> are<00:04:43.030> many<00:04:43.270> ways<00:04:43.449> to<00:04:43.720> do

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
hold the rod there are many ways to do

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.810 
hold the rod there are many ways to do
that<00:04:44.020> with<00:04:44.169> accuracy<00:04:44.530> casting<00:04:45.160> if<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.610> feel

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
that with accuracy casting if you feel

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.189 
that with accuracy casting if you feel
comfortable<00:04:45.970> putting<00:04:46.389> your<00:04:46.630> finger<00:04:46.900> on<00:04:46.930> top

of<00:04:47.349> the<00:04:47.410> rod<00:04:47.560> then<00:04:47.800> do<00:04:47.979> it<00:04:48.130> if<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.610> like

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
of the rod then do it if you like

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.550 
of the rod then do it if you like
turning<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.210> reel<00:04:49.449> to<00:04:49.479> the<00:04:49.720> side<00:04:49.960> then<00:04:50.229> do<00:04:50.409> it

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
turning the reel to the side then do it

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.279 
turning the reel to the side then do it
thumb<00:04:51.159> on<00:04:51.340> top<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:52.120> grip<00:04:52.479> it<00:04:52.659> doesn't<00:04:53.050> matter

we're<00:04:54.860> only<00:04:54.950> casting<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.580> short<00:04:55.820> distance<00:04:56.090> all

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
we're only casting a short distance all

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.840 
we're only casting a short distance all
that<00:04:56.900> matters<00:04:57.200> is<00:04:57.320> accuracy<00:04:57.740> once<00:04:58.490> you<00:04:58.610> get<00:04:58.730> to

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
that matters is accuracy once you get to

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.180 
that matters is accuracy once you get to
the<00:04:58.970> long<00:04:59.210> cast<00:04:59.570> then<00:05:00.290> grip<00:05:00.560> can<00:05:00.740> make<00:05:00.920> a<00:05:00.950> big

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
the long cast then grip can make a big

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.950 
the long cast then grip can make a big
difference<00:05:01.220> just<00:05:01.850> see<00:05:02.540> what's<00:05:02.750> comfortable
