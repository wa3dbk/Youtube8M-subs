00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
get the best possible time and I'm going

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:42.899 
get the best possible time and I'm going
to<00:01:41.380> torque<00:01:41.860> up<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.250> engine<00:01:42.520> just<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.759> little

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
to torque up the engine just a little

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.789 
to torque up the engine just a little
bit<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.119> get<00:01:43.209> that<00:01:43.390> turbo<00:01:43.659> spooling<00:01:44.110> now<00:01:44.619> keep

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
bit to get that turbo spooling now keep

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.350 
bit to get that turbo spooling now keep
in<00:01:44.920> mind<00:01:44.950> we're<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.340> mile<00:01:45.759> above<00:01:46.119> sea<00:01:46.330> level

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
in mind we're a mile above sea level

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.209 
in mind we're a mile above sea level
which<00:01:46.659> means<00:01:46.840> less<00:01:47.079> air<00:01:47.289> density<00:01:47.439> which<00:01:47.950> means

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
which means less air density which means

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.580 
which means less air density which means
about<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.549> second<00:01:49.060> -<00:01:49.299> slower<00:01:49.630> then<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:50.469> would

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
about a second - slower then you would

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.889 
about a second - slower then you would
normally<00:01:50.979> get<00:01:51.159> at<00:01:51.759> sea<00:01:52.060> level<00:01:52.180> so<00:01:52.360> here<00:01:52.689> we<00:01:52.750> go

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
normally get at sea level so here we go

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.830 
normally get at sea level so here we go
yeah<00:01:53.770> there<00:01:54.009> it<00:01:54.100> goes<00:01:54.130> that's<00:01:54.850> good<00:01:55.149> and<00:01:55.420> then

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
yeah there it goes that's good and then

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.810 
yeah there it goes that's good and then
the<00:01:56.079> power<00:01:56.799> and<00:01:57.070> torque<00:01:57.250> just<00:01:57.490> fall<00:01:57.670> off<00:01:57.789> a

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
the power and torque just fall off a

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.380 
the power and torque just fall off a
cliff

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
cliff

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.330 
cliff
come<00:01:59.350> on<00:01:59.439> Jeep<00:01:59.829> that's<00:02:00.100> 50

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
come on Jeep that's 50

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
well we did manage to break 10 nine

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.900 
well we did manage to break 10 nine
point<00:02:09.599> five<00:02:09.959> six<00:02:10.410> nine<00:02:10.709> point<00:02:11.129> five<00:02:11.400> six

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
point five six nine point five six

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.960 
point five six nine point five six
um<00:02:12.660> yeah<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:14.040> okay<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.519> would<00:02:15.480> wager<00:02:15.810> that

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
um yeah it's okay I would wager that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.720 
um yeah it's okay I would wager that
it's<00:02:17.970> gonna<00:02:18.209> be<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.480> lot<00:02:18.810> slower<00:02:19.019> towing<00:02:19.739> yeah

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
it's gonna be a lot slower towing yeah

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.619 
it's gonna be a lot slower towing yeah
I'm<00:02:21.120> sure

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
I'm sure

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.420 
I'm sure
anybody<00:02:22.230> out<00:02:22.290> there<00:02:22.410> will<00:02:22.620> take<00:02:22.799> that<00:02:23.010> but<00:02:23.220> but

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
anybody out there will take that but but

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.190 
anybody out there will take that but but
let's<00:02:23.610> write<00:02:23.819> one<00:02:23.970> more<00:02:24.030> time<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:24.900> time<00:02:25.110> you

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
let's write one more time this time you

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.009 
let's write one more time this time you
guys<00:02:25.319> can<00:02:25.470> look<00:02:25.590> at<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.860> speedometer<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:26.519> the

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
guys can look at the speedometer and the

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.640 
guys can look at the speedometer and the
odometer<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.500> just<00:02:29.129> see<00:02:29.930> what<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.140> engine<00:02:31.530> is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
odometer and just see what the engine is

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.809 
odometer and just see what the engine is
doing<00:02:31.890> because<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:32.220> you're<00:02:32.340> interesting<00:02:32.760> in

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
doing because it's you're interesting in

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.430 
doing because it's you're interesting in
a<00:02:32.910> diesel<00:02:33.090> there's<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.629> lot<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.989> torque<00:02:34.260> at

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
a diesel there's a lot of torque at

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.080 
a diesel there's a lot of torque at
about<00:02:34.620> 2,000<00:02:35.220> rpm<00:02:35.579> and<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.790> just<00:02:35.940> kind<00:02:36.060> of

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
about 2,000 rpm and it just kind of

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.000 
about 2,000 rpm and it just kind of
falls<00:02:36.360> off<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.599> cliff<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.349> trick<00:02:37.829> of<00:02:37.860> course

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
falls off a cliff so the trick of course

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.309 
falls off a cliff so the trick of course
is<00:02:38.340> for<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.519> transmission<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.900> shift<00:02:40.170> at

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
is for the transmission to the shift at

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.319 
is for the transmission to the shift at
its<00:02:40.470> optimal<00:02:40.920> torque<00:02:41.099> point<00:02:43.819> once<00:02:44.819> again<00:02:44.970> I've

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
its optimal torque point once again I've

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.970 
its optimal torque point once again I've
got<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.720> sport<00:02:45.989> mode<00:02:46.079> I'm<00:02:46.500> going<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.739> torque

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
got it in sport mode I'm going to torque

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.910 
got it in sport mode I'm going to torque
the<00:02:47.099> engine<00:02:47.129> a<00:02:47.430> little<00:02:47.489> bit<00:02:48.500> let<00:02:49.500> go

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
the engine a little bit let go

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.119 
the engine a little bit let go
Oh<00:02:49.950> wheel<00:02:50.549> drive<00:02:50.879> nice<00:02:51.660> hole<00:02:52.260> shot<00:02:52.590> got<00:02:52.980> off

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
Oh wheel drive nice hole shot got off

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.300 
Oh wheel drive nice hole shot got off
really<00:02:53.610> well<00:02:53.760> but<00:02:54.450> then<00:02:54.950> that's<00:02:55.950> where<00:02:56.280> it

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
really well but then that's where it

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.640 
really well but then that's where it
kind<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.549> falls<00:02:56.790> off<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.000> cliff<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:57.650> they're

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
kind of falls off a cliff and they're

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.039 
kind of falls off a cliff and they're
sixteen<00:02:59.129> oh<00:02:59.370> that<00:03:00.060> was<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.209> lot<00:03:00.390> faster<00:03:00.810> look<00:03:00.930> at

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
sixteen oh that was a lot faster look at

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.650 
sixteen oh that was a lot faster look at
that

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660

hooking<00:04:03.739> up<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:03.950> boat<00:04:04.129> now<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.400> may<00:04:04.519> be

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
hooking up the boat now you may be

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.699 
hooking up the boat now you may be
wondering<00:04:04.750> why<00:04:05.750> there's<00:04:06.080> another<00:04:06.260> person<00:04:06.650> in

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
wondering why there's another person in

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.320 
wondering why there's another person in
the<00:04:06.800> car<00:04:06.830> you<00:04:07.730> know<00:04:07.790> what<00:04:07.879> when<00:04:08.209> you're

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
the car you know what when you're

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.770 
the car you know what when you're
telling<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.720> 5,000<00:04:09.410> over<00:04:10.180> 5,000<00:04:11.180> pound<00:04:11.330> boat<00:04:11.540> it

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
telling a 5,000 over 5,000 pound boat it

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.460 
telling a 5,000 over 5,000 pound boat it
really<00:04:11.959> doesn't<00:04:12.200> matter

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
really doesn't matter

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.290 
really doesn't matter
so<00:04:12.739> if<00:04:12.980> should<00:04:13.129> add<00:04:13.250> volume<00:04:13.640> do<00:04:13.879> I<00:04:13.940> am<00:04:14.090> dealing

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
so if should add volume do I am dealing

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.030 
so if should add volume do I am dealing
 in<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:14.780> you're<00:04:15.140> doing<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:15.620> work<00:04:15.739> of<00:04:15.860> two

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
 in it you're doing the work of two

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.409 
 in it you're doing the work of two
men<00:04:16.070> yes<00:04:16.639> no<00:04:18.100> there's<00:04:19.100> two<00:04:19.280> of<00:04:19.340> us<00:04:19.430> in<00:04:19.609> here<00:04:19.639> all

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
men yes no there's two of us in here all

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:20.740 
men yes no there's two of us in here all
right

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
right

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.409 
right
now<00:04:21.440> this<00:04:21.620> chief<00:04:21.859> does<00:04:22.100> have<00:04:22.419> self-levelling

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
now this chief does have self-levelling

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.120 
now this chief does have self-levelling
suspension<00:04:23.450> so<00:04:24.350> that's<00:04:24.560> nice

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
suspension so that's nice

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.550 
suspension so that's nice
it<00:04:25.520> sorts<00:04:26.150> out<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.450> boat<00:04:26.630> issues<00:04:27.080> so<00:04:27.260> it's<00:04:27.410> not

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
it sorts out the boat issues so it's not

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.040 
it sorts out the boat issues so it's not
facing<00:04:28.370> too<00:04:28.490> far<00:04:28.729> up<00:04:28.940> or<00:04:29.210> too<00:04:29.360> far<00:04:29.600> down<00:04:29.750> it's

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
facing too far up or too far down it's

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.270 
facing too far up or too far down it's
nice<00:04:30.229> and<00:04:30.410> level<00:04:30.470> which<00:04:30.740> is<00:04:30.860> right<00:04:31.010> where<00:04:31.070> you

possibility showed us doubt it showed us

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.120 
possibility showed us doubt it showed us
and<00:05:19.870> I<00:05:19.930> will<00:05:20.050> do<00:05:20.140> overtime<00:05:20.410> don't<00:05:20.830> worry<00:05:21.010> we'll

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130

and I will do overtime don't worry we'll
do<00:05:21.220> it<00:05:21.310> one<00:05:21.400> more<00:05:21.430> time<00:05:21.700> we'll<00:05:22.000> try<00:05:22.210> it<00:05:22.240> I<00:05:22.480> think

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
do it one more time we'll try it I think

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.810

if<00:05:23.080> we<00:05:23.230> spool<00:05:23.650> up<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.800> turbo<00:05:24.190> love<00:05:24.400> it<00:05:24.580> hold

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
if we spool up the turbo love it hold

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.060 
if we spool up the turbo love it hold
the<00:05:24.880> brake<00:05:25.150> down<00:05:25.330> and<00:05:25.660> just<00:05:25.840> for<00:05:26.590> it<00:05:26.710> I<00:05:26.830> think

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
the brake down and just for it I think

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.930 
the brake down and just for it I think
we're<00:05:27.220> gonna<00:05:27.340> have<00:05:27.490> a<00:05:27.580> little<00:05:27.700> bit<00:05:27.850> better

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
results what do you think that my Tech's

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.620 
results what do you think that my Tech's
demonstrate<00:05:30.250> one<00:05:30.370> more<00:05:30.430> time<00:05:33.210> all<00:05:34.210> right
