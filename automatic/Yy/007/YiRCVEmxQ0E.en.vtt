00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.450
 you do that 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.369

 given intersecting forms we do not want 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.989

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.450

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.110

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.239
 take the time to get back everything 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.510
 the crates fall 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.340

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.120
