00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 Anatoly Eduardovich Tell with what 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.389
 countries assumed first 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:14.009
 start cooperation we are now on your 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.470
 employee with many countries and first 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.140
 Belarus Belarus queue with my hotel 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.850
 because we work with belarus us 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.910
 from 5 to campfire tesco enterprises we 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.430
 here we take the earth day 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.330
 we are building an ecological dough here 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.880
 plots and we will create production and 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.829
 so we have a normal relationship with 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.190
 power and strut coincided kansky 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.660
 from regional and local we are normal 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.579
 relationship height we already have food 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.750
 negotiations there is already a proposal for 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.829
 Celsius 1 roads in the Republic of Belarus 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.760
 countries people firewood skyway it and the road 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.070
 speed 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.559
 Minsk airport is the connection between 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.160
 and regional centers from the capital with 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.160
 Minsk and 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.799
 connection is not some cities 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.110
 small with each other without a group 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.159
 cities that don't have one 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:23.990
 hopes sustainable transportation connection 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:28.680
 This is the communication of the satellite cities 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.729
 from the capital with Minsk therefore 1 with whom we 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.540
 cooperating it 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.369
 republic until then naturally we 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.079
 worked actively in Russia there very 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.380
 many projects need to be and that is the very 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.240
 a large territory quickly new world 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.149
 most untapped territory therefore 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.119
 Only in Russia for a simple millions 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.799
 kilometers of string roads it's us 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.680
 Now we are building relationships with customers 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:00.479
 of power already in Russia because 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.180
 before wake respect was another we 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.210
 asked for money came says speak 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.239
 money we will make a dough plot built 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.170
 repairing a dash raw and happy 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:19.910
 stroma we all said 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:22.709
 do yourself overclocking to the end and last 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.470
 well that sounded in particular from 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.900
 Russian government then I was 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:32.730
 President Medvedev Dmitry Anatolyevich 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.340
 and he when we reported on the state council 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.200
 on innovation us transport broth with 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.760
 2009 , he said, and you will find money 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.730
 once great this innovation such 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.290
 real on you but the day will not find something 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.940
 there is a state not willing to invest 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.550
 money is to blame sandy 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.550
 or someone thinks something is illusions 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.989
 so we here come crowdinvesting from 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.000
 tori and 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.769
 for the money and the people to make the technology 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.159
 then asked to sell it from them 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:08.050
 horizon 20 project is therefore large 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:12.070
 the country where we are planning 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.750
 implement the project from u russia later 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.160
 build relationships now too 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.480
 customers and investors 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.220
 such countries as the volume of the Arab world from 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.930
 Saudi Arabia 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.700
 colombia china india 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.660
 African countries 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:37.630
 there is also no layer in australia 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.960
 this work is being done it is not visible 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:46.930
 work publicly because go now 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:51.370
 stage of the negotiations and our task figuratively 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.200
 speaking because of the quality stand up line to 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.350
 the time we certify 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.610
 technology and show its weight on test 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.280
 taught us there should be 80 customer here 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.130
 our task is to get today 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.030
 full-fledged order world but because 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:13.989
 technology is not yet certified in 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.770
 samples in experiments in the first 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.790
 generation 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:22.050
 zil when he went along the rail see the pipes 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.250
 boser string rail yes it's not 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.650
 product that you can sell about 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.770
 hicks will take as the Wright brothers plane 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:34.240
 carrion izya yes and here is the fourth generation 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.610
 we showed no showed no 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.190
 certified and naturally we are not 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.990
 we can go to the market with him 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.740
 we plan to do this through somewhere 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.760
 year and a half 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.340
 when I show on the test sites 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.270
 certified truth skyway technology 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.120
 which you can buy any country and 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.830
 build any address project 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.500
 wherein 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.190
 orders may be billions of dollars 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.170
 every project is not a movie hundreds 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:10.710
 million dollars and everything says 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:15.040
 let's say on the city project 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.020
 same day emirates well then 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.080
 this is actually a project for about a dozen 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:24.220
 I have a task to see items 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.760
 customers so that this method beznin then 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:31.770
 it is very important to show Belarus here 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.510
 on test sites that it works 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.610
 meets all international requirements 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:41.200
 environmental safety 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:43.830
 reliability durability what is it 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:48.510
 not imagination there 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:51.180
 design engineer a sober calculation 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.820
 sober analysis confirmed 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.140
 experimentally on test sites and 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.660
 what does that fit 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.820
 characteristics about which I have long been 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.700
 says this decay the very year 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.460
 environmentally friendly ride will be the most 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:10.720
 safe from freedom wounds 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.340
 most effective for all 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.160
 user categories because 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.720
 tickets will be much cheaper than 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.480
 existing transport 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.790
 at the same time it is possible to consume energy on 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:27.520
 order less than existing trance 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:31.120
 its safety on it will be higher than in 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.190
 aviation aviation is actually safer 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.000
 tamerlan transport which we 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.320
 not afraid you need really real fear 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.580
 today the inner roads of the world are dying 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.270
 a half million people evolutionary 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.300
 catastrophe 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.800
 600 700 something today aviation 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.200
 safe transport in 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.980
 several thousand times she still you 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.970
 safer 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.970
 why diaz 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:07:01.940
 and therefore we are working now customers 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:06.650
 from all over the world and are preparing their conclusion 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:08.870
 contract before contract and soon i'm flying 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:12.770
 dropped out of particular on the negotiations I 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:15.310
 I hope that my husband is in front of contracts 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.010
 conclusion is not a contract this again 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.420
 and for such serious things as 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:23.480
 building a new type 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:26.890
 City or clusters microdistrict 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.450
 but this is all settlement but go out 

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:32.750
 restored by a bud with gardens 

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:35.470
 with transport at the second level and 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.470
 completely pedestrian
