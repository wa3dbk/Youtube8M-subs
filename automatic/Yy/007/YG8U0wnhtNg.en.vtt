00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
the the engine nacelles cut out I just

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.849 
the the engine nacelles cut out I just
hot-wired<00:00:22.369> them<00:00:22.850> out<00:00:23.060> of<00:00:24.640> out<00:00:25.640> of<00:00:26.590> blue<00:00:27.590> core

I'm<00:00:34.100> gonna<00:00:34.190> put<00:00:34.340> a<00:00:34.400> seven<00:00:34.730> millimeter<00:00:34.940> ducted

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
I'm gonna put a seven millimeter ducted

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.930 
I'm gonna put a seven millimeter ducted
fan<00:00:35.720> now<00:00:36.230> I<00:00:36.590> think<00:00:37.340> just<00:00:37.579> to<00:00:37.670> get<00:00:37.790> this<00:00:37.880> thing

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
fan now I think just to get this thing

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.110 
fan now I think just to get this thing
made<00:00:38.300> ined<00:00:38.480> I<00:00:38.750> think<00:00:39.590> of<00:00:39.680> just<00:00:39.890> using<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:40.460> 70

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
made ined I think of just using to 70

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.580 
made ined I think of just using to 70
millimeter<00:00:42.579> ATT<00:00:43.989> two<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:45.170> half<00:00:45.320> three

pound<00:00:46.630> edf's<00:00:47.630> to<00:00:47.989> get<00:00:48.140> this<00:00:48.290> bird<00:00:48.500> in<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.680> air

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
pound edf's to get this bird in the air

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.940 
pound edf's to get this bird in the air
rather<00:00:50.149> than<00:00:50.420> using<00:00:51.579> for<00:00:53.020> weaker<00:00:54.020> ed<00:00:54.200> eps<00:00:54.500> that

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
rather than using for weaker ed eps that

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.889 
rather than using for weaker ed eps that
may<00:00:55.370> not<00:00:55.550> do<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:55.910> job<00:00:57.670> wiring<00:00:58.670> for<00:00:58.940> etfs<00:00:59.539> and

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
may not do the job wiring for etfs and

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.139 
may not do the job wiring for etfs and
for<00:01:00.200> speed<00:01:00.829> controllers<00:01:01.309> into<00:01:01.579> one<00:01:01.760> receiver

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
for speed controllers into one receiver

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.020 
for speed controllers into one receiver
can<00:01:02.360> be<00:01:02.480> kind<00:01:02.660> of<00:01:02.719> tricky<00:01:02.780> because<00:01:03.230> the

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
can be kind of tricky because the

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.499 
can be kind of tricky because the
channel<00:01:05.030> 3<00:01:05.330> on<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.479> futaba<00:01:05.899> fast<00:01:06.289> receiver

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
channel 3 on the futaba fast receiver

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.270 
channel 3 on the futaba fast receiver
just<00:01:08.509> doesn't<00:01:08.810> have<00:01:08.899> enough<00:01:08.930> power<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.530> do<00:01:09.890> for

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
just doesn't have enough power to do for

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.219 
just doesn't have enough power to do for
so<00:01:10.729> I'm<00:01:10.850> going<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.030> see<00:01:11.179> what<00:01:11.209> I<00:01:11.360> can<00:01:11.479> do<00:01:11.780> either

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
so I'm going to see what I can do either

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.870 
so I'm going to see what I can do either
i<00:01:12.530> might<00:01:12.860> be<00:01:12.950> able<00:01:13.009> to<00:01:13.130> use<00:01:13.310> an<00:01:13.490> auxiliary

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
i might be able to use an auxiliary

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.749 
i might be able to use an auxiliary
channel<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.740> reprogram<00:01:15.740> that<00:01:15.770> also<00:01:16.459> as<00:01:16.729> a

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
channel and reprogram that also as a

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:27.400 
channel and reprogram that also as a
throttle<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:18.670> have<00:01:21.970> you<00:01:22.970> know<00:01:23.090> have<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:26.410> know

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
throttle and have you know have you know

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.770 
throttle and have you know have you know
one<00:01:27.590> channel<00:01:28.069> channel<00:01:28.880> 3<00:01:29.090> is<00:01:29.179> throttle<00:01:29.599> and

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
one channel channel 3 is throttle and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.740 
one channel channel 3 is throttle and
channel<00:01:30.280> like<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.310> five<00:01:31.610> or<00:01:31.640> channel<00:01:32.300> six<00:01:32.569> as<00:01:32.720> a

channel like a five or channel six as a

channel like a five or channel six as a
throttle<00:01:33.200> as<00:01:33.289> well<00:01:33.530> give<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.640> guys<00:01:34.789> a<00:01:34.819> better

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
throttle as well give you guys a better

Am 707s for sale i'm hoping to get to a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.850 
Am 707s for sale i'm hoping to get to a
point<00:02:18.349> where<00:02:18.469> i<00:02:18.560> can<00:02:18.709> do

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
point where i can do

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.980 
point where i can do
maybe<00:02:19.100> two<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.370> these<00:02:19.460> babies<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.940> year<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:21.700> and

maybe two of these babies a year and and

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.190 
maybe two of these babies a year and and
so<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:25.160> know<00:02:25.190> sell<00:02:25.700> sell<00:02:26.420> them<00:02:26.600> on<00:02:26.720> eBay<00:02:27.020> or

the<00:03:13.940> planes<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.330> built<00:03:14.570> so<00:03:14.780> far<00:03:15.050> I've<00:03:15.410> maiden

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
the planes I built so far I've maiden

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.350 
the planes I built so far I've maiden
with<00:03:16.040> fixed<00:03:16.459> gear<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:16.910> i'm<00:03:17.030> going<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.239> add

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
with fixed gear and i'm going to add

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.070 
with fixed gear and i'm going to add
retracts<00:03:17.959> later<00:03:18.230> but<00:03:19.100> my<00:03:20.000> l-1011<00:03:20.720> is<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.930> t

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
retracts later but my l-1011 is the t

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.490 
retracts later but my l-1011 is the t
134<00:03:21.770> is<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.040> conchords<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:23.019> dc9<00:03:24.019> big<00:03:24.290> bunny

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
134 is the conchords the dc9 big bunny

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.259 
134 is the conchords the dc9 big bunny
that's<00:03:24.799> all<00:03:25.040> going<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.280> be<00:03:25.400> built<00:03:25.640> with

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
that's all going to be built with

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.890 
that's all going to be built with
retracts<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:27.019> begin<00:03:27.290> with<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:29.090> 707<00:03:29.810> is

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
retracts to begin with so this 707 is

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.330 
retracts to begin with so this 707 is
the<00:03:30.019> last<00:03:30.230> plane<00:03:30.530> I'm<00:03:30.680> building<00:03:31.040> that's<00:03:31.190> going

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
the last plane I'm building that's going

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.310 
the last plane I'm building that's going
to<00:03:31.400> have<00:03:31.549> fixed<00:03:31.820> landing<00:03:32.150> gear<00:03:32.209> all<00:03:32.600> my

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
to have fixed landing gear all my

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.780 
to have fixed landing gear all my
airliners<00:03:33.739> from<00:03:33.890> now<00:03:34.040> on<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:34.400> going<00:03:34.670> to<00:03:34.760> have

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
airliners from now on it going to have

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.160 
airliners from now on it going to have
retractable<00:03:37.790> landing<00:03:38.000> gears<00:03:38.390> from<00:03:38.840> the
