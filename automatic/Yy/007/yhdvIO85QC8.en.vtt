00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.409 
when they would imagine people slamming
up<00:03:21.069> against<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.519> wall<00:03:21.699> or<00:03:21.730> something<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.389> that

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
up against the wall or something to that

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.210 
up against the wall or something to that
effect<00:03:22.900> well<00:03:23.079> that<00:03:23.260> really<00:03:23.680> wouldn't<00:03:24.010> happen

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
effect well that really wouldn't happen

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.599 
effect well that really wouldn't happen
inertia<00:03:24.699> would<00:03:24.940> have<00:03:25.090> no<00:03:25.239> effect<00:03:25.560> you're

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
inertia would have no effect you're

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.390 
inertia would have no effect you're
you're<00:03:27.609> in<00:03:27.639> a<00:03:28.180> distortion<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.139> don't<00:03:30.069> forget

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
you're in a distortion and don't forget

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.059 
you're in a distortion and don't forget
that<00:03:30.699> gravity<00:03:31.269> distorts<00:03:31.599> time<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.260> space<00:03:32.530> so

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
that gravity distorts time and space so

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.740 
that gravity distorts time and space so
really<00:03:33.340> nothing<00:03:33.609> is<00:03:33.909> going<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.120> influence<00:03:34.480> you

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
really nothing is going to influence you

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.050 
really nothing is going to influence you

their different operating configurations

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.619 
their different operating configurations
there<00:03:42.430> are<00:03:42.609> three<00:03:42.790> amplifiers<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:45.489> craft<00:03:46.239> can

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
there are three amplifiers the craft can

are<00:03:55.320> two<00:03:56.040> different<00:03:56.400> ways<00:03:56.550> there's<00:03:57.030> what<00:03:57.660> they

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
are two different ways there's what they

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.470 
are two different ways there's what they
call<00:03:57.810> Omicron<00:03:58.530> configuration<00:03:59.340> where<00:04:00.210> the

problem to a disk because its

problem to a disk because its

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
interference essentially so what they do

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.190 
interference essentially so what they do
is<00:04:32.340> they<00:04:32.640> work<00:04:32.880> with<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.420> interference<00:04:33.990> to

is they work with that interference to

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.100 
is they work with that interference to
their<00:04:34.380> benefit<00:04:34.830> they'll<00:04:35.400> use<00:04:35.640> one<00:04:36.110> gravity

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
their benefit they'll use one gravity

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.870 
their benefit they'll use one gravity
