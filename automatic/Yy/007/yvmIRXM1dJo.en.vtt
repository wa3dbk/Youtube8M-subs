00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 ah 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.440
 now let's learn us the section to 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:13.010
 the section is a little bit longer 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.539
 we have a total of 16 measures in others 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.359
 16 bars we can talk about 2 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.439
 subdivisions a first subdivision 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.029
 creating a subdivision that really 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.250
 it looks like in terms of melody and 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.719
 harmony what to change the harmony of 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.399
 all ways is still very simple 

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:29.199
 the changes are minimal we will continue 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:31.089
 making the rhythmic guitar with the 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.670
 fifth chords to leave a little bit 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.199
 of space for the melody and for the 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.930
 accompaniment of the internal area with the 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.800
 gray is worth it is important that we have in 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.559
 mind that the melody when the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.989
 section in the original work is made 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.269
 by cello and then it is bent by 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.390
 the viola I suppose or if it could not be 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.489
 soft that comes in quite serious note 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.140
 I say it because it's going to stay a bit 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.730
 more expensive everything with the guitar but good 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.230
 especially when we then do 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.420
 the premium section, that is, when 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.980
 modify the melody a little bit in that 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.629
 part yes the violins go up and there are 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.100
 then the csis guitar the first 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.930
 guitar if it stands out a little bit more it's going 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.750
 to notice a little more acute then the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.960
 rif is a little more loaded with the 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.159
 chords but everything else stays or 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.680
 less on your sites to that really 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.619
 comes a little more balanced the 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.490
 chords in this section are four in the 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:27.550
 part of the fifth fifth sun fifth has been 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.050
 for fifth same fifth I will have the 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.789
 collective melody so they know by 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.860
 where are we going the rhythm continues is still 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.860
 the same while to many caracas tampa 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.689
 for so much 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.670
 really 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.640
 so that he does not control these 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.380
 chords say that the dow fifth is 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.569
 abundant on the fifth fret 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.770
 string we put the index finger and those of 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.360
 two three and four are always in the 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.580
 contiguous strings two become more acute or 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.900
 be from here and more we went to the fifth sun 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.150
 that climbing all I have is a 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.970
 rope or with let's say finger 1 on the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.260
 third string set and fingers 3 and 4 in 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.959
 the fifth fret of the fifth and the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.600
 fourth quarter so we would jump to if 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.209
 Flat fifth freedom from the fifth 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.470
 I wind the fingers 34 as the 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.450
 previous next is really a 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.220
 mobile position uses a mobile chord that 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.860
 we can place in the rest that we want 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.000
 and start to stay the same except 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.070
 as I said to the other in other video 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.350
 elections because of the difference there is 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.900
 tuning between the fourth string in the 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.380
 rope that does not have the same 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.870
 distance from other ropes 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.760
 we will pass to the fa after the sixth 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.720
 rope with this we would have the guitar 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.720
 rhythmic of this part 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.710
 do not
