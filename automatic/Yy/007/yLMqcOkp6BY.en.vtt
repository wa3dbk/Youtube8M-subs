00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.489 
match Tim cruel his diving is an 87 it
was<00:01:54.149> pretty<00:01:54.389> good<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.689> game<00:01:54.990> he<00:01:55.139> does<00:01:55.289> a<00:01:55.319> good

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:55.499 
was pretty good in game he does a good

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:57.620 
was pretty good in game he does a good
job<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.740> extending<00:01:56.429> his<00:01:56.579> body<00:01:56.819> pretty<00:01:57.240> far<00:01:57.479> out

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
job of extending his body pretty far out

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.289 
job of extending his body pretty far out
I<00:01:57.869> found<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.159> pretty<00:01:59.520> solid<00:01:59.999> he<00:02:00.119> could

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
I found it to be pretty solid he could

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.510 
I found it to be pretty solid he could
definitely<00:02:00.450> take<00:02:00.869> up<00:02:01.049> space<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.679> net<00:02:02.009> however

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
definitely take up space in net however

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.249 
definitely take up space in net however
he<00:02:02.729> wouldn't<00:02:03.030> really<00:02:03.149> fly<00:02:03.509> across<00:02:03.780> from<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.139> it

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
he wouldn't really fly across from it it

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.429 
he wouldn't really fly across from it it
felt<00:02:04.499> like<00:02:04.679> more<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.219> an<00:02:05.700> 85<00:02:06.359> in<00:02:06.600> game<00:02:06.810> however

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
felt like more of an 85 in game however

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.380 
felt like more of an 85 in game however
the<00:02:07.799> biggest<00:02:08.280> weakness<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:08.970> card<00:02:09.209> that

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the biggest weakness of this card that

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.350 
the biggest weakness of this card that
frustrated<00:02:10.140> me<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.590> much<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:11.069> his<00:02:11.790> positioning

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
frustrated me so much is his positioning

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.570 
frustrated me so much is his positioning
it<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.870> an<00:02:13.020> 81<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:13.950> played<00:02:14.220> with<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.400> lot<00:02:14.459> of

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
it is an 81 and I played with a lot of

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.220 
it is an 81 and I played with a lot of
goalies<00:02:14.940> recently<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.750> have<00:02:15.900> poor

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
goalies recently that have poor

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.649 
goalies recently that have poor
positioning<00:02:16.740> however<00:02:17.280> his<00:02:17.819> positioning<00:02:18.420> felt

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
positioning however his positioning felt

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.410 
positioning however his positioning felt
a<00:02:18.780> lot<00:02:19.170> worse<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.890> game<00:02:20.129> his<00:02:20.489> positioning<00:02:21.209> when

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
a lot worse in game his positioning when

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.620 
a lot worse in game his positioning when
you<00:02:21.569> leave<00:02:21.870> him<00:02:22.049> Annette

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
you leave him Annette

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.290 
you leave him Annette
very<00:02:23.050> very<00:02:23.350> poor<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:24.100> can<00:02:24.250> see<00:02:24.430> he<00:02:24.730> struggles

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
very very poor you can see he struggles

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.210 
very very poor you can see he struggles

I<00:02:42.550> know<00:02:42.760> he<00:02:43.000> wants<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.270> take<00:02:43.420> up<00:02:43.600> near<00:02:43.840> post<00:02:44.080> but

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
I know he wants to take up near post but

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.410 
I know he wants to take up near post but
that<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.620> way<00:02:44.830> too<00:02:44.860> much<00:02:45.220> in<00:02:45.490> an<00:02:45.790> easy<00:02:46.090> shot

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
that is way too much in an easy shot

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.150 
that is way too much in an easy shot
that<00:02:46.630> positioning<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.530> little<00:02:47.890> bit<00:02:47.980> worse

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
that positioning is a little bit worse

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.840 
that positioning is a little bit worse
than<00:02:48.430> an<00:02:48.550> 81<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.270> I<00:02:49.630> found<00:02:49.870> that<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.230> be<00:02:50.260> very

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
than an 81 and I found that to be very

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
than an 81 and I found that to be very
inconsistent<00:02:51.850> with<00:02:52.120> this<00:02:52.210> positioning<00:02:52.690> the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
inconsistent with this positioning the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.480 
inconsistent with this positioning the
angles<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.290> he<00:02:53.410> took<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.770> book<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.250> ball

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
angles that he took the book to the ball

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.520 
angles that he took the book to the ball
coming<00:02:55.000> out<00:02:55.180> on<00:02:55.360> one-on-one<00:02:55.900> shots<00:02:56.200> weren't

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
coming out on one-on-one shots weren't

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.380 
coming out on one-on-one shots weren't
exactly<00:02:56.920> bad<00:02:57.280> but<00:02:57.760> there<00:02:57.910> would<00:02:58.030> be<00:02:58.060> times

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
exactly bad but there would be times

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.450 
exactly bad but there would be times
where<00:02:58.600> his<00:02:58.720> positioning<00:02:59.290> would<00:02:59.860> be<00:03:00.100> really

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
where his positioning would be really

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.840 
where his positioning would be really
off<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.940> really<00:03:01.330> felt<00:03:01.540> like<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.930> was<00:03:02.020> a<00:03:02.050> 77<00:03:02.920> or<00:03:03.070> 78

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
off I really felt like it was a 77 or 78

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.430 
off I really felt like it was a 77 or 78
in<00:03:04.150> game<00:03:04.330> you<00:03:04.510> see<00:03:04.660> this<00:03:04.780> near<00:03:05.020> post<00:03:05.170> shot

in game you see this near post shot
right<00:03:05.620> here<00:03:05.650> that<00:03:06.220> goes<00:03:06.460> in<00:03:06.670> on<00:03:06.790> him<00:03:07.000> his

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
right here that goes in on him his

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.360 
right here that goes in on him his
positioning<00:03:08.020> isn't<00:03:08.440> terrible<00:03:08.890> but<00:03:09.280> again

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
positioning isn't terrible but again

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.550 
positioning isn't terrible but again
near<00:03:09.910> post<00:03:10.150> was<00:03:10.630> a<00:03:10.660> weakness<00:03:11.020> for<00:03:11.170> him<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.500> he

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
near post was a weakness for him and he

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.260 
near post was a weakness for him and he
would<00:03:11.710> leave<00:03:12.010> too<00:03:12.250> much<00:03:12.400> space<00:03:12.670> on<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:12.970> near

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
would leave too much space on that near

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.150 
would leave too much space on that near
post<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.660> go<00:03:13.780> in<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.410> it's<00:03:14.650> either<00:03:14.800> way<00:03:15.100> too

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.650 
in general I was really impressed with
his<00:03:44.890> diving<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.490> reflexes<00:03:46.120> but<00:03:46.270> his

his diving and reflexes but his

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.660 
his diving and reflexes but his
positioning<00:03:47.170> was<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:47.770> weakness<00:03:48.130> for<00:03:48.310> me<00:03:48.460> and

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
positioning was a weakness for me and

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.130 
positioning was a weakness for me and
there<00:03:49.000> would<00:03:49.060> be<00:03:49.120> some<00:03:49.360> shots<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:49.960> a

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140
