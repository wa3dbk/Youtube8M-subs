pitches<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> disk<00:00:45.690> between<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.770> bones

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
pitches in on the disk between the bones

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.639 
pitches in on the disk between the bones
of<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> vertebrae<00:00:47.789> what<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.870> might<00:00:49.110> do<00:00:49.379> you

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
of the vertebrae what that might do you

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.119 
of the vertebrae what that might do you
can<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.100> bent<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:50.960> that<00:00:51.960> might<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.590> is

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
can see the bent here that might do is

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.270 
can see the bent here that might do is
to<00:00:54.030> squeeze<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.690> vertebrae<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> lab

this<00:01:40.030> is<00:01:40.210> Riley's<00:01:40.660> neck<00:01:41.460> next<00:01:42.460> usually<00:01:42.880> should

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
this is Riley's neck next usually should

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.530 
this is Riley's neck next usually should
go<00:01:43.270> straight<00:01:44.080> down<00:01:44.890> now<00:01:45.880> you<00:01:45.940> see<00:01:46.300> why<00:01:46.479> these

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
go straight down now you see why these

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.070 
go straight down now you see why these
neck<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.320> bent<00:01:47.860> in<00:01:48.370> fact<00:01:48.729> see<00:01:49.450> here<00:01:49.840> that

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
neck is bent in fact see here that

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.020 
neck is bent in fact see here that
Riley's<00:01:50.710> vertebrae<00:01:51.190> are<00:01:51.340> not<00:01:51.550> in<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.729> straight

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
Riley's vertebrae are not in a straight

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.500 
Riley's vertebrae are not in a straight
line<00:01:52.440> in<00:01:53.440> fact<00:01:53.680> they're<00:01:53.950> stacked<00:01:54.310> so<00:01:54.970> that<00:01:55.180> the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
line in fact they're stacked so that the

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.650 
line in fact they're stacked so that the
they<00:01:56.110> curve<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:57.010> what<00:01:57.970> that<00:01:58.150> does<00:01:58.330> is<00:01:58.479> put

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
they curve and what that does is put

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.050 
they curve and what that does is put
excessive<00:01:59.020> force<00:01:59.530> on<00:01:59.800> the<00:02:00.040> spacer<00:02:00.790> or<00:02:00.940> the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
excessive force on the spacer or the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.930 
excessive force on the spacer or the
disk<00:02:01.360> so<00:02:02.050> it<00:02:02.080> wears<00:02:02.410> out<00:02:02.619> sooner<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:03.430> that's

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
disk so it wears out sooner and that's

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.880 
disk so it wears out sooner and that's
what's<00:02:04.180> happened<00:02:04.600> it's<00:02:04.750> got<00:02:04.990> that<00:02:05.170> bubble<00:02:05.770> in

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
what's happened it's got that bubble in

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.010 
what's happened it's got that bubble in
it<00:02:06.009> it<00:02:06.460> presses<00:02:06.940> on<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.180> stem<00:02:07.450> final<00:02:07.780> chord

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
it it presses on the stem final chord

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.010 
it it presses on the stem final chord
and<00:02:08.229> he<00:02:08.679> can't<00:02:08.979> feel<00:02:09.280> his<00:02:09.459> feet<00:02:09.790> so<00:02:10.509> you<00:02:10.570> see

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
and he can't feel his feet so you see

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.260 
and he can't feel his feet so you see

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.100 

the<00:02:19.310> trouble<00:02:19.700> is<00:02:19.790> when<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.120> bends<00:02:20.420> like<00:02:20.840> that

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
the trouble is when it bends like that

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.980 
the trouble is when it bends like that
it<00:02:21.530> puts<00:02:21.980> abnormal<00:02:22.670> pressure<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.480> those

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
it puts abnormal pressure on those

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.430 
it puts abnormal pressure on those
spacers<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.760> disk<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.240> if<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.230> next

always pushing on one side and wearing
it<00:02:29.330> out<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.930> gets<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.290> bubble<00:02:30.740> up<00:02:30.860> top<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.160> puts

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
it out it gets a bubble up top that puts

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.430 
it out it gets a bubble up top that puts
too<00:02:31.700> much<00:02:31.730> pressure<00:02:32.180> where<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.990> disc<00:02:33.170> starts

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
too much pressure where the disc starts

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.020 
too much pressure where the disc starts
to<00:02:33.560> wear<00:02:33.680> out<00:02:33.740> on<00:02:33.980> top<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.430> will<00:02:34.520> press<00:02:34.790> on<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
to wear out on top it will press on the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.010 
to wear out on top it will press on the

that's<00:02:36.890> what<00:02:37.070> Riley's<00:02:37.460> problem<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.090> he's<00:02:38.870> got

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
that's what Riley's problem is he's got

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.310 
that's what Riley's problem is he's got
a<00:02:39.170> scoliosis<00:02:39.800> of<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.340> neck<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.910> his<00:02:41.720> spacers

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
a scoliosis of the neck and his spacers

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.740 
a scoliosis of the neck and his spacers
are<00:02:42.560> as<00:02:42.710> intervertebral<00:02:43.340> discs<00:02:44.300> are<00:02:44.420> wearing

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
are as intervertebral discs are wearing

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.960 
are as intervertebral discs are wearing
out<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.350> his<00:02:45.980> vertebrae<00:02:46.460> are<00:02:46.970> not<00:02:47.660> normal

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
out and his vertebrae are not normal

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.700 
out and his vertebrae are not normal
size<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.000> shape<00:02:50.480> because<00:02:50.990> if<00:02:51.110> they<00:02:51.230> were<00:02:51.500> if

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
size and shape because if they were if

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.380 
size and shape because if they were if
they<00:02:51.770> stacked<00:02:52.250> on<00:02:52.520> each<00:02:52.550> other<00:02:52.910> just<00:02:53.300> like

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
they stacked on each other just like

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.810 
they stacked on each other just like
that<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:54.710> would<00:02:54.860> be<00:02:55.070> normal<00:02:55.490> because<00:02:55.610> they

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
that it would be normal because they

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.250 
that it would be normal because they
don't<00:02:56.090> because<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.480> just<00:02:56.630> told<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:56.959> there's<00:02:57.140> no

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
don't because I just told you there's no

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.100 
don't because I just told you there's no
spacer<00:02:57.709> in<00:02:57.800> between<00:02:57.830> each<00:02:58.220> one<00:02:58.630> so<00:02:59.630> actually

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
spacer in between each one so actually

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.900 
spacer in between each one so actually
they're<00:03:00.260> stacked<00:03:00.530> like<00:03:00.740> that<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.550> that<00:03:01.700> means

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
they're stacked like that so that means

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.650 
they're stacked like that so that means
one<00:03:02.180> side<00:03:02.209> or<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.690> other<00:03:03.160> is<00:03:04.330> abnormal<00:03:05.330> so<00:03:05.570> it

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
one side or the other is abnormal so it

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.370 
one side or the other is abnormal so it
might<00:03:05.840> be<00:03:05.900> skinnier<00:03:06.500> here<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.930> what<00:03:08.930> happens

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
might be skinnier here so what happens

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.740 
might be skinnier here so what happens
is<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.800> neck<00:03:10.040> if<00:03:10.520> it's<00:03:10.850> skinnier<00:03:11.240> one<00:03:11.540> side

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
is the neck if it's skinnier one side

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.540 
is the neck if it's skinnier one side
the<00:03:11.840> bone<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.590> bone<00:03:12.770> will<00:03:12.950> start<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.310> curve

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
the bone the bone will start to curve

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.920 
the bone the bone will start to curve
like<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.260> so<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.530> bone<00:03:15.770> curves<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:17.209> puts

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
like that so the bone curves and puts

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.540 
like that so the bone curves and puts
more<00:03:18.110> pressure<00:03:18.320> on<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.650> discs<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.220> they<00:03:19.340> wear

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
more pressure on the discs and they wear

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.340 
more pressure on the discs and they wear
out<00:03:19.700> a<00:03:19.730> little<00:03:20.000> sooner<00:03:20.270> they<00:03:20.660> also<00:03:20.810> wear<00:03:21.230> out

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
out a little sooner they also wear out

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.660 
out a little sooner they also wear out
sooner<00:03:21.770> on<00:03:21.950> some<00:03:22.280> dogs<00:03:22.810> some<00:03:23.810> poodles<00:03:24.670> some
