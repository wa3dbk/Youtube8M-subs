to answer the question we are we still
going<00:00:10.650> we<00:00:10.920> still<00:00:11.190> go<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.430> get<00:00:11.639> their<00:00:12.290> 1937

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:14.720 
going we still go and get their 1937

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.060 
going we still go and get their 1937
Maytag<00:00:15.720> we<00:00:15.990> still<00:00:16.230> go<00:00:16.439> and<00:00:16.560> put<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.710> thing

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
Maytag we still go and put that thing

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.429 
Maytag we still go and put that thing
together<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.760> that's<00:00:18.630> what<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.869> done<00:00:19.230> that

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
together and that's what I done that

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.870 
together and that's what I done that
that's<00:00:19.740> what<00:00:19.950> I've<00:00:20.070> done<00:00:20.220> built<00:00:20.580> right<00:00:20.820> here

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
that's what I've done built right here

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.210 
that's what I've done built right here
this<00:00:21.300> side<00:00:21.599> trip<00:00:22.200> it

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
this side trip it

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.150 
this side trip it
to<00:00:25.220> build<00:00:25.460> that<00:00:25.670> Clark<00:00:26.030> to<00:00:26.240> put<00:00:26.450> it<00:00:26.570> on<00:00:26.750> I

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
to build that Clark to put it on I

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.280 
to build that Clark to put it on I
needed<00:00:28.160> I<00:00:28.430> needed<00:00:29.330> I<00:00:29.510> needed<00:00:29.600> to<00:00:29.990> build<00:00:30.110> a

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.290 
needed I needed I needed to build a

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.560 
needed I needed I needed to build a
whole<00:00:30.470> bunch<00:00:30.680> of<00:00:30.920> wheels<00:00:32.530> aren't<00:00:33.530> wheels<00:00:34.570> for

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
whole bunch of wheels aren't wheels for

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.300 
whole bunch of wheels aren't wheels for
a<00:00:35.600> couple<00:00:36.020> of<00:00:36.110> three<00:00:36.320> projects<00:00:36.860> I've<00:00:37.100> got

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
a couple of three projects I've got

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.060 
a couple of three projects I've got
going<00:00:37.760> so<00:00:38.570> you<00:00:38.630> know<00:00:38.900> my<00:00:39.110> theory<00:00:39.440> is<00:00:39.680> if<00:00:39.920> you're

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
going so you know my theory is if you're

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.180 
going so you know my theory is if you're
gonna<00:00:40.250> build<00:00:40.550> more<00:00:40.880> than<00:00:41.590> two<00:00:42.590> or<00:00:42.770> three<00:00:42.800> of

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
gonna build more than two or three of

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.150 
gonna build more than two or three of
anything<00:00:43.340> build<00:00:44.000> a<00:00:44.150> jig<00:00:44.480> okay<00:00:45.350> I<00:00:45.380> just<00:00:46.010> now

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
anything build a jig okay I just now

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.490 
anything build a jig okay I just now
went<00:00:46.190> ahead<00:00:46.730> and<00:00:47.030> knock<00:00:47.180> this<00:00:47.450> jig<00:00:47.870> out<00:00:48.110> here

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
went ahead and knock this jig out here

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.130 
went ahead and knock this jig out here
it's<00:00:48.980> a<00:00:49.130> piece<00:00:49.340> of<00:00:49.370> about<00:00:50.300> high<00:00:50.510> fees<00:00:50.809> thick

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
it's a piece of about high fees thick

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.890 
it's a piece of about high fees thick
steel<00:00:51.520> it's<00:00:52.520> really<00:00:52.910> a<00:00:52.940> nice<00:00:53.180> piece<00:00:53.480> of<00:00:53.510> steel

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
steel it's really a nice piece of steel

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.170 
steel it's really a nice piece of steel
and<00:00:54.260> I've<00:00:54.770> drilled<00:00:55.040> it<00:00:55.280> out<00:00:55.400> you<00:00:55.730> know<00:00:55.790> in<00:00:56.150> the

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
and I've drilled it out you know in the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.530 
and I've drilled it out you know in the
middle<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:56.870> I<00:00:57.650> put<00:00:58.130> them<00:00:58.340> I<00:00:58.580> put<00:00:59.000> these<00:00:59.240> your

when<00:01:26.750> I<00:01:26.800> get<00:01:27.800> the<00:01:28.009> welding<00:01:28.429> slag<00:01:28.550> off<00:01:28.970> of<00:01:29.149> there

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
when I get the welding slag off of there

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.870 
when I get the welding slag off of there
the<00:01:29.960> lines<00:01:30.200> go<00:01:30.560> away<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:31.250> got<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.640> punch

these hold fast I drilled four extra

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.649 
these hold fast I drilled four extra

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
and if you've got a spoke that's kind of

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.110 
and if you've got a spoke that's kind of
acting<00:05:44.259> up<00:05:44.440> on<00:05:44.650> you<00:05:44.830> a<00:05:44.860> little<00:05:45.069> bit<00:05:45.219> they're
