expensive for a 1/4 scale aircraft in my
opinion<00:00:19.439> but<00:00:19.800> obviously<00:00:20.460> Gemini<00:00:20.880> Jets<00:00:21.090> makes

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
opinion but obviously Gemini Jets makes

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.470 
opinion but obviously Gemini Jets makes
excellent<00:00:21.810> products<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.609> plus<00:00:23.609> their<00:00:23.850> 707s

more<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:28.199> actually<00:00:28.349> was<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> pretty<00:00:28.859> good

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
more so it actually was a pretty good

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.880 
more so it actually was a pretty good
deal<00:00:29.660> we<00:00:30.660> get<00:00:30.810> right<00:00:30.960> into<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.230> unboxing<00:00:31.740> now

on<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> back<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.030> little<00:00:45.120> bit<00:00:45.300> bigger

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
on the back we have a little bit bigger

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.729 
on the back we have a little bit bigger
of<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.600> diagram<00:00:45.960> showing<00:00:46.020> what<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> aircraft

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
of a diagram showing what the aircraft

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.700 
of a diagram showing what the aircraft
looks<00:00:46.920> like<00:00:47.510> it's<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.660> simple<00:00:49.110> colors<00:00:49.440> but

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
looks like it's a simple colors but

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.850 
looks like it's a simple colors but
gives<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.190> nice<00:00:50.340> classic<00:00:50.820> look<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:52.620> so

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
gives it a nice classic look and so

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.470 
gives it a nice classic look and so
taking<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> look<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> model<00:00:53.820> now<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.300> is

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
taking a look at the model now it is

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.930 
taking a look at the model now it is
good<00:00:54.750> size<00:00:54.930> for<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.379> 1<00:00:55.530> 400<00:00:55.770> scale<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> 707<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
good size for a 1 400 scale the 707 is a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.229 
good size for a 1 400 scale the 707 is a
pretty<00:00:57.090> big<00:00:57.300> aircraft<00:00:59.420> and<00:01:01.010> as<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.239> classic

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
pretty big aircraft and as the classic

information here and here so we'll start

information here and here so we'll start
the<00:01:24.119> unboxing<00:01:24.180> now

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.850 

so<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.430> usual<00:01:38.640> Dimity<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.590> making<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> really

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
so as usual Dimity just making a really

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.770 
so as usual Dimity just making a really
detailed<00:01:41.070> model<00:01:41.640> especially<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
detailed model especially here on the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.140 
detailed model especially here on the
wing<00:01:43.200> area<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:44.370> this<00:01:44.520> particular<00:01:44.940> aircraft

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
wing area on this particular aircraft

00:01:45.150 --> 00:02:05.450 
wing area on this particular aircraft
isn't<00:01:45.720> really<00:01:45.900> nice<00:01:46.050> details<00:01:46.470> there<00:02:04.460> I'll

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
isn't really nice details there I'll

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.520 
isn't really nice details there I'll
give<00:02:05.880> me<00:02:05.970> one<00:02:06.270> quick<00:02:06.480> second<00:02:06.870> here<00:02:07.080> I'm<00:02:07.290> going

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
give me one quick second here I'm going

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.410 
give me one quick second here I'm going
to<00:02:07.590> take<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> camera<00:02:08.310> off<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.430> tripod<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.360> he

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
to take the camera off the tripod so he

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.030 
to take the camera off the tripod so he
can<00:02:09.570> get<00:02:09.660> some<00:02:09.720> closer<00:02:10.080> details<00:02:10.590> at<00:02:10.830> this

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
can get some closer details at this

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:21.640 
can get some closer details at this
model

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.320 

so<00:02:22.650> on<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.580> 707<00:02:24.360> 320<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:26.130> cockpit<00:02:27.000> area<00:02:27.120> is

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
so on this 707 320 the cockpit area is

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.980 
so on this 707 320 the cockpit area is
very<00:02:27.540> detailed<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:30.030> always<00:02:30.150> like<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.600> it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
very detailed and I always like that it

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.560 
very detailed and I always like that it
has<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.380> nice<00:02:31.590> chrome<00:02:32.240> kind<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.360> chrome

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
has a nice chrome kind of a chrome

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.840 
has a nice chrome kind of a chrome
polish<00:02:34.050> on<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.380> tops<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.370> bottoms<00:02:35.430> and

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
polish on the tops and bottoms and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.540 
polish on the tops and bottoms and
fuselage<00:02:36.270> also<00:02:36.690> on<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.900> wings<00:02:37.280> as<00:02:38.280> we<00:02:38.400> see

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
fuselage also on the wings as we see

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.830 
fuselage also on the wings as we see

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
leave a comment because I would actually

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.320 
leave a comment because I would actually
like<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.769> know<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:14.940> have<00:03:15.090> not

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
like to know and I and I have not

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.690 
like to know and I and I have not
figured<00:03:15.570> out<00:03:15.750> what<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.050> is<00:03:16.250> I<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.640> a

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
figured out what that is I have a

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.479 
figured out what that is I have a
feeling<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.120> something<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.510> do<00:03:18.660> with<00:03:19.489> air

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
feeling is something to do with air

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.310 
feeling is something to do with air
speed<00:03:20.790> readings<00:03:21.239> or<00:03:21.480> altitude<00:03:21.750> or<00:03:22.050> something

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
speed readings or altitude or something

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.110 
speed readings or altitude or something
