dollars<00:05:44.220> in<00:05:44.400> like<00:05:44.580> thirty<00:05:44.880> dollars<00:05:45.300> then<00:05:45.750> that

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
dollars in like thirty dollars then that

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.930 
dollars in like thirty dollars then that
would<00:05:46.230> be<00:05:46.260> thirty-six<00:05:46.980> dollars<00:05:47.370> but<00:05:47.580> instead

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.780

I<00:05:48.000> would<00:05:48.360> drop<00:05:48.540> it<00:05:48.750> to<00:05:48.960> thirty<00:05:49.290> dollars<00:05:49.790> so

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
I would drop it to thirty dollars so

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.250
