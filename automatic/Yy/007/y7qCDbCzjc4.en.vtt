00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 years of people in this video you see that 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:12.540
 review also art widget all iphone 5 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:15.389
 case yes as mentioned the whole is from 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.640
 art joke and calls itself the jacket alu 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.890
 and it for the iphone 5 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.170
 I thank you in art joke we leave 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.750
 sent the whole thing for a review 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.990
 have so the case looks like here 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.490
 the name implies we all have here 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.969
 and in the inside we have it here 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.500
 a layer of silicone 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.690
 I have the black version here 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.149
 but there are still in titan and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.129
 silver I think the case really great 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.770
 I have the whole thing for that 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.750
 iphone 4 and 4s tested and sent 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.670
 get link to his description 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.100
 and I was really excited about the case 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.870
 very excited the case here is now 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.399
 as good as the predecessor 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.079
 Unfortunately I have a few negative ones here 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.360
 They did not find me that way 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.039
 The ones who liked the predecessor were better 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.469
 let's just put the iphone in that 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.500
 case that's really easy for us 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.229
 Silicone-part pack out as our 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.020
 iphone rhein could do it this way 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.150
 Actually even as a case use 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.010
 it's just a bit loose but so 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.200
 a lot is not so thought then 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.159
 does it just let's call it here once 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.549
 as such a snap case looks then as 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.680
 here these points that these points there 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.700
 really in the case are then sitting in it 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.990
 the case also really perfect in my case 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.820
 case is now perfect for the whole 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.820
 then looks like this installed 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.140
 Let's see the connections and 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.210
 buttons will be on here 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.250
 Volume buttons covered with silicone 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.970
 but they can be very well pressed 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:54.140
 and we have something small here 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:56.240
 Input for this is the music above the power 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.039
 button is clearer so a hole became the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.039
 can press all without problems 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.039
 below we really have everything from 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.539
 have saved no problems there 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.399
 to connect something is really 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.440
 Of course, all free camera is synonymous 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.940
 perfectly cut and does not do any 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.489
 problems with the flash or the microphone 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.640
 and as you can see we have a label there 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:20.870
 design what should help your iphone before 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:24.350
 crash or protect something like that for example 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.269
 what the money is really bombastic if 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.700
 It's all about safety here 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.350
 that's really alu and silicone me 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.440
 would say that is over already 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.819
 neat collapse i would say too 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.830
 that does not scratch so fast 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.780
 I have it here now at work 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.940
 had it and I really have none 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.590
 single scratch on it was really very 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.700
 Well, I think I would say the case fits 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.900
 better to the black iphone 5 that fits 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.970
 simply better because then everything 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.310
 completely black is I say now 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.870
 not that I look bad but 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.670
 if you bought the case and one 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.820
 black iphone does she really have that 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.650
 Bomb out yes as I mentioned before 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.510
 the predecessor for the iphone 4s and was 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.859
 I'm really excited about that, too 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.630
 The whole thing really feels excited 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.739
 very good in hand and gives you 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.930
 somehow the feeling that your iphone 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.819
 really safe in there but there is 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.829
 still some negative points I 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.390
 think bad and the predecessor 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.500
 we were better off starting down here 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.690
 we have it down here now 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.650
 bottom side find everything completely open 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.500
 I'm a little stupid because if that 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.220
 iphone somehow falls down like that 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.500
 sometime it does then here 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.989
 was like everything was broken when predecessor 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.639
 here's a strip of silicone of choice 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.160
 little labritja but he has there 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.290
 then protected, I found better at 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.900
 predecessor was also up here and at the 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.030
 everything cut out so there was 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.060
 a great freedom again with one 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.130
 I found silicone strips there personally 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.790
 better 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.500
 I just think so 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.000
 It does not matter if you do this individually 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.169
 want to have keys or have that open 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.910
 I want you to feel the right keys 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.390
 that actually pushes my negative 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.400
 points so nothing too big 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.959
 the case costs just under 23 euros currently 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.340
 on amazon of course I have a link 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.290
 to all color variants in the 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.940
 description and if you buy about it 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.170
 I would be really happy about that 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.840
 I have a clear buy recommendation 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.209
 if you are looking for a case what your iphone 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.819
 really very well protects an alu design 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.890
 I do not look too bad 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.630
 Thanks again to art joke that 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.260
 have sent me the water with 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.790
 the video 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.290
 If you liked it I would 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.600
 happy about a thumbs up 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.630
