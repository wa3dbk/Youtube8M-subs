00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.000
 sir said in that traffic service 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.950
 national informs you in a way that 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.049
 this Friday, April 26 we have the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.580
 presence of what came to be the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.910
 opposite number 40 and is a situation 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.070
 very very restless and send losing 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.500
 totally intensity is a system 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.599
 stationary that little by little it will go 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.210
 dissipating if we continue to observe the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.550
 entrance the entrance of humidity from the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.420
 peaceful ocean towards the west the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.460
 center and east of the republic 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.379
 Mexican that even covers 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.969
 also the northeast with rainfall 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.130
 that go from light to occasional 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.930
 moderate and we can even expect some 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.390
 forces in the state of mexico and in the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.530
 state of michoacán there we will wait is 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.120
 of its rainfall condition 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.770
 he also directs the moderates in what 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.010
 It is the southeast of the Mexican Republic 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.600
 as well as in the south of Campeche and the south 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.850
 of the state of quintana roo 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.810
 then the condition of these systems 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.970
 so it will be lost in front number 40 in the 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.739
 gulf of mexico and we will hope that only 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.689
 the humidity arrives and the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.880
 precipitation and good temperatures 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.979
 the openings will have to go recovering 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.289
 the values ​​that we had mentioned the 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.430
 last week and it will do just that 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.440
 about everything that is 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.990
 because you imagine black stones 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.120
 with 17 degrees maximum temperature of 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.680
 day 10 is a really very low value 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.750
 then the pains will recover 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.670
 little by little in the course of these 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.680
 next those next days like that 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.600
 we will expect them to be the values for 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.220
 which is the northwest of our territory 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.590
 36 degrees in Hermosillo 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.510

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.580
 rest also a clear sky to medium 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.369

 the state of coahuila like the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.700
 monterrey very very low value of 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.380

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.830
