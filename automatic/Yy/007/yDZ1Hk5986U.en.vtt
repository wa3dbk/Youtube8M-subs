00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:01.079> every<00:00:01.500> time<00:00:01.680> he<00:00:02.040> goes<00:00:02.220> in<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.669> ring

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
I think every time he goes in the ring

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.490 
I think every time he goes in the ring
that's<00:00:03.030> it's<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.449> masterpiece<00:00:03.780> you<00:00:04.080> know<00:00:04.170> Rubio

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
I think part of the motivation no you

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.419 
I think part of the motivation no you
can't<00:00:07.350> take<00:00:07.500> anything<00:00:07.529> away<00:00:07.830> from<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.189> winner

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
can't take anything away from the winner

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.280 
can't take anything away from the winner
over<00:00:08.670> when<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:08.910> had<00:00:09.030> them<00:00:09.150> knocked<00:00:09.929> down<00:00:10.080> in

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
over when you had them knocked down in

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.959 
over when you had them knocked down in
the<00:00:10.380> second<00:00:10.679> round<00:00:10.769> we<00:00:11.130> took<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.849> tremendous

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
the second round we took a tremendous

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.780 
the second round we took a tremendous
shock<00:00:12.389> getting<00:00:13.320> up<00:00:13.440> from<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.429> then

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
shock getting up from that and then

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.279 
shock getting up from that and then
still<00:00:15.120> being<00:00:15.299> able<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.480> go<00:00:15.570> six<00:00:15.809> more<00:00:15.990> rounds<00:00:16.199> I

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
still being able to go six more rounds I

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.019
