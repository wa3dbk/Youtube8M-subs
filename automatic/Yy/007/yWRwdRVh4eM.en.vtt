00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.510 
with this there's a close resemblance I
guess<00:05:31.880> this<00:05:32.060> part<00:05:32.330> is<00:05:32.450> uneven<00:05:32.990> with<00:05:33.110> this<00:05:33.520> wing

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
guess this part is uneven with this wing

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:41.200 
guess this part is uneven with this wing
but<00:05:35.030> you<00:05:35.180> know<00:05:35.590> no<00:05:36.590> that's<00:05:36.830> them<00:05:37.450> um<00:05:39.880> so<00:05:40.880> yeah

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
but you know no that's them um so yeah

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.510 
but you know no that's them um so yeah
if<00:05:41.600> you<00:05:41.840> if<00:05:42.260> you<00:05:42.380> fail<00:05:42.680> in<00:05:42.890> the<00:05:42.980> first<00:05:43.010> try<00:05:43.460> it

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
if you if you fail in the first try it

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.880 
if you if you fail in the first try it
doesn't<00:05:43.760> matter<00:05:44.090> just<00:05:44.870> just<00:05:45.320> try<00:05:45.530> and<00:05:45.710> try<00:05:45.860> and

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
doesn't matter just just try and try and

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.240 
doesn't matter just just try and try and
try<00:05:46.040> never<00:05:46.370> give<00:05:46.640> up<00:05:46.790> you<00:05:47.420> know<00:05:47.570> because<00:05:48.070> no<00:05:49.070> no

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
try never give up you know because no no

try never give up you know because no no
you<00:05:49.310> might<00:05:49.610> be<00:05:49.730> better<00:05:49.910> someday<00:05:50.330> you<00:05:50.720> might

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
you might be better someday you might

you might be better someday you might
actually<00:05:50.990> be<00:05:51.320> better<00:05:51.470> than<00:05:51.680> this<00:05:52.060> it's<00:05:53.060> just<00:05:53.240> a

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
actually be better than this it's just a

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.220 
actually be better than this it's just a
piece<00:05:53.450> of<00:05:53.510> crap<00:05:53.980> so<00:05:54.980> from<00:05:55.430> there<00:05:55.640> Oh<00:05:56.080> can<00:05:57.080> make
