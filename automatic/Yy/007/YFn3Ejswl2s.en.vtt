 years here they are this victory 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:08.679
 which i'm on reaching them by meter 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:11.950
 30 meters somewhere pinch on top and 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:17.650
 now from the sinuses of each leaf here 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:22.319
 grow new shoots that will 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:26.110
 form like their tree crown this 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:30.629
 Standard raspberry that is from these upper 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:35.129
 bosoms liston grow here such branches 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.280
 under them show you how it happened already 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.510
 victory 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.540
 this year I'm on reaching them 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.430
 height meter twenty meters 30 not how much 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.760
 30 meters probably here or meter 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.810
 fifty almost here i pinch 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:58.000
 and see from the sinuses leaves began to grow 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:01.050
 new branches here one here vtaraya here these 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.710
 and so on 4 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.250
 that is, until the autumn here will grow up thing 68 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:12.090
 here these shoots from the upper sinuses 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.900
 leaves and they will hang like this 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:19.650
 and forms like a tree on these here 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.970
 shoots next year on their here 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:30.540
 the tips will hang berries in clusters 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:37.250
 or guests now I will show one bush 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:41.370
 which I will thin out here he is 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.190
 burst raspberry row 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.650
 shoots and here we come to last year's 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.650
 I will run which this year bears fruit 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:54.600
 again I 'm telling it here last year 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.610
 escape here are fruitful twigs why these 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.710
 bushes are so short because in 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.780
 last year they were planted late 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.640
 pretty autumn so could not 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.120
 grow to that height 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.370
 which I now use for pinching 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.920
 that is, up to thirty meters fifty meters 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.860
 here they were so short 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.230
 I don't even pin them 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.520
 wintered this year that's grown 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.989
 fruit branches 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:24.630
 these fruitful branches already have fruits on them 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.450
 already gathered they all dried up and now 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.040
 this bush 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.850
 last yearâ€™s fruitful 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:37.370
 escape we also cut out in the same way 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:43.230
 without leaving the same hemp from the very 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:45.169
 we remove the base like this and this one 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.169
 last year's escape 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.169
 throwing 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:05:02.610
 young shoots can not tie up 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:07.460
 I'm tied up trying to keep a number in 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:10.550
 normal form as it drove the hands and 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:15.030
 again here when reaching 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:18.139
 when reaching shoots height meter 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:23.250
 thirty meter fifty pinching and 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:29.069
 begin to grow again from the sinuses of the leaves 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:31.849
 victory that next year will be 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.849
 fruit 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:41.550
 here is another one that's old yet 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.340
 a little fructifying 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.620
 otplodonosivshie circumcised and here still 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:53.640
 some branches here are left with berries 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.320
 I will gather and finally we will cut off everything 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:06:02.810
 will be here with us 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:04.460
 clean and shoots will grow young 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.680
 this year 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.680
 good luck and good harvests
