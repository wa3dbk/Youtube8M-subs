Stadium<00:01:11.869> on<00:01:12.170> earth<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.560> know<00:01:12.649> we've<00:01:12.799> we've

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
Stadium on earth you know we've we've

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.010 
Stadium on earth you know we've we've
doubled<00:01:13.490> up<00:01:13.610> some<00:01:13.850> capacity<00:01:14.420> for<00:01:14.570> them<00:01:14.689> and<00:01:14.810> we

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
doubled up some capacity for them and we

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.170 
doubled up some capacity for them and we
bought<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.890> roll<00:01:16.100> up<00:01:16.280> machines<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:17.090> to

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
bought to roll up machines and to

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.240 
bought to roll up machines and to
removal<00:01:17.630> machines<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:18.469> if<00:01:18.710> we<00:01:18.829> have<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:19.159> do

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
removal machines and so if we have to do

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.310 
removal machines and so if we have to do
a<00:01:19.280> really<00:01:19.549> fast<00:01:19.880> conversion<00:01:20.299> we<00:01:20.960> could<00:01:21.109> do<00:01:21.200> it

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
a really fast conversion we could do it

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.840 
a really fast conversion we could do it
but<00:01:21.469> it's<00:01:21.590> almost<00:01:21.740> impossible<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.399> convert<00:01:22.729> it

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
but it's almost impossible to convert it

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.730 
but it's almost impossible to convert it
in<00:01:22.939> one<00:01:23.090> day<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:23.570> while<00:01:23.899> the<00:01:24.049> Cowboys<00:01:24.530> are
