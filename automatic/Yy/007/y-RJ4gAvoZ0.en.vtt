00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.590
 yes you become people again and again 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.240
 If you need a smart watch, you need it 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.940
 that something I absolutely have 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.480
 should or what you do with it 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.270
 at all 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.619
 what do i need this question for? 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.510
 I answer today in this video 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.949
 also with that the question if it is worthwhile 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.990
 already a smart watch for 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.550
 for example, an LG Stewart or a 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.949
 buy samsung life or maybe 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.210
 even later a motorflex but what 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.610
 can we do with such a clock 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.800
 So we can get notifications 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.520
 receive and answer us the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.559
 look at 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.030
 we can see and remember 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.640
 so interact for example 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.140
 we get one we get one 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.489
 Reminder okay now go shopping 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.260
 and a checklist of things there can 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.760
 we check off what we already have what 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.600
 handy is if you just like that 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.670
 can tick off quickly 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.170
 or we can also accept and call 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.340
 Reject directly at the clock even if I am 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.750
 so I can not call 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.309
 once mobile phone out want or if I want 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.800
 An SMS will get it to me 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.780
 i can read the sms and i can 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.579
 I answer directly by language 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.110
 can apps written for it 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.780
 smaller victims also turn to the victims 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.970
 games or something and I can do it all 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.890
 So dictate just google use 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.450
 For example, if I say google okay 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.430
 and then the big barack obama or 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.170
 something like that will happen to me as well 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.240
 what is spent right on the clock 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.590
 pro features for so why should 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.090
 I get one number one 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.400
 of course I am happy I am 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.659
 networked it is somehow cool and 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.470
 somehow I'm a little bit in the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.520
 future in it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.840
 I get those too fast 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.250
 here on this site so that's the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.049
 means I can the notification 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.630
 see without looking at my phone and 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.040
 that much higher in society 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.150
 accepted as if i got my cellphone out 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.380
 get it right in the middle of it all 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.570
 interrupt conversation or something 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.670
 therefore as notification display 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.990
 and also for the weather 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.270
 for example, how warm it is cold or something 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.829
 which perfectly suited for wonderful 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.930
 however, the facts speak against it 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.320
 from the price 200 euro now here for one 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.030
 ltp watch that is already expensive you have to 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.860
 So you can not say otherwise 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.689
 and that's the thing too 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.100
 immature so we have problems like 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.030
 at the connection aborts we have however 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.350
 also a mature one 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.670
 operating systems there are still many 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.979
 where you can improve 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.209
 There are few apps that are battery life 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.319
 with own tag short and I have to do it myself 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.500
 if I want to load the thing then if 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.610
 I 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.590
 somewhere has to indulge thus still 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.210
 carry this ladebeck so that I can 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.880
 can load things without problems because of it 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.250
 even has no connection at the clock 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.340
 directly without an external and a 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.380
 to load special charger and that 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.240
 Well, that would be cool if you 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.580
 just here, for example, easy 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.020
 could insert the micro usb plug 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.940
 Of course, it does not look so stylish 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.900
 the place away, etc. but it would be practical 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.550
 I always have to do this 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.870
 charging cradle now specially with me 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.520
 lead and last but not least mine 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.900
 cellphone actually anyway the whole time 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.390
 The clock will work for you 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.500
 regardless of the time or 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.940
 maybe a few apps I have here 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.350
 on it has a game or something but 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.880
 otherwise I always have the cell phone with me 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.440
 have the need to be connected 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.459
 otherwise there is nothing I come 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.480
 not the internet I can not 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.850
 retrieve information 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.560
 no nothing you need the phone 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.570
 all time now is the question 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.850
 are you these features I the you 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.620
 just called 200 euro worth or 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.570
 depending on how much the clock cost the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.980
 you like to buy asus said 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.510
 they also want to like a 100 euro 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.370
 We'll take a look at smart watch house 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.590
 something there at the end of the year later in the year 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.720
 but still comes out these are you 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.670
 features the 200 euro for eg a lg 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.049
 watch swords or would you like that 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.920
 a lot of money is about these features 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.110
 to get now 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.820
 If so, then it is clear for you then 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.010
 buy such a thing that's great 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.330
 that it waits wonderfully no 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.280
 I'd rather wait a few more months 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.170
 wait until there are more apps out there 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.489
 we can see where at first 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.540
 The thing really needed us 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.400
 actually no longer ask the question 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.170
 but have to say okay that's real 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.580
 practically when I get this off and this 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.140
 I can personally ask for myself 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.030
 do not answer yes that is 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.470
 This device is nice but it will 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.269
 go back because well I see the meaning 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.120
 not yet it is not me 200 euro 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.220
 worth it in everyday life 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.780
 to do something 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.950
 yes I hope so you can ask your 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.989
 answer what you need the thing 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.400
 and if you should buy yourself as me 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.310
 'm excited you want to set you end 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.780
 if yes which lg watch the samsung 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.640
 life or maybe a motor for 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.350
 six or maybe something completely different 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.250
 I'll come out later in the year 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.570
 I'm so excited 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.430
 I look forward to your answers below 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.269
 in the comments as we move to the next 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.269
 video again makes it good 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.860
 the
