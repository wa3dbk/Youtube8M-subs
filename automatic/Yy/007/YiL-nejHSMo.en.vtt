00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.990
 Hello, good morning, I'm going to all of you 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.320
 teach how to cut oranges and you can 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.830
 use the same technique for grapefruit 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.809
 crowns and oranges and good I love you 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.810
 teach how to do it because I was 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.990
 looking on youtube and I did not see that they had 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.650
 good videos in spanish yes dÃ­az some 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.170
 videos in English but I found nothing 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.529
 good in Spanish so well so that 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.739
 those who prefer instruction in 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.030
 Spanish here we are and I know that a lot 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.940
 people are sometimes lazy to eat 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.200
 oranges because good sometimes it 's more 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.510
 easy to eat an apple one thing that is 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.930
 I can eat with everything and skin and not 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.949
 you need no utensil but the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.860
 truth is that the orange is delicious 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.880
 especially when it is 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.770
 because when you eat cold with everything and your 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.920
 juice 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.110
 I feel it's something that satisfies me is 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.570
 Super sweet without having to add 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.450
 no sugar 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.270
 and many times I do not eat breakfast 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.340
 as a snack and you can see here I have 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.440
 this knife that uses it only for 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.630
 split the oranges in half never 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.240
 you want to cut here you always want 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.340
 cut it like this and you can use any 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.740
 knife 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.219
 to get the fruit you will want a 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.049
 Sharp knife 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.329
 any knife so have a 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.420
 good tip and that is younger a 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.010
 sharp important to have the sharp you 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.080
 Will serve 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.850
 some seeds you will find them 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.730
 as it is cutting but those that 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.350
 are on top you can take them out and what 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.830
 I do it is very simple at an angle 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:01.290
 not not straight like that but I make an angle 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.290
 I'm cutting around 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.880
 and I make a circle 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.530
 very easy and do not worry this is left 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.920
 connected on the bottom and now 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.600
 we see that the orange has its lines 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:28.130
 here dividers one goes cutting inside 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.170
 of these lines and is taking out the fruit 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.450
 now I always when I work in the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.120
 kitchen I always have some pots 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.390
 to put the trash as I go 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.030
 cutting and one to put the fruit to 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.970
 as I'm cutting so I put 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.580
 this here on top as is the camera a 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.360
 little bit and I'm cutting and I'm going 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.360
 here 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.020
 and as we already made a circle around 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.080
 these little triangles come out 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.810
 super fast super easy and not you 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.050
 worry about taking out all the fruit they are going to 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.040
 be a few insignificant bits 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.549
 in there it does not matter 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.620
 what we want is to get the majority here 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.390
 I have one seed I put in the other 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.230
 vessel that I had garbage and I continue 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.480
 cutting up 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.780
 when I finish if there is another seed 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.680
 with a teaspoon the sack only takes about 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.900
 seconds 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.959
 for people who are too lazy to eat 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.579
 grapefruit the oranges this makes it super 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.819
 easy ok 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.590
 there I took out the remaining fruit 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.489
 fruit is some juice 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.950
 there is very simply I take out that juice what 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.730
 with my spoon I will eat the orange 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.090
 and also all that delicious juice some 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.910
 people have 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:03.550
 Primers can use a juicer 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.550
 like this one you put the orange 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.580
 and it's raw 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.660
 to get everything out and not spend anything 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.510
 but it does not matter if you do not have the 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.750
 juicer the hands work very well 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.480
 if you are a person who does not have much 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.670
 strength in your hands or that costs you 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.250
 do this action for arthritis by 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.340
 anything the teeth work very 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.340
 all right 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.260
 so very simple 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.630
 smile 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.930
 or not 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.189
 wei low 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:44.039
 alone and while they are not the life of someone 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:47.039
 more different for its vision to be organ 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.039
 do not 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.540
 have the sea 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.880
 There are many things you can do with 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.820
 You can put this in the blender and 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.160
 take it as juice with or without other fruits 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.770
 you can school it and drink from the juice and 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.290
 eat you affect them separately what 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.230
 you can freeze it freezes 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.240
 for a couple of hours and every hour what 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.100
 mix a little bit so that the 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.440
 crystals are small and you can 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.660
 eat like a semi fred or a semi 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.810

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.540
 You can eat it with the pieces 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:35.360
 Juice is also delicious and ximo
