00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 you follow the soloist for three years 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.519
 not suitable thereby lighter 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.469
 Parking or suggestions were warm 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.820
 welcome love bio friends and children 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.799
 over three years to a brand new 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.000
 we open with dave i am dave 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.380
 and this is a fragmentary crowd 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.390
 then goes on buy I wanted the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.740
 age cut of my target audience due 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.289
 of speech and title of today 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.000
 Correct videos down a bit 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.250
 which of course is not true that I have 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.140
 not before and it also gives me from the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.420
 drinking habits of the potential 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.930
 growing beer drinker generation 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.100
 to influence in any way 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.390
 Rather, I want the feathers still 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.800
 to puzzle what your children this 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.329
 year under the Christmas tree crackle 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.960
 give a tip on the way 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.860
 lego because lego is not quite 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.420
 selfless gift as it is today 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.010
 hopefully will show off lego 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:01:01.020
 wonderful to open 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:03.329
 Nevertheless , it starts against lego today 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.129
 make clever we start the whole way 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.900
 just tell the ones without 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.439
 Construction knowledge to open 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.700
 are 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.229
 of course, a bit longer and of course 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.450
 reasonably stable parts 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:21.360
 That should not be a problem at all 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.189
 Assumed that is quite good so those 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.430
 Parts are definitely less suitable 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.500
 suitable certainly such a thing as 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.340
 he makes you slim 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.810
 even if today's generation 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.400
 maybe not that much anymore 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.210
 maybe nothing with lego 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.220
 no idea 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.590
 the educational value of lego is on 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.240
 in any case indisputable and natural 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.600
 no lego also an educational one 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.850
 namely fulfill function if that 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.460
 little child arrive says look daddy 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.220
 has done to be very proud 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.220
 plane then the dad can judge 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:06.390
 Freud, he makes a lot cooler than happy 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.950
 just the sleeve with one 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.020
 single Legostein is to be lifted 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.640
 Of course, from Lego to build the opener 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.440
 the whole thing would not be that easy 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.440
 still has lego of that time or else 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.440
 children have the lego arm or still with 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.220
 Lego always plays the whole time 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.790
 try out 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.830
 I myself still open then and 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.720
 have three misconstructions behind me 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.890
 I now have two potential openers 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.420
 here are the hopefully 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.780
 work on the one hand this thin 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.000
 simple things and on the other hand this one 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.750
 simple but massive thing one of them 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.760
 will be good 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.880
 we'll try it out with the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.490
 partly less promising 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:52.080
 I thought to myself how it tastes jammed 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:57.570
 the sleeve so that is not so 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:02.870
 So the open works properly 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:05.510
 as good as expected not at all 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.530
 That's why we take this simple one 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.100
 thought it's natural he will 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.090
 used 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.090
 the part is coming 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:19.650
 and there is not as good as everything 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.150
 So this works too 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.260
 actually a gardener makes good eyes 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.360
 this opener, however, relatively 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.130
 have is boring and unspectacular 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.930
 I thought I needed one more 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.930
 Another looks like that if that 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.840
 I do not know how I work either 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.670
 also do not know how much power 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.110
 strictly necessary is the 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.670
 sleeve to open properly 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.020
 Of course it is thought that it is there 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.940
 Hippel inscribed the mourning too 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.390
 Hold firmly so that the lid is as possible 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.600
 rises 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.560
 if the bomb develops enough power here 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:02.670
 we'll see through the whole thing witty 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.690
 and that's right that bends 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.010
 his looks through 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.550
 The cylinder is already at the bottom and 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.550
 Here's just the whole thing 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.550
 bent 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.660
 the problem with the lego share is it 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.310
 Of course, only plaster should travel when 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.930
 you slipped two times three times then 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.970
 then not many bars will happen 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:44.220
 there are those shopping in the edge that 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:47.010
 she is no longer fit and friend yes there 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.250
 I'm the way to end it too 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.650
 The fleet is bubbling around 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.450
 a few degrees or I would have the lever 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.550
 put something different but then probably 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.750
 even enough in turn, not by virtue of a 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.270
 problem-all again from the 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.270
 completely opposite 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:15.699
 Go on but after a little bit 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.860
 still work the lever somewhat strengthened 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.710
 and slightly offset, let's see if 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.379
 that is now enough for the bottle yes 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.020
 actually already shown now 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:41.169
 completely cancel 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:44.379
 it really does not make us that 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.599
 but that's how you surely seen 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:48.330
 lego is quite open 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.460
 and not too bad 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.490
 Of course, open a simple one is possible 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.139
 parts work without problems and one 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.759
 or other times the drive thinks 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.759
 There are 24 people left 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.669
 clarified I hope we see each other in the 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.639
 next episode again 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.639
 until then need
