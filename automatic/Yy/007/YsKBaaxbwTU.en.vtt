the<00:01:05.950> fish<00:01:06.130> actually<00:01:06.370> grouped<00:01:06.820> together<00:01:06.940> and

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
the fish actually grouped together and

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.050 
the fish actually grouped together and
the<00:01:08.170> reason<00:01:08.410> for<00:01:08.590> that<00:01:08.650> is<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.460> aquatic<00:01:09.820> plant

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
the reason for that is the aquatic plant

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.780 
the reason for that is the aquatic plant
life<00:01:10.240> is<00:01:10.450> all<00:01:10.600> dying<00:01:10.869> off<00:01:11.170> and<00:01:11.410> they<00:01:12.310> really<00:01:12.610> go

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
life is all dying off and they really go

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.910 
life is all dying off and they really go
where<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.119> food<00:01:13.270> sources<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:14.080> because<00:01:14.710> the

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
where the food sources and because the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.790 
where the food sources and because the
forage<00:01:15.670> you<00:01:16.150> shot<00:01:16.479> your<00:01:16.750> minnows<00:01:17.110> that<00:01:17.530> crepe

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
forage you shot your minnows that crepe

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.190 
forage you shot your minnows that crepe

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
this time of year as it holds the heat a

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.410 
this time of year as it holds the heat a
lot<00:01:56.440> better<00:01:56.679> than<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:56.920> sparse<00:01:57.220> wheat<00:01:57.550> if<00:01:58.179> you

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
lot better than the sparse wheat if you

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.960 
lot better than the sparse wheat if you
find<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.810> dense<00:01:59.080> area<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.679> milf<00:01:59.950> oil<00:02:00.250> make<00:02:00.789> sure

find a dense area of milf oil make sure

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.029 
find a dense area of milf oil make sure
you<00:02:01.119> concentrate<00:02:01.750> on<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:02.080> and<00:02:02.319> really<00:02:02.830> pick

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
you concentrate on that and really pick

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.800 
you concentrate on that and really pick
it<00:02:03.069> apart<00:02:03.250> you'll<00:02:03.970> also<00:02:04.149> notice<00:02:04.479> that<00:02:04.599> the

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
it apart you'll also notice that the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.359 
it apart you'll also notice that the
thick<00:02:05.020> milk<00:02:05.289> oil<00:02:05.470> is<00:02:05.679> going<00:02:05.830> to<00:02:05.920> be<00:02:05.979> healthy

thick milk oil is going to be healthy

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.520 
thick milk oil is going to be healthy
which<00:02:06.819> means<00:02:07.090> it'll<00:02:07.270> hold<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.599> forage<00:02:08.020> if<00:02:08.380> the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
which means it'll hold the forage if the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.870 
which means it'll hold the forage if the
forage<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.039> there<00:02:09.250> then<00:02:09.490> there's<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.729> really

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
forage is there then there's a really

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.610 
forage is there then there's a really

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
good chance that those big schools of

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:20.940 
good chance that those big schools of
fish<00:02:11.770> are<00:02:11.950> gonna<00:02:12.040> be<00:02:12.130> there
