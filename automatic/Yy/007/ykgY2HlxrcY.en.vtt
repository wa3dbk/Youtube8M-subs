00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.500 
mistake of my first one to count the
stock<00:00:27.810> because<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> stock<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.670> incredibly

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
stock because the stock is so incredibly

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.299 
stock because the stock is so incredibly
overpowered<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.679> it's<00:00:31.830> pointless

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
overpowered that it's pointless

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.720 
overpowered that it's pointless
comparing<00:00:33.030> anything<00:00:33.870> else<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> stock

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
comparing anything else to the stock

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.470 
comparing anything else to the stock
stock<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.880> amazing

and honestly if I can do to the stock in

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.400 
and honestly if I can do to the stock in
this<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.120> well<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.480> would<00:00:39.690> immediately<00:00:39.989> go

with<00:01:43.290> me<00:01:43.680> -<00:01:43.799> emo<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.670> 25%<00:01:45.329> damage<00:01:45.869> penalty

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
with me - emo is the 25% damage penalty

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.280 
with me - emo is the 25% damage penalty
the<00:01:47.040> 25%<00:01:47.549> down<00:01:47.820> penalty<00:01:48.299> actually<00:01:48.509> leads<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.170> a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the 25% down penalty actually leads to a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.330 
the 25% down penalty actually leads to a
few<00:01:49.649> serious<00:01:50.220> problems<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.600> example

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
few serious problems like for example

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.770 
few serious problems like for example
most<00:01:53.340> situations<00:01:53.579> where<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.299> would<00:01:54.479> kill

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
most situations where you would kill

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.889 
most situations where you would kill
them<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.740> don't<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.880> thankfully<00:01:57.329> Tasha<00:01:57.570> is

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
them you don't but thankfully Tasha is

them you don't but thankfully Tasha is
it's<00:01:58.079> pretty<00:01:58.530> much<00:01:58.680> centered<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.430> shooting<00:01:59.969> as

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
it's pretty much centered on shooting as

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.380 
it's pretty much centered on shooting as
much<00:02:00.930> as<00:02:01.200> possible<00:02:01.469> as<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:03.210> more

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
much as possible as in the more

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.940 
much as possible as in the more
consistent<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.020> are<00:02:04.110> at<00:02:04.380> shooting<00:02:04.770> with<00:02:04.920> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
consistent you are at shooting with a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.770 
consistent you are at shooting with a
minigun<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.000> more<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.299> hit<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
minigun like the more you hit and the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.570 
minigun like the more you hit and the
less<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.110> miss<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.950> better<00:02:08.129> you'll<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.489> with

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
less you miss the better you'll do with

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.619 
less you miss the better you'll do with
the<00:02:08.640> Natasha<00:02:09.000> because<00:02:09.300> you'll<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.509> get

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the Natasha because you'll just get

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.190 
the Natasha because you'll just get
consist

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
consist

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.170 
consist
high-damage<00:02:10.649> doesn't<00:02:11.520> really<00:02:11.670> matter<00:02:11.940> and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
high-damage doesn't really matter and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.970 
high-damage doesn't really matter and
you'll<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.480> more<00:02:12.690> ammo<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.319> use<00:02:13.530> with<00:02:13.770> that

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
you'll have more ammo to use with that

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.190 
you'll have more ammo to use with that
and<00:02:14.220> they<00:02:15.180> will<00:02:15.269> be<00:02:15.390> able<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.569> dodge<00:02:15.810> if<00:02:16.110> you

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and they will be able to dodge if you

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.170 
and they will be able to dodge if you
get<00:02:16.349> them<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.620> first<00:02:16.769> place<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:18.060> only

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
get them in the first place the only

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.729 
get them in the first place the only
thing<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.629> is<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.959> spin<00:02:19.200> up<00:02:19.319> time<00:02:19.530> but<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
thing is is the spin up time but the

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.050 
thing is is the spin up time but the
spin<00:02:19.890> up<00:02:19.950> time<00:02:20.160> isn't<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:20.700> big<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:20.940> deal

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
spin up time isn't that big a deal

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.309 
spin up time isn't that big a deal
considering<00:02:21.540> all<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.780> rest<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.050> them<00:02:22.170> have

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
considering all the rest of them have

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.530 
considering all the rest of them have
pretty<00:02:22.590> shitty<00:02:22.860> spit<00:02:23.069> up<00:02:23.160> times<00:02:23.370> as<00:02:23.519> well<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
pretty shitty spit up times as well the

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.030 
pretty shitty spit up times as well the
damage<00:02:24.989> penalty<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.349> kind<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.680> big<00:02:25.860> one

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
damage penalty is kind of the big one

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.370 
damage penalty is kind of the big one
but<00:02:26.340> really<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:27.030> recommend<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.840> natascha

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
but really I recommend the natascha

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
when I first played this game anyway the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.570 
when I first played this game anyway the
next<00:02:40.140> weapon<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.500> list<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.129> brass

next weapon in the list is the brass

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.640 
next weapon in the list is the brass
beasts<00:02:41.910> now<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:42.599> actually<00:02:42.959> used<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.470> brass

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
beasts now I actually used the brass

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.960 
beasts now I actually used the brass
piece<00:02:43.860> for<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.130> very<00:02:44.370> long<00:02:44.549> time<00:02:44.819> when<00:02:44.910> I

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
piece for a very long time when I

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.339 
piece for a very long time when I
started<00:02:45.299> off<00:02:45.390> as<00:02:45.510> heavy<00:02:45.660> before<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:46.080> stopped

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
started off as heavy before I stopped

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.289 
started off as heavy before I stopped
using<00:02:46.500> heavy<00:02:46.769> altogether<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:48.180> only

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
using heavy altogether and the only

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.280 
using heavy altogether and the only
reason<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.510> really<00:02:48.540> did<00:02:48.930> was<00:02:49.019> because<00:02:49.230> I

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
reason I really did was because I

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.710 
reason I really did was because I
enjoyed<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.769> damage<00:02:50.519> bonus<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:51.030> was<00:02:51.209> kind

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
enjoyed the damage bonus that was kind

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.080 
enjoyed the damage bonus that was kind
of<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.290> damage<00:02:52.500> bonus<00:02:52.739> really<00:02:53.670> makes<00:02:54.000> a

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
of it the damage bonus really makes a

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.210 
of it the damage bonus really makes a

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
with the brass piece which is probably

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.300 
with the brass piece which is probably
what<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.230> should<00:03:07.319> know<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.709> lot<00:03:07.829> fast<00:03:08.099> when

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
what I should know it's a lot fast when

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.550 
what I should know it's a lot fast when
I<00:03:08.370> was<00:03:08.459> first<00:03:08.610> playing<00:03:08.880> heavy<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.690> you

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
I was first playing heavy is that you

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.490 
I was first playing heavy is that you
literally<00:03:11.549> are<00:03:11.910> like<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.150> statue<00:03:12.690> when<00:03:13.349> you

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
literally are like a statue when you

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.259 
literally are like a statue when you
when<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:13.860> spin<00:03:14.160> up<00:03:14.190> with<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.850> bias<00:03:15.030> beast

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
when you spin up with the bias beast

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.300 
when you spin up with the bias beast
like<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.079> spin<00:03:16.260> up<00:03:16.350> time<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:16.769> a<00:03:16.829> pain<00:03:17.160> in<00:03:17.280> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
like the spin up time is a pain in the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.550 
like the spin up time is a pain in the
ass<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.790> it's<00:03:17.940> difficult<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.569> chill<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.440> be

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
ass and it's difficult to chill to be

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.500 
ass and it's difficult to chill to be
ready<00:03:19.799> against<00:03:20.130> certain<00:03:20.370> enemies<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:20.970> really

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
ready against certain enemies but really

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.050 
ready against certain enemies but really
the<00:03:22.019> big<00:03:22.260> one<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:23.069> slower<00:03:23.370> spin<00:03:23.730> up<00:03:23.850> time

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
the big one is the slower spin up time

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.750 
the big one is the slower spin up time
because<00:03:24.269> when<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.600> set<00:03:25.290> up<00:03:25.319> your<00:03:25.760> perimeters

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
because when you set up your perimeters

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.940 
because when you set up your perimeters
and<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:27.090> bring<00:03:27.480> down<00:03:27.600> your<00:03:27.660> minigun<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.799> are

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
and you bring down your minigun you are

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.390 
and you bring down your minigun you are
moving<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.569> slowly<00:03:31.049> like<00:03:31.380> every<00:03:31.920> class<00:03:32.130> can

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
moving so so slowly like every class can

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.270 
moving so so slowly like every class can
kill<00:03:32.579> you<00:03:32.670> especially<00:03:33.209> demos<00:03:33.780> demos<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:35.010> just

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
kill you especially demos demos you just

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.129 
kill you especially demos demos you just
they're<00:03:35.459> breakfast<00:03:36.120> usually<00:03:36.329> stages<00:03:36.870> fire

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
they're breakfast usually stages fire

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.840 
they're breakfast usually stages fire
out<00:03:37.319> a<00:03:37.350> few<00:03:37.590> semi-circular<00:03:38.160> bomb<00:03:38.519> launches

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
out a few semi-circular bomb launches

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.629 
out a few semi-circular bomb launches
and<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.120> are<00:03:39.269> dead<00:03:39.630> immediately<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:41.190> are<00:03:41.250> not

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
and you are dead immediately you are not

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.430 
and you are dead immediately you are not
gonna<00:03:41.819> survive<00:03:42.150> against<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.480> demo<00:03:42.690> the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
gonna survive against the demo the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.280 
gonna survive against the demo the
soldier<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:45.000> pyro<00:03:45.420> maybe<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:46.019> might<00:03:46.139> get

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
soldier of a pyro maybe you might get

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.140 
soldier of a pyro maybe you might get
away<00:03:46.380> with<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.950> scout<00:03:47.220> your<00:03:47.370> party<00:03:47.639> beat<00:03:47.819> and

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
away with the scout your party beat and

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.930 
away with the scout your party beat and
that's<00:03:48.690> kind<00:03:48.900> of<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.079> you<00:03:49.380> know<00:03:49.560> scouts<00:03:50.400> don't

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
that's kind of it you know scouts don't

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.099 
that's kind of it you know scouts don't
have<00:03:51.030> much<00:03:51.180> trouble<00:03:51.359> against<00:03:51.690> them<00:03:51.870> but

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
have much trouble against them but

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.780 
have much trouble against them but
really<00:03:52.590> any<00:03:52.769> classes<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.430> can<00:03:53.579> take

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
really any classes that can take

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.729 
really any classes that can take
advantage<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.269> your<00:03:54.420> lack<00:03:54.569> of<00:03:54.599> ability<00:03:55.019> would

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
advantage of your lack of ability would

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.349 
advantage of your lack of ability would
be<00:03:55.859> a<00:03:55.889> serious<00:03:56.549> problem<00:03:56.819> for<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.180> grants

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
be a serious problem for the grants

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.020 
be a serious problem for the grants
beast<00:03:57.630> but<00:03:58.410> if<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:59.130> don't<00:03:59.310> mind<00:03:59.579> being

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
beast but if you don't mind being

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.940 
beast but if you don't mind being
basically<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.690> statue<00:04:00.930> moving<00:04:01.380> around<00:04:01.590> doing

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
basically a statue moving around doing

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.800 
basically a statue moving around doing
nothing<00:04:01.980> then<00:04:02.549> I<00:04:02.849> recommend<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.389> back<00:04:03.540> piece

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
nothing then I recommend the back piece

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.569 
nothing then I recommend the back piece
because<00:04:04.139> the<00:04:04.319> damage<00:04:04.680> actually<00:04:04.920> does<00:04:05.310> mean

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
because the damage actually does mean

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:06.890 
because the damage actually does mean
something<00:04:05.609> especially<00:04:06.510> against<00:04:06.750> other

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
something especially against other

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.289 
something especially against other
heavies<00:04:07.319> because<00:04:07.950> when<00:04:08.099> the<00:04:08.220> heavy<00:04:08.489> basically

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
heavies because when the heavy basically

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.670 
heavies because when the heavy basically
when<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:09.510> against<00:04:09.780> just<00:04:10.049> normal<00:04:10.410> heavies

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
when you against just normal heavies

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.920 
when you against just normal heavies
it's<00:04:11.069> basically<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.489> stop<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.209> you're<00:04:12.720> waiting

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
it's basically a stop and you're waiting

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.659 
it's basically a stop and you're waiting
of<00:04:13.260> which<00:04:13.590> minigun<00:04:14.040> could<00:04:14.190> do<00:04:14.280> more<00:04:14.459> damage

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
of which minigun could do more damage

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.180 
of which minigun could do more damage
and<00:04:14.940> like<00:04:15.180> that's<00:04:16.049> where<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.380> natasha<00:04:16.739> falls

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
and like that's where the natasha falls

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.069 
and like that's where the natasha falls
this<00:04:17.579> is<00:04:17.700> where<00:04:17.849> the<00:04:17.970> bias<00:04:18.180> be<00:04:18.390> shines<00:04:18.780> because

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
this is where the bias be shines because

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.610 
this is where the bias be shines because
you<00:04:19.229> can<00:04:19.349> just<00:04:19.440> kill<00:04:19.769> any<00:04:20.310> other<00:04:20.700> heavy

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
you can just kill any other heavy

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.290 
you can just kill any other heavy
that<00:04:21.769> doesn't<00:04:22.130> have<00:04:22.220> manic<00:04:22.520> on<00:04:22.639> it<00:04:22.760> obviously

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
that doesn't have manic on it obviously

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.890 
that doesn't have manic on it obviously
and<00:04:23.630> no<00:04:24.470> bother<00:04:24.740> if<00:04:24.949> your<00:04:25.190> bass<00:04:25.340> beast<00:04:25.900> the

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
and no bother if your bass beast the

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.600 
and no bother if your bass beast the
next<00:04:27.169> one<00:04:27.320> is<00:04:27.530> actually<00:04:27.860> an<00:04:28.100> interesting<00:04:28.490> idea

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
next one is actually an interesting idea

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.100 
next one is actually an interesting idea
because<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.180> first<00:04:29.389> two<00:04:29.600> were<00:04:29.690> just<00:04:29.810> kind<00:04:30.080> of

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
because the first two were just kind of

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.719 
because the first two were just kind of
messing<00:04:30.470> around<00:04:30.560> with<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.889> stats<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.490> the

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
messing around with the stats of the

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.909 
messing around with the stats of the
minigun<00:04:32.240> but<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.840> Thomas<00:04:33.169> lab<00:04:33.350> actually<00:04:33.590> does

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
minigun but the Thomas lab actually does

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.050 
minigun but the Thomas lab actually does
something<00:04:34.220> pretty<00:04:34.400> cool

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
something pretty cool

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.820 
something pretty cool
the<00:04:35.360> Thomas<00:04:35.720> lab<00:04:35.930> which<00:04:36.169> is<00:04:36.290> next<00:04:36.470> on<00:04:36.590> dark

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
the Thomas lab which is next on dark

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.520 
the Thomas lab which is next on dark
nord<00:04:37.130> has<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.610> fifth<00:04:37.970> 10%<00:04:38.630> faster<00:04:38.840> spin<00:04:39.199> up<00:04:39.290> time

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
nord has a fifth 10% faster spin up time

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.120 
nord has a fifth 10% faster spin up time
and<00:04:39.830> it's<00:04:40.340> completely<00:04:40.970> silent<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:42.440> silent

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
and it's completely silent the silent

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.830 
and it's completely silent the silent
past<00:04:43.370> what<00:04:43.639> really<00:04:43.880> makes<00:04:44.240> it<00:04:44.389> cool<00:04:44.630> of<00:04:44.810> course

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
past what really makes it cool of course

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.960 
past what really makes it cool of course
there's<00:04:45.260> a<00:04:45.320> minus<00:04:45.620> 20%<00:04:45.830> slower<00:04:46.280> firing<00:04:46.729> speed

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
there's a minus 20% slower firing speed

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.810 
there's a minus 20% slower firing speed
so<00:04:47.449> it's<00:04:47.600> not<00:04:47.750> as<00:04:48.080> powerful<00:04:48.410> but<00:04:49.280> I<00:04:49.520> don't

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
so it's not as powerful but I don't

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.250 
so it's not as powerful but I don't
think<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:50.030> power<00:04:50.210> really<00:04:50.419> matters<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:50.990> think

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
think the power really matters I think

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.620 
think the power really matters I think
what<00:04:51.740> you<00:04:51.860> have<00:04:52.100> is<00:04:52.160> heavy<00:04:52.580> is<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.210> element<00:04:53.570> of

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
what you have is heavy is the element of

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.540 
what you have is heavy is the element of

the Thomas laughs you'd be surprised how

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.830 
the Thomas laughs you'd be surprised how
little<00:05:00.289> the<00:05:01.039> firing<00:05:01.400> speed<00:05:01.639> means<00:05:01.850> when<00:05:02.479> you

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
little the firing speed means when you

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.260 
little the firing speed means when you
already<00:05:03.410> have<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.860> first<00:05:04.070> few<00:05:04.460> hits<00:05:04.699> like

mostly but you're playing it's a team

mostly but you're playing it's a team
and<00:05:07.130> they<00:05:07.190> don't<00:05:07.550> know<00:05:07.699> you<00:05:07.760> there<00:05:07.970> initially

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
and they don't know you there initially

they're not gonna know until they're

they're not gonna know until they're

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
almost dead because the sound of the

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.140 
almost dead because the sound of the
minigun<00:05:12.620> isn't<00:05:12.889> there<00:05:13.100> and<00:05:13.400> they<00:05:13.729> won't<00:05:13.910> know

reason<00:05:20.870> it's<00:05:21.080> a<00:05:21.229> very<00:05:21.500> very<00:05:21.770> effective<00:05:22.310> weapon

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
reason it's a very very effective weapon

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.520 
reason it's a very very effective weapon
I<00:05:22.789> think<00:05:23.240> it's<00:05:23.419> probably<00:05:23.630> the<00:05:23.840> most<00:05:23.900> effective

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
I think it's probably the most effective

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.279 
I think it's probably the most effective
heavy<00:05:25.070> weapon<00:05:25.460> but<00:05:25.820> I<00:05:25.880> will<00:05:26.150> be<00:05:26.539> telling<00:05:26.780> my

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
heavy weapon but I will be telling my

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.360 
heavy weapon but I will be telling my
favorite<00:05:27.770> one<00:05:27.919> in<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.490> end<00:05:28.669> but<00:05:29.330> for<00:05:30.139> now

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
favorite one in the end but for now

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.770 
favorite one in the end but for now
probably<00:05:31.370> I'm<00:05:31.490> gonna<00:05:31.610> say<00:05:31.849> it's<00:05:32.150> a<00:05:32.240> Thomas<00:05:32.630> lap

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
probably I'm gonna say it's a Thomas lap

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.330 
probably I'm gonna say it's a Thomas lap
is<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:33.050> most<00:05:33.200> effective<00:05:33.680> on<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:33.979> fact<00:05:34.220> that

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
is the most effective on the fact that

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.180 
is the most effective on the fact that
it's<00:05:34.550> just<00:05:34.700> the<00:05:35.389> silence<00:05:35.780> really<00:05:36.590> does<00:05:36.860> mess

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
it's just the silence really does mess

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.010 
it's just the silence really does mess
with<00:05:37.430> most<00:05:37.700> classes<00:05:38.210> like<00:05:38.360> scouts<00:05:38.690> and

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
with most classes like scouts and

with most classes like scouts and
soldiers<00:05:39.470> and<00:05:39.500> demos<00:05:39.919> most<00:05:40.729> of<00:05:40.910> those<00:05:41.000> classes

soldiers and demos most of those classes

soldiers and demos most of those classes
if<00:05:41.660> they<00:05:41.690> don't<00:05:41.930> see<00:05:42.139> coming<00:05:42.380> especially

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
if they don't see coming especially

if they don't see coming especially
medics<00:05:43.370> it's<00:05:43.789> very<00:05:44.120> good<00:05:44.270> for<00:05:44.450> taking<00:05:44.630> our

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
medics it's very good for taking our

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.270 
medics it's very good for taking our
medics<00:05:45.169> before<00:05:45.410> the<00:05:45.500> heavy<00:05:45.680> Nova<00:05:45.919> there

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
medics before the heavy Nova there

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.460 
medics before the heavy Nova there
that's<00:05:46.880> where<00:05:47.330> it<00:05:47.450> comes<00:05:47.630> out<00:05:47.780> very<00:05:48.020> cool<00:05:48.260> and

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
that's where it comes out very cool and

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.990 
that's where it comes out very cool and
ambushing<00:05:49.130> is<00:05:49.250> a<00:05:49.280> great<00:05:49.490> thing<00:05:49.669> for<00:05:49.700> it<00:05:49.910> as

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
ambushing is a great thing for it as

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.129 
ambushing is a great thing for it as
well<00:05:50.150> as<00:05:50.240> if<00:05:50.330> you<00:05:50.360> drove<00:05:50.539> off<00:05:50.690> from<00:05:50.840> a<00:05:50.870> corner

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
well as if you drove off from a corner

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.409 
well as if you drove off from a corner
and<00:05:51.260> kill<00:05:51.440> them<00:05:51.620> moving<00:05:52.220> on<00:05:52.550> to<00:05:52.789> the<00:05:52.910> last<00:05:53.120> one

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
and kill them moving on to the last one

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.570 
and kill them moving on to the last one
because<00:05:54.050> I<00:05:54.440> know<00:05:54.680> I'm<00:05:54.979> moving<00:05:55.130> on<00:05:55.370> pretty

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
because I know I'm moving on pretty

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.890 
because I know I'm moving on pretty
quickly<00:05:55.820> here<00:05:56.090> but<00:05:56.270> because<00:05:56.539> there's<00:05:56.750> four

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
quickly here but because there's four

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.300 
quickly here but because there's four
weapons<00:05:57.080> to<00:05:57.349> get<00:05:57.470> through<00:05:57.620> and<00:05:57.740> I<00:05:57.770> want<00:05:57.949> to<00:05:58.039> get

weapons to get through and I want to get

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.500 
weapons to get through and I want to get
this<00:05:58.460> into<00:05:58.639> about<00:05:58.729> seven<00:05:59.180> or<00:05:59.270> eight<00:05:59.330> minutes

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
this into about seven or eight minutes

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.570 
this into about seven or eight minutes
hopefully<00:05:59.810> anyway<00:06:00.770> moving<00:06:01.010> on<00:06:01.280> to<00:06:01.370> the<00:06:01.460> last

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
hopefully anyway moving on to the last

one the who long he sure now the who
long<00:06:04.099> heater<00:06:04.840> it's<00:06:05.840> pretty<00:06:06.110> good<00:06:06.380> it's

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
long heater it's pretty good it's

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.589 
long heater it's pretty good it's
basically<00:06:07.039> the<00:06:07.400> stock<00:06:07.699> minigun<00:06:08.210> which<00:06:08.449> is

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
basically the stock minigun which is

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.180 
basically the stock minigun which is
which<00:06:08.810> is<00:06:08.930> it<00:06:09.050> which<00:06:09.139> sounds<00:06:09.380> alright<00:06:09.860> but<00:06:10.099> the

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
which is it which sounds alright but the

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.550 
which is it which sounds alright but the
thing<00:06:10.400> is<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:10.940> main<00:06:11.090> difference<00:06:11.510> is<00:06:11.720> six<00:06:12.169> ammo

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
thing is the main difference is six ammo

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.219 
thing is the main difference is six ammo
is<00:06:12.979> pretty<00:06:13.639> /<00:06:14.030> second<00:06:14.449> is<00:06:14.539> produced<00:06:14.960> when

is pretty / second is produced when

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:16.960 
is pretty / second is produced when
you're<00:06:15.380> spinning<00:06:15.560> up<00:06:15.830> now<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:16.520> reason<00:06:16.940> for

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
you're spinning up now the reason for

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.570 
you're spinning up now the reason for
that<00:06:17.180> is<00:06:17.660> the<00:06:18.349> huling<00:06:18.710> hicham<00:06:19.010> makes<00:06:19.190> a<00:06:19.310> ring

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
that is the huling hicham makes a ring

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.480 
that is the huling hicham makes a ring

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
of fire around you now that sounds kind

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.909 
of fire around you now that sounds kind

this is against spies this is where it

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.399 
this is against spies this is where it
works<00:06:30.590> because<00:06:31.159> spies<00:06:31.669> are<00:06:32.229> basically<00:06:33.229> their

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.409 
works because spies are basically their

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:35.620 
works because spies are basically their
heavies<00:06:33.710> worst<00:06:34.070> enemy<00:06:34.669> if<00:06:34.969> spies<00:06:35.300> are<00:06:35.510> gonna

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
heavies worst enemy if spies are gonna

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.020 
heavies worst enemy if spies are gonna
be

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
be

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.820 
be
like<00:06:36.240> if<00:06:36.480> you<00:06:36.660> a<00:06:36.720> spy<00:06:37.080> you're<00:06:37.470> gonna<00:06:37.560> kill

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
like if you a spy you're gonna kill

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.900 
like if you a spy you're gonna kill
heavies<00:06:38.100> first<00:06:38.430> because<00:06:38.700> they're<00:06:38.820> the

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
heavies first because they're the

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.360 
heavies first because they're the
easiest<00:06:39.090> target<00:06:39.780> gulong<00:06:40.230> heater<00:06:40.500> makes<00:06:41.160> it<00:06:41.280> a

easiest target gulong heater makes it a

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.840 
easiest target gulong heater makes it a
lot<00:06:41.700> harder<00:06:41.760> for<00:06:42.540> any<00:06:43.080> spy<00:06:43.470> you<00:06:43.920> spies<00:06:44.220> get<00:06:44.670> lit

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
lot harder for any spy you spies get lit

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.750 
lot harder for any spy you spies get lit
on<00:06:44.910> fire<00:06:44.970> and<00:06:45.510> any<00:06:45.900> spy<00:06:46.290> using<00:06:47.100> this<00:06:47.190> bicycle

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:49.920 
it's completely screwed it is if they

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.620 
it's completely screwed it is if they
try<00:06:50.070> to<00:06:50.130> get<00:06:50.280> close<00:06:50.520> to<00:06:50.550> a<00:06:50.820> spy<00:06:51.000> school<00:06:51.270> or<00:06:51.390> melt

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
and you're telling me spies I basically

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.700 
and you're telling me spies I basically
reason<00:07:00.540> why<00:07:00.600> this<00:07:00.660> is<00:07:00.930> amazing<00:07:01.380> because<00:07:01.530> it

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
reason why this is amazing because it

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.010 
reason why this is amazing because it
basically<00:07:01.860> it<00:07:02.400> works<00:07:02.940> against<00:07:03.300> spies<00:07:03.660> but

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 
basically it works against spies but

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.810 
basically it works against spies but
it's<00:07:04.170> based<00:07:04.350> in<00:07:04.530> the<00:07:04.590> stock<00:07:04.860> minigun<00:07:05.400> it

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:05.820 
it's based in the stock minigun it

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.090 
it's based in the stock minigun it
sounds<00:07:06.420> amazing<00:07:06.660> but<00:07:07.080> the<00:07:07.620> biggest<00:07:07.800> problem

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 
sounds amazing but the biggest problem

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.220 
sounds amazing but the biggest problem
that<00:07:08.400> the<00:07:08.460> hulong<00:07:08.760> heater<00:07:09.000> is<00:07:09.510> actually<00:07:10.020> how

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.230 
that the hulong heater is actually how

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.960 
that the hulong heater is actually how
fast<00:07:10.680> you've<00:07:10.980> run<00:07:11.160> out<00:07:11.190> of<00:07:11.280> bullets<00:07:11.520> with<00:07:11.850> it

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:11.970 
fast you've run out of bullets with it

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.380 
fast you've run out of bullets with it
