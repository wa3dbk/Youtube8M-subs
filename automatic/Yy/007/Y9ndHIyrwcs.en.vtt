00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.920
 well guys like always neither for killer 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.089
 that speaks to you is how you are also seeing 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.940
 today I am on ghost they are game of 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.359
 I make weapons and this video 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.039
 especially as a preview why 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.349
 I want to start a series on cost in 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.710
 all against all then free for all 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.559
 because I discovered that it hides from the classes 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.050
 v ie starter prizes ago and the class 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.640
 random and this thing I discovered from 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.140
 just saw that the opposite is not me I was there 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.570
 I bought immediately, in fact I bought them 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.539
 wife that is not so long ago today 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.280
 a month ago so I didn't know 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.079
 of the existence of that key that you 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.539
 generates random classes and therefore I would like 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.010
 make videos with random in classes 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.539
 all against all and I think he can 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.539
 come something very beautiful 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.570
 in this activity I played on the game 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.370
 of weapons and I was as I started 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.460
 very slowly even though there was a piece 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.110
 of sprint where he managed to make one 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.270
 I therefore manage to get a decent seat 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.950
 understand why I was aiming with the rifle a 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.600
 I knew how to pump and pump 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.340
 if stronger if they don't just tell me 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.350
 automatic transmission targeted with the viewfinder 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.850
 precisely once I admired it 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.890
 shocked and in this map 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.530
 honestly it's not that taken 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.270
 break is not my favorite because with 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.869
 all these plants and trees there 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.579
 I understand nothing and therefore if I don't have 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.500
 decent weapons like a certain point 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.780
 I will block with the mini cannes because 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.390
 besides being very slow 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.210
 the enemies are from far away seeing that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.729
 they were also ahead with the offices that I was 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.900
 I'm stuck in the American for a long time 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.610
 time and I have to say 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.860
 the enemies will buy it in vain enough 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.420
 not towards the started game but there has been 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.280
 a moment where everyone is behind 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.980
 at the corner electives hidden from the 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.660
 trees and that is not a very thing 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.310
 beautiful here now I arrive at mimicry 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.980
 also how did I not take 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.520
 what I am, too, I come to 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.780
 mini cannes 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.240
 hoping to overcome a lot 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.390
 quickly instead it begins to die 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.640
 very often it is also of continuation 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.560
 and that's something he did to me 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.350
 quite nervous because they saw 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.550
 the others that went up and for me great 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.670
 joy 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.260
 there is also that asshole of my ally 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.090
 snake that we are also in the same clan 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.400
 do not participate 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.950
 because you're strong and you do it on purpose 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.370
 so loses i make a shit figure on 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.890
 youtube 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.510
 instead he participates and I arrive too 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.280
 first of all I love you and hate you 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.770
 anyway nothing except this one 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.610
 small outburst of anger I remain common 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.830
 instead of this mini canada 255 octopus e 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.050
 then there is a certain point I didn't even play 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.430
 the more I looked at only the clock than the 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.709
 his right 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.570
 the player who was so accepted 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.709
 he said I walked a lot I walked dead there 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.660
 I do more 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.940
 and just as you can see by dying 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.810
 a lot in my opinion if I camp and ravo 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.730
 he could do some kill anyway and 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.340
 nothing just suffered the minicar 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.060
 unfortunately it is too late unfortunately 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:18.200
 too late what the fuck is ok it's too late 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.730
 and therefore loses a memory if I arrive if 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.120
 i'm wrong i should get second 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.250
 because I can recover but it's too much 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.840
 late to finish first 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.920
 anyway I hope you like the idea 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.530
 of the random class because of what I am 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.320
 seeing there is also many has many sides of 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.390
 tuber are still making these videos 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.100
 of ghost wants random class then 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.000
 maybe it could even be a bit boring 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.280
 from your part 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.450
 just that it's something I'd like to do 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.100
 why 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.410
 a really beautiful thing can come here 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.069
 too ethical as it's all in the air 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.870
 that asshole and that pixel with links 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.810
 because here I say who repeats it 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.980
 little am not used to playing 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.020
 especially rosico when I take the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.150
 heat marche I prefer a srx name 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.610
 at least I miss the blow I die prost i 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.270
 cabbage no like links that I miss it 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.340
 and fascist larcher and reminds me so much in 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.489
 pieces fields of the ballista hill and the 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.420
 mink like a fairly powerful weapon 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.609
 the problem is that it was in that 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.430
 very much and I can't get a mirage e 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.860
 very well here if I'm not mistaken or the 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.250
 ethical camper here's a look around 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.930
 the corner 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.520
 I find this one who co championship 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.080
 I don't even know what the weapon is in the corner 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.960
 he had in his hand how he did it to no 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.150
 see me I do not know and here release of the 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.100
 pump that I risked a lot of 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.750
 to be killed here because I was thinking since 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.330
 first shot to kill him rather not 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.330
 he took and I'm doing a great job 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.270
 I sincerely remount only that echo 17 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.010
 unfortunately that disney bastard understood neither 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.240
 for killer the whole venue a nice lay 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.560
 a comment if you like life of 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.560
 gloucester went a class
