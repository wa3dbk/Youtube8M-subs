but otherwise the paint's hold it up

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:13.910 
but otherwise the paint's hold it up
really<00:01:04.269> well<00:01:04.420> on<00:01:04.869> that<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.799> bedliner

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.219 

bedliner<00:01:14.920> is<00:01:15.130> actually<00:01:15.840> chipping<00:01:16.840> in<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:17.020> few

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
bedliner is actually chipping in a few

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.730 
bedliner is actually chipping in a few
places<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:19.570> there<00:01:19.869> you<00:01:20.259> can<00:01:20.409> see<00:01:20.590> it's

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
places like there you can see it's

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.440 
places like there you can see it's
chipping<00:01:22.049> off<00:01:23.049> of<00:01:23.469> the<00:01:25.619> off<00:01:26.619> of<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:27.329> bottom<00:01:28.329> of

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
chipping off of the off of the bottom of

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.200 
chipping off of the off of the bottom of
the<00:01:28.539> deal<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.020> I<00:01:29.140> realize<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:29.740> that<00:01:30.609> is

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
the deal and I realize that that is

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.200 
the deal and I realize that that is
probably<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:33.130> place<00:01:33.429> takes<00:01:33.759> probably<00:01:34.149> the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
probably that place takes probably the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.480 
probably that place takes probably the
most<00:01:34.390> abuse<00:01:34.840> from<00:01:35.020> them<00:01:35.200> tires<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.890> did<00:01:39.460> a

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
most abuse from them tires but I did a

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.440 
most abuse from them tires but I did a
lot<00:01:39.789> of<00:01:39.820> prep<00:01:40.210> work<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.850> stay<00:01:43.090> on<00:01:43.240> that

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
lot of prep work on that to stay on that

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.559 
lot of prep work on that to stay on that
to<00:01:43.719> get<00:01:43.929> that<00:01:44.170> ready<00:01:44.380> for<00:01:44.499> that<00:01:45.359> bedliner<00:01:46.359> to

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
to get that ready for that bedliner to

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.609 
to get that ready for that bedliner to
really<00:01:47.289> grab<00:01:47.499> a<00:01:47.530> hold<00:01:47.979> and<00:01:48.929> I<00:01:49.929> see<00:01:50.200> it's<00:01:50.350> coming

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
really grab a hold and I see it's coming

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.270 
really grab a hold and I see it's coming
off<00:01:50.890> so<00:01:50.920> I'm<00:01:51.399> gonna<00:01:51.549> have<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.729> take<00:01:51.909> a<00:01:53.280> wire

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
off so I'm gonna have to take a wire

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.999 
off so I'm gonna have to take a wire
brush<00:01:54.429> or<00:01:54.909> something<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.450> go<00:01:55.539> on<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:56.259> wall<00:01:56.890> in

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
brush or something and go on a wall in

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.529 
brush or something and go on a wall in
the<00:01:57.100> areas<00:01:57.549> of<00:01:57.639> things<00:01:57.850> doing<00:01:58.149> this<00:01:58.270> in<00:01:58.450> the

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
the areas of things doing this in the

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.980 
the areas of things doing this in the
scene

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.240 

doing<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.259> same<00:02:02.290> thing<00:02:02.500> over<00:02:02.890> here<00:02:07.500> yeah<00:02:08.500> see

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
doing the same thing over here yeah see

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.180 
doing the same thing over here yeah see
he's<00:02:09.369> coming<00:02:09.729> off<00:02:09.910> there<00:02:10.950> don't<00:02:11.950> really

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
he's coming off there don't really

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.240 
he's coming off there don't really
understand<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:14.880> but<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:17.069> guess<00:02:18.069> I'll<00:02:18.220> just

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
understand that but I guess I'll just

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.070 
understand that but I guess I'll just
have<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.489> take<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.700> wire<00:02:18.940> brush<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.330> clean<00:02:19.630> that

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
have to take a wire brush and clean that

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.089 
have to take a wire brush and clean that
up<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:21.900> reshoot<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.230> guess<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:26.560> bed<00:02:26.860> liner

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
up and reshoot it I guess the bed liner

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.830 
up and reshoot it I guess the bed liner
on<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:28.110> topper<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:30.300> actually<00:02:31.300> holding<00:02:31.660> up

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
on the topper is actually holding up

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.330 
on the topper is actually holding up
really<00:02:32.140> well<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.750> don't<00:02:34.750> see<00:02:34.900> anything

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340

so love the BFGS I guess mechanical eyes

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.059 
so love the BFGS I guess mechanical eyes
you<00:03:40.459> can<00:03:40.609> see<00:03:40.639> that<00:03:41.329> it<00:03:42.200> does<00:03:42.560> still<00:03:42.859> have<00:03:43.010> a

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
you can see that it does still have a

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.030 
you can see that it does still have a
little<00:03:43.280> bit<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.549> leakage<00:03:43.909> under<00:03:44.239> there<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:45.040> I

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
little bit of leakage under there and I

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.860 
little bit of leakage under there and I
believe<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.670> is<00:03:46.819> either<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.120> rear<00:03:47.480> main

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
believe that is either the rear main

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.979 
believe that is either the rear main
seal<00:03:48.819> leaking<00:03:49.819> or<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.629> oil<00:03:51.019> pan<00:03:51.879> and<00:03:52.989> I

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
seal leaking or the oil pan and I

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.679 
seal leaking or the oil pan and I
actually<00:03:54.170> haven't<00:03:54.530> added<00:03:54.950> any<00:03:55.069> oil<00:03:55.569> to<00:03:56.569> this

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:56.689 
actually haven't added any oil to this

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.220 
actually haven't added any oil to this
since<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.200> last<00:03:57.230> oil<00:03:57.709> change<00:03:58.129> so<00:03:59.019> it's<00:04:00.019> in

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
since the last oil change so it's in

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.589 
since the last oil change so it's in
here<00:04:00.440> I'm<00:04:00.500> going<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.680> check<00:04:00.889> the<00:04:01.040> oil<00:04:01.599> probably

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
here I'm going to check the oil probably

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.809 
here I'm going to check the oil probably
add<00:04:02.840> a<00:04:02.870> little<00:04:03.109> bit<00:04:03.319> to<00:04:03.349> it<00:04:05.799> but<00:04:06.799> it's<00:04:07.489> it's

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
add a little bit to it but it's it's

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.199 
add a little bit to it but it's it's
it's<00:04:08.299> been<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.540> while<00:04:08.810> so<00:04:09.879> not<00:04:10.879> like<00:04:11.030> it's

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
it's been a while so not like it's

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.809 
it's been a while so not like it's
leaking<00:04:11.419> terribly<00:04:12.199> I<00:04:12.379> guess<00:04:13.310> I'll<00:04:13.459> pop<00:04:13.639> the

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
leaking terribly I guess I'll pop the

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.629 
leaking terribly I guess I'll pop the
hood<00:04:13.970> we'll<00:04:14.209> check<00:04:14.389> out<00:04:15.190> what's<00:04:16.190> going<00:04:16.280> on

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
hood we'll check out what's going on

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.509 
hood we'll check out what's going on
with<00:04:16.909> the<00:04:17.479> engine<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.650> intake<00:04:18.979> manifold

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
with the engine and the intake manifold

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.180 
with the engine and the intake manifold
gaskets<00:04:20.120> that<00:04:20.209> I<00:04:20.359> changed<00:04:20.720> out<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:22.010> we'll

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
gaskets that I changed out and we'll

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.300 
gaskets that I changed out and we'll
check<00:04:22.370> them<00:04:22.550> out<00:04:22.729> I<00:04:23.650> guess<00:04:24.650> before<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:24.979> do<00:04:25.130> that

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
check them out I guess before I do that

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.379 
check them out I guess before I do that
these<00:04:26.240> lights<00:04:27.280> that<00:04:28.280> I<00:04:28.310> got<00:04:28.550> still<00:04:29.000> working

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
these lights that I got still working

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.610 
these lights that I got still working
good<00:04:29.570> I<00:04:29.810> like<00:04:30.199> them<00:04:32.020> they<00:04:33.020> seem<00:04:33.260> to<00:04:33.380> be<00:04:33.470> holding

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
good I like them they seem to be holding

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.850 
good I like them they seem to be holding
up<00:04:34.659> good<00:04:35.659> -<00:04:35.930> I'm<00:04:36.289> the<00:04:37.039> LED<00:04:38.139> LED<00:04:39.139> turn<00:04:39.380> signals

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
up good - I'm the LED LED turn signals

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.740 
up good - I'm the LED LED turn signals
are<00:04:40.010> still<00:04:40.220> working<00:04:40.400> good<00:04:40.820> no<00:04:41.180> problems<00:04:41.630> with

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
are still working good no problems with

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.189 
are still working good no problems with
them<00:04:44.440> another<00:04:45.440> thing<00:04:45.710> with<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.990> LED<00:04:47.990> turn

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
them another thing with the LED turn

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.290 
them another thing with the LED turn
signals<00:04:48.710> if<00:04:48.830> you<00:04:48.919> guys<00:04:49.099> remember<00:04:49.460> I<00:04:49.669> had<00:04:50.270> a

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
signals if you guys remember I had a

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.700 
signals if you guys remember I had a
moisture<00:04:50.990> issue<00:04:51.139> happening<00:04:52.130> where<00:04:53.710> moisture

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
moisture issue happening where moisture

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.830 
moisture issue happening where moisture
was<00:04:55.370> getting<00:04:55.669> into<00:04:55.849> the<00:04:55.970> light<00:04:56.150> if<00:04:56.570> you

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
was getting into the light if you

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.370 
was getting into the light if you
remember<00:04:57.199> I<00:04:57.229> took<00:04:57.620> these<00:04:57.770> off<00:04:59.020> pop<00:05:00.020> them<00:05:00.289> out

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
remember I took these off pop them out

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.550 
remember I took these off pop them out
and<00:05:02.440> reseal<00:05:03.440> them<00:05:03.650> myself<00:05:03.830> with<00:05:04.370> some<00:05:04.669> gasket

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
and reseal them myself with some gasket

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.420 
and reseal them myself with some gasket
maker<00:05:06.560> and

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
maker and

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.670 
maker and
I<00:05:07.460> haven't<00:05:07.880> had<00:05:07.970> any<00:05:08.270> issue<00:05:08.479> with<00:05:09.199> moisture

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
I haven't had any issue with moisture

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.840 
I haven't had any issue with moisture
getting<00:05:09.949> in<00:05:10.160> them<00:05:10.340> sense<00:05:10.699> so<00:05:11.590> looks<00:05:12.590> like<00:05:12.850> it

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
getting in them sense so looks like it

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.909 
getting in them sense so looks like it
was<00:05:14.000> just<00:05:14.240> a<00:05:14.330> faulty<00:05:14.750> seal<00:05:15.020> around<00:05:15.440> this<00:05:15.590> lens

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
was just a faulty seal around this lens

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.230 
was just a faulty seal around this lens
and<00:05:16.630> once<00:05:17.630> she<00:05:17.810> once<00:05:18.229> I<00:05:18.350> got<00:05:18.530> that<00:05:18.680> sealed<00:05:19.009> up

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
and once she once I got that sealed up

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.100 
and once she once I got that sealed up
no<00:05:20.240> more<00:05:20.389> problems

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.320 

here<00:05:24.740> under<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:25.160> hood<00:05:25.340> now<00:05:25.520> doing<00:05:26.060> a<00:05:26.120> quick

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
here under the hood now doing a quick

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.360 
here under the hood now doing a quick
inspection<00:05:26.660> I<00:05:27.550> don't<00:05:28.550> see<00:05:28.700> any<00:05:28.850> leaks<00:05:29.120> I<00:05:30.370> don't

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
inspection I don't see any leaks I don't

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.790 
inspection I don't see any leaks I don't
see<00:05:31.580> any<00:05:34.210> problems<00:05:35.210> it<00:05:35.360> still<00:05:35.660> looks<00:05:36.050> fairly

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
see any problems it still looks fairly

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.580 
see any problems it still looks fairly
clean<00:05:37.160> under<00:05:37.550> here<00:05:37.760> yet<00:05:37.970> so<00:05:41.380> everything<00:05:42.380> looks

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
clean under here yet so everything looks

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.700 
clean under here yet so everything looks
good<00:05:42.770> the<00:05:42.950> wide<00:05:43.130> new<00:05:43.340> water<00:05:43.580> pump<00:05:43.850> looks<00:05:44.120> good

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
good the wide new water pump looks good

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.610 
good the wide new water pump looks good
see<00:05:45.710> any<00:05:45.860> leakage<00:05:46.310> I<00:05:46.430> remember<00:05:47.170> shortly<00:05:48.170> after

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
see any leakage I remember shortly after

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.530 
see any leakage I remember shortly after
I<00:05:48.740> got<00:05:49.040> everything<00:05:49.700> put<00:05:49.910> back<00:05:49.940> together<00:05:50.300> I

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
I got everything put back together I

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.030 
I got everything put back together I
thought<00:05:50.810> I<00:05:50.870> might<00:05:51.170> have<00:05:51.230> had<00:05:51.440> a<00:05:51.500> leak<00:05:51.770> on<00:05:52.010> the

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
thought I might have had a leak on the

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.010 
thought I might have had a leak on the
radiator<00:05:52.640> there<00:05:52.940> but<00:05:53.210> I<00:05:54.130> have<00:05:55.130> not<00:05:55.340> had<00:05:55.730> any

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
radiator there but I have not had any

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.070 
radiator there but I have not had any
leakage<00:05:57.020> sense<00:05:57.820> so<00:05:58.820> I<00:05:58.850> would<00:05:59.210> say<00:05:59.420> that<00:05:59.660> it<00:05:59.870> was

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
leakage sense so I would say that it was

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.750 
leakage sense so I would say that it was
not<00:06:00.820> it<00:06:01.820> was<00:06:01.970> either<00:06:02.120> just<00:06:02.300> leftover<00:06:03.020> coolant

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
not it was either just leftover coolant

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.850 
not it was either just leftover coolant
that<00:06:04.760> was<00:06:04.940> dripping<00:06:05.390> or<00:06:08.470> just<00:06:09.470> I<00:06:09.590> thought<00:06:09.800> I

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
that was dripping or just I thought I

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.320 
that was dripping or just I thought I
had<00:06:10.070> a<00:06:10.100> leak<00:06:10.340> but<00:06:10.520> I<00:06:10.580> didn't<00:06:10.850> have<00:06:10.910> a<00:06:10.970> leak<00:06:11.180> but

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
had a leak but I didn't have a leak but

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.010 
had a leak but I didn't have a leak but
everything<00:06:11.690> seems<00:06:11.930> to<00:06:12.050> be<00:06:12.140> looking<00:06:12.850> good

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
everything seems to be looking good
