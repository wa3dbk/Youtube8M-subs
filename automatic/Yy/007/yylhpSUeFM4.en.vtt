00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.099
 is this such a match that actually with 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.170
 the 3450 must win 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.500
 woman I am now too easy with you 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.450
 father easier to see this and 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.620
 where is you got to profit or like me 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.580
 not yet lost are three at a time 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.550
 stuff 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.279
 vitesse from also played well between it 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.050
 is not that you walk so many alone 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.609
 must indeed be busy with again 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.980
 direct opponents in advance 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.439
 opponent is how they play 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.860
 well for me it is already clear who 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.109
 or how a team plays and most of all they do 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.910
 my direct opponent is becoming there 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:42.050
 also just well prepared here one 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.420
 day in advance with images about how their 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.239
 so I often know enough about it 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.190
 the counter is the lesson anyway know that 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.350
 you always have to be up anyway 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.000
 to win from anyone 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.399
 well that I also have a few euros and 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.769
 indicate we are then we are also about us 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.339
 best that is our strength when everyone does 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.269
 what he should do 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:05.269
 one hundred percent focused and yes that 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.940
 we should not be too much in the tone of 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.220
 say it and we have to go there continuously 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.320
 matches also round percent sharply 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.180
 even though it is a team that bad 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.670
 is low 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.390
 yes that's what you say but you see in it 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.060
 this competition 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.170
 yes they play well with vitesse they catch 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.390
 point earned there 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.950
 maybe to deserve more offenders that 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.860
 so to the west have chance seeing 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.580
 you see that it is just not easy 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.380
 in this competition 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.150
 losing at home yesterday too 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.470
 groningen so you just need any 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.850
 match are sharp and ensure that 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.740
 you just wind it easy 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.670
 after all, just design and honestly 7 damn it 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.020
 on the couch 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.020
 when he was up again yesterday 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.400
 done the same about 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.350
 yes sure it is bales and i think 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.390
 Groningen because it had good opportunity 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.570
 the second half still sting 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:00.200
 And yes it is a shame that they are 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.420
 not two points or that they are not equal 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.190
 play my corner through that kind of thing 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.510
 automatically submit results to the 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.300
 fact that place two might be it 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.649
 most competition is this competition 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.360
 Well at the moment I think like you 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.860
 be realistic you want to match too 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.739
 to go 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.380
 no described 7 points for with a 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.940
 better goal balance so right now 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.500
 only 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.810
 is still important to go to 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.480
 to win at salads or almost everything 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.650
 have to win and well i will but 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.050
 twente will 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.319
 points must go lose view all 2 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.319
 on it 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.459
 so yes in those in if they can 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.340
 you do walk again just at this time 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.720
 you must be realistic and you must now 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.700
 not with the championship these should be 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.780
 you a very justified trainer he 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.370
 muscles with my you it goes especially there 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.019
 this competition shows that you too 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.730
 can win for a week in breda and 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.170
 nice going from home easy 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.150
 then you cut this season's lesson yes 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.640
 of course but generally think 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.620
 I did our duty at home 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.790
 especially against the teams that you had to 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.410
 I think we just wear in 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.830
 erectus huis indeed do not have that 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.830
 well done 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.080
 but well what i say you just need us 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.030
 every match just go really sharp 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.420
 just make sure you have a mint and i think 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.910
 that we will all do it tomorrow or 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.650
 good still plays in very hands 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.180
 topics I hear the last days 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.440
 many people say if they have a name 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.640
 for that group comes in the tub and the 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.170
 good successor for koeman ' 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.450
 might also be an argument for that 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.680
 some top players to stay 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.510
 do you ever think about yes of course 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.700
 well 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.739
 but well yes it is difficult to comment on 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.290
 natural must it will not yet 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.680
 be clear who the trainer will be 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.209
 I do not agree with that 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.340
 only for players here within the 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.930
 selection but also for other games that 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.799
 they possibly want to attract it 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.139
 can work with you if you have one if you have one 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.040
 good coach but you think filter 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.150
 can learn from 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.889
 but also for you personally a 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.180
 some training but you would be very 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.310
 feeling good became an argument 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.170
 are perhaps to sign or 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.420
 to stay or and to stay 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.739
 yes but we still have anyway 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.049
 no decision was made not to 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.079
 stay or so we have not yet 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.370
 conversation is about to come so then 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.440
 you will then do things like that 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.120
 fix you come up one 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.880
 date or a month with van yellow 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.690
 agreed to talk but not really 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.720
 a date but I think we are 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.010
 his name is my agent 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.900
 so coming back should have had conversation 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.850
 are busy yes don't take a conversation yet 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.080
 was that there is an intention to 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.460
 quick to talk yes i wanted to 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.140
 therefore important in our hooks 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.020
 I am a bit difficult then 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.450
 how as well it should, and yes there is 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:44.180
 contact about that after yes yes the steeper 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.370
 myself in no yes I will start the conversation and 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.050
 yes I told you too in advance 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.950
 positive and we'll see what looks like 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.960
 coming 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.520
 I have those unwise to my liking but what 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.440
 I also say I'm just still yet 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.140
 one and a half season the and 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.690
 for me this is really a whole thing now 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.530
 important half year just complete the 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.990
 focus on football and so yes we have too 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:12.090
 it is him that we are in a hurry nut 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:14.400
 maybe 2 numbers 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.290
 I went well then let's go 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.610
 take the second that we are going to test final 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.500
 I do n't go long through summer tons yet 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.150
 a question that that wk comes that if 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.130
 important ones have you are fixed 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.300
 have become valuable with orange too 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.310
 also good to establish that 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.020
 each other I 'll make sure it 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.310
 rather than certain is can be for 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.730
 your future 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.260
 yes that hope is turk and size 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.450
 we are now bothered about zeros 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.600
 but not really financially in between 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.550
 I don't look at that now either 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.740
 I just really want to do it 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.000
 25 in the summer really do what 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.710
 look to see what is best 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.229
 for my career 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.030
 yes then i just have to do everything about it 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:55.680
 consider and of course if you have one 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.110
 contract extension then gets normal 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.270
 Spoken characteristic of show went on 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.419
 for me it is really sporty now 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.419
 main
