 Borrowing crucial in Austria 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.770
 and the best place was until now 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.770
 third place in the wind crucial 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.870
 in austria, therefore, the river and sport 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.400
 Comes out of the goal wall and fight that 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.550
 the end of the 70s came to Germany 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.470
 there were the first competitions strohmann 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.210
 are different disciplines at each 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.230
 For example, there is a championship 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.100
 suitcase drugs mature finned stone 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.869
 Lift big stone balls or pull trucks 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.619
 I am by Heinz Ollesch also 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.570
 strohmann got the times tested 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.860
 and I was able to get excited about it and you 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.810
 can always improve 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.899
 or new challenges 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.940
 and that just fascinated me so 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.759
 i have been doing weightlifting some years before 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.380
 operated so hard trained fitness 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.860
 and then I'm going to stream sports 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.049
 come 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.470
 So the first contest of the one where 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:32.200
 the heaviest in Germany in addition 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.890
 and through the audience, that's it 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.890
 right under adrenaline and enthusiasm 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.360
 So it was really fun if he was 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.420
 hard I would not last year yet 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.090
 penultimate at first so i will 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.229
 currently by my coach sepp meier 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.750
 the sports school vitalis in 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.450
 Neukirchen is preparing for the 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.060
 next season so during the time in the 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.560
 So studio mostly dumbbell training 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.229
 stability training of the balloon and 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.240
 balancing a stable middle 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.450
 now very important then it starts 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.630
 with explosivity fast-paced of course 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.399
 muscle and strength and then the 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.920
 different disciplines will be separate 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.620
 somebody trains the reason force 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.970
 want to increase it is recommended in the reason 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.670
 Doing exercises like squats 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.470
 bench press or cross lift 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.330
 and of course the explosiveness of 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.959
 Exercise with it then 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.739
 gets stronger before a serious one 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:33.480
 training day namely the supplements 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.950
 Parental for the blessing peptide 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.300
 and it is very important after that 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.120
 heavy training course to the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.370
 promote regeneration that a pc out 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.840
 and dispensable glutamine peptide vitamin 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.910
 c zinc to strengthen the immune system 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.530
 therefore weakened accordingly 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:57.130
 After training to prevent infections 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.260
 my name is daniela i am 35 years old 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.410
 old comes from friday near by 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.410
 Dresden 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.290
 I actually do the highland games 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.860
 Scottish highland games are strong 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.680
 come 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.640
 the current themes power girl 2010 and 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.549
 2009 and I would like to return to 2011 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.220
 pauling so enter 22 years ago 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.480
 I have done the first with my 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.250
 fitness sport I was left a rehab 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.650
 Measure for manipulation in the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.329
 I played handball earlier at 14 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.730
 started the sport as I said and 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.930
 since then it has me with the fitness 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.420
 sport did not let me go 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.829
 had to train very hard with mine 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.959
 knee injury has replaced and 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.160
 since then I am here 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.590
 So my trainer says Maurer of the 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.390
 language school vitalis has next year 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.859
 before that I have the German championship 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.010
 So in the stone lift do this 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.930
 Bavarian stone raising then I should so 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.940
 power core logically the 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.940
 title defense and then the German 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.500
 championship in powerlifting 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.260
 International will then follow in 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.850
 Belgium on 31.7 where I am international 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.950
 so my first competition was 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.230
 right now it's just that I'm in 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.510
 the planning phase is that is there 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.489
 had to be completely blown up very much 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.019
 many repetitions relatively easily because 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.950
 the recovery phases between the locks 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.530
 phases are also important 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.880
 then it is always the case with us 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.650
 can only squat on us 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.090
 bench press lift cross specialize 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.780
 but we have to in the whole 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.790
 disciplines the trucks rise 10 balls et 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.970
 cetera tree trunks and that's why 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.950
 always be like that one week 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.110
 currently has studio training that is 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.720
 the force phases and then a week 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.460
 long the discipline I know now by 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.940
 the sports school will have to change something 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.970
 there we give everything that's me 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.460
 currently know sepp maier and the hand 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.910
 and he gets into there the right ones 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.830
 times and the right methods 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.990
 definitely teach 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.580
 So for us it is important that that 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.080
 vitamin is the most important thing for us 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.910
 the regeneration was logical 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.020
 That's always something we always have 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.310
 bit on the track remains 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.169
 I give eleven courses in one 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.639
 Gym itself that is next to 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.000
 I have to train with the studio 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.030
 his 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.350
 and if the dress was amini the pca would be it 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.470
 the amino acids everything you need 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.590
 that's the most important thing anyway 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.600
 we are not allowed to step in higher 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.360
 quantities of iron bodybuilders for example 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.430
 never form us decisively with us 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.539
 but we just need energy and 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.450
 because we need a lot more carbohydrates 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.919
 as a bodybuilder for example now 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.880
 Yes, I experienced it daily 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:35.070
 taxi driver is or just that 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.470
 the bourgeois are the general ones 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.760
 fitness is always in the foreground me 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.280
 already call me already 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:44.610
 performance athlete or re me 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.200
 whether the endurance training I set 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.810
 quite present because the heart 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.850
 logically in the general year of life 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.610
 is very important and then the whole 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.630
 Specific back training reha athlete 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.060
 as is the case with us in MÃ¼nster 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:00.270
 Bodybuilding is all about the gentle one 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.560
 Full body training is important 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.419
 You should not do that with the heavy one 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.130
 Begin squats you should 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.700
 first very gently on one 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.320
 barrier 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.970
 prepare loads if it 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.190
 is desired logically 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.980
 generality just wants to be fit and 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.990
 So fitness is for me 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:19.140
 persevering and muscle of the arrangement 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.850
 that means I have to feel good 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.200
 It is very important and we are 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.440
 now lead years in our sport 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.570
 and the other people feel good 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.820
 fat loss and and if you are ten kilo 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.640
 You can lose weight by donating 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.260
 logically I would like me 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.370
 First of all, many women wish that 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:40.350
 trust a weight handset 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.360
 to take the hand so it is not so 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.360
 that you are giants from one day to the next 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.490
 upper arms get and meadows thighs 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.470
 and i would go for my sport 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.300
 many women just wish that 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.590
 come in at the end of the dream man shirt 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.060
 and just skip my discipline 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.910
 because how many women exercise 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.380
 maybe six seven years already and 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.760
 Do light squats and why 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.160
 not just once in exotic 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.100
 discipline just like this one 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.840
 either believe it or just always 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.860
 Test it because you can not say that 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.670
 is not for me if you do not 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.670
 has tried 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:19.910
