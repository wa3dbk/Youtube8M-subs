00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hello, the company welcomes you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.179
 hotline in this video you will learn how 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.000
 do the so -called redirection 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.460
 Directions of one domain to another is 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.980
 you may need it then when you 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.789
 rebrand you mean 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.019
 for example some domain name site com 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.660
 for example u did rebrand 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.130
 registered a beautiful domain name and 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.800
 want to redirect the old site to it 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.559
 let's say new to us in the name of the site dot org 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.870
 so as not to lose your customers so that 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.270
 do not lose positions in search engines 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.430
 you need to do a split to 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.649
 when recruiting your old domain 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.980
 visitors came to your new home 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.980
 you can do it in two ways first 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.289
 the way is redirect through the panel 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.070
 hosting management on a respa manager and 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.399
 second is the addition 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.199
 certain lines of the htc file from the old 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.019
 domain name 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:09.720
 so consider everything in order and on 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.580
 example of our two little house and so we have with 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.820
 you have 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.560
 house this let's say our old will be house 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.869
 mediacom gay.ru 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:27.920
 and both are evil to the camcorder guide that is 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.920
 while everything works and opens 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:42.329
 as we see on it and also there is a new one 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.670
 home we are just branding and now we 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.079
 we want all visitors to come 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.659
 here for the beginning we have moved everything 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.229
 the contents of the old site to our new 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.720
 site 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.280
 that is, we backed up the databases 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.729
 a glass of our files transferred all this to 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.210
 unzip and configure a new domain 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.030
 and now we have content completely 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.569
 identical to what we have there 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:17.510
 that the new house is not all the ways 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:23.240
 match up as we see the slash hello world 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:26.190
 slash hello world slash sample page 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.330
 shadowing what are we completely with you 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.090
 created the so-called site mirror but 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.280
 we don't need two sites we need one and 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.819
 we want visitors to come to 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.360
 our new site 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:45.019
 There are two options for solving our problem 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.910
 so let's take both in order 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.560
 the first solution to our problem we 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.900
 go to our control panel 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.500
 hosting pass bookmark for dvayt 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.980
 at 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:03.260
 and we need to redirect either we can 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.760
 go directly to the house 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:13.320
 choosing how to go there if we don't remember how 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:16.140
 it is spelled and here we can can 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.470
 choose your home and mood 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.190
 the tournament and since we already talked 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.970
 want to redirect domina 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.799
 video who guide on others b there we allocate 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.170
 video khan guide click redirect and 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.930
 go to the creation of redirect 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.880
 redirect now the moment is 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.829
 we are not redirected to us 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:51.390
 you need its creator so our house video 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:55.340
 can buy true take the path index php code 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:04:01.370
 put 301 transferred to the address and 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.370
 let's set a new lesson 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:17.350
 and click ok now check 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:21.900
 Video redirection kan guide 301 to about 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:28.860
 this show so video about the guide 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.860
 update this only ru 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:37.050
 mediacom guy let's sample in this only 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.630
 mediacom guide hello world in this mouse and 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.660
 so it was with us the first way also 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.419
 there is another way which 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:01.390
 allows us to automate our 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.410
 process because here as you saw 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.850
 all requests that you ask 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.140
 redirected to the main page bad 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:14.440
 english to the main page of the new house 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:17.729
 this is convenient if you allow your site 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:21.160
 was let's say was take pages and 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:23.640
 also moves to a new site on a new 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:28.710
 domain is also one page 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:33.610
 either you need to prescribe as much 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:36.310
 redirects how much do you have 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.320
 pages example when you say 5 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.130
 pages 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.940
 of course you can easily also write 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:53.650
 all by hand 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:58.440
 for example the sample page ask the same 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:03.030
 301 and here fully register url 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.030
 bad english center page 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:11.469
