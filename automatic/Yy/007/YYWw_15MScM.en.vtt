to make a TCA 5 style game in unity 3d

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.059 
to make a TCA 5 style game in unity 3d
today<00:00:05.879> we're<00:00:06.420> gonna<00:00:06.569> do<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:07.080> make<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.710> car<00:00:07.919> an

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
today we're gonna do is make the car an

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.970 
today we're gonna do is make the car an
automatic<00:00:08.970> so<00:00:09.750> what<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.590> means<00:00:10.800> is

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
automatic so what that means is

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.560 
automatic so what that means is
currently<00:00:11.580> we<00:00:11.700> have<00:00:11.730> talked<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.059> manual<00:00:12.509> so

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
currently we have talked to manual so

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.990 
currently we have talked to manual so
basically<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.440> persecute<00:00:13.889> akafuku<00:00:14.130> t<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.820> go

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
basically you persecute akafuku t to go

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.730 
basically you persecute akafuku t to go
up<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.179> gear<00:00:15.210> q<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.660> go<00:00:15.780> down<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.440> kind<00:00:16.710> of

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
up a gear q to go down that kind of

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.290 
up a gear q to go down that kind of
thing<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.490> now<00:00:17.609> we're<00:00:17.699> gonna<00:00:17.789> do<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.029> sort<00:00:18.240> of

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
thing so now we're gonna do it sort of

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.450 
thing so now we're gonna do it sort of
automatically<00:00:18.750> goes<00:00:18.960> up<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.260> down<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:20.220> let's

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
automatically goes up and down so let's

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.109 
automatically goes up and down so let's
open<00:00:20.550> up<00:00:20.760> our<00:00:20.910> car<00:00:21.270> scripts<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.840> first<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.470> all

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
open up our car scripts and first of all

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.640 
open up our car scripts and first of all
let's<00:00:24.119> create<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.480> bull<00:00:25.039> public<00:00:26.039> o<00:00:27.050> public<00:00:28.050> bull

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
let's create a bull public o public bull

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.470 
let's create a bull public o public bull
is<00:00:29.240> manual<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:31.070> let's<00:00:32.070> say<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.399> force<00:00:32.820> for

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
is manual and let's say it's a force for

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.709 
is manual and let's say it's a force for
now<00:00:33.630> which<00:00:33.840> means<00:00:34.079> automatic<00:00:34.800> obviously<00:00:35.719> so

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
now which means automatic obviously so

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.549 
now which means automatic obviously so
here<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.020> where<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.380> have<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.690> inputs<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.350> q

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
here we where we have the inputs for q

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.869 
here we where we have the inputs for q
and<00:00:40.680> e<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.129> want<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.309> go<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.710> manual<00:00:43.879> put

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and e you want to go if is manual put

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.670 
and e you want to go if is manual put
that<00:00:45.000> around<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:45.989> checks<00:00:46.140> if<00:00:46.379> we

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
that around that so it just checks if we

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.440 
that around that so it just checks if we
are<00:00:46.829> manual<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.030> manual<00:00:48.390> we

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
are manual and then if it is manual we

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.569 
are manual and then if it is manual we
can<00:00:48.600> do<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> inputs<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.129> no<00:00:50.280> obviously

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
can do the inputs and it's no obviously

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.840 
can do the inputs and it's no obviously
we<00:00:50.700> can't<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:52.320> yeah<00:00:52.500> now<00:00:53.190> what<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.430> need<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.670> do

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
we can't so yeah now what we need to do

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.099 
we can't so yeah now what we need to do
is<00:00:54.120> create<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:56.030> toonie<00:00:57.030> variables<00:00:57.480> both<00:00:57.719> floats

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
is create a toonie variables both floats

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.889 
is create a toonie variables both floats
public<00:00:58.949> floats<00:00:59.670> first<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.420> will<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:01.070> shift<00:01:02.070> up

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
public floats first one will be shift up

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.940 
public floats first one will be shift up
RPM<00:01:04.369> second<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.549> will<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.729> shift<00:01:06.600> down<00:01:08.150> RPM

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
RPM second one will be shift down RPM

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.140 
RPM second one will be shift down RPM
both<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.130> these<00:01:11.220> variables<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:11.880> they<00:01:12.000> are

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
both of these variables what they are

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.469 
both of these variables what they are
this<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.439> are<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.890> rest<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.520> minute<00:01:14.820> that

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
this is the are the rest a minute that

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.050 
this is the are the rest a minute that
the<00:01:16.200> engine<00:01:16.560> has<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.280> us<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.939> up

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the engine has to be at for us to go up

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.030 
the engine has to be at for us to go up
a<00:01:18.180> gear<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.600> shift<00:01:19.290> down<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.590> obviously<00:01:19.830> good

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
a gear and shift down so obviously good

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.219 
a gear and shift down so obviously good
to<00:01:20.220> go<00:01:20.340> down<00:01:20.520> again<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.000> let's<00:01:21.630> quickly<00:01:21.810> set

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
to go down again so let's quickly set

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.710 
to go down again so let's quickly set
then<00:01:22.439> let's<00:01:22.799> sit<00:01:23.070> let's<00:01:23.720> go<00:01:24.720> something<00:01:25.170> like

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
then let's sit let's go something like

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.300 
then let's sit let's go something like
shift<00:01:27.720> down<00:01:28.020> will<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:29.630> 1000<00:01:30.740> shift<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.950> will<00:01:32.189> be

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
shift down will be 1000 shift up will be

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.810 
shift down will be 1000 shift up will be
2,000<00:01:33.119> not<00:01:33.810> 2000<00:01:34.619> or<00:01:36.170> 200,000<00:01:37.280> cool<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.610> now<00:01:38.759> we

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
2,000 not 2000 or 200,000 cool so now we

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.480 
2,000 not 2000 or 200,000 cool so now we
need<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> pray<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> new<00:01:39.600> method<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.680> make

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
need to pray a new method you can make

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.190 
need to pray a new method you can make
public<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.030> want<00:01:42.210> your<00:01:42.899> money<00:01:42.990> matter

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
public if you want your money matter

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.219 
public if you want your money matter
public<00:01:43.979> void<00:01:47.090> also<00:01:48.090> shift

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
public void also shift

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.990 
public void also shift
let's<00:01:49.470> do<00:01:50.630> okay<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.689> what<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:51.930> need<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:53.000> is

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
let's do okay so what we need to do is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.209 
let's do okay so what we need to do is
go<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:55.430> rpm<00:01:56.430> rpm<00:01:57.290> is<00:01:58.290> greater<00:01:58.740> than<00:01:59.040> or<00:01:59.189> equal

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
go if rpm rpm is greater than or equal

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.940 
go if rpm rpm is greater than or equal
to<00:02:00.500> shift<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.950> rpm<00:02:03.290> then<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.350> do<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.560> shift<00:02:04.770> up

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
to shift up rpm then we do the shift up

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.260 
to shift up rpm then we do the shift up
logic<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.430> first<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.729> all<00:02:05.759> we<00:02:05.850> need<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.060> check

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
logic so first of all we need to check

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.589 
logic so first of all we need to check
that<00:02:06.299> we're<00:02:06.509> not<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.930> highest<00:02:07.290> gear<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.799> if

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
that we're not in the highest gear so if

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.640 
that we're not in the highest gear so if
gear<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:10.590> not<00:02:10.830> equal<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.640> does<00:02:11.760> not<00:02:11.879> equal<00:02:12.650> ear

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
gear is not equal it does not equal ear

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.190 
gear is not equal it does not equal ear
ratio

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
ratio

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.670 
ratio
dot<00:02:16.200> length<00:02:16.410> minus<00:02:17.280> 1<00:02:17.900> then<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:18.930> shift<00:02:19.260> down<00:02:19.470> so

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
dot length minus 1 then we shift down so

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.869 
dot length minus 1 then we shift down so
each<00:02:19.830> basically<00:02:20.280> go<00:02:20.459> cur<00:02:21.180> get<00:02:21.480> -<00:02:21.959> -<00:02:22.370> mmm<00:02:23.430> so

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
each basically go cur get - - mmm so

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.030 
each basically go cur get - - mmm so
yeah<00:02:24.120> knows<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.870> then<00:02:25.019> we<00:02:25.140> have<00:02:25.260> Genet

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
yeah knows that and then we have Genet

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.490 
yeah knows that and then we have Genet
there<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:27.090> was<00:02:27.300> good<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.900> then<00:02:28.200> we<00:02:28.319> have<00:02:28.410> to

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
there that was good and then we have to

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.259 
there that was good and then we have to
go<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:28.830> cur<00:02:29.720> rpm<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:31.530> less<00:02:32.069> than<00:02:32.340> or<00:02:32.610> equal<00:02:33.090> to

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
go if cur rpm is less than or equal to

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.580 
go if cur rpm is less than or equal to
shift<00:02:34.140> down<00:02:35.150> rpm<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.930> then<00:02:37.049> we<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.379> check

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
shift down rpm so then we have to check

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.490 
shift down rpm so then we have to check
that<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.980> car<00:02:38.160> gear<00:02:38.430> isn't<00:02:38.849> zero<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:39.959> if<00:02:40.140> cur

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
that the car gear isn't zero so if cur

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.880 
that the car gear isn't zero so if cur
gear<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:41.489> not<00:02:41.700> equal<00:02:42.030> zero<00:02:42.900> if<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.769> the

gear is not equal zero if that is the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.449 
gear is not equal zero if that is the
case

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
case

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.970

oh<00:02:44.489> where<00:02:45.390> we<00:02:45.450> have<00:02:45.540> shift<00:02:45.780> up<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.110> mean<00:02:46.380> cur

oh where we have shift up I mean cur

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.069 
oh where we have shift up I mean cur
gear<00:02:47.220> plus<00:02:47.400> plus<00:02:47.640> not<00:02:47.880> crooked<00:02:48.209> those<00:02:48.750> months

in<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.099> shift<00:02:50.370> down<00:02:50.579> one<00:02:50.819> that's<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.239> do<00:02:51.420> cur

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
in this shift down one that's we do cur

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.160 
in this shift down one that's we do cur
gear<00:02:51.959> -<00:02:52.319> months<00:02:52.670> oops<00:02:53.670> -<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.690> just<00:02:54.780> goes<00:02:54.989> down

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
gear - months oops - that just goes down

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.660 
gear - months oops - that just goes down
again<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.700> then<00:02:57.510> what<00:02:57.750> we<00:02:57.810> need<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.959> do<00:02:58.670> he's

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
again and then what we need to do he's

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.940 
again and then what we need to do he's
at<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.150> top<00:03:00.510> where<00:03:01.019> we<00:03:01.110> have<00:03:01.260> if<00:03:01.440> his<00:03:01.560> manual

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
at the top where we have if his manual

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.030 
at the top where we have if his manual
at<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.640> last<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:03.599> last<00:03:03.829> swiftly<00:03:04.829> back<00:03:05.010> I

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
at the last the last swiftly back I

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.979 
at the last the last swiftly back I
wouldn't<00:03:05.340> go<00:03:05.489> else<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.060> then<00:03:06.569> we<00:03:06.780> cool

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
wouldn't go else and then we cool

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.039 
wouldn't go else and then we cool
auto-ship<00:03:07.970> simple<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.450> that's<00:03:09.810> it

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
auto-ship simple and that that's it

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.449 
auto-ship simple and that that's it
really<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:10.709> let's<00:03:11.610> just<00:03:11.790> play<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:13.049> oh<00:03:14.010> oh

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
is enabled spit it out so there we go

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.960 
is enabled spit it out so there we go
obviously<00:03:43.919> it's<00:03:44.040> not<00:03:44.160> playing<00:03:45.260> let<00:03:46.260> me<00:03:46.349> get<00:03:46.560> in

once again Jim then if we slow down go

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:45.360 
once again Jim then if we slow down go
down<00:04:37.510> a<00:04:37.690> girl<00:04:39.690> don't<00:04:40.690> I<00:04:40.840> get<00:04:43.500> into<00:04:44.500> two<00:04:44.710> zeros

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
down a girl don't I get into two zeros

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.980 
down a girl don't I get into two zeros
gear<00:04:45.640> first<00:04:45.910> gear<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:48.130> yeah<00:04:48.450> there<00:04:49.450> we<00:04:49.510> go<00:04:49.540> and

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
gear first gear so yeah there we go and

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
gear first gear so yeah there we go and
then<00:04:50.140> we<00:04:50.230> just<00:04:50.350> come<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:50.620> a<00:04:50.650> stop<00:04:53.790> voila
