people<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.380> art<00:02:25.680> actually<00:02:25.860> could<00:02:26.220> evoke

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
people and art actually could evoke

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.059 
people and art actually could evoke

and<00:02:29.550> that's<00:02:29.730> that's<00:02:30.150> our<00:02:31.140> goal<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.920> terms<00:02:32.160> of

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
and that's that's our goal in terms of

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.949 
and that's that's our goal in terms of
just<00:02:32.430> demonstrating<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.270> sheer<00:02:33.300> scale<00:02:33.750> of

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
just demonstrating the sheer scale of

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.820 
just demonstrating the sheer scale of
this<00:02:34.860> on<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:35.850> side<00:02:36.180> note<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:37.319> further<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
this on a side note to just further the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.009 
this on a side note to just further the
impact<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.640> one<00:02:40.010> in<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:42.019> industrialized

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
impact is one in the industrialized

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.290 
impact is one in the industrialized
countries<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.709> average<00:02:44.040> person<00:02:44.550> emits<00:02:44.940> one

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
countries the average person emits one

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.940 
countries the average person emits one
ton<00:02:45.989> of<00:02:46.019> co2<00:02:46.590> per<00:02:47.340> month<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.420> here<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.590> US

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
ton of co2 per month and here in the US

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.850 
ton of co2 per month and here in the US
it's<00:02:50.400> two<00:02:50.819> tons<00:02:51.150> per<00:02:51.480> month<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:52.319> when<00:02:52.500> people

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
it's two tons per month so when people

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.330 
it's two tons per month so when people
hear<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.790> fact<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.510> see<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.170> size<00:02:55.380> it

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
hear that fact and see the size it

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.070 
hear that fact and see the size it
actually<00:02:56.790> has<00:02:57.120> an<00:02:57.330> impact<00:02:57.660> because<00:02:57.810> many

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
actually has an impact because many

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.380 
actually has an impact because many
people<00:02:58.380> think<00:02:58.530> maybe<00:02:58.860> one<00:02:59.519> ton<00:02:59.790> per<00:03:00.120> year<00:03:00.920> so

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
people think maybe one ton per year so

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.930 
people think maybe one ton per year so
that<00:03:03.390> is<00:03:03.709> one<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.920> goals<00:03:05.100> in<00:03:05.340> terms<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.730> the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
that is one of the goals in terms of the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.600 
that is one of the goals in terms of the
the<00:03:06.209> sculptural<00:03:06.690> side<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.890> installation
