sixty bucks

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.459 
sixty bucks
through<00:00:32.759> craftsman<00:00:33.329> chainsaws<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> home<00:00:34.260> light

through craftsman chainsaws a home light
blower<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.010> blower<00:00:37.129> this<00:00:38.129> didn't

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
blower in this blower this didn't

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.540 
blower in this blower this didn't
include<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.180> blower<00:00:39.390> tubes<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.040> just

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
include the blower tubes on it so I just

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.950 
include the blower tubes on it so I just
put<00:00:41.760> those<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.629> did<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
put those on it but it did have the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.869 
put those on it but it did have the
throttle<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.690> this<00:00:45.690> throttle<00:00:46.050> doesn't<00:00:46.730> fit<00:00:47.730> on

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
throttle so this throttle doesn't fit on

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.260 
throttle so this throttle doesn't fit on
these<00:00:48.690> tubes<00:00:49.079> right<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.640> tight<00:00:51.000> as<00:00:51.120> it

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
these tubes right and it's tight as it

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.689 
these tubes right and it's tight as it
can<00:00:51.300> go<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.899> doesn't<00:00:52.230> fit<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.649> I'll<00:00:53.520> either

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
can go but it doesn't fit so I'll either

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.180 
can go but it doesn't fit so I'll either
have<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.210> get<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> new<00:00:55.170> throttle<00:00:55.440> piece<00:00:55.800> or<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
have to get a new throttle piece or a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.119 
have to get a new throttle piece or a
new<00:00:56.850> blower<00:00:57.210> tube<00:00:57.570> which<00:00:58.530> I'll<00:00:58.710> probably<00:00:58.920> do

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
new blower tube which I'll probably do

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.010 
new blower tube which I'll probably do
this<00:00:59.190> tube<00:00:59.550> because<00:01:00.149> those<00:01:00.329> tubes<00:01:00.629> aren't<00:01:00.870> in

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
this tube because those tubes aren't in

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.789 
this tube because those tubes aren't in
good<00:01:01.199> condition<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.910> this<00:01:02.910> blowers<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.809> new

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
good condition and this blowers like new

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.950 
good condition and this blowers like new
so<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.580> tubes<00:01:05.790> don't<00:01:06.060> match<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.680> on

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
so the tubes don't match up to it so on

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.570 
so the tubes don't match up to it so on
I'll<00:01:09.500> start<00:01:09.800> it<00:01:09.890> up<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:10.190> show<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:10.400> guys<00:01:10.460> how

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
I'll start it up and show you guys how

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.380 
I'll start it up and show you guys how
good<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:11.330> works<00:01:11.480> now<00:01:12.370> doesn't<00:01:13.370> work<00:01:13.490> great

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
good it works now doesn't work great

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.130 
good it works now doesn't work great
whether<00:01:15.080> it<00:01:15.170> works<00:01:15.350> good<00:01:16.070> enough<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:17.180> good

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
whether it works good enough so good

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.510 
whether it works good enough so good
enough<00:01:18.410> and<00:01:19.570> I'll<00:01:20.570> start<00:01:20.780> it<00:01:20.900> up<00:01:20.960> now<00:01:21.230> and<00:01:21.520> you

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
enough and I'll start it up now and you

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:34.440 
enough and I'll start it up now and you
can<00:01:22.670> see<00:01:22.850> how<00:01:22.940> good<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.570> works<00:01:24.070> or<00:01:25.070> whatever

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:02:06.100 

now

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.820 

so<00:02:07.110> what<00:02:07.260> I<00:02:07.290> had<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.620> do<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.070> and

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
so what I had to do to this and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.309 
so what I had to do to this and
actually

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
actually

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.009 
actually
clean<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.430> spark<00:02:13.670> plug<00:02:14.000> because<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.930> was

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
clean the spark plug because it was

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.250 
clean the spark plug because it was
filled<00:02:15.230> up<00:02:15.379> oil<00:02:15.769> and<00:02:16.239> while<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:17.269> was<00:02:17.480> at<00:02:17.659> it<00:02:17.689> this

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
filled up oil and while I was at it this

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.559 
filled up oil and while I was at it this
thing<00:02:18.530> was<00:02:18.680> bogging<00:02:19.159> before<00:02:19.579> but<00:02:19.879> actually<00:02:20.150> it

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
thing was bogging before but actually it

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.089 
thing was bogging before but actually it
was<00:02:20.659> just<00:02:20.689> the<00:02:20.989> carburetor<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.590> had<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.799> adjust

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
was just the carburetor I had to adjust

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.750 
was just the carburetor I had to adjust
it<00:02:22.280> but<00:02:23.120> add<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.329> capped<00:02:23.689> on<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:24.049> so<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.260> figured

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
it but add the capped on it so I figured

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.800 
it but add the capped on it so I figured
before<00:02:25.760> I<00:02:25.790> do<00:02:25.879> that<00:02:25.970> I'll<00:02:26.299> take<00:02:26.480> off<00:02:26.659> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
before I do that I'll take off the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.369 
before I do that I'll take off the
muffler<00:02:27.019> which<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:28.430> pretty<00:02:28.670> hard<00:02:28.909> because

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
muffler which is pretty hard because

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.930 
muffler which is pretty hard because
these<00:02:30.379> echo<00:02:30.620> mufflers<00:02:31.159> don't<00:02:31.400> come<00:02:31.579> off<00:02:31.730> too

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
these echo mufflers don't come off too

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.300 
these echo mufflers don't come off too
easy<00:02:32.260> but<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.379> muffler<00:02:33.709> is<00:02:33.860> pretty<00:02:34.159> much

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
easy but the muffler is pretty much

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.850 
easy but the muffler is pretty much
brand<00:02:34.700> new<00:02:34.819> thought<00:02:35.329> I<00:02:35.360> don't<00:02:35.510> know<00:02:35.569> why<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:36.170> did

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
brand new thought I don't know why I did

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.830 
brand new thought I don't know why I did
that<00:02:36.890> anyway<00:02:37.400> but<00:02:37.700> I<00:02:37.970> looked<00:02:38.180> at<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.420> piston

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
that anyway but I looked at the piston

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.160 
that anyway but I looked at the piston
the<00:02:38.930> piston<00:02:38.959> it's<00:02:39.470> like<00:02:40.299> I<00:02:41.299> can't<00:02:41.870> get<00:02:41.989> much

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
the piston it's like I can't get much

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.149 
the piston it's like I can't get much
better<00:02:42.200> than<00:02:42.500> what<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:42.829> is<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:44.829> what<00:02:45.829> else<00:02:45.980> I

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
better than what it is so what else I

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.580 
better than what it is so what else I
had<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.400> fix<00:02:46.609> throttle<00:02:47.329> the<00:02:48.019> throttle<00:02:48.049> linkage

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
had to fix throttle the throttle linkage

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.030 
had to fix throttle the throttle linkage
wasn't<00:02:49.810> working<00:02:50.810> right<00:02:50.840> this<00:02:51.349> dawdle<00:02:51.829> was

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
wasn't working right this dawdle was

so<00:04:09.150> I<00:04:09.210> already<00:04:09.330> got<00:04:09.540> one<00:04:09.750> running<00:04:09.990> now<00:04:10.710> I<00:04:10.740> just

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
so I already got one running now I just

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.490 
so I already got one running now I just
need<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.220> get<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.460> other<00:04:11.610> two<00:04:11.640> running
