 parsley is thin and so the leaves I 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.970
 will isolate the truce with the 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.440
 chisel but you can very well 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.530

 leaves just cut with scissors and I 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.060
 let the salad rest three four 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:39.340
