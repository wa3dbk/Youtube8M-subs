00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.900
 third I think it's from this great game 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.870
 that is so liked you like to 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.530
 many that is this against global strike 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.080
 offensive version for pc has already left 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.800
 the full and good version I will bring 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.950
 today a 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.270
 for those of us who want to have the game and 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.670
 they know that one of the main 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.760
 big changes are the record of the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.470
 weapons and weapons and good I bring 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.620
 a video with the record that feed 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:03.230
 right now the first one is going to be the 47 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.230
 modal to shoot it without controlling it 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.320
 in the record of 47 and here we are going to 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.320
 try to control a little 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.080
 You see, it's much more difficult 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.270
 control it now they have changed it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.640
 totally and well there will be 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.370
 get used to the next rifle that 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.520
 let's see his route is the m4 the one 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.300
 would be the version of the m4a1 but in the m 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.090
 4 to 4 m 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.090
 as well as its journey without controlling it 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.299
 that still does not control the route and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.299
 here controlling it 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.180
 more or less 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.470
 it is more controllable than the 47 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.030
 as you can see 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.659
 but one is also quite difficult to 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.870
 drive 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.030
 and well let's go with the next weapon 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:06.310
 for the next weapons I bring the fames 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:09.240
 I like a piece of gun a lot and here 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.240
 we have your tour 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.680
 it's more like the smaller ones so 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.680
 more effective and controlling it 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.150
 much smaller also although it has 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.350
 less bullets but good enough effective 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.840
 well then the next weapon 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.730
 now I bring you the p 90 also more 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.100
 known as the stapler gives a piece 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.930
 of weapon that has hardly recoil as its 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.420
 look like the other games other versions 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.560
 here we will see your collected control 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.560
 trike attacked offensive 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.860
 that would be without controlling it and here we are going to 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.860
 control right now 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.430
 As you can see, it has just traveled 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.319
 very little 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.500
 and well let's try a shotgun 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.500
 now 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.400
 now I am a shotgun will know see your 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.440
 travel although he has no penis travel 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.480
 but good for you to see a little 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.200
 weapons and a 6 itself so without 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.200
 control anything 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.490
 this has nothing record 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.980
 Now it's time to finish I'll bring 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.320
 the grenades version of the counter strike 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.190
 global offensive as you see instead 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.280
 currently totally the way and there 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.020
 a new as is the grenade was leveled and 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.930
 the incendiary grenade you have to teach to 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.250
 do and now we're also going to launch 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.370
 a decoy grenade so that to see what 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.350
 what does it do totally new and what does 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.350
 it's like you'll see simulate shots 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.230
 you can simulate shooting for beagle 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.920
 some shots of ak-47 of vp anyone 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.600
 all types of weapons the demands 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.400
 next that nothing we will see is the 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.010
 hard turdi aircraft have also changed 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.650
 in a way of how you see are more like 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.030
 fine let's throw one here in our 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.030
 nose for you to see what it does 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.630
 it leaves you only diego according to how you get it 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.519
 he swallows it whole leaves totally blind 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.170
 and deaf 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.080
 the next the grenade 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.330
 in the h as you want to call it the pomegranate 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.500
 hand 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.500
 you will see it right now 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.180
 there you have made a lot more realistic 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:35.180
 you see everyone jumping through the air 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.699
 it's worth driving we continue with the grenade 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.910
 of smoke let's make her buy this now 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.969
 same throw me and low as you see 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.649
 they bounce much more 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:50.649
 and here we have our smoke grenade 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.090
 it should be around here you can not see anything 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.740
 as you can see you do not see anything 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.810
 like the other versions that would be a 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.500
 little bit or at least I'm not totally 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.500
 nothing 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.330
 and to finish I'll teach the 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.910
 new grenade also that I like a lot 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.590
 in particular that for cetes the 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.319
 against terrorists is called grenade 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.840
 incendiary grenade and for dogs it 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:18.740
 Molotov cocktail flame let's throw a 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.980
 so you can see the effect it makes 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:25.420
 as you see , fire is undertaken 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.160
 great radius of the piece of grams thrown away 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.690
 go out there and burn 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.500
 practically lowering life very 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.790
 quickly and this well if he has he is 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.780
 the friend fire activated as it does not stop 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.980
 Well, it 's your teammates also burn 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.880
 but if in this case it is not activated 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.770
 from friend fire 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.150
 your companions can pass by the fire 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.150
 and nothing happens 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.000
 so good we said goodbye until 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.890
 next video with this review of a 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.110
 little record of weapons so nothing 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.770
 see you in the next episode and 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.770
 until next time
