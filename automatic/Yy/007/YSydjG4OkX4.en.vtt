one<00:00:04.740> of<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:04.950> ways<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.339> can<00:00:05.490> add<00:00:05.700> more<00:00:06.089> life<00:00:06.359> to

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
one of the ways you can add more life to

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.660 
one of the ways you can add more life to
your<00:00:06.660> character<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.560> create<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.250> more

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
your character is to create a more

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.330 
your character is to create a more
realistic<00:00:09.240> head<00:00:09.809> turn<00:00:10.110> so<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.040> chapter

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
realistic head turn so in this chapter

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.980 
realistic head turn so in this chapter
we're<00:00:11.639> going<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.820> show<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.059> how<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.300> create<00:00:12.690> a

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
we're going to show you how to create a

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.410 
we're going to show you how to create a
dimensional<00:00:13.650> head<00:00:13.889> turn<00:00:14.160> where<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.849> features

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
dimensional head turn where the features

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.540 
dimensional head turn where the features
of<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.780> characters<00:00:16.260> face<00:00:16.590> actually<00:00:17.010> move

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
of the characters face actually move

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.220 
of the characters face actually move
across<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.510> face<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.930> give<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
across the face and give you the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.200 
across the face and give you the
impression<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.430> character<00:00:20.760> has<00:00:20.939> more

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
impression that the character has more

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.330 
impression that the character has more
volume<00:00:21.449> let<00:00:22.320> me<00:00:22.410> show<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.890> head<00:00:23.100> turn

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
volume let me show you this head turn

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.859 
volume let me show you this head turn
that<00:00:23.670> we're<00:00:23.789> going<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.600> chapter

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
that we're going to do in this chapter

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.330 
that we're going to do in this chapter
so<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.410> way<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:25.710> have<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.920> little<00:00:26.130> bit<00:00:26.250> of

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
so that way we have a little bit of

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.150 
so that way we have a little bit of
reference<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.000> I've<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.140> basically<00:00:28.349> added

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
reference so I've just basically added

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.669 
reference so I've just basically added
this<00:00:29.730> head<00:00:30.390> turn<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:30.960> now<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.380> see<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
this head turn so now you can see the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.760 
this head turn so now you can see the
eyes<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.309> nose<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.550> mouth<00:00:32.910> all<00:00:33.360> move<00:00:34.290> across

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
eyes the nose the mouth all move across

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.709 
eyes the nose the mouth all move across
the<00:00:35.010> face<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.700> face<00:00:36.000> itself<00:00:36.480> actually

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the face and the face itself actually

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.319 
the face and the face itself actually
changes<00:00:37.500> shape<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.610> now<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:38.940> understand

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
changes shape so now that we understand

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.270 
changes shape so now that we understand
where<00:00:39.750> we're<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.170> let's<00:00:40.320> go<00:00:40.500> ahead<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.980> get

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
where we're going let's go ahead and get

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.790 
where we're going let's go ahead and get
started<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.120> I'm<00:00:42.540> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.870> go<00:00:43.410> ahead<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
started so I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.090 
started so I'm going to go ahead and
just<00:00:43.920> open<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.309> project<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.770> in<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.890> case

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
just open a project and in this case

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.799 
just open a project and in this case
we're<00:00:47.219> gonna<00:00:47.309> open<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.000> first<00:00:48.270> one<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.660> this

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
we're gonna open the first one in this

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.369 
we're gonna open the first one in this
chapter<00:00:49.289> which<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.469> oh<00:00:49.829> six<00:00:50.250> oh<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.379> this

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
chapter which is oh six oh one and this

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.139 
chapter which is oh six oh one and this
is<00:00:52.530> basically<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.070> same<00:00:53.340> character<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:53.910> had

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
is basically the same character we had

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.529 
is basically the same character we had
before<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> few<00:00:55.710> changes<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.370> deleted<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
before with a few changes I deleted the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.750 
before with a few changes I deleted the
blinks<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.620> mouse<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.340> we're<00:00:59.460> gonna<00:00:59.550> add

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
blinks and the mouse and we're gonna add

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.660 
blinks and the mouse and we're gonna add
those<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.079> little<00:01:01.109> bit<00:01:01.379> later<00:01:01.739> because

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
those in just a little bit later because

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.969 
those in just a little bit later because
when<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> head<00:01:03.600> turn<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
when you do a head turn like this the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.280 
when you do a head turn like this the
standard<00:01:05.549> replacement<00:01:06.270> mouths<00:01:06.450> don't<00:01:06.960> quite

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
standard replacement mouths don't quite

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.420 
standard replacement mouths don't quite
work<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.740> we're<00:01:07.830> gonna<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.400> another

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
work so we're gonna have to do another

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.730 
work so we're gonna have to do another
method<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.570> we're<00:01:09.750> gonna<00:01:09.840> use<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.110> sort<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.560> head

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
method if we're gonna use a sort of head

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
method if we're gonna use a sort of head
turn<00:01:10.979> well<00:01:11.820> let's<00:01:11.970> go<00:01:12.119> ahead<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.600> start<00:01:13.140> now

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
turn well let's go ahead and start now

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.830 
turn well let's go ahead and start now
the<00:01:13.590> easiest<00:01:14.070> way<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.340> do<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.180> use<00:01:15.390> time

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the easiest way to do it is to use time

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.810 
the easiest way to do it is to use time
remapping<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.159> use<00:01:17.280> time<00:01:17.549> remapping

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
remapping and we can use time remapping

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.570 
remapping and we can use time remapping
for<00:01:18.210> things<00:01:18.450> other<00:01:18.750> than<00:01:19.580> replacement

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
for things other than replacement

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.550 
for things other than replacement
animation<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.570> case<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.170> use<00:01:22.380> it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
animation so in this case we can use it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.910 
animation so in this case we can use it
to<00:01:22.710> smoothly<00:01:23.220> animate<00:01:24.060> between<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.990> left<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
to smoothly animate between a left a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.319 
to smoothly animate between a left a
Center<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:27.540> right<00:01:28.020> head<00:01:28.740> turn<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.909> let's<00:01:30.180> go

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
Center and a right head turn so let's go

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.090 
Center and a right head turn so let's go
through<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.810> select<00:01:30.930> everything<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.950> we

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
through and select everything that we

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.719 
through and select everything that we
have<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.939> head<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.680> mouth<00:01:35.430> oh

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
have on the head so here I have mouth oh

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.840 
have on the head so here I have mouth oh
one<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:37.200> scroll<00:01:37.590> down<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.829> basically<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
one and I scroll down and basically the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.179 
one and I scroll down and basically the
head<00:01:39.060> goes<00:01:39.299> all<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.509> way<00:01:39.600> down<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:40.200> left<00:01:40.950> and

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
head goes all the way down to left and

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.910 
head goes all the way down to left and
right<00:01:41.369> ear<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.729> basically<00:01:42.270> all<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> these<00:01:43.500> top

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
right ear so basically all of these top

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.490 
right ear so basically all of these top
layers<00:01:44.250> from<00:01:44.640> left<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.210> right<00:01:45.299> ear<00:01:45.780> through

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
layers from left and right ear through

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.170 
layers from left and right ear through
head<00:01:46.799> all<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.250> way<00:01:47.280> up<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> mouth<00:01:47.909> and

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
head all the way up to the mouth and

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.200 
head all the way up to the mouth and
this<00:01:48.600> selects<00:01:48.930> everything<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.189> head<00:01:50.430> now

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
this selects everything on the head now

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.940 
this selects everything on the head now
just<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.689> when<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.290> replacement

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
just like when we do replacement

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.710 
just like when we do replacement
animation<00:01:53.070> we're<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.790> create<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.180> pre

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
animation we're going to create a pre

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.420 
animation we're going to create a pre
comp<00:01:54.990> I'm<00:01:55.470> gonna<00:01:55.649> go<00:01:55.770> into<00:01:55.979> layer<00:01:56.509> pre<00:01:57.509> compose

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
comp I'm gonna go into layer pre compose

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.920 
comp I'm gonna go into layer pre compose
and<00:01:59.430> let's<00:01:59.790> just<00:01:59.969> call<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.509> head<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:02.340> okay<00:02:02.930> so

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
and let's just call this head it okay so

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.010 
and let's just call this head it okay so
now<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.560> composition<00:02:05.130> called<00:02:05.729> head<00:02:06.210> we

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
now I have a composition called head we

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.169 
now I have a composition called head we
can<00:02:07.140> double<00:02:07.770> click<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.789> can<00:02:08.940> see

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
can double click on it and you can see

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.170 
can double click on it and you can see
if<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.569> fit<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.379> we've<00:02:11.160> got<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.670> lot<00:02:12.150> of

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
if I fit to this we've got a lot of

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.729 
if I fit to this we've got a lot of
extra<00:02:12.540> space<00:02:12.750> around<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:13.410> let's<00:02:13.560> go<00:02:13.680> ahead

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
extra space around it so let's go ahead

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:13.970 
extra space around it so let's go ahead
and

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
and

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.369 
and
shrim<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.430> down<00:02:14.670> we're<00:02:15.360> gonna<00:02:15.450> use<00:02:15.720> region

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
shrim this down we're gonna use region

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.420 
shrim this down we're gonna use region
of<00:02:16.470> interest<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.099> just<00:02:17.370> draw<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.849> box<00:02:18.390> around

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
of interest and just draw a box around

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.430 
of interest and just draw a box around
the<00:02:20.430> character<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.360> maybe<00:02:21.510> zoom<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.080> here<00:02:22.319> and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
the character and maybe zoom in here and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.050 
the character and maybe zoom in here and
let's<00:02:22.590> go<00:02:22.709> ahead<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:22.980> fine-tune<00:02:23.459> this<00:02:23.670> box<00:02:23.909> so

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
let's go ahead and fine-tune this box so

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.280 
let's go ahead and fine-tune this box so
I<00:02:24.090> want<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.269> make<00:02:24.390> sure<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.599> have<00:02:24.810> enough<00:02:25.080> room

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
I want to make sure I have enough room

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.399 
I want to make sure I have enough room
not<00:02:26.069> just<00:02:26.340> for<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.610> character<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:27.420> also<00:02:27.450> for

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
not just for the character but also for

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.039 
not just for the character but also for
the<00:02:28.680> head<00:02:28.890> turn<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:30.030> maybe<00:02:30.239> give<00:02:30.420> him<00:02:30.629> a<00:02:30.690> little

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
the head turn so maybe give him a little

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.050 
the head turn so maybe give him a little
bit<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.410> room<00:02:31.620> on<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.069> sides<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.640> not<00:02:32.819> too

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
bit of room on the sides but not too

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.530 
bit of room on the sides but not too
much<00:02:33.209> just<00:02:33.660> enough<00:02:34.129> so<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:35.910> should<00:02:36.239> be<00:02:36.269> good

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
much just enough so that should be good

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.009 
much just enough so that should be good
and<00:02:37.200> once<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.620> have<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.310> all<00:02:38.879> blocked<00:02:39.510> out<00:02:39.750> all

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
and once I have that all blocked out all

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.619 
and once I have that all blocked out all
I<00:02:40.230> have<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.500> do<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.709> composition<00:02:41.160> crop<00:02:42.000> comp<00:02:42.390> to

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
I have to do is composition crop comp to

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.360 
I have to do is composition crop comp to
region<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:43.019> interest<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.799> now<00:02:43.980> I'm<00:02:44.190> gonna

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
region of interest so now I'm gonna

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.640 
region of interest so now I'm gonna
create<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.760> head<00:02:44.909> turn<00:02:45.150> within<00:02:45.540> this<00:02:46.019> now<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
create the head turn within this now the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.500 
create the head turn within this now the
first<00:02:47.010> thing<00:02:47.160> we<00:02:47.310> need<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.579> do<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.849> decide<00:02:48.180> how

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
first thing we need to do is decide how

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.839 
first thing we need to do is decide how
many<00:02:48.959> frames<00:02:49.260> are<00:02:49.650> we<00:02:49.769> going<00:02:50.069> to<00:02:50.220> create<00:02:50.640> this

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
many frames are we going to create this

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.789 
many frames are we going to create this
head<00:02:51.090> turn<00:02:51.360> over<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:51.959> other<00:02:52.109> words<00:02:52.290> how<00:02:52.739> many

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
head turn over in other words how many

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.670 
head turn over in other words how many
steps<00:02:53.519> are<00:02:53.819> we<00:02:54.060> going<00:02:54.329> to<00:02:54.480> give<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.140> animator

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
steps are we going to give the animator

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.670 
steps are we going to give the animator
in<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.640> head<00:02:56.879> turn<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.359> think<00:02:57.629> a<00:02:57.989> good<00:02:58.200> value

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
in this head turn I think a good value

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.699 
in this head turn I think a good value
is<00:02:58.829> somewhere<00:02:59.099> around<00:02:59.489> 20<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:01.290> let's<00:03:01.560> go

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
is somewhere around 20 and so let's go

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.170 
is somewhere around 20 and so let's go
ahead<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:01.980> do<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.519> so<00:03:02.760> I'm<00:03:02.819> going<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.060> go

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
ahead and do that so I'm going to go

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.780 
ahead and do that so I'm going to go
into<00:03:03.450> my<00:03:03.780> composition<00:03:04.560> settings<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.310> I'm

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
into my composition settings and I'm

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.550 
into my composition settings and I'm
gonna<00:03:05.910> make<00:03:06.120> my<00:03:06.359> duration<00:03:06.989> not<00:03:07.680> 20<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:08.280> 21<00:03:09.560> and

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
gonna make my duration not 20 but 21 and

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.990 
gonna make my duration not 20 but 21 and
let<00:03:10.739> me<00:03:10.799> show<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.040> why<00:03:11.280> because<00:03:11.489> what<00:03:11.970> that

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
let me show you why because what that

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.210 
let me show you why because what that
does<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.629> makes<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:12.959> last<00:03:13.290> frame<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.099> we

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
does is it makes that last frame that we

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.420 
does is it makes that last frame that we
can<00:03:14.370> scroll<00:03:14.819> to<00:03:15.209> 20<00:03:16.140> then<00:03:16.410> we<00:03:16.560> have<00:03:16.739> 21<00:03:17.129> at<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
can scroll to 20 then we have 21 at the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.089 
can scroll to 20 then we have 21 at the
end<00:03:17.700> there<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.239> now<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.900> have<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.530> proper

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
end there so now that I have the proper

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.059 
end there so now that I have the proper
number<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.579> frames<00:03:21.260> let's<00:03:22.260> go<00:03:22.470> ahead<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.859> just

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
number of frames let's go ahead and just

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.909 
number of frames let's go ahead and just
animate<00:03:23.669> the<00:03:23.940> shape<00:03:24.299> of<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:25.049> head<00:03:25.319> so<00:03:25.799> the

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
animate the shape of the head so the

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.440 
animate the shape of the head so the
first<00:03:26.099> thing<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.280> want<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.489> do<00:03:26.579> is<00:03:26.700> select<00:03:26.940> all

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
first thing I want to do is select all

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.740 
first thing I want to do is select all
of<00:03:27.989> my<00:03:28.139> parts<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.030> hide<00:03:30.030> them<00:03:30.329> so<00:03:30.630> I'm<00:03:30.690> just

of my parts and hide them so I'm just

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.449 
of my parts and hide them so I'm just
gonna<00:03:30.900> go<00:03:31.109> and<00:03:31.230> hide<00:03:31.470> all<00:03:31.709> these<00:03:31.859> layers<00:03:32.160> I

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
gonna go and hide all these layers I

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.599 
gonna go and hide all these layers I
also<00:03:32.639> want<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:32.970> hide<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:34.260> left<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:34.919> right<00:03:35.160> ear

also want to hide the left and right ear

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.819 
also want to hide the left and right ear
so<00:03:36.419> I<00:03:36.480> just<00:03:36.660> want<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.900> keep<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.319> head<00:03:37.560> and

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
so I just want to keep the head and

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.069 
so I just want to keep the head and
we're<00:03:38.130> just<00:03:38.459> going<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.760> animate<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.569> shape<00:03:39.900> of

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
we're just going to animate the shape of

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.009 
we're just going to animate the shape of
the<00:03:40.530> head<00:03:40.799> so<00:03:41.760> we<00:03:41.880> can<00:03:41.910> do<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.359> by<00:03:42.569> just<00:03:42.870> using

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
the head so we can do that by just using

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.140 
the head so we can do that by just using
a<00:03:43.230> simple<00:03:43.709> distortion<00:03:44.489> we<00:03:44.549> can<00:03:44.669> actually<00:03:44.819> put

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
a simple distortion we can actually put

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.390 
a simple distortion we can actually put
an<00:03:45.269> effect<00:03:45.690> on<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.200> head<00:03:46.440> we're<00:03:47.069> gonna<00:03:47.160> go

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
an effect on the head we're gonna go

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.379 
an effect on the head we're gonna go
effect<00:03:48.000> distort<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.190> I<00:03:50.190> think<00:03:50.489> busy<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:50.940> warp

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
effect distort and I think busy a warp

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.210 
effect distort and I think busy a warp
is<00:03:51.630> actually<00:03:52.139> a<00:03:52.169> really<00:03:52.380> good<00:03:52.680> one<00:03:52.829> to<00:03:52.859> use<00:03:53.190> for

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
is actually a really good one to use for

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.830 
is actually a really good one to use for
this<00:03:53.489> because<00:03:53.639> all<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.000> does<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:54.299> just<00:03:54.540> put<00:03:54.810> a

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
this because all it does is just put a

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.720 
this because all it does is just put a
little<00:03:55.079> box<00:03:55.290> around<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.799> that<00:03:55.829> we<00:03:56.010> can<00:03:56.160> reshape

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
little box around it that we can reshape

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.869 
little box around it that we can reshape
and<00:03:56.970> kind<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.359> morph<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.620> head<00:03:59.040> so<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.669> first

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
and kind of morph the head so the first

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.069 
and kind of morph the head so the first
thing<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.060> want<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.239> do<00:04:00.359> is<00:04:00.480> make<00:04:00.629> sure<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:00.870> I

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
thing I want to do is make sure that I

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.970 
thing I want to do is make sure that I
have<00:04:01.530> a<00:04:01.919> position<00:04:02.910> for<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.930> center<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:04.919> I'm

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
have a position for the center so I'm

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.409 
have a position for the center so I'm
going<00:04:05.129> to<00:04:05.160> go<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.310> frame<00:04:05.579> 10<00:04:06.000> which<00:04:06.239> is<00:04:06.269> the

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
going to go to frame 10 which is the

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.960 
going to go to frame 10 which is the
center<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:06.840> my<00:04:07.019> animation<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.859> under<00:04:08.609> bezzie

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
center of my animation and under bezzie

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.599 
center of my animation and under bezzie
a<00:04:09.000> warp<00:04:09.450> I'm<00:04:09.720> gonna<00:04:09.930> select<00:04:10.139> all<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:11.040> the

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
a warp I'm gonna select all of the

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.830 
a warp I'm gonna select all of the
controls<00:04:12.569> here<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.079> then<00:04:13.949> just<00:04:14.810> set<00:04:15.810> a

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
controls here and then just set a

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.349 
controls here and then just set a
keyframe<00:04:16.049> for<00:04:16.289> everything<00:04:16.949> so<00:04:17.669> now<00:04:17.849> I've<00:04:18.090> got

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
keyframe for everything so now I've got

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.050 
keyframe for everything so now I've got
this<00:04:18.599> locked<00:04:19.079> down<00:04:19.380> in<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.979> center<00:04:20.459> position

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
this locked down in a center position

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.750 
this locked down in a center position
now<00:04:21.570> all<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.840> need<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.169> do<00:04:22.440> is<00:04:22.680> create<00:04:23.099> my<00:04:23.370> left

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
now all I need to do is create my left

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.540 
now all I need to do is create my left
and<00:04:24.030> right<00:04:24.440> head<00:04:25.440> shape<00:04:25.770> so<00:04:26.219> I'm<00:04:26.310> going<00:04:26.430> to<00:04:26.490> go

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
and right head shape so I'm going to go

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.219 
and right head shape so I'm going to go
all<00:04:26.849> the<00:04:26.940> way<00:04:26.969> down<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.300> frame<00:04:27.510> 0

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
all the way down to frame 0

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.320 
all the way down to frame 0
and<00:04:28.380> let's<00:04:28.770> go<00:04:28.889> ahead<00:04:29.130> into<00:04:29.460> our<00:04:29.550> busy<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:29.910> warp

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
and let's go ahead into our busy a warp

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.840 
and let's go ahead into our busy a warp
and<00:04:30.630> we're<00:04:30.750> just<00:04:30.840> gonna<00:04:31.220> alter<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.370> shape<00:04:32.580> so

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
and we're just gonna alter the shape so

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.300 
and we're just gonna alter the shape so
I'm<00:04:32.910> gonna<00:04:33.060> take<00:04:33.360> this<00:04:33.630> corner<00:04:34.050> here<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.590> if

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
I'm gonna take this corner here and if

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.010 
I'm gonna take this corner here and if
you<00:04:35.460> think<00:04:35.669> about<00:04:35.880> it<00:04:36.030> when<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.330> head<00:04:36.570> turns

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
you think about it when the head turns

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.860 
you think about it when the head turns
that<00:04:37.440> chin<00:04:37.800> kind<00:04:38.130> of<00:04:38.340> moves<00:04:38.580> from<00:04:39.330> one<00:04:39.570> side<00:04:39.840> to

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
that chin kind of moves from one side to

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.070 
that chin kind of moves from one side to
the<00:04:40.139> other<00:04:40.289> so<00:04:41.280> I'm<00:04:41.370> gonna<00:04:41.570> bring<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.780> chin

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
the other so I'm gonna bring the chin

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.010 
the other so I'm gonna bring the chin
out<00:04:43.229> a<00:04:43.500> little<00:04:43.860> bit<00:04:44.039> here<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:45.150> again<00:04:45.690> this<00:04:45.840> is

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
out a little bit here and again this is

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.990 
out a little bit here and again this is
just<00:04:46.259> the<00:04:46.410> shape<00:04:46.770> of<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:47.190> head<00:04:47.430> we're<00:04:47.940> gonna

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
just the shape of the head we're gonna

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.810 
just the shape of the head we're gonna
worry<00:04:48.300> about<00:04:48.330> facial<00:04:48.900> features<00:04:49.289> later<00:04:49.820> so

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
worry about facial features later so

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.219 
worry about facial features later so
when<00:04:50.910> you<00:04:50.970> take<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.150> look<00:04:51.389> at<00:04:51.539> this<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:51.870> can<00:04:51.990> see

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
when you take a look at this you can see

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.040 
when you take a look at this you can see
how<00:04:52.470> now<00:04:52.800> it's<00:04:53.070> going<00:04:53.490> from<00:04:53.699> the<00:04:54.060> jaw<00:04:54.600> straight

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
how now it's going from the jaw straight

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.370 
how now it's going from the jaw straight
at<00:04:55.320> you<00:04:55.650> -<00:04:56.580> maybe<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.060> jaw<00:04:57.300> over<00:04:57.750> here<00:04:58.199> and

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
at you - maybe the jaw over here and

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.890 
at you - maybe the jaw over here and
let's<00:04:59.370> do<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.639> same<00:04:59.850> for<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.300> other<00:05:00.449> side<00:05:00.780> I'm

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
let's do the same for the other side I'm

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.570 
let's do the same for the other side I'm
going<00:05:00.990> to<00:05:01.080> select<00:05:01.199> that<00:05:01.500> busy<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:01.830> warp<00:05:02.190> again

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
going to select that busy a warp again

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.749 
going to select that busy a warp again
and<00:05:02.849> again<00:05:03.599> I'm<00:05:03.690> gonna<00:05:03.840> push<00:05:04.289> it<00:05:04.320> in<00:05:04.680> here<00:05:05.310> to

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
and again I'm gonna push it in here to

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.900 
and again I'm gonna push it in here to
kind<00:05:06.000> of<00:05:06.060> round<00:05:06.360> out<00:05:06.630> where<00:05:07.229> that<00:05:07.440> jaw<00:05:08.130> was<00:05:08.490> and

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
kind of round out where that jaw was and

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.570 
kind of round out where that jaw was and
then<00:05:09.840> just<00:05:10.020> pull<00:05:10.320> out<00:05:10.349> the<00:05:10.530> jaw<00:05:10.860> a<00:05:11.009> little<00:05:11.430> bit

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
then just pull out the jaw a little bit

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.909 
then just pull out the jaw a little bit
on<00:05:11.820> this<00:05:12.330> side<00:05:12.630> here<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:13.259> again<00:05:13.650> I'm<00:05:13.770> gonna

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
on this side here and again I'm gonna

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.850 
on this side here and again I'm gonna
make<00:05:14.070> this<00:05:14.220> pretty<00:05:14.870> symmetrical<00:05:15.870> so<00:05:16.289> now<00:05:16.500> I've

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
make this pretty symmetrical so now I've

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.719 
make this pretty symmetrical so now I've
got<00:05:17.099> this<00:05:18.349> now<00:05:19.349> this<00:05:19.500> is<00:05:19.680> just<00:05:19.889> a<00:05:19.949> very<00:05:20.190> smooth

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
got this now this is just a very smooth

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.230 
got this now this is just a very smooth
shape<00:05:21.270> transition<00:05:22.199> but<00:05:22.740> if<00:05:22.949> I<00:05:23.039> go<00:05:23.250> into<00:05:23.550> my

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
shape transition but if I go into my

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.719 
shape transition but if I go into my
master<00:05:24.509> composition<00:05:25.470> let's<00:05:26.340> go<00:05:26.460> ahead<00:05:26.550> and

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
master composition let's go ahead and

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.969 
master composition let's go ahead and
fit<00:05:26.970> this<00:05:27.210> here<00:05:27.599> you'll<00:05:28.080> see<00:05:28.289> that<00:05:28.500> while<00:05:28.800> my

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
fit this here you'll see that while my

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.140 
fit this here you'll see that while my
head<00:05:29.340> shape<00:05:30.180> is<00:05:30.419> already<00:05:31.080> there<00:05:31.410> and<00:05:31.760> I<00:05:32.760> can

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
head shape is already there and I can

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.529 
head shape is already there and I can
take<00:05:33.690> this<00:05:33.990> and<00:05:34.320> just<00:05:35.250> like<00:05:35.760> with<00:05:36.060> replacement

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
take this and just like with replacement

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.320 
take this and just like with replacement
animation<00:05:37.199> I<00:05:37.320> can<00:05:37.530> do<00:05:37.770> right<00:05:38.550> click<00:05:38.849> over<00:05:39.180> it

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
animation I can do right click over it

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.010 
animation I can do right click over it
time<00:05:40.139> and<00:05:40.500> naval<00:05:41.400> time<00:05:41.639> remapping<00:05:42.120> and<00:05:42.840> when<00:05:42.990> I

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
time and naval time remapping and when I

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.469 
time and naval time remapping and when I
do<00:05:43.139> that<00:05:43.590> all<00:05:44.039> I<00:05:44.340> have<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.610> do<00:05:44.760> again<00:05:45.240> is<00:05:45.449> just

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
do that all I have to do again is just

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.409 
do that all I have to do again is just
delete<00:05:46.080> that<00:05:46.110> last<00:05:46.530> key<00:05:46.949> and<00:05:47.220> now<00:05:47.789> what<00:05:48.120> I<00:05:48.150> can

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
delete that last key and now what I can

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.520 
delete that last key and now what I can
do<00:05:48.570> is<00:05:48.810> I<00:05:49.020> can<00:05:49.080> go<00:05:49.530> from<00:05:49.800> frame<00:05:50.220> 0<00:05:50.760> to<00:05:51.690> frame<00:05:51.960> 20

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
do is I can go from frame 0 to frame 20

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.379 
do is I can go from frame 0 to frame 20
and<00:05:52.770> you<00:05:53.370> can<00:05:53.520> see<00:05:55.039> how<00:05:56.039> it<00:05:56.250> changes<00:05:56.280> shape<00:05:56.820> so

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
and you can see how it changes shape so

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.529 
and you can see how it changes shape so
I'm<00:05:57.479> getting<00:05:57.720> a<00:05:57.900> smooth<00:05:58.440> in<00:05:58.860> between<00:05:59.610> now<00:06:00.360> one

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
I'm getting a smooth in between now one

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:01.879 
I'm getting a smooth in between now one
of<00:06:00.599> the<00:06:00.659> things<00:06:00.780> I'm<00:06:00.960> noticing<00:06:01.259> here<00:06:01.440> is<00:06:01.680> that

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
of the things I'm noticing here is that

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.219 
of the things I'm noticing here is that
when<00:06:02.070> I<00:06:02.099> get<00:06:02.220> to<00:06:02.430> the<00:06:02.759> very<00:06:02.789> last<00:06:03.419> frame<00:06:03.659> it

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
when I get to the very last frame it

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.860 
when I get to the very last frame it
disappears<00:06:05.159> and<00:06:05.370> we<00:06:05.909> can<00:06:06.090> fix<00:06:06.330> that<00:06:06.599> because

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
disappears and we can fix that because

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.950 
disappears and we can fix that because
what<00:06:07.289> happens<00:06:07.770> here<00:06:07.860> is<00:06:08.130> when<00:06:08.820> we<00:06:09.180> shrink<00:06:09.780> it

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
what happens here is when we shrink it

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.670 
what happens here is when we shrink it
down<00:06:10.080> to<00:06:10.139> 21<00:06:10.650> frames<00:06:11.130> this<00:06:12.120> is<00:06:12.419> the<00:06:12.900> 21st<00:06:13.349> frame

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
down to 21 frames this is the 21st frame

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.800 
down to 21 frames this is the 21st frame
and<00:06:13.919> there's<00:06:14.070> no<00:06:14.310> bitmap<00:06:15.030> over<00:06:15.419> it<00:06:15.509> so<00:06:15.630> all<00:06:15.750> I

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
and there's no bitmap over it so all I

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.629 
and there's no bitmap over it so all I
have<00:06:15.930> to<00:06:15.990> do<00:06:16.110> is<00:06:16.169> right<00:06:16.320> click<00:06:16.349> and<00:06:16.770> drag<00:06:16.949> this

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
have to do is right click and drag this

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.689 
have to do is right click and drag this
over<00:06:18.409> and<00:06:19.409> we<00:06:19.440> go<00:06:19.800> here<00:06:20.330> now<00:06:21.330> that<00:06:21.599> last<00:06:21.990> frame

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:22.699 
over and we go here now that last frame

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:25.850 
over and we go here now that last frame
won't<00:06:23.699> disappear<00:06:24.389> in<00:06:24.599> fact<00:06:25.169> I<00:06:25.349> need<00:06:25.560> to<00:06:25.710> do

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
won't disappear in fact I need to do

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.800 
won't disappear in fact I need to do
this<00:06:26.039> for<00:06:26.280> everything<00:06:26.759> in<00:06:27.090> the<00:06:27.150> composition

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
this for everything in the composition

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.300 
this for everything in the composition
so<00:06:27.960> in<00:06:28.050> fact<00:06:28.289> I<00:06:28.409> should<00:06:28.620> probably<00:06:28.650> select

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
so in fact I should probably select

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.640 
so in fact I should probably select
everything<00:06:29.759> and<00:06:30.090> then<00:06:30.750> just<00:06:30.960> make<00:06:31.110> sure<00:06:31.380> that

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
everything and then just make sure that

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.939 
everything and then just make sure that
it's<00:06:31.919> one<00:06:32.580> frame<00:06:33.000> over<00:06:33.300> that<00:06:34.199> end<00:06:34.530> and<00:06:34.740> that

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949 
it's one frame over that end and that

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.080 
it's one frame over that end and that
way<00:06:35.099> we<00:06:35.430> won't<00:06:35.699> run<00:06:35.940> into<00:06:36.000> this<00:06:36.360> problem<00:06:36.750> later

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
way we won't run into this problem later

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.850 
way we won't run into this problem later
so<00:06:39.090> now<00:06:39.240> we<00:06:39.300> have<00:06:39.630> the<00:06:39.870> basic<00:06:40.409> head<00:06:40.800> shape<00:06:40.830> but

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
so now we have the basic head shape but

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.800 
so now we have the basic head shape but
now<00:06:41.949> let's<00:06:42.129> go<00:06:42.280> ahead<00:06:42.550> and<00:06:42.759> go<00:06:42.969> through<00:06:43.360> the

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
now let's go ahead and go through the

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.050 
now let's go ahead and go through the
rest<00:06:43.840> of<00:06:44.229> the<00:06:44.379> head<00:06:44.590> and<00:06:44.830> start<00:06:45.219> adding<00:06:45.669> in<00:06:45.849> the

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
rest of the head and start adding in the

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.400 
rest of the head and start adding in the
other<00:06:46.270> components<00:06:47.139> of<00:06:47.259> the<00:06:47.860> head<00:06:48.099> turn
