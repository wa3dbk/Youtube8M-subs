00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.060 

now<00:02:15.600> i'm<00:02:15.810> gonna<00:02:15.990> go<00:02:16.200> get<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:17.270> bigger<00:02:19.070> angle

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070

now i'm gonna go get this bigger angle
brush<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:21.270> makes<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:22.080> shadow<00:02:22.380> base<00:02:22.590> in

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
brush and this makes a shadow base in

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.920 
brush and this makes a shadow base in
beige<00:02:23.450> i'm<00:02:24.450> going<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.900> use<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.350> line<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
beige i'm going to use it to line the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.979 
beige i'm going to use it to line the
below<00:02:27.930> my<00:02:28.140> brow<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:29.489> create<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:30.060> more<00:02:30.510> precise

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
below my brow to create a more precise

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.150 
below my brow to create a more precise
line<00:02:31.430> this<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.610> also<00:02:32.880> going<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.480> be<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:34.800> base

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
line this is also going to be the base

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.970 
line this is also going to be the base
of<00:02:35.550> my<00:02:36.290> eyeshadow<00:02:37.290> my<00:02:37.650> highlights<00:02:38.070> later<00:02:38.400> so

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
of my eyeshadow my highlights later so

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.070 
of my eyeshadow my highlights later so
like<00:02:40.980> earlier<00:02:41.430> I'm<00:02:41.760> just<00:02:42.150> creating<00:02:42.780> a

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
like earlier I'm just creating a

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.320 
like earlier I'm just creating a
straight<00:02:43.470> line<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.100> follow<00:02:44.400> through<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
straight line and follow through to the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:54.040 
straight line and follow through to the
tail<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.600> my<00:02:45.900> brow

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.720 

and<00:02:55.050> then<00:02:55.320> I'm<00:02:55.470> just<00:02:55.500> going<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:55.950> drag<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.310> down

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
and then I'm just going to drag it down

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.170 
and then I'm just going to drag it down
towards<00:02:57.360> my<00:02:57.600> crease<00:02:57.960> so<00:02:58.920> it's<00:02:59.250> easier<00:02:59.760> to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
towards my crease so it's easier to

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:15.500 
towards my crease so it's easier to
blend<00:03:00.810> later<00:03:01.200> with<00:03:01.500> my<00:03:01.680> fingers<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:14.300> I<00:03:15.300> also

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
blend later with my fingers and I also

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.460 
blend later with my fingers and I also
did<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.410> same<00:03:16.440> process<00:03:17.310> on<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.610> upper<00:03:18.470> side

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
did the same process on the upper side

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.030 
did the same process on the upper side
of<00:03:19.530> my<00:03:19.890> brow<00:03:20.900> just<00:03:21.900> going<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.320> line<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.560> and

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
of my brow just going to line it and

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.800 
of my brow just going to line it and
