so this is yeah my beginning of the

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.070 
so this is yeah my beginning of the
floorstanding<00:00:06.810> speaker<00:00:06.919> project<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:09.080> I've

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
floorstanding speaker project and I've

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.870 
floorstanding speaker project and I've
already<00:00:10.320> finished<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.429> phrase<00:00:12.830> so<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:14.610> see

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
already finished it to phrase so you see

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.170 
already finished it to phrase so you see
all<00:00:15.330> rising<00:00:17.210> yeah<00:00:18.380> okay<00:00:19.380> over<00:00:19.800> here<00:00:20.180> decided

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
all rising yeah okay over here decided

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.240 
all rising yeah okay over here decided
to<00:00:21.720> go<00:00:21.869> with<00:00:22.080> like<00:00:22.260> four<00:00:22.590> pieces<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
to go with like four pieces in the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.470 
to go with like four pieces in the
insides<00:00:24.199> then<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:26.550> drivers<00:00:26.939> are<00:00:27.060> going<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.390> be

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
insides then the drivers are going to be

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.240 
insides then the drivers are going to be
mounting<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> roof<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.680> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.099> be

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
mounting it so the roof is going to be

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.939 
mounting it so the roof is going to be
here<00:00:29.720> that's<00:00:30.720> why<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.960> spacing<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> little

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
here that's why the spacing is a little

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.280 
here that's why the spacing is a little
bit<00:00:32.040> wider<00:00:32.279> overhead<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.149> over<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.690> it's

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
bit wider overhead and over here it's

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.069 
bit wider overhead and over here it's
here<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.670> tweeters<00:00:36.059> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.420> mount<00:00:36.870> it

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
here and the tweeters going to mount it

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.510 
here and the tweeters going to mount it
over<00:00:37.590> here<00:00:38.570> know<00:00:40.280> a<00:00:41.690> little<00:00:42.690> bit<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.960> research

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
over here know a little bit of research

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.560 
over here know a little bit of research
things<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.480> decided<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:47.539> for<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
things like that and decided to for a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.799 
things like that and decided to for a
way<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.289> would<00:00:50.070> enforce<00:00:50.520> design<00:00:51.090> ready

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
way that would enforce design ready

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.319 
way that would enforce design ready
doesn't<00:00:52.739> really<00:00:52.829> matter<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:56.309> thing<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.879> that

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
doesn't really matter the thing is that

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.970 
doesn't really matter the thing is that
the<00:00:57.750> plastic<00:00:58.050> trumpet<00:00:58.770> shape<00:00:59.039> ports<00:01:00.770> will<00:01:01.770> do

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the plastic trumpet shape ports will do

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.690 
the plastic trumpet shape ports will do
a<00:01:02.250> better<00:01:02.520> job<00:01:02.670> at<00:01:03.120> reducing<00:01:03.719> airport<00:01:04.260> noise

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
a better job at reducing airport noise

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.530 
a better job at reducing airport noise
so<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:07.159> that's<00:01:08.159> really<00:01:08.369> what<00:01:08.610> he<00:01:08.700> wants<00:01:09.210> it

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
so and that's really what he wants it

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.330 
so and that's really what he wants it
will<00:01:09.689> save<00:01:09.900> me<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.140> lot<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.290> time<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.189> is

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
will save me a lot of time and it is

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.690 
will save me a lot of time and it is
it's<00:01:11.790> cheaper<00:01:12.119> than<00:01:12.299> buying<00:01:12.630> new<00:01:12.890> router<00:01:13.890> bits

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
it's cheaper than buying new router bits

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.950 
it's cheaper than buying new router bits
retire<00:01:15.180> don't<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.960> need<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:18.060> they<00:01:18.900> were

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
retire don't really need and they were

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.770 
retire don't really need and they were
like<00:01:19.320> hello<00:01:19.830> hello<00:01:20.340> expensive<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:23.390> see<00:01:24.390> this

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
like hello hello expensive so see this

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:34.130 
like hello hello expensive so see this
is<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.110> shape<00:01:26.509> like<00:01:27.509> Grandma<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:33.140> we're

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
is the shape like Grandma and we're

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.039 
is the shape like Grandma and we're
standing<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.670> well<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:36.750> very

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
standing like that well it's not very

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.200 
standing like that well it's not very
stable<00:01:37.380> because<00:01:37.740> that's<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> very<00:01:38.850> small

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
stable because that's like a very small

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.410 
stable because that's like a very small
base<00:01:39.860> still<00:01:40.860> need<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.250> yeah<00:01:43.970> yeah<00:01:44.970> these<00:01:45.210> are

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
base still need to yeah yeah these are

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.130 
base still need to yeah yeah these are
the<00:01:45.450> sort<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.840> base<00:01:46.259> which<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:48.000> D<00:01:48.420> speak<00:01:48.750> focus

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
the sort of base which the D speak focus

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.749 
the sort of base which the D speak focus
standing<00:01:49.500> already<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:51.630> could<00:01:52.250> like<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.460> floor

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
standing already it could like the floor

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.539 
standing already it could like the floor
okay<00:01:54.030> also<00:01:54.659> isn't<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:55.290> yeah<00:01:56.280> that's

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
okay also isn't really yeah that's

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:56.929 
okay also isn't really yeah that's
better

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
better

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.060 
better
I<00:01:58.909> could<00:01:59.909> go<00:02:00.119> for<00:02:00.360> our<00:02:00.600> outriggers<00:02:01.560> which<00:02:01.890> are

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
I could go for our outriggers which are

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.330 
I could go for our outriggers which are
just<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:05.310> long<00:02:05.549> bars<00:02:06.950> weightless<00:02:07.950> with

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
just like that long bars weightless with

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.999 
just like that long bars weightless with
the<00:02:08.459> spikes<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:09.030> them<00:02:09.239> or<00:02:10.020> can<00:02:10.379> also<00:02:10.530> go<00:02:10.830> for

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the spikes on them or can also go for

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.150 
the spikes on them or can also go for
like<00:02:11.160> Laurel<00:02:11.959> right

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
like Laurel right

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.590 
like Laurel right
shaped<00:02:13.640> base<00:02:15.010> which<00:02:16.010> could<00:02:16.250> also<00:02:16.430> have<00:02:16.880> spikes

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
shaped base which could also have spikes

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.090 
shaped base which could also have spikes
in<00:02:17.900> an<00:02:18.020> air<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:20.750> shoe<00:02:21.050> boys<00:02:21.320> brought<00:02:21.920> the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
in an air and a shoe boys brought the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.450 
in an air and a shoe boys brought the
spikes<00:02:22.460> now<00:02:23.380> because<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.530> ones<00:02:24.740> that<00:02:24.950> was<00:02:25.160> for

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
spikes now because the ones that was for

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.790 
spikes now because the ones that was for
for<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.390> other<00:02:26.570> speakers<00:02:27.170> were<00:02:27.380> not<00:02:27.530> very
