00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
ahead and cut the cards wherever you

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.789 
ahead and cut the cards wherever you
like<00:00:12.019> great<00:00:13.019> just<00:00:13.230> like<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.679> we'll<00:00:13.769> just

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
we're going to try to tap into that

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.859 
we're going to try to tap into that
field<00:00:26.310> ourselves<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.480> you're<00:00:27.570> going<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.720> help

believe it or not just by touching them
you<00:00:49.890> actually<00:00:50.160> magnetized<00:00:51.059> those<00:00:51.360> cards<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809

word for it because with just a little

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.750 
word for it because with just a little
bit<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.289> magnetism<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.250> little<00:00:56.520> bit<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
bit of magnetism and a little bit of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.479 
bit of magnetism and a little bit of
magic<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.410> can<00:00:59.149> take<00:01:00.149> those<00:01:00.329> cards<00:01:01.250> right<00:01:02.250> back

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
magic I can take those cards right back

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.910 
magic I can take those cards right back
out<00:01:02.699> all<00:01:03.629> right<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:03.989> that's<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.350> six<00:01:04.650> nine

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
out all right so that's the six nine

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.109 
out all right so that's the six nine
trick<00:01:05.280> I'm<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.580> show<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.820> guys<00:01:06.060> how

of cards you have to set it up the deck
up<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.290> little<00:01:19.470> bit<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.369> totally

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
up a little bit but it's a totally

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.770 
up a little bit but it's a totally

works<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.009> called<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> criss<00:01:41.549> cross<00:01:41.820> force

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
works it's called the criss cross force

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.149 
works it's called the criss cross force
before<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.409> show<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.770> though<00:01:43.860> I'm<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.100> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
before I show that though I'm going to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.340 
before I show that though I'm going to
show<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.520> set<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.909> secret<00:01:45.299> setup<00:01:45.630> you

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
show you the set of the secret setup you

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.700 
show you the set of the secret setup you
want<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.590> begin<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.040> trick<00:01:47.299> with<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.600> six<00:01:49.560> of

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
want to begin the trick with a six of

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.649 
want to begin the trick with a six of
Spades<00:01:50.130> right<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.180> doesn't<00:01:51.420> matter<00:01:51.570> but

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
Spades right it doesn't matter but

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.950 
Spades right it doesn't matter but
generally<00:01:52.229> six<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.560> spades<00:01:53.540> right<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:54.750> on

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
generally six of spades right there on

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.840 
generally six of spades right there on
the<00:01:55.140> bottom<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.619> six<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.100> A<00:01:56.130> nine<00:01:56.340> look<00:01:56.579> pretty

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
the bottom a six and A nine look pretty

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.940 
the bottom a six and A nine look pretty
much<00:01:56.969> alike<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:58.079> brain<00:01:58.290> has<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> hard<00:01:58.740> time

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
much alike the brain has a hard time

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.440 
much alike the brain has a hard time
separating<00:01:59.250> them<00:01:59.670> which<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.909> why<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.180> use<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
separating them which is why we use a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.510 
separating them which is why we use a
six<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.960> A<00:02:01.020> nine<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.439> effect<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.369> put

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
six and A nine for this effect so we put

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.830 
six and A nine for this effect so we put
the<00:02:02.610> six<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.909> spades<00:02:03.119> right<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> bottom

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the six of spades right on the bottom

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.590 
the six of spades right on the bottom
then<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.259> put<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.799> nine<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.130> clubs<00:02:05.520> right<00:02:06.450> on

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
then we put the nine of clubs right on

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.960 
then we put the nine of clubs right on
top<00:02:06.840> above<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:08.039> put<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> six<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.819> clubs

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
top above that we put the six of clubs

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.390 
top above that we put the six of clubs
and<00:02:09.360> then<00:02:10.080> on<00:02:10.200> top<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:10.979> put<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.250> nine

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and then on top of that we put the nine

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.870 
and then on top of that we put the nine
of<00:02:11.550> spades

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
of spades

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.950

know a few minutes ago most people in

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.730 
know a few minutes ago most people in
fact<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.810> pretty<00:02:51.050> effective<00:02:51.290> force

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
fact this is a pretty effective force

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.040 
fact this is a pretty effective force
will<00:02:52.400> forget<00:02:52.940> that<00:02:53.000> this<00:02:53.360> was<00:02:53.420> actually<00:02:53.840> the

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
will forget that this was actually the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.990

top of the deck she cut the deck here

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.490 
top of the deck she cut the deck here
but<00:02:59.000> because<00:02:59.150> we<00:02:59.450> used<00:02:59.660> this<00:02:59.870> as<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.170> marker

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
but because we used this as the marker

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.640 
but because we used this as the marker
and<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.710> crisscross<00:03:01.190> formation<00:03:01.820> I<00:03:02.590> asked<00:03:03.590> her
