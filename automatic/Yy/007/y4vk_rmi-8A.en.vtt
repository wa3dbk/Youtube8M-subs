nice<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.700> how<00:01:57.940> much<00:01:58.030> more<00:01:58.300> would<00:01:58.510> it<00:01:58.570> cost<00:01:58.810> to

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
nice so how much more would it cost to

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.410 
nice so how much more would it cost to
add<00:01:59.080> Wi-Fi<00:01:59.350> you<00:01:59.860> cannot<00:02:00.100> do<00:02:00.190> that<00:02:00.340> at<00:02:01.090> present

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
add Wi-Fi you cannot do that at present

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.560 
add Wi-Fi you cannot do that at present
it<00:02:02.020> can<00:02:02.320> ask<00:02:02.560> for<00:02:02.740> Wi-Fi<00:02:03.430> University<00:02:04.090> Council

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
it can ask for Wi-Fi University Council

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.130 
it can ask for Wi-Fi University Council
is<00:02:04.750> android<00:02:05.380> 2.1<00:02:05.980> and<00:02:06.430> due<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.330> halfway<00:02:07.690> or
