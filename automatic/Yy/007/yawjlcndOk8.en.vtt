size of that horn a little bit so we'll
come<00:00:45.840> down<00:00:46.190> at<00:00:47.190> an<00:00:47.370> angle<00:00:47.579> back<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.570> head

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
come down at an angle back to the head

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.189 
come down at an angle back to the head
okay<00:00:49.320> let's<00:00:49.559> follow<00:00:49.739> along<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.690> parallel<00:00:51.690> on

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
a curved line here and out of the sides

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:27.370 
a curved line here and out of the sides
we<00:01:20.159> will<00:01:20.400> give<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:22.590> its<00:01:23.270> tusks<00:01:25.820> they're

we will give as to its tusks they're

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.020 
we will give as to its tusks they're
almost<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:29.100> shaped<00:01:30.590> two<00:01:31.590> slanted<00:01:32.400> lines<00:01:32.670> for

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
almost this shaped two slanted lines for

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.980 
almost this shaped two slanted lines for
the<00:01:33.150> nostrils<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.380> eyes<00:01:35.659> they're<00:01:36.659> going

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the nostrils and the eyes they're going

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.640 
the nostrils and the eyes they're going
to<00:01:37.079> be<00:01:37.200> an<00:01:37.470> arch<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.579> egg<00:01:38.850> shape<00:01:39.470> we're<00:01:40.470> going

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
to be an arch and egg shape we're going

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.649 
to be an arch and egg shape we're going
to<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.950> add<00:01:41.100> another<00:01:41.490> line<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.420> so

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
to have to add another line to it so

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.080 
to have to add another line to it so
let's<00:01:42.930> start<00:01:43.500> off<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.970> egg<00:01:45.329> shape<00:01:47.090> from

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
let's start off with the egg shape from

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.630 
let's start off with the egg shape from
here<00:01:48.630> we're<00:01:49.229> going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.560> come<00:01:49.740> down<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
here we're going to come down just a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.660 
here we're going to come down just a
little<00:01:50.670> bit<00:01:50.909> almost<00:01:51.270> straight<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.670> connect

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
little bit almost straight and connect

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.370 
little bit almost straight and connect
there<00:01:54.740> inside

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
there inside

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.459 
there inside
okay<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.590> will<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> curved<00:01:59.790> line<00:02:00.469> then

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
okay I will have a curved line then

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.530 
okay I will have a curved line then
we're<00:02:01.590> going<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.829> make<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> very<00:02:02.549> long

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
we're going to make a very long

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.609 
we're going to make a very long
elongated<00:02:04.350> oval<00:02:05.340> we'll<00:02:06.270> make<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> smaller<00:02:07.020> oval

an oval in the center of the eye and

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.479 
an oval in the center of the eye and
we're<00:02:13.159> going<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.430> make<00:02:13.549> a<00:02:13.579> smaller<00:02:14.150> oval

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
we're going to make a smaller oval

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.000 
we're going to make a smaller oval
towards<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:16.609> bottom<00:02:16.849> and<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.900> small<00:02:18.349> circle

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
towards the bottom and a small circle

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.000 
towards the bottom and a small circle
right<00:02:19.400> there<00:02:19.510> no<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:20.840> am<00:02:21.109> going<00:02:21.439> to<00:02:21.560> do<00:02:21.769> the

right there no I am going to do the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.410 
right there no I am going to do the
other<00:02:22.040> eye<00:02:23.319> around<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.469> collar<00:02:24.799> is<00:02:25.219> it<00:02:26.209> looks

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
other eye around the collar is it looks

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.170 
other eye around the collar is it looks
like<00:02:26.629> a<00:02:26.659> kerchief<00:02:27.109> almost<00:02:27.920> well<00:02:28.730> come<00:02:29.000> down

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.420 

to<00:02:51.630> indicate<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.349> body<00:02:52.650> we're<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.190> going<00:02:53.400> to

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
to indicate the body we're just going to

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.470 
to indicate the body we're just going to
come<00:02:53.610> down<00:02:53.819> two<00:02:54.599> curved<00:02:54.870> lines<00:02:55.880> like<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.239> and

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
come down two curved lines like so and

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.040 
come down two curved lines like so and
then<00:02:58.230> another<00:02:59.010> curve<00:02:59.400> out<00:02:59.610> here<00:02:59.970> which<00:03:00.599> will

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
then another curve out here which will
