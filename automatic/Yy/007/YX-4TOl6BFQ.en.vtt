i<00:01:08.119> would<00:01:09.119> say<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.270> lemondogs<00:01:09.840> has<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:11.460> most

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
i would say that lemondogs has the most

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.580 
i would say that lemondogs has the most
potential<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.299> new<00:01:12.540> amateur<00:01:12.869> teams<00:01:13.229> they<00:01:13.530> are

potential of new amateur teams they are

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.270 
potential of new amateur teams they are
increasing<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:14.670> fast<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.690> can<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:16.920> for

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
increasing really fast they can get for

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.730 
increasing really fast they can get for
one<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> top<00:01:18.150> places<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.500> summer

called I'm have been around for such a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.340 
called I'm have been around for such a
long<00:01:23.880> time<00:01:23.940> they<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:25.020> don't<00:01:25.170> need<00:01:25.229> an

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
long time they really don't need an

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.139 
long time they really don't need an
introduction<00:01:25.920> anymore<00:01:26.490> they<00:01:26.729> were<00:01:26.790> play

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
introduction anymore they were play

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.460 
introduction anymore they were play
really<00:01:27.330> solid<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:27.960> they<00:01:28.050> probably<00:01:28.259> still

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
really solid but they probably still

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.050 
really solid but they probably still
have<00:01:28.590> some<00:01:28.770> weaknesses<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.759> see<00:01:29.940> if

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
have some weaknesses and it's to see if

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.520 
have some weaknesses and it's to see if
those<00:01:30.180> weaknesses<00:01:30.450> get<00:01:30.810> exposed<00:01:31.170> during<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
those weaknesses get exposed during the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.010 
those weaknesses get exposed during the
next<00:01:31.680> week's<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.330> think<00:01:33.330> I'll<00:01:33.479> turn<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.750> started

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
next week's I think I'll turn it started

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.389 
next week's I think I'll turn it started
off<00:01:34.080> really<00:01:34.290> strong<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.009> didn't<00:01:35.280> make<00:01:35.369> it

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
off really strong like it didn't make it

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:36.770 
off really strong like it didn't make it
into<00:01:35.610> last<00:01:35.880> blit<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.540> really

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
into last blit and that can really

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.090 
into last blit and that can really
frustrate<00:01:37.200> them<00:01:37.409> first<00:01:37.740> couple<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.040> weeks

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
frustrate them first couple of weeks

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.850 
frustrate them first couple of weeks
they're<00:01:38.610> gonna<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.970> quite<00:01:39.840> strong<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
they're gonna be quite strong but as the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.410 
they're gonna be quite strong but as the
old<00:01:41.160> experienced<00:01:41.580> teams<00:01:41.759> come<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.210> think

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
old experienced teams come in I think

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.180 
old experienced teams come in I think
they're<00:01:42.539> gonna<00:01:42.630> learn<00:01:42.990> these<00:01:43.200> new<00:01:43.380> teams<00:01:43.619> like

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
they're gonna learn these new teams like

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.070 
they're gonna learn these new teams like
strengths<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.940> weaknesses<00:01:45.330> and<00:01:45.539> then<00:01:45.600> we

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
strengths and weaknesses and then we

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.210 
strengths and weaknesses and then we
cannot<00:01:46.259> falter<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> bit<00:01:46.619> hopefully<00:01:47.100> that's

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
cannot falter a bit hopefully that's

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.310 
cannot falter a bit hopefully that's
what<00:01:47.340> happens<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:48.000> better<00:01:48.179> beat<00:01:48.360> them<00:01:48.479> it

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
what happens we better beat them it

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.440 
what happens we better beat them it
feels<00:01:49.500> great<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:49.920> NLCS<00:01:50.460> player<00:01:50.789> so<00:01:51.300> much

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
feels great to be NLCS player so much

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.290 
feels great to be NLCS player so much

chance<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.780> be<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.080> because<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.530> already

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
chance to be here because I already

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.710 
chance to be here because I already
qualified<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.580> scale<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.030> don't<00:02:00.600> need<00:02:00.659> to

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720

prove<00:02:00.899> anything<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.440> went<00:02:02.190> to<00:02:02.310> escape<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.880> now

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
prove anything I went to escape and now

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.059 
prove anything I went to escape and now
I<00:02:03.119> join<00:02:03.509> again<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:03.990> alternate<00:02:04.470> so<00:02:04.679> it's

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
I join again with alternate so it's

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:11.060 
I join again with alternate so it's
enough<00:02:05.340> proof<00:02:05.490> for<00:02:05.550> myself<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:09.590> expect<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.739> we

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
enough proof for myself I expect that we

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.150 
enough proof for myself I expect that we
will<00:02:11.250> learn<00:02:11.760> much<00:02:12.060> from<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:13.019> summer<00:02:13.709> pit<00:02:13.980> I

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
will learn much from this summer pit I

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.340 
will learn much from this summer pit I
hope<00:02:14.459> we'll<00:02:15.269> get<00:02:15.570> enough<00:02:16.410> experience<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:18.350> keep

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
hope we'll get enough experience to keep

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.789

up<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.010> other<00:02:20.160> teams<00:02:21.140> well<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.170> think<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
up to the other teams well I think the

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.130 
up to the other teams well I think the
all-team<00:02:23.310> juice<00:02:23.579> underestimate<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:24.810> much<00:02:24.989> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
all-team juice underestimate so much the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.870 
all-team juice underestimate so much the
new<00:02:25.260> teams<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.680> newcomers<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.370> that's

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
new teams the newcomers and that's

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.390 
new teams the newcomers and that's
something<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.299> should<00:02:27.570> never<00:02:27.720> do<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:29.220> was

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
something this should never do it was

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.069 
something this should never do it was
really<00:02:29.640> good<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.820> finally<00:02:30.269> be<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.780> LCS

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
really good to finally be in the LCS

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.810 
really good to finally be in the LCS
