00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that people really like to buy bigger

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.469 
that people really like to buy bigger
phones<00:01:40.770> than<00:01:41.130> their<00:01:41.280> previous<00:01:41.430> phones<00:01:41.850> so

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
phones than their previous phones so

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.359 
phones than their previous phones so
this<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.110> grew<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.740> little<00:01:43.829> bit<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.340> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
this one grew up a little bit and it's a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.639 
this one grew up a little bit and it's a
little<00:01:44.549> bit<00:01:44.700> bigger<00:01:44.909> now<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.320> black

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
little bit bigger now this is black

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.569 
little bit bigger now this is black
comes<00:01:47.220> black<00:01:47.520> out<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.909> box<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.390> moto<00:01:49.049> is

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
comes black out of the box but moto is

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.670 
comes black out of the box but moto is
sticking<00:01:50.579> with<00:01:50.729> last<00:01:51.030> year's<00:01:51.439> idea<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
sticking with last year's idea of

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.740 
sticking with last year's idea of
creating<00:01:53.220> swappable<00:01:53.759> back<00:01:54.060> cover<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.630> I've

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
creating swappable back cover so I've

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.840 
creating swappable back cover so I've
got<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.170> they're<00:01:56.130> also<00:01:56.250> doing<00:01:56.490> sort<00:01:56.759> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
got one here they're also doing sort of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.520 
got one here they're also doing sort of
flip<00:01:57.149> style<00:01:57.450> cases<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.110> will<00:01:58.229> cover<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
flip style cases that will cover the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.899 
flip style cases that will cover the
front<00:01:58.829> as<00:01:58.979> well<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.369> there's<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.549> whole<00:01:59.880> bunch

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
front as well but there's a whole bunch

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.300 
front as well but there's a whole bunch
of<00:02:00.270> different<00:02:00.540> colors<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.619> can't<00:02:01.829> go<00:02:02.009> moto

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
of different colors so you can't go moto

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.010 
of different colors so you can't go moto
maker<00:02:02.549> personalization<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.869> know<00:02:03.930> with

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
maker personalization like you know with

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.749 
maker personalization like you know with
the<00:02:04.079> Moto<00:02:04.290> X<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.680> can<00:02:04.799> still<00:02:04.979> really<00:02:05.159> customize

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
the Moto X be can still really customize

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.330 
the Moto X be can still really customize
it<00:02:05.790> by<00:02:06.659> swapping<00:02:06.990> out<00:02:07.229> backs<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.979> stuff<00:02:08.190> like

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
it by swapping out backs and stuff like

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.850 
it by swapping out backs and stuff like
that<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.580> kind<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.450> cool<00:02:09.629> there

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
that so kind of cool there

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.570 
that so kind of cool there
in<00:02:11.100> terms<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.270> new<00:02:12.690> stuff<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:13.950> again<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.460> can

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
in terms of new stuff so again you can

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.830 
in terms of new stuff so again you can
see<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.850> device<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.120> definitely<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.750> little

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
see the device is definitely a little

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.900 
see the device is definitely a little
bit<00:02:16.020> bigger<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.320> last<00:02:16.530> moto<00:02:16.860> G<00:02:17.160> was<00:02:17.550> actually

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
bit bigger the last moto G was actually

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.580 
bit bigger the last moto G was actually
quite<00:02:18.210> small<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:18.780> one's<00:02:19.050> definitely<00:02:19.440> a

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
quite small this one's definitely a

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.620 
quite small this one's definitely a
little<00:02:19.830> bit<00:02:19.920> bigger<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:20.190> if<00:02:20.430> we<00:02:20.520> talk<00:02:20.670> specs

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
little bit bigger so if we talk specs

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.830 
little bit bigger so if we talk specs
you're<00:02:22.230> looking<00:02:22.500> at<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> 5<00:02:23.070> inch<00:02:23.370> HD<00:02:23.660> display

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
you're looking at a 5 inch HD display

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.100 
you're looking at a 5 inch HD display
so<00:02:25.110> that's<00:02:25.340> 720p<00:02:26.340> not<00:02:26.820> 1080p<00:02:27.690> like<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.990> new

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
so that's 720p not 1080p like the new

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.610 
so that's 720p not 1080p like the new
moto<00:02:28.350> X<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.760> previous<00:02:30.300> version<00:02:30.600> was<00:02:30.720> 4.5<00:02:31.380> inch

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
moto X the previous version was 4.5 inch

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.980 
moto X the previous version was 4.5 inch
720p<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.610> it's<00:02:32.850> still<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.150> same<00:02:33.330> resolution

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
720p so it's still the same resolution

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.930 
720p so it's still the same resolution
it's<00:02:34.170> just<00:02:34.470> bigger<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.250> again<00:02:35.520> Motorola

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
it's just bigger so again Motorola

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.460 
it's just bigger so again Motorola
decided<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:36.660> everyone<00:02:36.990> wants<00:02:37.260> bigger

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
decided that everyone wants bigger

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.380 
decided that everyone wants bigger
phones<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.130> they're<00:02:38.580> probably<00:02:38.820> right<00:02:39.180> with

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
phones and they're probably right with

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.300 
phones and they're probably right with
that<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:40.020> 11<00:02:40.410> millimeters<00:02:40.830> thick

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
that it is 11 millimeters thick

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.830 
that it is 11 millimeters thick
the<00:02:41.490> original<00:02:41.880> was<00:02:42.060> eleven<00:02:42.420> point<00:02:42.600> five

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
the original was eleven point five

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.210 
the original was eleven point five
millimeter<00:02:43.440> stick<00:02:43.710> so<00:02:43.830> it's<00:02:43.950> actually<00:02:44.160> a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
millimeter stick so it's actually a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.240 
millimeter stick so it's actually a
little<00:02:44.640> bit<00:02:44.760> thinner<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:46.230> have<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> same<00:02:47.040> I

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
little bit thinner you have a same I

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
little bit thinner you have a same I
believe<00:02:47.460> it's<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.640> same<00:02:47.670> Qualcomm

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270

cards<00:03:04.470> they<00:03:04.920> upgraded<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.430> camera<00:03:05.820> so<00:03:06.030> you

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
cards they upgraded the camera so you

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.700 
cards they upgraded the camera so you
got<00:03:06.240> an<00:03:06.330> 8<00:03:06.510> megapixel<00:03:06.810> camera<00:03:07.110> in<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.560> back

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
got an 8 megapixel camera in the back

got an 8 megapixel camera in the back
now<00:03:07.950> used<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.400> just<00:03:08.580> have<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.730> 5<00:03:09.000> megapixel<00:03:09.360> give

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
now used to just have a 5 megapixel give

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.380 
now used to just have a 5 megapixel give
me<00:03:10.140> 2<00:03:10.410> megapixel<00:03:10.950> camera<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.760> front<00:03:12.150> and
