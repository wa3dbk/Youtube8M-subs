what's<00:00:20.850> interesting<00:00:20.970> about<00:00:21.330> kinect<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.869> is

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
what's interesting about kinect is is

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.439 
what's interesting about kinect is is
that<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.350> runs<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.769> three<00:00:23.070> cameras<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:24.300> one

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
that it runs on three cameras but one

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.880 
that it runs on three cameras but one
camera<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.810> an<00:00:24.900> infrared<00:00:25.140> camera<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.800> it

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
camera is an infrared camera that it

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.470 
camera is an infrared camera that it
throws<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.369> net<00:00:26.640> over<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.060> chick<00:00:27.300> at

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
throws a net over you to chick at

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.480 
throws a net over you to chick at
checkout<00:00:27.779> depth<00:00:28.080> then<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.859> has<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> regular

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
checkout depth then it has a regular

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.279 
checkout depth then it has a regular
picture<00:00:29.820> camera<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.330> take<00:00:30.480> still<00:00:30.750> images<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
picture camera to take still images and

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.630 
picture camera to take still images and
then<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.500> has<00:00:31.650> another<00:00:32.399> camera<00:00:32.969> too<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.570> guess

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
then it has another camera too I guess

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.250 
then it has another camera too I guess
work<00:00:35.640> out<00:00:35.790> shapes<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.719> movement<00:00:37.170> than

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
work out shapes and movement than

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.560 
work out shapes and movement than
whatnot<00:00:37.590> motion<00:00:37.950> camera<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.430> guess<00:00:38.969> if<00:00:39.480> you

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
whatnot motion camera I guess if you

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.549 
whatnot motion camera I guess if you
have<00:00:39.660> those<00:00:39.780> three<00:00:39.989> cameras<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.469> together

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
have those three cameras and together

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.350 
have those three cameras and together
they<00:00:40.829> create<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> image<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> what<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
they create the image of the what the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.450 
they create the image of the what the
connection<00:00:42.660> picks<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.320> now<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.280> first

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
connection picks up now is the first

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
connection picks up now is the first
thing<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.730> take<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> look<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> court

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
thing we can take a look at is the court

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.400 
thing we can take a look at is the court
now<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> big<00:00:45.899> complaint<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.469> course<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:48.410> PS

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
now a big complaint of course of the PS

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.639 
now a big complaint of course of the PS
move<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.100> cord<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.809> what's<00:00:52.350> great<00:00:52.620> about

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
move is the cord so what's great about

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.189 
move is the cord so what's great about
the<00:00:52.920> Kinect<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> cord<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.420> probably

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the Kinect is is the cord is probably

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.069 
the Kinect is is the cord is probably
the<00:00:55.440> longest<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:56.629> probably<00:00:57.629> eat<00:00:57.750> along<00:00:57.930> with

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the longest one probably eat along with

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.740 
the longest one probably eat along with
a<00:00:58.170> Nintendo<00:00:58.500> Wii<00:00:58.649> censored<00:00:59.100> cord<00:00:59.420> so<00:01:00.420> i<00:01:00.449> mean

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
a Nintendo Wii censored cord so i mean

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.360 
a Nintendo Wii censored cord so i mean
the<00:01:00.809> PS<00:01:01.020> move<00:01:01.050> cord<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.710> very<00:01:01.920> very<00:01:02.070> short<00:01:02.280> you

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the PS move cord is very very short you

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.260 
the PS move cord is very very short you
have<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> make<00:01:02.670> sure<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:02.879> right<00:01:03.000> next<00:01:03.149> to

to the reg our dashboard the day with my
hands<00:03:33.579> so<00:03:34.060> really<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.540> camera<00:03:35.170> even<00:03:35.500> in<00:03:35.590> this

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
hands so really the camera even in this

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.440 
hands so really the camera even in this
Titan<00:03:36.340> spot<00:03:36.700> that<00:03:36.910> we're<00:03:37.060> in<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:37.390> the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
Titan spot that we're in and the

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.420 
Titan spot that we're in and the
underwater<00:03:37.750> base<00:03:37.959> really<00:03:38.920> does<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.130> fantastic

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
underwater base really does a fantastic

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.780 
underwater base really does a fantastic
job<00:03:40.799> now<00:03:41.799> of<00:03:41.890> course<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.280> big<00:03:42.400> thing<00:03:42.579> is<00:03:42.609> is

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
job now of course the big thing is is

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.430 
job now of course the big thing is is
that<00:03:42.880> so<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.239> hardware<00:03:43.720> works<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.170> connect

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
that so the hardware works the connect

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.000 
that so the hardware works the connect
itself<00:03:44.769> is<00:03:45.269> by<00:03:46.269> far<00:03:46.570> and<00:03:46.720> away<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:46.930> think<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
itself is by far and away I think the

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.720 
itself is by far and away I think the
best<00:03:48.900> motion<00:03:49.900> sensor<00:03:50.470> out<00:03:50.620> there<00:03:50.890> but<00:03:51.609> the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
best motion sensor out there but the

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.370 
best motion sensor out there but the
question<00:03:51.850> is<00:03:52.120> going<00:03:52.269> to<00:03:52.359> be<00:03:52.420> can't<00:03:52.959> get<00:03:53.230> the

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
question is going to be can't get the

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.520 
question is going to be can't get the
soft<00:03:53.620> software<00:03:54.579> to<00:03:55.120> support<00:03:55.569> it<00:03:55.720> look<00:03:56.410> when

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
soft software to support it look when

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.870 
soft software to support it look when
you<00:03:56.620> got<00:03:56.739> break<00:03:56.920> voice<00:03:57.130> commands<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:57.700> you<00:03:57.760> get

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
you got break voice commands and you get

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.210 
you got break voice commands and you get
pics<00:03:58.299> up<00:03:58.390> you're<00:03:58.569> smashing<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.859> what<00:04:00.010> else<00:04:00.160> do

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220
