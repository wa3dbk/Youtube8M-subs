most<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.710> these<00:01:25.830> colors<00:01:26.159> will<00:01:26.189> look<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:26.729> on

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
most of these colors will look like on

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.050 
most of these colors will look like on
your<00:01:27.450> Galaxy<00:01:28.320> s3<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> general

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
your Galaxy s3 so you can get a general

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.429 
your Galaxy s3 so you can get a general
idea<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:31.250> what<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.400> would<00:01:32.460> look<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.259> this

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
idea of what it would look like so this

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.450 
idea of what it would look like so this
is<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.890> white<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.110> white

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
is the white one so if you have a white

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.380 
is the white one so if you have a white
s3<00:01:38.460> matches<00:01:39.090> pretty<00:01:39.270> well<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:42.000> I'm<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.240> going

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
s3 matches pretty well so I'm just going

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.950 
s3 matches pretty well so I'm just going
to<00:01:42.450> take<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:42.990> off<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:45.210> there's<00:01:45.899> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
to take this one off and there's a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.740 
to take this one off and there's a
little<00:01:46.579> notch<00:01:47.579> right<00:01:47.610> here<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.360> could<00:01:48.509> pry

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
little notch right here so you could pry

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.480 
little notch right here so you could pry
it<00:01:48.810> off<00:01:49.220> so<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.520> pry<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:50.909> one<00:01:51.240> off<00:01:52.490> all

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
it off so just pry this one off all

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.080 
it off so just pry this one off all
right<00:01:53.700> off<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.750> side<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.640> this<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:57.060> of

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
right off to the side and this is one of
