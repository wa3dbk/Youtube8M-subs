has<00:01:52.570> little<00:01:52.900> to<00:01:53.020> none<00:01:53.230> gameplay<00:01:53.880> players

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
has little to none gameplay players

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.730 
has little to none gameplay players
required<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.630> make<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:55.810> choice<00:01:56.080> from<00:01:56.320> time<00:01:56.560> to

time in order to progress the story

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.250 
time in order to progress the story
these<00:01:59.920> instances<00:02:00.550> are<00:02:00.970> little<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.510> far<00:02:01.810> apart

these instances are little and far apart

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.590 
these instances are little and far apart
so<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.010> player<00:02:03.250> will<00:02:03.460> spend<00:02:03.730> about<00:02:04.090> ninety

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
so the player will spend about ninety

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.390 
so the player will spend about ninety
percent<00:02:04.720> of<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.080> time<00:02:05.230> simply<00:02:05.650> reading<00:02:06.010> much

text can be set to also advance so the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.720 
text can be set to also advance so the
