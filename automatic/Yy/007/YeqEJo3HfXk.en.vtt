00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.190 

so<00:00:05.580> in<00:00:05.700> these<00:00:05.819> next<00:00:05.879> few<00:00:06.299> tutorials<00:00:06.420> I'm<00:00:07.020> going

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
so in these next few tutorials I'm going

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.750 
so in these next few tutorials I'm going
to<00:00:07.259> go<00:00:07.350> through<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.710> new<00:00:07.830> sculpting<00:00:08.370> tools<00:00:08.610> in

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
to go through the new sculpting tools in

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.230 
to go through the new sculpting tools in
cinema<00:00:09.090> 4d<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:10.340> this<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.490> an<00:00:11.610> image<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:12.000> found

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
cinema 4d and this is an image I found

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.990 
cinema 4d and this is an image I found
on<00:00:12.480> Google<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:13.070> I<00:00:14.070> think<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.759> would<00:00:14.880> make

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
on Google and I think it would make

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.790 
on Google and I think it would make
quite<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.299> good<00:00:15.420> starting<00:00:15.780> point<00:00:15.990> because<00:00:16.440> it's

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
quite a good starting point because it's

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.700 
quite a good starting point because it's
quite<00:00:17.100> simple<00:00:17.490> 3d<00:00:18.029> model<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.480> build<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
quite simple 3d model to build so the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.140 
quite simple 3d model to build so the
first<00:00:19.949> thing<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.220> do<00:00:20.369> before<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.760> start<00:00:21.000> any

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
first thing you do before you start any

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.420 
first thing you do before you start any
kind<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.390> sculpting<00:00:21.869> would<00:00:22.020> be<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.410> build<00:00:23.279> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
kind of sculpting would be to build a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.210 
kind of sculpting would be to build a
base<00:00:23.609> mesh<00:00:23.939> for<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.359> 3d<00:00:24.689> model<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:26.039> base

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
base mesh for this 3d model and the base

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.220 
base mesh for this 3d model and the base
mesh<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.609> basically<00:00:26.939> like<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> very<00:00:27.599> rough<00:00:27.930> cage

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
mesh is basically like a very rough cage

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.220 
mesh is basically like a very rough cage
of<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.710> 3d<00:00:29.070> model<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.779> it<00:00:30.779> really<00:00:31.019> doesn't

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
of this 3d model and it really doesn't

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.200 
of this 3d model and it really doesn't
have<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.439> be<00:00:31.590> very<00:00:31.769> detailed<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.520> sometimes

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
have to be very detailed and sometimes

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.170 
have to be very detailed and sometimes
it<00:00:33.329> doesn't<00:00:33.570> even<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.960> resemble<00:00:35.180> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
it doesn't even have to resemble the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.959 
it doesn't even have to resemble the
final<00:00:36.540> product<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.250> basically<00:00:38.430> has<00:00:38.790> to

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
final product it just basically has to

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.840 
final product it just basically has to
have<00:00:39.180> clean<00:00:39.809> flowing<00:00:40.230> topology<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.040> I'm

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
have clean flowing topology and I'm

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.830 
have clean flowing topology and I'm
going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.030> show<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.450> mean<00:00:42.660> by

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
going to show you what I mean by

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.180 
going to show you what I mean by
topology<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:45.200> here's<00:00:46.200> an<00:00:46.379> image<00:00:46.500> some

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
topology so here's an image some

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.950 
topology so here's an image some
examples<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.940> good<00:00:48.120> topology<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.809> bad

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
examples of good topology and bad

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.740 
examples of good topology and bad
topology<00:00:49.670> if<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.850> look<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.210> head<00:00:51.420> here

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
topology if you look at this head here

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.470 
topology if you look at this head here
this<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.890> an<00:00:52.980> example<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.520> very<00:00:53.670> good<00:00:53.969> topology

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
this is an example of very good topology

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.740 
this is an example of very good topology
because<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:56.309> polygons<00:00:56.820> are<00:00:57.030> mostly<00:00:57.360> quads

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
because the polygons are mostly quads

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.160 
because the polygons are mostly quads
and<00:00:58.520> they're<00:00:59.520> kind<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.789> everything's<00:01:00.780> flowing

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
and they're kind of everything's flowing

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.049 
and they're kind of everything's flowing
around<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.890> face<00:01:02.129> as<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:02.820> kind<00:01:02.969> of

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
around the face as if it's kind of

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.119 
around the face as if it's kind of
following<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.629> face<00:01:04.229> muscle<00:01:04.680> structure

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
following the face muscle structure

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.550 
following the face muscle structure
around<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.939> eyes<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.600> around<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.020> mouth<00:01:07.260> it

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
around the eyes and around the mouth it

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.649 
around the eyes and around the mouth it
just<00:01:07.770> looks<00:01:07.950> accurate<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:09.119> all<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.450> lines

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
just looks accurate and all the lines

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.410 
just looks accurate and all the lines
are<00:01:09.869> flowing<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.610> we<00:01:11.610> haven't<00:01:11.850> got<00:01:11.970> any<00:01:12.180> kind

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
are flowing and we haven't got any kind

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.899 
are flowing and we haven't got any kind
of<00:01:12.510> triangles<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.470> angles<00:01:13.979> although<00:01:14.369> it's

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
of triangles or angles although it's

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.880 
of triangles or angles although it's
okay<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.330> use<00:01:15.450> triangles<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.170> angles<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.710> some

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
okay to use triangles and angles in some

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.730 
okay to use triangles and angles in some
cases<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.420> general<00:01:18.750> rule<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.259> thumb<00:01:19.320> is

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
cases but as a general rule of thumb is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.340 
cases but as a general rule of thumb is
good<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.159> stick<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.549> quads<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> quad<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
good to stick with quads and the quad is

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.560 
good to stick with quads and the quad is
basically<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.830> four-sided<00:01:23.520> polygon<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.360> this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
basically a four-sided polygon like this

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.469 
basically a four-sided polygon like this
one<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:26.460> looking<00:01:26.759> over<00:01:27.000> here<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.360> an

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
one here and looking over here is an

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.690 
one here and looking over here is an
example<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.020> very<00:01:28.049> bad<00:01:28.470> apology<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.549> can

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
example of very bad apology as you can

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.910 
example of very bad apology as you can
see<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.840> look<00:01:30.990> around<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.290> mouth<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.770> can

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
see if we look around the mouth we can

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.499 
see if we look around the mouth we can
see<00:01:32.070> there's<00:01:32.280> absolutely<00:01:32.759> no<00:01:33.150> flow

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
see there's absolutely no flow

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.899 
see there's absolutely no flow
everything<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.650> straight<00:01:35.369> down<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
everything is just straight down and

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.760 
everything is just straight down and
along<00:01:36.229> we've<00:01:37.229> got<00:01:37.259> some<00:01:37.560> kind<00:01:37.710> of

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
along we've got some kind of

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.679 
along we've got some kind of
triangulation<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.270> few

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
triangulation going on here a few

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.679 
triangulation going on here a few
triangles<00:01:40.259> there<00:01:40.729> triangles<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.299> it's

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
triangles there triangles here and it's

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.830 
triangles there triangles here and it's
just<00:01:42.750> generally<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.610> very<00:01:44.610> bad<00:01:45.240> example<00:01:45.420> of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
just generally a very bad example of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080 
just generally a very bad example of
building<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.259> 3d<00:01:46.290> model<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.820> I'm<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.000> gonna

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
building a 3d model so I'm just gonna

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.359 
building a 3d model so I'm just gonna
put<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.630> side<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.799> bring<00:01:49.979> back<00:01:50.189> my

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
put this to the side and bring back my

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.120 
put this to the side and bring back my
image<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.380> was<00:01:52.470> gonna<00:01:52.560> create<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.950> base

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
image so if I was gonna create a base

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.789 
image so if I was gonna create a base
mesh<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.670> model<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.470> probably<00:01:55.470> create<00:01:55.770> an

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
mesh for this model I probably create an

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.399 
mesh for this model I probably create an
indent<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.490> mouth<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.079> I<00:01:58.079> definitely

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
indent for the mouth and I definitely

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.010 
indent for the mouth and I definitely
create<00:01:58.920> an<00:01:59.070> extrusion<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.909> the<00:01:59.969> ears<00:02:00.240> that's

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
create an extrusion for the ears that's

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.160 
create an extrusion for the ears that's
because<00:02:02.450> when<00:02:03.450> you're<00:02:03.600> sculpting<00:02:03.869> you're

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
because when you're sculpting you're

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.690 
because when you're sculpting you're
basically<00:02:04.530> carrying<00:02:04.890> out<00:02:05.040> displacement

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
basically carrying out displacement

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.910 
basically carrying out displacement
mapping<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.689> extrude<00:02:07.439> something<00:02:07.799> out

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
mapping if you extrude something out

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.990 
mapping if you extrude something out
like<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.429> ear<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:09.660> can't<00:02:09.899> then<00:02:10.080> extrude

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
like that ear you can't then extrude

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.430 
like that ear you can't then extrude
sideways<00:02:12.000> as<00:02:12.209> well<00:02:12.239> so

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
sideways as well so

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.460 
sideways as well so
say<00:02:13.620> if<00:02:13.770> we<00:02:13.950> were<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.220> create<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.520> horn<00:02:14.880> here

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
say if we were to create a horn here

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.990 
say if we were to create a horn here
using<00:02:16.470> displacement<00:02:16.650> mapping<00:02:17.160> we<00:02:17.700> couldn't

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
using displacement mapping we couldn't

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.360 
using displacement mapping we couldn't
then<00:02:18.150> start<00:02:18.510> pulling<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.440> out<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.890> way<00:02:20.100> and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
then start pulling it out this way and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.540 
then start pulling it out this way and
if<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:20.640> did<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.240> would<00:02:21.390> basically<00:02:21.540> rise<00:02:22.020> up

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
if we did it would basically rise up

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.820 
if we did it would basically rise up
from<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.730> base<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.270> you'll<00:02:25.170> probably<00:02:25.350> grasp

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
from the base and you'll probably grasp

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.470 
from the base and you'll probably grasp
what<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.100> mean<00:02:26.340> as<00:02:26.490> we<00:02:26.880> kind<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.090> go<00:02:27.240> for<00:02:27.420> this

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
what I mean as we kind of go for this

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.510 
what I mean as we kind of go for this
tutorial<00:02:27.800> but<00:02:28.800> for<00:02:29.040> now<00:02:29.130> I'm<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.430> gonna

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
tutorial but for now I'm just gonna

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.660 
tutorial but for now I'm just gonna
build<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.940> very<00:02:30.180> quick<00:02:30.420> base<00:02:30.630> mesh<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.860> explain

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
build a very quick base mesh to explain

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.160 
build a very quick base mesh to explain
better<00:02:32.820> what<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.210> mean

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.300 

so<00:02:37.170> I'm<00:02:37.230> just<00:02:37.350> going<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.560> start<00:02:37.800> with<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> cube

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
so I'm just going to start with a cube

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.840 
so I'm just going to start with a cube
and<00:02:39.110> I'm<00:02:40.110> gonna<00:02:40.230> make<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.470> editable<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.220> I'm

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
and I'm gonna make it editable and I'm

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.980 
and I'm gonna make it editable and I'm
probably<00:02:42.060> going<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.390> play<00:02:42.480> back<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.870> video

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
probably going to play back the video

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.470 
probably going to play back the video
quite<00:02:43.320> fast<00:02:43.620> because<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.490> isn't<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:45.000> polygon

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
quite fast because this isn't a polygon

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.180 
quite fast because this isn't a polygon
modeling<00:02:45.840> tutorial<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:46.620> want<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.010> get<00:02:47.070> to

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
modeling tutorial I just want to get to

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:55.510 
modeling tutorial I just want to get to
the<00:02:47.280> sculpting<00:02:47.700> parts<00:02:48.000> pretty<00:02:48.180> quickly

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.340 

and<00:02:56.090> I'm<00:02:56.390> just<00:02:56.540> gonna<00:02:56.630> stop<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.050> video<00:02:57.290> here

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
and I'm just gonna stop the video here

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.500 
and I'm just gonna stop the video here
so<00:02:58.280> basically<00:02:58.400> when<00:02:58.760> you're<00:02:58.880> creating<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.330> base

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
so basically when you're creating a base

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.400 
so basically when you're creating a base
mesh<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.020> best<00:03:00.260> tools<00:03:00.590> are<00:03:02.230> extrude<00:03:03.230> an

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
mesh the best tools are extrude an

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.650 
mesh the best tools are extrude an
extrude<00:03:03.950> inner<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:04.760> for<00:03:04.970> creating<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.480> mouth

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
extrude inner so for creating the mouth

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.900 
extrude inner so for creating the mouth
I'm<00:03:06.560> just<00:03:06.710> gonna<00:03:06.830> select<00:03:06.950> this<00:03:07.190> polygon<00:03:07.700> and

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
I'm just gonna select this polygon and

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.400 
I'm just gonna select this polygon and
I'm<00:03:08.240> just<00:03:08.360> going<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.570> extrude<00:03:08.900> inner<00:03:09.140> like

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
I'm just going to extrude inner like

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.950 
I'm just going to extrude inner like
that<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.520> then<00:03:10.670> go<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.970> extrude<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.690> just

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
that and then go to extrude and just

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.470 
that and then go to extrude and just
push<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.200> back<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:13.640> that's<00:03:13.730> basically<00:03:14.150> all

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
push it back and that's basically all

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.450 
push it back and that's basically all
the<00:03:14.750> topology<00:03:15.080> we<00:03:15.470> need<00:03:15.650> for<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:15.920> mouth<00:03:16.130> and

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
the topology we need for the mouth and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.700 
the topology we need for the mouth and
then<00:03:16.910> for<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.180> ear<00:03:17.390> I'm<00:03:18.110> gonna<00:03:18.320> use<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.680> same

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
then for the ear I'm gonna use the same

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.030 
then for the ear I'm gonna use the same
extrude<00:03:19.550> inner<00:03:19.760> like<00:03:20.570> that<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.110> then<00:03:21.770> I'm

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
extrude inner like that and then I'm

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.850 
extrude inner like that and then I'm
gonna<00:03:22.160> extrude<00:03:22.730> out<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:24.500> ear<00:03:24.770> whoops

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
gonna extrude out the ear whoops

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.270 
gonna extrude out the ear whoops
like<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:29.770> you<00:03:30.770> could<00:03:30.920> probably<00:03:31.040> even

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
like that and you could probably even

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.340 
like that and you could probably even
get<00:03:31.550> away<00:03:31.700> with<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.180> but<00:03:32.570> I'm<00:03:32.960> just<00:03:33.080> going<00:03:33.320> to

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
get away with that but I'm just going to

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:41.630 
get away with that but I'm just going to
keep<00:03:33.500> refining<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:34.010> model

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.850 

and<00:03:41.780> I'm<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:42.840> gonna<00:03:42.990> stop<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.350> video<00:03:43.470> there

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
and I'm just gonna stop the video there

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.100 
and I'm just gonna stop the video there
something<00:03:44.819> like<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.420> basically<00:03:45.540> all<00:03:45.900> we

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
something like this is basically all we

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.360 
something like this is basically all we
need<00:03:48.590> as<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.680> can<00:03:49.800> see<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.040> doesn't<00:03:50.160> look<00:03:50.280> like

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
need as you can see it doesn't look like

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.850 
need as you can see it doesn't look like
our<00:03:50.640> reference<00:03:51.060> image<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.540> much<00:03:51.780> but<00:03:52.110> it's

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
our reference image that much but it's

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.100 
our reference image that much but it's
got<00:03:53.010> everything<00:03:53.340> we<00:03:53.640> need<00:03:53.880> basically<00:03:54.420> the

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
got everything we need basically the

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.020 
got everything we need basically the
topology<00:03:55.410> is<00:03:55.740> clean<00:03:56.100> it's<00:03:56.520> kind<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.819> flowing

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
topology is clean it's kind of flowing

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.290 
topology is clean it's kind of flowing
nicely<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:59.190> magic<00:03:59.550> basically<00:03:59.910> happens

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
nicely and the magic basically happens

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.050 
nicely and the magic basically happens
in<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.540> sculpting<00:04:00.959> stage<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.940> we'll<00:04:02.940> go

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
in the sculpting stage and we'll go

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.230 
in the sculpting stage and we'll go
through<00:04:03.270> that<00:04:03.300> in<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.570> next<00:04:03.780> tutorial
