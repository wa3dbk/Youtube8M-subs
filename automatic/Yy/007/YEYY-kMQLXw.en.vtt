00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.300
 good morning my friends 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.139
 we are on my can say apiary 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.030
 all the same 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.460
 5 hives is already some kind of apiary but 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.980
 there will be more 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.910
 here's the kill and finnish you saw it from 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.619
 past videos 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.960
 today we will talk about 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.039
 dividing grids on the past kind and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.040
 rollers apiary number four you saw how 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.130
 we placed in the shop stores 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.040
 set the framework for comments 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.469
 wrote what are you doing in your own 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.969
 you need to become a dividing grid to 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.520
 the womb did not go up 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.590
 there is no ink and everything else but guys 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.600
 Well, of course I know about this academician 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.070
 skyskiy wardrobe i studied capitally cool and 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.660
 not at once looked through all the lectures 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.629
 By the way, I recommend typing in 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.850
 the internet lecture academy poop soon 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.280
 everyone will watch old ones 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.690
 beekeepers 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.129
 Well, of course, beekeepers will only become 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.430
 twenty years from now also gaggia 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.700
 I'm starting now 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.409
 talk about separating grids for 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.659
 what it serves the grill serves for 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.479
 so the womb does not pass the top 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.170
 shop if she will pass the top shop 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.780
 it matches will start the worm and this 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.610
 honey will not be suitable but not that honey 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.970
 these semi frames will not be suitable for 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.890
 sales why am i doing install 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.810
 im lattices because i collect honey 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.090
 only sell in the floor 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.680
 the framework only knows how to be in comb 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.030
 Why do I do this in principle ? 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.790
 like everything else as you saw me 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.180
 started everything from scratch didn't take it from anyone 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.100
 honeycombs Dry fitted by the so-called not 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.119
 took no honey, no one is nothing that is all 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.299
 from scratch with your own hands 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.540
 With regards to honey comb explained 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.460
 cause honey comb 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.520
 diseases of honey simple a thousand times honey 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.710
 when downloaded 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.660
 jars of u poured all honey begins 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.860
 lose their properties honey comb can 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.209
 stored for thousands of years 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.720
 found in the pyramid 100 opened checked 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.400
 the perfect state of honey spent it all 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.910
 the most porridge is called spectral 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.620
 analysis for the term how many substances are already well 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.390
 there still chose the framework there all 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.629
 the country was ruled for as long as 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.180
 in the summer it turned out more than 10,000 years 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:39.260
 such information on the Internet was in 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.069
 but back to this separation 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:49.310
 Lattice lattice ordering in the same place 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:51.829
 Finland they go under the same u here 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.530
 so here they look here they are beautiful 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.700
 all the grids are written here too 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.970
 as it should be paradise x he is not 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.489
 swarm of bees 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.459
 Here are the grids by box not installed 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.090
 very easy to shop 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.730
 are put 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.319
 like this 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.790
 just show put this way 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:17.389
 here and there is such an interesting one 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.819
 trick as it is called so that the Torelli 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.799
 people are not letka can't tell you here 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.850
 now show you with an example of how it is 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.510
 it's all worth it 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.730
 time 5 am bees are not particularly active 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.519
 by the way I approached started began a little bit 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.700
 I will not fool you 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.599
 don't worry for two weeks not touch you 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.940
 I'll be at all here it is worth this lattice 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:46.340
 Is it not a grid of points? 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:48.829
 way inserted here here here to 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.470
 there was direct access immediately to the store 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.019
 here it is, it turns out there opens 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.470
 points I will not open because there 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.840
 but now it's cold outside 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.109
 there's the temperature of the cold bangs 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.310
 again he will be pumped up 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:09.790
 such things here what else to say about this 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:13.220
 dividing lattices good 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.979
 quality plastic on the lattice will be 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.250
 serve long faithfully but if 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.079
 neatly do everything as if 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.260
 the rest if the lack of this lattice 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:27.300
 when assembling she was leaving here these 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.320
 the tricks here are these here and here they are 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.350
 just went around 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.840
 and that is, the lattice itself fell out 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.530
 so I thought I thought 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.810
 when assembling was going to winter like 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.910
 make them go their way 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.760
 Now I will move this grid and 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.130
 everyone is the simplest elementary 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:56.190
 the way I came here, look 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:58.260
 you can see yes slap and here the same thing 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.850
 there is a stapler muted here here there is 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.560
 holes until these ones here 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.130
 established what planochki 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.230
 on stack with copier muffled screwdriver 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.169
 bent on the other side and everything 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:14.460
 she now keeps dead nowhere is she 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:17.790
 will come off and everything will be clear and beautiful well 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:21.150
 like that basically this whole thing is done 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:24.360
 and is set for now 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.210
 one wiki we have a bee shop 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.729
 actively began there to pull yours well this 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.280
 as if happy starts quietly 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.740
 bribes but he knows everything better 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.930
 the temperature from was the day before yesterday big 30 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.270
 degrees 2931 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.760
 at this temperature, you all know what 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.240
 nectar does not stand out and who is sitting on the middle 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:49.550
 Anticipating Medoc who have prepared 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:52.050
 before well as if in principle like this 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:56.490
 nothing more to say next our 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:58.209
 the video will probably be dedicated already 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.519
 first 

00:05:58.209 --> 00:06:02.989
 honey will look what happened 

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:05.379
 will continue to stand still throw 

00:06:02.989 --> 00:06:09.069
 we will do the inspection soon 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:12.439
 mattcom wings will be trimmed 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:14.029
 why because so that the wing in the uterus does not 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:16.609
 flew one wing to check on 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:17.209
 half this here, too, as if from 

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:21.219
 training 

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:24.559
 academy of turd sun who and many others 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:27.559
 experienced beekeepers but we will look 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:30.199
 we will develop as if in principle everything 

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:33.039
 subscribe to the world channel you you good 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.039
 goodbye 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.500
 but
