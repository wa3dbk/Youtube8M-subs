00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
right down here so okay next I'm going

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.390 
right down here so okay next I'm going
to<00:02:24.720> take<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.140> studio<00:02:25.410> finish<00:02:25.650> concealer<00:02:25.709> like

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
to take the studio finish concealer like

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.920 
to take the studio finish concealer like
so<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:29.000> what<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.030> wants<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.270> do<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.510> kind<00:02:30.870> of

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
so and what I wants to do this kind of

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.860 
so and what I wants to do this kind of
warm<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.230> up<00:02:31.320> so<00:02:31.910> by<00:02:32.910> warming<00:02:33.270> it's<00:02:33.450> hot<00:02:33.690> in

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
warm it up so by warming it's hot in

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.090 
warm it up so by warming it's hot in
here<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:34.350> probably<00:02:34.650> doesn't<00:02:34.860> do<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> lot

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
here so it's probably doesn't do a lot

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.340 
here so it's probably doesn't do a lot
of<00:02:35.130> warming<00:02:35.580> but<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.270> would<00:02:36.480> take<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:37.080> brush

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
of warming but I would take the brush

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.710 
of warming but I would take the brush
and<00:02:38.160> swirl<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.489> around<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.940> bit<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.360> get<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.540> good

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
and swirl it around a bit to get a good

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.330 
and swirl it around a bit to get a good
amount<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.140> there<00:02:41.030> like<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:43.100> if<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.190> can

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
amount on there like that and if you can

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.540 
amount on there like that and if you can
see<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.700> amount<00:02:44.910> that's<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.239> there<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:46.459> will<00:02:47.459> go

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
see the amount that's on there I will go

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.100 
see the amount that's on there I will go
ahead<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:48.709> begin<00:02:49.709> buffing<00:02:50.310> by<00:02:50.790> doing<00:02:51.780> tight

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
ahead and begin buffing by doing tight

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.460 
ahead and begin buffing by doing tight
circular<00:02:52.830> motions<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.080> is<00:02:58.200> going<00:02:58.380> to

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
circular motions and this is going to

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.850 
circular motions and this is going to
give<00:02:58.560> us<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.830> flawless<00:02:59.310> coverage<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.860> by

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
give us that flawless coverage and by

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.800 
give us that flawless coverage and by
buffing<00:03:02.340> it's<00:03:02.519> not<00:03:02.670> cakey<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.360> that's<00:03:03.540> what<00:03:03.780> I

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
buffing it's not cakey and that's what I

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.300 
buffing it's not cakey and that's what I
think<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.200> lot<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.380> people<00:03:04.650> have<00:03:04.769> trouble<00:03:05.130> with

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
think a lot of people have trouble with

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.620 
think a lot of people have trouble with
making<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.480> not<00:03:06.630> like<00:03:06.780> cakey<00:03:07.880> but<00:03:08.880> just<00:03:09.300> blend

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
making it not like cakey but just blend

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.710 
making it not like cakey but just blend

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
like this but buffing makes a big

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.949 
like this but buffing makes a big
difference<00:04:05.230> because<00:04:05.350> it<00:04:06.030> covers<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.360> it

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
difference because it covers and it

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.820 
difference because it covers and it
really<00:04:08.590> really<00:04:08.830> um<00:04:09.190> thins<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.150> out<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.650> it's

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
really really um thins it out so it's

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.340 
really really um thins it out so it's
good<00:04:12.010> stuff<00:04:15.570> can<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:16.600> see<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.870> difference<00:04:17.200> in

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
good stuff can you see the difference in

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.909 
good stuff can you see the difference in
it<00:04:17.769> from<00:04:18.160> here<00:04:18.579> when<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:19.389> back<00:04:19.660> away<00:04:19.690> you<00:04:20.650> see<00:04:20.859> it

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
it from here when I back away you see it

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.159 
it from here when I back away you see it
doesn't<00:04:21.160> look<00:04:21.280> like<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.609> so<00:04:22.889> extra<00:04:24.990> so<00:04:25.990> that's

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
doesn't look like it so extra so that's

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.000 
doesn't look like it so extra so that's
good<00:04:26.410> stuff<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:28.720> that's<00:04:28.930> how<00:04:29.050> I<00:04:29.080> do<00:04:29.229> it<00:04:29.350> and<00:04:29.620> it

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
good stuff and that's how I do it and it

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.700 
good stuff and that's how I do it and it
a<00:04:30.250> small<00:04:30.700> brush<00:04:31.090> like<00:04:31.630> this<00:04:31.780> small<00:04:32.289> and<00:04:32.500> dense

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
a small brush like this small and dense

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.210 
a small brush like this small and dense
and<00:04:34.140> if<00:04:35.140> you<00:04:35.289> can<00:04:35.410> see<00:04:35.590> like<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:35.770> period<00:04:36.039> in<00:04:36.160> my

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
and if you can see like a period in my

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.930 
and if you can see like a period in my
hand<00:04:36.400> is<00:04:36.520> tiny

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
hand is tiny

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.550 
hand is tiny
and<00:04:37.090> it<00:04:37.600> really<00:04:37.780> just<00:04:37.900> gets<00:04:38.260> into<00:04:38.410> those

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
and it really just gets into those

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.020 
and it really just gets into those
little<00:04:38.710> spaces<00:04:39.039> so<00:04:39.370> I've<00:04:39.490> always<00:04:39.789> used<00:04:39.910> that

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
little spaces so I've always used that

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.590 
little spaces so I've always used that
