00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.470
 we are in the news we are 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.840
 understand how the last time is of 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.170
 I bring quite succulent news that 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.240
 some will like my wish quite 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.010
 we can meet ceo in gamescom no 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.230
 we care the truth to me no no is that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.880
 I care to know the person who took out 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.890
 the br but let's go what matters we're going to 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.610
 the news I'm bowling vi show 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.260
 d'alger from 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.470
 there is a news here I am going to translate 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.990
 a little bit above says since 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.850
 We started doing pocketing and 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.970
 develop it we have added content 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.860
 different in the game varied so that what 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.079
 we can play there we have planes 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.289
 locations and we add 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.800
 the Russian and German ground forces 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.989
 finally after we introduce the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.049
 American vehicles and says of course 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.089
 we were not going to stop there so we can 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.189
 we are proud to present the 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.229
 technological genealogical tree whatever 

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:03.390
 of the British 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:07.770
 this means that they will add the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.759
 British tanks soon I'm not going to 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.159
 say anything is a tm is a tm in the game 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:18.299
 with this I mean they are not going to be 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.740
 are going to go the British tanks me 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.630
 would like to know what plans they have for 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.280
 the Japanese but good are going to go 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.780
 British tanks here we have there is a 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.659
 brief description of about three that we 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.880
 they are going to put here the first one is the comet 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.950
 the supposedly committed with here not 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.959
 the description is a bit the weight 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.720
 the millimeters it has cannon and such 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.670
 well he tells us that he's going to be tier 34 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.600
 so well here we have a small 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.610
 Photo of the pretty cool comet is not very 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.409
 great in fact it seems to me to see 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.360
 let's see it from behind until here of 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.510
 done here you have a comparison of 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.760
 this down here you have 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.840
 a person tank so for that reason 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.150
 say it so you can make an idea will be 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.760
 it's medium is it reminds me one of 24 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.520
 chafí so to speak is like a 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.810
 chat and in fact here it puts in good 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.880
 we have here a tank is 33 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.770
 tons so neither is it very 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.870
 Small is in fact a medium but you can see him 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.190
 quite small for what is of all 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.530
 ways I think I would be between a cafe 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.690
 and a panzer 4 a thing like that afterwards 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.540
 we have the churchill the churchill was 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.040
 Of course I was going to fall this to me 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.160
 I like chill chat a lot but it's good 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.420
 a classic vehicle of the British 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.450
 this is bigger 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.390
 this would be comparable roughly with a 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.970
 kv size in increase but if saying it is 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.840
 quite long not high but long and that 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.330
 that is quite long 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.480
 in fact he puts here that he has 57 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.209
 millimeters 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.220
 does not say that you have the sea 3 does not put 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.879
 what you will get it is not decided 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.159
 but well anyway we have the part 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.629
 seen from behind in fact this one has the 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.840
 hatch for these but those that 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.580
 they drive they go here or they go through 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.310
 of the chains which is a point 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.549
 strange in a design of a tank that 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.110
 to enter the aforementioned tank have 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.930
 to enter through the doors by lan by 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.909
 by the possible chains and because of that 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.069
 the chain had to be longer 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:16.040
 Then the production expenses were 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.930
 In the end, there was a lot of fun and 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.209
 finally another half centurion tank 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.739
 This is a lot heavier although I put 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.480
 more heavy media I like more than the 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.260
 churchill and in fact I think it will be better 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.220
 in the game here he says he has 83 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.990
 millimeters 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.290
 what is a very strange weapon because 83 8 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.830
 millimeters could only be English so much 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.080
 specialization here we have the 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.560
 centurion to put him here really 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.150
 that is marked 3 I say it by these 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.580
 of sumo I would like a heart of 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.930
 add the smoke screen and it would be 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.670
 very well indeed has mirrors 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.700
 to see if you know for when you have to 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.030
 changing lanes is pretty good 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.330
 here says 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.720
 which will be in tier 4 and what 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.330
 will stick with panther and of 44 good will be 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.370
 of 54 if panthers guys good is bread 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.630
 terno panther 2 well, there you go 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.750
 not cancer 5 g pan 05 efe out there 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.860
 is in fact here we have the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.570
 rear modification good as follows 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.910
 from behind I'm cool because it has lights 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.350
 brake is that they cool but as I know it is 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.590
 keep after they are not going to be divided into 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.449
 nothing 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.949
 but it would be cool to añadiese in lights 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.650
 brake this is a little bit bigger as 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.650
 you can see actually I do not know when he added 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.889
 they will add this 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.919
 but I do not think they plan for the 1.53 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.650
 is more within two weeks they will start 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.930
 those of server and the 1.5 of interest will leave 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.710
 because want guard under has average 2 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.680
 months for update 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.320
 then knowing that a month has passed and 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.030
 half since the last update and now 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.420
 in fact we have already made a spot here 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.850
 quickie then it is to be expected that in 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.580
 next week two weeks start 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.490
 roll news and finally then one of 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.590
 servet and probably then in thing of 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.200
 three weeks or there we will have the 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.930
 1.53 I plan that for two 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.930
 three weeks we have the 1.53 in fact 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.210
 I would like to know that I do not think they have 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.980
 done as much work for 1.53 as 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.870
 to make a complete technological tree 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.370
 it's more I'm waiting for something American roll 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.280
 only tank is one of each tanks nor 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.730
 none of this but I would like that 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.980
 instead of waiting at 1.55 to take 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.530
 the complete technological tree of the 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.970
 British tanks did like 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.750
 they did with the Americans that they take out 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.520
 half or three quarters in 1.53 and that 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.960
 then finish polishing the details the 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.640
 1.55 that I would like you not to do 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.860
 the roll they made with the tanks 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.930
 Americans for whom he did not find out 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.970
 He lived on his own flesh like I did 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.790
 when the American tanks came out 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.950
 during the first week you could only 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.900
 have one during the second tier 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.390
 2 during the third tier 3 and so on 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.480
 unless on purchases is a 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.370
 premium tank of Americans I hope so 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.890
 Do not do the same with the British 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.410
 and by God I want to see in the game the 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.610
 light tank mk1 because I want to laugh 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:22.050
 I want to laugh a little while at the hoop 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:24.780
 in fact you can see in the forum and everything 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.789
 this roll then you give here to speech 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.919
 off from where forum if you can see everything 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:31.199
 news what people think and such 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:34.520
 but we're not going to anticipate 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:37.409
 still because he puts the redín dizier vale 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.750
 means that it's going to come out this year but 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:42.539
 this year as I said right from 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:45.930
 now until December I hope that the 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:47.340
 1.53 take something out and in fact I'm going to 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.199
 suppose that they are going to get something out because if 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.500
 we would not take these photos but good 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:54.090
 I leave that to your choice and I 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:58.039
 would like to give a little salt only to 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.039
 topic that you tell me about 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.930
 which is the tank that you would most like 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.330
 that they took in 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.770
 in this in the update of the 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.710
 British I want you to take out the light 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:12.139
 and because I want to laugh and I 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:15.289
 I would also like this to come out 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:16.699
 update planning I plan not because if 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:19.639
 I would like I would not leave today 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:21.560
 but I plan it will come out in 34 weeks in 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:23.870
 three two , three weeks or so 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.430
 when you think that you are going to come out 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.780
 update and how would you like to 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.250
 what would you say is tell me that 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.240
 Well, that's all I hope you have 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:34.130
 I hope you are house and nothing 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.199
 custom favorite life to subscribe 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.160
 if you who helped me ride and bouquets 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:41.120
