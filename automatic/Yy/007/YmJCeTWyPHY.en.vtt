and<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:02.389> some<00:00:03.389> work<00:00:03.600> that<00:00:03.750> was<00:00:03.929> put

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
and this is a some work that was put

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.839 
and this is a some work that was put
together<00:00:04.490> during<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.730> process<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.770> actually

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849 
together during the process of actually

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.129 
together during the process of actually
both<00:00:08.849> designing<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.660> setting<00:00:09.990> the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
both designing and setting the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.030 
both designing and setting the
architecture<00:00:10.800> so<00:00:11.460> two<00:00:12.210> or<00:00:12.300> three<00:00:12.450> years<00:00:12.690> ago

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
architecture so two or three years ago

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.260 
architecture so two or three years ago
we<00:00:14.040> were<00:00:14.450> we<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> woman<00:00:15.900> named<00:00:16.109> Sarah<00:00:16.379> Tory<00:00:17.270> was

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
we were we a woman named Sarah Tory was

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.250 
we were we a woman named Sarah Tory was
developing<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.020> application<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.920> we<00:00:20.609> used

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
developing this application and we used

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.060 
developing this application and we used
used<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.820> better<00:00:24.830> understand<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
used it to better understand what the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.540 
used it to better understand what the
workload<00:00:26.430> looked<00:00:26.699> like<00:00:26.939> as<00:00:27.900> well<00:00:28.140> as

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
workload looked like as well as

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.259 
workload looked like as well as
understand<00:00:29.550> what<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> programming

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
understand what the programming

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.510 
understand what the programming
interfaces<00:00:30.630> should<00:00:31.590> be<00:00:31.800> how<00:00:32.070> they<00:00:32.219> should<00:00:32.279> be

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
interfaces should be how they should be

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.040 
interfaces should be how they should be
structured<00:00:32.930> so<00:00:33.930> what<00:00:34.079> you're<00:00:34.230> seeing<00:00:34.380> here<00:00:34.530> is

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
structured so what you're seeing here is

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.900 
structured so what you're seeing here is
curse<00:00:37.050> they're<00:00:37.559> actually<00:00:38.219> cubic<00:00:38.520> curves<00:00:38.760> that

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
curse they're actually cubic curves that

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.020 
curse they're actually cubic curves that
are<00:00:38.969> generated<00:00:39.510> by<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> translator<00:00:41.030> randomly

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
are generated by the translator randomly

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.700 
are generated by the translator randomly
placed<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.690> basically<00:00:42.960> stochastically

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
placed it basically stochastically

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.740 
placed it basically stochastically
placed<00:00:44.100> within<00:00:44.430> triangular<00:00:45.059> patches<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
placed within triangular patches on the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.880 
placed within triangular patches on the
skull<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:47.850> those<00:00:48.059> lawns<00:00:48.420> are<00:00:48.750> are<00:00:48.960> fed

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
skull and then those lawns are are fed

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.470 
skull and then those lawns are are fed
to<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> geometry<00:00:50.579> shooter<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.059> then<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
to the geometry shooter and then the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.319 
to the geometry shooter and then the
geometry<00:00:51.870> shader<00:00:52.050> actually<00:00:52.379> generates

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
geometry shader actually generates

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.880 
geometry shader actually generates
little<00:00:54.329> quads<00:00:54.629> along<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.199> path<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> line

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
little quads along the path of the line

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.220 
little quads along the path of the line
so<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> hairs<00:00:57.510> actually<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.379> finite<00:00:59.309> extent

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
so the hairs actually have finite extent

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.439 
so the hairs actually have finite extent
in<00:01:01.230> screen<00:01:01.649> space<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.219> then<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> pixel

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
in screen space and then in the pixel

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.500 
in screen space and then in the pixel
shader<00:01:03.660> there's<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> fairly<00:01:04.680> sophisticated

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
shader there's a fairly sophisticated

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.870 
shader there's a fairly sophisticated
isotropic<00:01:06.510> shading<00:01:06.990> model<00:01:07.290> applied<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.400> you

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
isotropic shading model applied to you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.760 
isotropic shading model applied to you
know<00:01:09.000> they're<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.080> realistic<00:01:10.350> hair

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
know they're just really realistic hair

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.560 
know they're just really realistic hair
you<00:01:10.920> want<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.159> turn<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> web<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
you want to turn on the web for just a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.870 
you want to turn on the web for just a
second<00:01:15.560> that's<00:01:16.560> bad<00:01:19.280> this<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> first<00:01:20.759> time

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
second that's bad this is the first time

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.810 
second that's bad this is the first time
I've<00:01:21.000> seen<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.240> happen<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.659> days<00:01:21.979> if<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.220> oh

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
I've seen this happen in days if that oh

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.310 
I've seen this happen in days if that oh
there<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.630> go<00:01:24.689> okay<00:01:26.479> all<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.140> is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
there we go okay all right and this is

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.109 
there we go okay all right and this is
to<00:01:28.500> sort<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.220> highlight<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> fact<00:01:29.970> that

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
to sort of highlight the fact that

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.060 
to sort of highlight the fact that
they're<00:01:30.360> also<00:01:30.659> also<00:01:31.140> physics<00:01:31.619> calculations

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
they're also also physics calculations

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.640 
they're also also physics calculations
going<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.640> including<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.720> interactions<00:01:34.350> with

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
going on including the interactions with

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.499 
going on including the interactions with
the<00:01:34.950> pedestal<00:01:36.950> any<00:01:37.970> any<00:01:38.970> questions<00:01:39.420> about

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the pedestal any any questions about

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.380 
the pedestal any any questions about
this<00:01:40.040> that<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.340> does<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.670> legit<00:01:42.060> 40

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
this that this one does have a legit 40

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.480 
this that this one does have a legit 40
na<00:01:42.990> i'm<00:01:43.110> sorry<00:01:43.380> about<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.829> Thank<00:01:44.189> You<00:01:44.250> Joey

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
na i'm sorry about that Thank You Joey

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.969 
na i'm sorry about that Thank You Joey
so<00:01:45.030> here<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.420> are<00:01:45.570> we're<00:01:46.200> running<00:01:46.350> around<00:01:46.590> 30

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
so here we are we're running around 30

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.580 
so here we are we're running around 30
frames<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.399> second<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.439> this

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
frames a second but if you this so this

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.620 
frames a second but if you this so this
was<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:50.250> fair<00:01:50.850> amount<00:01:50.909> more<00:01:51.119> sophisticated

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
was a fair amount more sophisticated

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.530 
was a fair amount more sophisticated
I've<00:01:51.869> seen<00:01:52.079> its<00:01:52.799> back<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.220> 15<00:01:53.549> okay<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.270> push

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
I've seen its back up to 15 okay so push

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.649 
I've seen its back up to 15 okay so push
it<00:01:54.659> off<00:01:54.810> into<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> distance<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:57.149> changes

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
it off into the distance and it changes

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.749 
it off into the distance and it changes
the<00:01:58.350> level<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.680> detail<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.369> case<00:01:59.549> it's

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
the level of detail in this case it's

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.920 
the level of detail in this case it's
sort<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.060> number<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.420> hairs<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.869> are

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
sort of the number of hairs that are

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.020 
sort of the number of hairs that are
generated<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.329> performance<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.079> up<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
generated and the performance is up to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.730 
generated and the performance is up to
around<00:02:05.990> 140<00:02:06.619> frames<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.140> idea<00:02:09.440> being<00:02:09.679> that

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
around 140 frames to the idea being that

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.880 
around 140 frames to the idea being that
by<00:02:10.250> being<00:02:10.759> able<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.500> control<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.650> level<00:02:12.770> of

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
by being able to control the level of

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.160 
by being able to control the level of
detail<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.520> can<00:02:13.700> sort<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.150> deploy<00:02:14.600> these

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
detail you can sort of deploy these

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.260 
detail you can sort of deploy these
techniques<00:02:15.650> across<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:16.490> larger<00:02:16.940> number<00:02:17.060> of
