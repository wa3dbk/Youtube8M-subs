the<00:00:56.550> intuitive<00:00:57.059> aspect<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.600> me<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.920> real

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
the intuitive aspect to me but the real

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.580 
the intuitive aspect to me but the real
question<00:01:00.210> here<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.930> we've<00:01:01.109> been<00:01:01.350> addressing

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
question here that we've been addressing

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.780 
question here that we've been addressing
is<00:01:02.399> how<00:01:02.460> we've<00:01:02.879> been<00:01:03.000> businesses<00:01:03.480> are<00:01:03.660> we

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
is how we've been businesses are we

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.760 
is how we've been businesses are we
since<00:01:05.790> we<00:01:05.970> are<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> spacefaring

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
since we are now a spacefaring

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.679 
since we are now a spacefaring
civilization<00:01:07.770> having<00:01:08.580> only<00:01:08.880> gone<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.330> our<00:01:09.479> own

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
civilization having only gone to our own

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.890 
civilization having only gone to our own
moon<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.130> our<00:01:11.549> visitors<00:01:12.360> are<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
moon but have our visitors are the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.050 
moon but have our visitors are the
aliens<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.740> they<00:01:13.950> come<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.340> us<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
aliens have they come to us and all the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.990 
aliens have they come to us and all the
evidence<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.600> yes<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.500> what<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.460> you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
evidence is yes so what is it that you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.390 
evidence is yes so what is it that you
want<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.450> see<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> Obama<00:01:19.400> administration
