bomb plant points in assault and we set

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.660 
bomb plant points in assault and we set
them<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.390> instant<00:00:55.110> score<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:56.250> could<00:00:56.399> kind<00:00:56.579> of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
them to instant score we could kind of

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.490 
them to instant score we could kind of
set<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.390> sport<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
set up like a sport I have the

in<00:01:04.830> season<00:01:05.309> 4<00:01:06.500> when<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.560> was<00:01:07.680> playing<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
in season 4 when I was playing the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.670 
in season 4 when I was playing the
character<00:01:08.159> Sarge<00:01:10.700> smash<00:01:11.700> cut<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:16.380> we're<00:01:16.500> back

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
character Sarge smash cut and we're back

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.640 
character Sarge smash cut and we're back
I<00:01:17.009> guess<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.119> know<00:01:18.240> three<00:01:18.600> years<00:01:18.810> later<00:01:18.869> we

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
I guess you know three years later we

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.710 
I guess you know three years later we
got<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> make<00:01:20.100> an<00:01:20.220> actual<00:01:20.430> game<00:01:20.759> type<00:01:21.000> based<00:01:21.450> on

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
got to make an actual game type based on

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.270 
got to make an actual game type based on
that<00:01:21.869> line<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.830> looked<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.250> had

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
that line so it looked like we had

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.070 
that line so it looked like we had
everything<00:01:23.610> planned<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.930> was<00:01:25.049> just

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
everything planned out but it was just

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.039 
everything planned out but it was just
random<00:01:25.920> luck<00:01:26.330> grifball<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.450> about<00:01:27.659> one<00:01:27.869> thing

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
random luck grifball is about one thing

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109 
random luck grifball is about one thing
one<00:01:28.320> thing<00:01:28.350> only<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:29.040> basically<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.790> what

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
the trilogy that we've been building up

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.319

now<00:03:46.850> over<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.389> last<00:03:47.540> two<00:03:47.690> years<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:49.239> for<00:03:50.239> this

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
now over the last two years and for this

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.699 
now over the last two years and for this
year<00:03:50.510> we're<00:03:50.660> definitely<00:03:50.840> trying<00:03:51.230> new<00:03:51.500> things

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
year we're definitely trying new things

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.039 
year we're definitely trying new things
and<00:03:52.040> we're<00:03:52.579> trying<00:03:52.850> to<00:03:52.910> take<00:03:53.090> everything<00:03:53.540> up<00:03:53.840> a

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
and we're trying to take everything up a

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.470 
and we're trying to take everything up a
level<00:03:54.410> when<00:03:54.920> we<00:03:55.010> made<00:03:55.299> reconstruction<00:03:56.299> I

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
level when we made reconstruction I

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.960 
level when we made reconstruction I
thought<00:03:56.750> this<00:03:57.410> is<00:03:57.709> probably<00:03:58.069> technically<00:03:58.730> the

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
thought this is probably technically the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.599 
thought this is probably technically the
best<00:03:59.560> piece<00:04:00.560> of<00:04:00.709> machine<00:04:00.950> whether<00:04:01.160> we'll<00:04:01.579> ever

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
best piece of machine whether we'll ever

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.940 
best piece of machine whether we'll ever
be<00:04:01.940> able<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.209> make<00:04:02.299> as<00:04:02.420> a<00:04:02.450> company<00:04:02.810> and<00:04:02.959> I<00:04:03.769> mean

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
be able to make as a company and I mean

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.039 
be able to make as a company and I mean
given<00:04:04.310> talent<00:04:04.790> limitations<00:04:05.239> extreme<00:04:05.750> talent

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
given talent limitations extreme talent

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.759 
given talent limitations extreme talent
limitations<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:07.720> but<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:08.870> think<00:04:09.079> I<00:04:09.230> think<00:04:09.260> I

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
limitations and but I think I think I

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.020 
limitations and but I think I think I
think<00:04:09.859> we're<00:04:10.099> going<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.280> be<00:04:10.370> able<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.609> beat<00:04:10.910> it

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
think we're going to be able to beat it

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.670 
think we're going to be able to beat it
