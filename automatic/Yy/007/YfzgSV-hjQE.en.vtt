00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
batteries die extremely fast and they

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.599 
batteries die extremely fast and they
never<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:21.930> enough<00:00:22.140> power<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:23.250> Eidos

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
never have enough power but what Eidos

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.279 
never have enough power but what Eidos
done<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.269> basically<00:00:24.689> taking<00:00:24.930> all

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
done with this is basically taking all

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
get an idea of what the ego blower is

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.260 
get an idea of what the ego blower is
all<00:00:57.690> about<00:00:58.079> inside<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.949> box<00:00:59.340> itself<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
all about inside the box itself is the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.680 
all about inside the box itself is the
blower<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.870> extension<00:01:01.829> tube<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.399> 2<00:01:02.760> amp<00:01:03.359> hour

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
blower and extension tube a 2 amp hour

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.560 
blower and extension tube a 2 amp hour
56<00:01:04.559> volt<00:01:04.799> battery<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.670> battery<00:01:06.000> charger

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
56 volt battery and a battery charger

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.050 
56 volt battery and a battery charger
now<00:01:07.080> assembly<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.740> extremely<00:01:08.369> easy<00:01:08.580> because

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
now assembly is extremely easy because

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.300 
now assembly is extremely easy because
the<00:01:09.390> tube<00:01:09.600> itself<00:01:10.020> will<00:01:10.380> slide<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the tube itself will slide right on the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.640 
the tube itself will slide right on the
end<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> blower<00:01:11.850> lock<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.080> place<00:01:13.229> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
end of the blower lock it in place and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.740 
end of the blower lock it in place and
then<00:01:13.799> you'll<00:01:13.979> twist<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:15.030> everything<00:01:15.659> is

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
then you'll twist it now everything is

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.539 
then you'll twist it now everything is
assembled<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.530> basically<00:01:16.890> all<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.280> need<00:01:17.430> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
assembled and basically all you need to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.760 
assembled and basically all you need to
do<00:01:17.670> now<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.119> install<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.630> battery<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
do now is install the battery it's on a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.070 
do now is install the battery it's on a
sliding<00:01:20.250> rail<00:01:20.670> system<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.420> you'll<00:01:21.570> line<00:01:21.780> that

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
sliding rail system so you'll line that

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.620 
sliding rail system so you'll line that
up<00:01:22.110> slide<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.310> into<00:01:23.460> place<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.060> then<00:01:24.270> once<00:01:24.509> you

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
up slide it into place and then once you

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.460 
up slide it into place and then once you
hear<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.930> click

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
hear that click

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.980 
hear that click
it's<00:01:26.280> fully<00:01:26.549> installed<00:01:27.060> now<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> few<00:01:27.960> other

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
it's fully installed now a few other

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.899 
it's fully installed now a few other
things<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.500> want<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.680> talk<00:01:28.890> about<00:01:29.040> with<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> ego

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
things I want to talk about with the ego

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.670 
things I want to talk about with the ego
blower<00:01:30.210> before<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.720> actually<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.500> being

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
blower before we actually see it being

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.190 
blower before we actually see it being
used<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.909> fact<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.270> because<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.810> has<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
used is the fact that because it has the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.800 
used is the fact that because it has the
56<00:01:34.890> volt<00:01:35.130> lithium<00:01:35.670> battery<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.570> full

56 volt lithium battery and a full
brushless<00:01:37.200> motor<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:38.250> actually<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.909> most

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
brushless motor it's actually the most

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.330

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.800 
market today now you may see some other
ones<00:01:43.560> with<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> higher<00:01:44.250> mile-per-hour<00:01:44.810> rating

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
ones with a higher mile-per-hour rating

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.840 
ones with a higher mile-per-hour rating
but<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:46.409> because<00:01:46.649> they're<00:01:47.100> forcing<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.640> lot

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
but that's because they're forcing a lot

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.510 
but that's because they're forcing a lot
of<00:01:48.000> air<00:01:48.180> into<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.899> very<00:01:49.320> narrow<00:01:49.770> little<00:01:50.159> funnel

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
of air into a very narrow little funnel

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.730 
of air into a very narrow little funnel
and<00:01:50.880> at<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> end<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.540> very<00:01:51.780> small<00:01:52.170> hole<00:01:52.439> so

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and at the end is a very small hole so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.950 
and at the end is a very small hole so
when<00:01:53.310> all<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.759> air<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.149> forced<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.780> end

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
when all that air is forced to the end

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.499 
when all that air is forced to the end
it<00:01:55.259> increases<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.189> speed<00:01:56.460> because<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> actual

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
it increases in speed because the actual

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.080 
it increases in speed because the actual
funnel<00:01:57.869> size<00:01:58.079> decreases<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:59.579> if<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.790> notice

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
funnel size decreases but if you notice

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.359
