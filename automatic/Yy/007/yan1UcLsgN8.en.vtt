uses much stiffer high back than the 390

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.120 
uses much stiffer high back than the 390
however<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:28.140> still<00:00:28.260> enough<00:00:28.560> play<00:00:28.740> there<00:00:28.980> to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
however it's still enough play there to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.250 
however it's still enough play there to
give<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:30.359> freestyle<00:00:30.750> freedom<00:00:31.109> when<00:00:31.230> you

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
want it the high back actually locks out

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.510 
want it the high back actually locks out
as<00:00:34.230> well<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.590> as<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:34.860> kind<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.160> suspension

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
as well so as this kind of suspension

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.470 
as well so as this kind of suspension
thing<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.649> as<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:38.550> flex<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.000> high<00:00:39.270> back

thing in and as you flex the high back
back<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.899> locks<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.950> reduces

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
back it locks out and that just reduces

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.860 
back it locks out and that just reduces
any<00:00:41.610> chatter<00:00:41.910> gives<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.510> really<00:00:42.840> really

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
ankle strap actually gets firmer the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.209 
ankle strap actually gets firmer the
more<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.570> tighten<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.920> want<00:00:53.129> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
just loosen off slightly gives you loads

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.560 
just loosen off slightly gives you loads
of<00:00:59.879> versatility

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
of versatility

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.530 
of versatility
evie<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.769> toe<00:01:04.769> strap<00:01:05.040> as<00:01:05.189> well<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:06.180> nice<00:01:06.330> and

evie a toe strap as well really nice and
comfortable<00:01:06.960> conforms<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.560> your<00:01:07.680> boot<00:01:07.860> really

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
comfortable conforms to your boot really

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.940

well<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.060> also<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.390> canted<00:01:09.780> footbeds<00:01:10.140> so

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
well and you also get canted footbeds so

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.590 
well and you also get canted footbeds so
that<00:01:11.250> allows<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.760> run<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.030> binding

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
that allows you to run the binding

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.510 
that allows you to run the binding
slightly<00:01:12.900> wider<00:01:13.140> if<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.439> want<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:14.340> going<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
slightly wider if you want it's going to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.800 
slightly wider if you want it's going to
take<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> pressure<00:01:14.909> off<00:01:15.090> your<00:01:15.299> knees<00:01:15.479> just

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
take the pressure off your knees just

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.859 
take the pressure off your knees just
makes<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.200> much<00:01:16.380> much<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.860> comfortable

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
makes it much much more comfortable

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.960 
makes it much much more comfortable
v-rod<00:01:18.869> baseplate<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.850> pretty

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
v-rod baseplate so this is pretty

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.149 
v-rod baseplate so this is pretty
standard<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.570> rowing<00:01:21.750> bindings<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.979> they

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
standard on rowing bindings but they

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.940 
standard on rowing bindings but they
basically<00:01:23.460> let<00:01:24.409> they're<00:01:25.409> basically<00:01:25.650> raised

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
basically let they're basically raised

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.630 
basically let they're basically raised
to<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> contacts<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.479> reduces<00:01:28.049> board

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
to the contacts so that reduces board

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.710 
to the contacts so that reduces board
contact<00:01:29.640> with<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.790> board<00:01:30.030> lets<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.509> board

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
contact with the board lets you board

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
contact with the board lets you board
flex<00:01:30.990> much<00:01:31.200> better<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.970> also<00:01:33.710> allows<00:01:34.710> you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
flex much better and it also allows you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.859 
flex much better and it also allows you
the<00:01:35.250> binding<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.880> direct<00:01:36.299> pressure<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.750> your

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the binding to direct pressure to your

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.780 
the binding to direct pressure to your
boards<00:01:37.170> edges<00:01:37.470> as<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.680> put<00:01:38.040> pressure<00:01:38.280> into<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
boards edges as you put pressure into it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.280 
boards edges as you put pressure into it
so<00:01:39.329> there's<00:01:39.780> really<00:01:39.990> no<00:01:40.229> wasted<00:01:40.710> here<00:01:42.290> really

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
so there's really no wasted here really

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.080 
so there's really no wasted here really
high-quality<00:01:43.619> binding<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.790> going<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> be

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
high-quality binding it's going to be

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.420 
high-quality binding it's going to be
good<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:45.899> intermediate<00:01:46.200> advanced<00:01:46.799> riders

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
good for intermediate advanced riders

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.190 
good for intermediate advanced riders
it's<00:01:47.670> not<00:01:47.880> really<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.479> jibbers<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.110> gonna

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it's not really for jibbers it's gonna

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.740 
it's not really for jibbers it's gonna
be<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> bit<00:01:49.619> too<00:01:49.799> stiff<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.220> responsive<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:51.570> if

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
be a bit too stiff and responsive but if

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.999 
be a bit too stiff and responsive but if
you<00:01:51.869> are<00:01:52.049> kind<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.500> more<00:01:53.960> seasoned
