any<00:02:58.519> measurements<00:02:59.389> for<00:02:59.630> this<00:02:59.810> but<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.980> is

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
any measurements for this but that is

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:08.050 
any measurements for this but that is
kind<00:03:02.299> of<00:03:02.359> the<00:03:02.540> ratio<00:03:03.049> of<00:03:06.250> five-spice<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.730> chili

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
kind of the ratio of five-spice to chili

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.620 
kind of the ratio of five-spice to chili
powder<00:03:08.269> so<00:03:08.630> not<00:03:09.260> as<00:03:09.410> much<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.790> chili

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
powder so not as much of the chili

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.129 
powder so not as much of the chili
powder

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139 
powder

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.039 
powder
but<00:03:12.609> yeah<00:03:13.609> it's<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.299> really<00:03:14.569> love<00:03:14.720> Chinese

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
but yeah it's I really love Chinese

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.870 
but yeah it's I really love Chinese
five-spice<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.739> just<00:03:15.980> feel<00:03:16.190> like<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.489> little<00:03:16.760> bit

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
five-spice I just feel like a little bit

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.520 
five-spice I just feel like a little bit
more<00:03:16.910> of<00:03:18.010> something<00:03:19.120> spicier<00:03:20.120> today

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.460 

so<00:03:23.980> these<00:03:24.100> are<00:03:24.310> almost<00:03:24.670> done<00:03:25.200> I'm<00:03:26.200> just
