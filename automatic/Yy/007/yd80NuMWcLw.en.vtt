with<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.630> using<00:00:27.990> four<00:00:28.439> I'm<00:00:29.429> going<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.670> just

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
with just using four I'm going to just

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.120 
with just using four I'm going to just
take<00:00:30.029> two<00:00:30.300> way<00:00:30.449> glue<00:00:30.830> just<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.920> light<00:00:32.130> glue<00:00:32.520> and

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
take two way glue just a light glue and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.180 
take two way glue just a light glue and
cover<00:00:35.130> three<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.579> these<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:37.070> then<00:00:38.070> you're

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
cover three of these and then you're

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.740 
cover three of these and then you're
going<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.579> stack<00:00:39.000> them<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.600> much

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
going to just stack them it's much

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.619 
going to just stack them it's much
easier<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.260> with<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> tweezers<00:00:41.030> on<00:00:42.030> top<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
easier to do with the tweezers on top of

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.810 
easier to do with the tweezers on top of
each<00:00:42.780> other<00:00:42.960> making<00:00:43.890> sure<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.340> line<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
each other making sure to line up the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.440 
each other making sure to line up the
edges<00:00:44.969> as<00:00:45.950> perfect<00:00:46.950> as<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.250> until<00:00:47.730> you

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
edges as perfect as you can until you

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.770 
edges as perfect as you can until you
have<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.930> stacked<00:00:50.329> kind<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.449> looks<00:00:51.629> like

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
have a little stacked kind of looks like

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.959 
have a little stacked kind of looks like
a<00:00:51.809> button<00:00:52.079> already<00:00:52.520> now<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.579> could<00:00:53.940> just

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
a button already now you could just

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.580 
a button already now you could just
leave<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.270> like<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.899> put<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.140> holes<00:00:55.410> in

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
leave it like that and put the holes in

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.439 
leave it like that and put the holes in
it<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.250> when<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.520> were<00:00:56.640> done<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.149> would<00:00:57.270> end

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
it and when you were done it would end

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.369 
it and when you were done it would end
up<00:00:57.539> looking<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:59.510> but<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.050> want<00:01:01.230> it

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
up looking like this but if you want it

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.990 
up looking like this but if you want it
to<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> ring<00:01:02.010> around<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:02.730> some

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
to have a ring around it like some

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.149 
to have a ring around it like some
buttons<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:04.170> would<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> 3/4<00:01:05.129> inch

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
buttons do you would get a 3/4 inch

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.390 
buttons do you would get a 3/4 inch
circle<00:01:05.700> punch<00:01:06.650> punch<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:07.890> three<00:01:08.100> quarter

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400

inch<00:01:08.580> circle<00:01:08.850> first<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:10.320> take<00:01:10.530> your<00:01:10.650> 1

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
inch circle first and then take your 1

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.000 
inch circle first and then take your 1
inch<00:01:11.100> circle<00:01:11.610> Center<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.270> around<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.780> and

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
inch circle Center it around it and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.820

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
punch out a 1 inch circle loop on the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.370 
punch out a 1 inch circle loop on the
outside<00:01:17.299> now<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> really<00:01:18.840> want<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.200> to

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
outside now if you really want this to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.660 
outside now if you really want this to
stand<00:01:19.590> out<00:01:19.830> you're<00:01:20.070> going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.549> two<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.939> them

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
stand out you're going to do two of them

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.399 
stand out you're going to do two of them
so<00:01:23.670> once<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:26.689> punch<00:01:27.689> out<00:01:27.869> your<00:01:28.049> two<00:01:28.229> loops

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
so once you punch out your two loops

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.410 
so once you punch out your two loops
you're<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> use<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> same<00:01:29.820> 2-way<00:01:30.180> glue

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
you're going to use the same 2-way glue

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.980 
you're going to use the same 2-way glue
and<00:01:30.930> you're<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:31.950> gonna<00:01:32.100> glue<00:01:32.400> one<00:01:33.000> down<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and you're just gonna glue one down to

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.469 
and you're just gonna glue one down to
the<00:01:35.240> bottom<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:36.750> one<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:36.990> top<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the bottom and then one on top so you

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.600 
the bottom and then one on top so you
just<00:01:39.720> want<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> glue<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.320> right<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.829> top<00:01:41.280> of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
just want to glue it right on top of

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.280 
just want to glue it right on top of
your<00:01:42.030> circles<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:44.750> then<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> other<00:01:46.049> one

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
your circles and then the other one

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.460 
your circles and then the other one
right<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.829> top<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:48.140> now<00:01:49.140> you're<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.409> to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
right on top of that now you're going to

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.590 
right on top of that now you're going to
want<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.649> take<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> sanding<00:01:50.430> block<00:01:50.600> because

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
want to take a sanding block because

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.969 
want to take a sanding block because
sometimes<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:54.360> edges<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> little<00:01:55.290> uneven

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
sometimes the edges are a little uneven

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.980 
sometimes the edges are a little uneven
so<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.729> take<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.939> sanding<00:01:57.450> left<00:01:57.750> you

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
so if you just take a sanding left you

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.440 
so if you just take a sanding left you
can<00:01:58.140> get<00:01:58.290> most<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.619> those<00:01:58.710> edges<00:01:59.280> down<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.329> it

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
can get most of those edges down so it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.850 
can get most of those edges down so it
looks<00:02:00.630> really<00:02:00.930> smooth<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.500> then<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.619> just

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
looks really smooth and then you just

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.690 
looks really smooth and then you just
want<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> go<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> light<00:02:02.520> pass<00:02:02.880> over<00:02:03.479> your<00:02:04.290> sides

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
want to go a light pass over your sides

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.090 
want to go a light pass over your sides
to<00:02:05.700> make<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.880> all<00:02:06.090> nice<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.329> even

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.500 

so<00:02:11.100> then<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.370> have<00:02:11.520> just<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.820> nice<00:02:12.030> smooth

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
so then you have just a nice smooth

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.880 
so then you have just a nice smooth
looking<00:02:12.990> bud<00:02:13.700> now<00:02:14.700> use<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.910> pencil<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:16.440> draw<00:02:16.620> my

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
looking bud now use a pencil to draw my

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.400 
looking bud now use a pencil to draw my
where<00:02:17.190> my<00:02:17.370> holes<00:02:17.640> are<00:02:17.850> gonna<00:02:17.940> be<00:02:18.180> now<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.080> use

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
where my holes are gonna be now I use

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.160 
where my holes are gonna be now I use
the<00:02:19.620> crop-a-dile<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:21.330> punch<00:02:21.570> holes<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:21.960> this

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
the crop-a-dile to punch holes in this

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.850 
the crop-a-dile to punch holes in this
but<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:22.830> can<00:02:23.010> also<00:02:23.160> just<00:02:23.520> use<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:24.410> hole<00:02:25.410> piercer

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
but you can also just use a hole piercer

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.949 
but you can also just use a hole piercer
to<00:02:26.520> make<00:02:26.700> smaller<00:02:27.060> holes<00:02:28.250> you're<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.430> gonna

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
to make smaller holes you're just gonna

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.610 
to make smaller holes you're just gonna
punch<00:02:30.959> right<00:02:31.230> through<00:02:31.260> all<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.860> layers<00:02:33.620> and

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
punch right through all the layers and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.750 
punch right through all the layers and
you<00:02:34.800> have<00:02:35.720> your<00:02:36.720> two<00:02:36.930> holes<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.260> your<00:02:37.410> button

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
you have your two holes in your button

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.280 
you have your two holes in your button
now<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.820> can<00:02:39.030> do<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.270> in<00:02:39.390> any<00:02:39.540> color<00:02:39.870> or<00:02:40.110> any

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.380 
now you can do this in any color or any
size<00:02:40.650> punch<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.400> way<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.030> always<00:02:42.300> have

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
size punch and that way you always have

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.930 
size punch and that way you always have
buttons<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.020> match<00:02:43.110> your<00:02:43.320> projects<00:02:43.860> but<00:02:44.670> to

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
buttons to match your projects but to

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.699 
buttons to match your projects but to
give<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.239> final<00:02:45.630> step<00:02:45.870> like<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> real<00:02:46.470> button

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
give it a final step like a real button

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.620

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
and just put a light coating of crystal

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.430 
and just put a light coating of crystal
effects<00:03:20.160> over<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.519> top<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.150> when<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:22.080> dries

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
effects over the top and when this dries

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.370 
effects over the top and when this dries
this<00:03:23.070> gives<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.670> button<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.750> look<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.230> a

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
this gives the button the look of a

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.890 
this gives the button the look of a
plastic<00:03:26.040> button<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.269> normal<00:03:27.690> button

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
plastic button just like a normal button

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.350 
plastic button just like a normal button
does<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:29.400> way<00:03:29.580> you<00:03:29.640> can<00:03:29.730> have<00:03:30.060> them<00:03:30.239> in

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360

any color you need to match perfectly
with<00:03:33.269> your<00:03:33.570> projects<00:03:35.480> now<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.660> takes<00:03:36.810> about<00:03:36.930> a

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
with your projects now it takes about a

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.229 
with your projects now it takes about a
half<00:03:37.320> hour<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.620> dry<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.400> then<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:38.790> just<00:03:39.030> peel

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
half hour to dry and then you just peel

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.840 
half hour to dry and then you just peel
it<00:03:39.360> up<00:03:39.420> from<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.750> wax<00:03:39.959> paper<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.519> can<00:03:41.700> see

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
it up from the wax paper and you can see

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.610 
it up from the wax paper and you can see
some<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.269> others<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.810> can<00:03:43.290> do<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.500> with<00:03:43.590> a

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
some of the others you can do it with a

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.250 
some of the others you can do it with a
heart<00:03:43.890> punch<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.549> make<00:03:45.150> heart<00:03:45.480> buttons<00:03:45.900> or<00:03:46.230> a

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
heart punch and make heart buttons or a

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.890 
heart punch and make heart buttons or a
flower<00:03:46.680> punch<00:03:47.130> make<00:03:47.430> flowers<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.600> can<00:03:48.720> make

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
flower punch make flowers you can make

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.660 
flower punch make flowers you can make
bigger<00:03:49.200> or<00:03:49.530> smaller<00:03:49.739> holes<00:03:50.250> in<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.549> middle

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
bigger or smaller holes in the middle

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.910 
bigger or smaller holes in the middle
but<00:03:51.360> then<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.600> can<00:03:51.750> see<00:03:51.900> once<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.260> dries<00:03:52.500> it

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
but then you can see once it dries it

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.430 
but then you can see once it dries it
kind<00:03:53.579> of<00:03:53.670> looks<00:03:54.060> like<00:03:54.209> it's<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.570> plastic<00:03:54.810> button

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
kind of looks like it's a plastic button

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.890 
kind of looks like it's a plastic button
and<00:03:55.940> that's<00:03:56.940> all<00:03:57.120> there<00:03:57.269> is<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.600> it

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
and that's all there is to it

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.560 
and that's all there is to it
very<00:03:58.140> simple
