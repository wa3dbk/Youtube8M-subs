00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.080 
by the person who sent it to me is the
dock<00:00:30.960> connector<00:00:31.470> or<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.309> certainly<00:00:32.910> looks

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
dock connector or it certainly looks

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.240 
dock connector or it certainly looks
like<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.329> I've<00:00:34.110> had<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.500> look<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:40.350> inside

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
like it I've had a look in the inside

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.389 
like it I've had a look in the inside
the<00:00:41.340> character<00:00:42.500> through<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.559> 30<00:00:44.129> times

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the character through a 30 times

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.549 
the character through a 30 times
magnifying<00:00:44.910> glass<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.410> looks

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
magnifying glass and it can do looks

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.990 
magnifying glass and it can do looks
like<00:00:46.649> there's<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> few<00:00:47.190> pins<00:00:47.460> missing<00:00:47.879> or

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
like there's a few pins missing or

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.779 
like there's a few pins missing or
something<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.219> I'm<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
something like that so I'm going to

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.240 
something like that so I'm going to
touch<00:00:51.449> screen<00:00:51.780> off<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> look<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
touch screen off have a look on the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.630 
touch screen off have a look on the
inside<00:00:53.539> then<00:00:54.539> move<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.870> from<00:00:55.050> there<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.980> see<00:00:56.550> if

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
inside then move on from there to see if

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.069 
inside then move on from there to see if
we<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.879> get<00:00:57.000> looking<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> dock<00:00:57.629> connector

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
we can get looking at the dock connector

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.590 
we can get looking at the dock connector
now<00:00:58.260> from<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> inside<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> ipod<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.480> we

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
now from the inside of the ipod if we

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.319 
now from the inside of the ipod if we
look<00:01:00.780> sort<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.350> around<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:02.010> couple<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.059> pins

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
look sort of around here couple of pins

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.830 
look sort of around here couple of pins
over<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.549> sort<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.610> dark<00:01:05.850> areas<00:01:06.420> there<00:01:06.659> as

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
over here sort of dark areas there as

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.910 
over here sort of dark areas there as
well<00:01:07.070> it's<00:01:08.070> not<00:01:08.159> looking<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.490> best<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.330> pins

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
well it's not looking as best the pins

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.890 
well it's not looking as best the pins
themselves<00:01:10.920> should<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.150> not<00:01:12.689> necessarily

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
themselves should be and not necessarily

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.160 
themselves should be and not necessarily
all<00:01:13.380> shiny<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.189> sort<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.000> clean<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> suppose

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
all shiny but sort of clean I suppose

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.460 
all shiny but sort of clean I suppose
apart<00:01:16.979> from<00:01:17.070> maybe<00:01:17.250> some<00:01:17.520> dust<00:01:17.930> but<00:01:18.930> mainly

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
apart from maybe some dust but mainly

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.830 
apart from maybe some dust but mainly
this<00:01:19.740> should<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:19.979> consistent<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.540> their

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
this should be consistent as in their

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.810 
this should be consistent as in their
appearance<00:01:22.350> shouldn't<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.159> sort<00:01:23.790> of

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
appearance shouldn't be sort of

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.890 
appearance shouldn't be sort of
interrupted<00:01:24.659> by<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.310> in<00:01:26.310> whatever<00:01:27.180> way<00:01:27.570> is

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
happened it is sort of to me looking

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.249 
happened it is sort of to me looking
like<00:01:31.560> water<00:01:31.920> damage<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.670> Sam<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.750> certainly
