00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.700
 hello today let's talk 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.220
 of lightness then lightness is 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.880
 what bush is called putting his 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.189
 slippers 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.040
 that is riding all the horses 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.010
 without exception by using either 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:29.320
 legs be the hand with the biggest 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.320
 sweetness and especially the slightest effort 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.150
 in our quest for lightness 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.940
 we will see that the 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.610
 rider learn to find the right 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.409
 muscle tonicity 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.640
 for that I will ask sephora 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.640
 to be my partner today 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.470
 so I try to find them 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.220
 different tone to show you 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.800
 that it influences 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.050
 my mare lecavalier had one who did not 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.920
 not want to make an effort 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.350
 usually it's called 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.150
 with us the ass in the wheelbarrow then 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.850
 a blues confesses that she advance 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.400
 this is the rider we hamachi do not 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.320
 transmits no tonicity to his horse and 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.270
 tonicity a little exaggerated that's what 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.460
 I would call Madam not Mrs. Papin and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.570
 super stressed she is very stiff at 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.570
 saljic school 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.160
 brief depending on the circumstances and in 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.320
 function of efforts to provide the 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.140
 rider will adjust his muscle tone 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.789
 I show you go with me 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.300
 would say with the outfit it was just your 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.160
 horse at pace the movement of the plate 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.350
 accompany you with your hands you 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.789
 can even pavement and leave 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.970
 hang your legs priced beast at the same 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.160
 time that flanks then you go 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.170
 use your pond to block 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.910
 the basin over the company you 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.170
 go go against the studio it was that 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.119
 you will be created with your 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.020
 horse is normally your horse 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.380
 should stop I block sephora 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.380
 stop 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.160
 we agree that for a 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.840
 horse be light oz 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.480
 it is necessary that the rider is a good 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:32.570
 position but what exactly is the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:34.250
 good position of the rider well he 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.230
 there is no mystery to acquire a 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.400
 good position the rider must be 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.650
 give a little bit of trouble 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.420
 and for that, it's simple 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.550
 put in the saddle and yes it's not 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.500
 just to annoy you banging 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.050
 hindsight it is also to succeed in 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:55.340
 acquire the ideal position and therefore 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:57.800
 get the lightness rosen an example of 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.750
 poor independence of the aid is the 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.780
 rider he can not too you are 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.820
 gallop without clinging to the mouth of 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.950
 his horse finally it's the rider 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.410
 every time they get up and ben he 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.660
 gets up with all the strength on the 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.100
 mouth of his shawl had you queue asked to 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.860
 his horse to be light in these 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.110
 conditions second example of bad 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.510
 independence of the z is the rider who 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.620
 is not able to get up without 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.690
 move his hands at the same time 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.230
 normally the hands are able to 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.930
 do not move 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.430
 even if last solesmes last point 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.080
 to make the horse understand 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.080
 we expect him to be light 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.860
 so that our horse is a chance to 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.410
 understand that we expect him 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.480
 be light it is already necessary that jumper 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.460
 resume is less talkative with these aids 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.680
 do not put legs permanently 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.550
 and not so much solicited the horse 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.770
 in his mouth 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.850
 so learn a little bit to be 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.650
 silent with you second thing he 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.450
 must jumper is leading a plan of 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.880
 progression to request transition 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.860
 to his horse you prepare different 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.540
 steps you 're stuck for example 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.180
 first step block your pool 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.489
 second step with the voice asked 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.650
 a transition with horse a third 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.500
 step fix your hand if you have to tighten 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.600
 strongly your fingers on the reins your 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.190
 horse has plenty of ways to learn I 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.169
 want to be light if your horse has 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.120
 stopped light way ie 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.550
 with a very small congratulations from 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.990
 dreams take advantage of it to reward him in 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.620
 leaving him three zones of 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.200
 tranquility he will appreciate a fair 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.840
 tonicity an excellent independence of 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.340
 helps a mare who responds to the slightest 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.930
 solicitation and well I believe me 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.720
 I won my stripes to ride or 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.720
 slippers go it's gone
