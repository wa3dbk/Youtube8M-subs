00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.420 
and it reminded me of like that JLo glow
because<00:05:15.540> you<00:05:15.630> could<00:05:15.750> totally<00:05:15.900> take

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
because you could totally take

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.250 
because you could totally take
darker<00:05:16.730> shade<00:05:16.940> and<00:05:17.120> just<00:05:17.360> give<00:05:17.570> yourself<00:05:17.930> that

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
darker shade and just give yourself that

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.840 
darker shade and just give yourself that
glow<00:05:18.680> I<00:05:18.980> wouldn't<00:05:19.250> use<00:05:19.340> it<00:05:19.370> as<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:19.610> bronzer

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
glow I wouldn't use it as a bronzer

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.760 
glow I wouldn't use it as a bronzer
because<00:05:20.180> it<00:05:20.300> was<00:05:20.390> pretty<00:05:20.630> high<00:05:20.840> high<00:05:21.500> sugar

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
because it was pretty high high sugar

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.340 
because it was pretty high high sugar
but<00:05:22.040> you<00:05:22.160> could<00:05:22.280> do<00:05:22.430> that<00:05:22.580> bronzy<00:05:23.420> glow<00:05:23.660> over

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
but you could do that bronzy glow over

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.690 
but you could do that bronzy glow over
your<00:05:24.500> bronzer<00:05:24.830> and<00:05:24.980> then<00:05:25.130> the<00:05:25.220> highlight<00:05:25.580> on
