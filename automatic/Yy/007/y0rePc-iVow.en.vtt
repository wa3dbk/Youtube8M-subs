you<00:03:08.489> can<00:03:08.730> see<00:03:09.000> how<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.299> whitening<00:03:09.780> agent

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
you can see how the whitening agent

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.199 
you can see how the whitening agent
actually<00:03:10.650> gets<00:03:10.829> into<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.190> smallest<00:03:11.549> surfaces

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
actually gets into the smallest surfaces

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.789 
actually gets into the smallest surfaces
of<00:03:12.329> your<00:03:12.359> teeth<00:03:12.480> where<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.230> stains<00:03:13.500> hide

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
ever imagined possible and this doesn't

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.360 
ever imagined possible and this doesn't
take<00:03:18.569> two<00:03:18.810> hours<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.590> sure<00:03:19.799> doesn't<00:03:19.980> cost

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
take two hours and it sure doesn't cost

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.370 
take two hours and it sure doesn't cost

hundreds and hundreds of dollars and for

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.530 
hundreds and hundreds of dollars and for
me<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.829> best<00:03:23.010> part<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.880> doesn't<00:03:24.120> hurt<00:03:24.359> my

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
me the best part is it doesn't hurt my

over

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.250 

that's<00:03:31.959> incredible<00:03:32.829> I<00:03:33.159> had<00:03:34.150> no<00:03:34.450> idea<00:03:34.750> that

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
that's incredible I had no idea that

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.530 
that's incredible I had no idea that
they<00:03:35.409> were<00:03:35.439> really<00:03:35.829> that<00:03:36.129> that<00:03:36.400> is<00:03:36.609> HUGE<00:03:36.969> oh

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
they were really that that is HUGE oh

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.170 
they were really that that is HUGE oh
wow<00:03:38.200> yeah<00:03:38.769> they<00:03:39.040> look<00:03:39.159> so<00:03:39.310> much<00:03:39.340> brighter<00:03:39.640> and

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
wow yeah they look so much brighter and

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.599 
wow yeah they look so much brighter and
it<00:03:40.450> changes<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.170> whole<00:03:41.200> chemistry<00:03:42.159> of<00:03:42.430> your

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
it changes the whole chemistry of your

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.819 
it changes the whole chemistry of your
smile<00:03:42.909> that's<00:03:43.450> pretty<00:03:43.870> impressive<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.650> like

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
smile that's pretty impressive I like

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.550 
smile that's pretty impressive I like
that<00:03:45.069> the<00:03:45.640> before<00:03:46.060> they're<00:03:46.719> just<00:03:46.930> dull<00:03:47.200> and

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
that the before they're just dull and

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.289 
that the before they're just dull and
