00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.790
 this picturesque village in the mountains between 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.490
 Syria and Lebanon melts its dark secret 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.010
 such that perhaps everyone hides 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.280
 locality on this 400 meter 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.500
 the borders on the other side of the mountain are already 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.900
 the territory of Syria the border passes here 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.939
 day and night she is guarded with one 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.550
 side by the Syrian military on the other 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.289
 Lebanese seemingly reliable protection 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.320
 slip into fail 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.369
 the reality is nothing like 30 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.620
 people and now these here 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.899
 and tons of other weapons regularly 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.670
 cross the Lebanese Syrian border 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.260
 to then get to different 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.200
 Syrian armed formation 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.420

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.530
 along with several people cross 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.629
 on horseback we give goods 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.559
 we return usually drive about 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.989
 as much as here in 2012 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.350
 just a year after the crisis began 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.210
 Syria 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.129
 un confirmed that the country is illegal 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.049
 weapons come from Lebanese 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.689
 several years later transporting it 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.760
 it became harder smuggler ahmad this 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.320
 his not real name tells what 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.020
 every month when trying to cross 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.030
 2-3 people are alone in the border 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.790
 kill shootout others tread on 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.479
 mines but the flow of illegal weapons is not 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.659
 runs down 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.390

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.000
 says he sells weapons to the enemies of Assad 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.380
 because he wants him to be overthrown 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.840
 but it's also a multi-million dollar business 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.150
 bring back 3-4 million dollars and 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.750

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.170
 claims not to be engaged 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.880
 smuggling 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.090
 however, he also keeps his home 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.670
 dangerous cargo conflict continues very 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.410
 long ago all the countries of the world and he just 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.900
 watching from the side 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.940
 if similar things happen in another 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.500
 country and they want to put conflict 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.080
 end they do so 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.180
