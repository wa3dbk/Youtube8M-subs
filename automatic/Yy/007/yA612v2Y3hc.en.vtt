00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:22.919
 Recently, more and more people are using smartphones as navigation systems for cars and motorcycles 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.529
 Voice over wireless if you have a bluetooth compatible intercom on your helmet 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:29.340
 You can also listen to the guidance 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.680
 So how should we fix the smartphone on the floor ? 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:38.270
 This is trouble 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.270
 Recommend is to be installed using the ram mount -x grip 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.089
 ram mount is a navigation system and a mounting system such as a smartphone tablet 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.920
 Already 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:52.160
 92 already get this patent 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.980
 We still apply for about 60 patents 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:00.660
 It is a brand excellent in technology 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:06.600
 The product is produced in the United States and boasts excellent quality 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:09.530
 The biggest feature of ram mount is the combination of base and arm mount 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.030
 I just met the request 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:18.260
 Since the rubber ball has become a simple structure sandwiched between the arm 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:22.360
 Non-slippery , sturdy and simple to operate 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.360
 The mounting angle can also be changed freely 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.620
 Had 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:40.750
 mirror frame base 9 right hole and the standard if attached to the ninja 250 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.750
 It would be better to combine x grips 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:52.330
 x Grip is not only easy to attach and remove your smartphone like this 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:56.450
 You will continue to report your smartphone firmly while driving 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:01.520
 It can be used even with the case attached 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:05.170
 The tip of the grip is conical, so when you go over the steps the smartphone 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.170
 There is no danger of jumping out 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:15.010
 There is a dedicated mount for iphone 4 and 5 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:19.740
 If you purchase a camera mount , you can attach a small camera 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.740
 It is also attractive that such extensibility is high 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.739
 Let's go for a more enjoyable and comfortable touring with ram mount
