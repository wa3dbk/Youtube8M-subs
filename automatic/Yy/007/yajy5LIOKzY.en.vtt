the<00:00:01.940> bionic<00:00:02.300> eye<00:00:02.419> would<00:00:02.659> produce<00:00:02.840> an<00:00:03.139> image

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:03.260 
the bionic eye would produce an image

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.460 
the bionic eye would produce an image
like<00:00:03.649> this<00:00:04.360> as<00:00:05.360> you<00:00:05.450> can<00:00:05.750> see<00:00:05.930> the<00:00:06.259> image<00:00:06.440> that

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
like this as you can see the image that

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.799 
like this as you can see the image that
presented<00:00:06.799> is<00:00:07.100> by<00:00:07.250> no<00:00:07.310> means<00:00:07.490> perfect<00:00:07.970> but<00:00:08.330> it

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
presented is by no means perfect but it

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.230 
presented is by no means perfect but it
does<00:00:09.019> allow<00:00:09.260> a<00:00:09.740> degree<00:00:10.130> of<00:00:10.160> Independence<00:00:10.519> so

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
does allow a degree of Independence so

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.070 
does allow a degree of Independence so
it<00:00:11.599> will<00:00:12.139> in<00:00:12.380> the<00:00:12.679> end<00:00:12.710> be<00:00:13.550> able<00:00:13.910> to<00:00:14.150> restore

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
it will in the end be able to restore

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.259 
it will in the end be able to restore
some<00:00:15.410> form<00:00:15.650> of<00:00:15.740> vision<00:00:16.039> to<00:00:16.160> tens<00:00:16.580> of<00:00:16.789> thousands

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:17.269

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.470 
the image is sent to a processing unit
that<00:00:41.370> processes<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.400> image<00:00:42.820> and<00:00:43.059> converts

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
that processes the image and converts

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.420 
that processes the image and converts
them<00:00:43.600> into<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:44.140> series<00:00:44.620> of<00:00:44.650> stimulation

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
them into a series of stimulation

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.600 
them into a series of stimulation
commands<00:00:46.059> that<00:00:46.149> are<00:00:46.210> sent<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:46.750> a<00:00:47.610> transmitter

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
commands that are sent to a transmitter

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.970 
commands that are sent to a transmitter
that<00:00:48.879> is<00:00:49.000> mounted<00:00:49.239> here<00:00:49.420> behind<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:50.199> year<00:00:50.410> so

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
that is mounted here behind the year so

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.650 
that is mounted here behind the year so

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
that sends these these commands

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.079 
that sends these these commands
wirelessly<00:00:53.290> to<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.650> implanted<00:00:54.190> device<00:00:54.489> then

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
wirelessly to the implanted device then

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.180 
wirelessly to the implanted device then
the<00:00:55.239> signals<00:00:55.600> come<00:00:55.870> to<00:00:56.079> an<00:00:56.350> implant<00:00:56.920> which<00:00:57.159> is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
the signals come to an implant which is

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.369 
the signals come to an implant which is
placed<00:00:57.550> on<00:00:57.760> top<00:00:57.940> of<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.239> eye<00:00:58.269> with<00:00:59.019> a<00:00:59.050> small

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
placed on top of the eye with a small

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.229 
placed on top of the eye with a small
incision<00:00:59.559> made<00:01:00.070> in<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.339> side<00:01:00.550> of<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.820> eye<00:01:00.850> so

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
incision made in the side of the eye so

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.149 
incision made in the side of the eye so
that<00:01:01.360> we<00:01:01.420> can<00:01:01.570> slide<00:01:01.900> an<00:01:02.230> electrode<00:01:02.920> array

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
that we can slide an electrode array

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.369 
that we can slide an electrode array
around<00:01:03.729> to<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:04.000> back<00:01:04.180> of<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.449> retina<00:01:04.629> now<00:01:05.320> the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
around to the back of the retina now the

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.859 
around to the back of the retina now the
back<00:01:05.680> of<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:05.920> retina<00:01:06.070> is<00:01:06.430> roughly<00:01:07.420> there<00:01:07.659> and

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
back of the retina is roughly there and

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.140 
back of the retina is roughly there and
that's<00:01:08.650> where<00:01:08.830> our<00:01:08.860> electrode<00:01:09.369> array<00:01:09.640> sits

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
that's where our electrode array sits

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.140 
that's where our electrode array sits
and<00:01:10.450> it<00:01:11.070> receives<00:01:12.070> these<00:01:12.280> instructions<00:01:12.970> from

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
and it receives these instructions from

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.020 
and it receives these instructions from
from<00:01:13.570> Nigel<00:01:13.930> system<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:14.470> that<00:01:15.000> causes<00:01:16.000> a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
from Nigel system and that causes a

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.240 
from Nigel system and that causes a
signal<00:01:16.659> to<00:01:16.689> go<00:01:16.900> down<00:01:17.080> the<00:01:17.229> optic<00:01:17.530> nerve<00:01:17.560> and<00:01:18.010> be

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
signal to go down the optic nerve and be

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.910 
signal to go down the optic nerve and be
interpreted<00:01:18.790> as<00:01:18.909> vision<00:01:19.240> by<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.450> patient<00:01:19.920> 15

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
interpreted as vision by the patient 15

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.410 
interpreted as vision by the patient 15
years<00:01:21.159> in<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.369> making<00:01:21.549> to<00:01:21.790> get<00:01:21.909> to<00:01:22.030> this<00:01:22.150> point

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
years in the making to get to this point

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.600 
years in the making to get to this point
and<00:01:22.659> it's<00:01:23.110> been<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.380> very<00:01:23.500> long<00:01:23.830> journey<00:01:23.890> so

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
and it's been a very long journey so

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.940 
and it's been a very long journey so
here<00:01:25.000> is<00:01:25.180> our<00:01:25.450> current<00:01:26.140> generation<00:01:26.619> of<00:01:26.740> chip

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
here is our current generation of chip

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.580 
here is our current generation of chip
this<00:01:27.670> will<00:01:27.850> be<00:01:27.970> a<00:01:28.000> very<00:01:28.090> exciting<00:01:28.960> development

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
this will be a very exciting development

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.350 
this will be a very exciting development
once<00:01:29.770> it<00:01:29.920> gets<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.220> humans<00:01:30.640> we<00:01:31.150> thought<00:01:31.330> that

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
once it gets to humans we thought that

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.390 
once it gets to humans we thought that
we<00:01:31.600> would<00:01:31.720> be<00:01:31.810> inhuman<00:01:32.110> implantation<00:01:32.740> about

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
we would be inhuman implantation about

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.330 
we would be inhuman implantation about
the<00:01:33.549> year<00:01:33.670> 2000<00:01:34.359> which<00:01:35.229> is<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.409> sort<00:01:35.799> of<00:01:35.920> a<00:01:36.009> naive

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
the year 2000 which is a sort of a naive

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.300 
the year 2000 which is a sort of a naive
you<00:01:36.640> so<00:01:37.390> here<00:01:37.539> we<00:01:37.630> are<00:01:37.749> in<00:01:37.780> 2012<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.070> we're

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
you so here we are in 2012 and we're

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.749 
you so here we are in 2012 and we're
anticipating<00:01:39.899> actual<00:01:40.899> human<00:01:41.229> trials<00:01:41.560> in<00:01:41.759> 2013

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
anticipating actual human trials in 2013

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.060 
anticipating actual human trials in 2013
so<00:01:43.630> we<00:01:43.749> started<00:01:44.020> out<00:01:44.200> using<00:01:44.350> equipment<00:01:44.710> that

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
so we started out using equipment that

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.370 
so we started out using equipment that
we<00:01:45.189> we<00:01:45.520> scrounged<00:01:46.119> from<00:01:46.240> various<00:01:46.899> disused

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
we we scrounged from various disused

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.160 
we we scrounged from various disused
pieces<00:01:47.799> of<00:01:47.920> electronics<00:01:48.490> so<00:01:48.609> it<00:01:48.670> was<00:01:48.789> a<00:01:48.819> very

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
pieces of electronics so it was a very

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.599 
pieces of electronics so it was a very
aggravated<00:01:50.170> that<00:01:50.319> we<00:01:50.439> started<00:01:50.799> with<00:01:50.859> to<00:01:51.429> make

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
aggravated that we started with to make

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:54.029 
aggravated that we started with to make
out<00:01:51.819> our<00:01:52.090> electrodes<00:01:52.719> that's<00:01:53.469> right<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:53.859> lot<00:01:54.009> of

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
out our electrodes that's right a lot of

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.590 
out our electrodes that's right a lot of
the<00:01:54.310> work<00:01:54.579> in<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.819> early<00:01:55.030> days<00:01:55.179> was<00:01:55.299> done<00:01:55.509> in

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
the work in the early days was done in

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.800 
the work in the early days was done in
my<00:01:55.719> garage<00:01:55.899> up<00:01:56.319> on<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.530> Central<00:01:56.859> Coast<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.939> had

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
my garage up on the Central Coast I had

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.480 
my garage up on the Central Coast I had
to<00:01:58.899> carry<00:01:59.139> this<00:01:59.259> on<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.530> train<00:01:59.799> and<00:01:59.829> got<00:02:00.280> lots

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
to carry this on the train and got lots

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.609 
to carry this on the train and got lots
of<00:02:00.609> stairs<00:02:00.939> and<00:02:01.240> an<00:02:01.359> odd<00:02:01.990> looks<00:02:02.289> this

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
of stairs and an odd looks this

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.379 
of stairs and an odd looks this
particular<00:02:03.159> device<00:02:03.429> allowed<00:02:03.969> us<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.149> make<00:02:04.359> a

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:04.389 
particular device allowed us to make a

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:06.029 
particular device allowed us to make a
sphere<00:02:04.899> that<00:02:05.079> would<00:02:05.289> allow<00:02:05.499> us<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.770> put<00:02:05.950> it

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
sphere that would allow us to put it

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.219 
sphere that would allow us to put it
very<00:02:06.189> close<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:06.969> neurons<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.539> directly

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
very close to the neurons and directly

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.840 
very close to the neurons and directly
electrically<00:02:08.800> stimulate<00:02:09.220> those<00:02:09.369> things<00:02:09.640> I

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
electrically stimulate those things I

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.080 
electrically stimulate those things I
could<00:02:10.119> show<00:02:10.300> you<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.660> car<00:02:11.470> coil<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.190> the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
could show you the car coil of the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.370 
could show you the car coil of the
ignition<00:02:13.480> coil<00:02:13.780> from<00:02:14.080> my<00:02:14.500> wife's<00:02:14.709> of<00:02:16.380> 1978

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
ignition coil from my wife's of 1978

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.970 
ignition coil from my wife's of 1978
dots<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.200> she<00:02:20.200> noticed<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:20.860> was

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
dots and that I she noticed it was

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.440 
dots and that I she noticed it was
missing<00:02:21.010> pretty<00:02:21.490> pretty<00:02:21.940> quickly<00:02:22.209> but

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
missing pretty pretty quickly but

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.360 
missing pretty pretty quickly but
nevertheless<00:02:23.020> we<00:02:23.290> were<00:02:23.470> able<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.800> make<00:02:23.950> this

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
nevertheless we were able to make this

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.400 
nevertheless we were able to make this
this<00:02:24.760> device<00:02:25.120> based<00:02:25.420> on<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.840> in<00:02:26.080> our<00:02:26.140> first

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
this device based on that in our first

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.500 
this device based on that in our first
version<00:02:27.069> of<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:27.459> thing<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.819> spark<00:02:28.120> was<00:02:28.300> so

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
version of this thing the spark was so

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.750 
version of this thing the spark was so
had<00:02:29.410> so<00:02:29.560> much<00:02:29.680> energy<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.550> the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
had so much energy in it that the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.270 
had so much energy in it that the
computers<00:02:31.450> nearby<00:02:31.930> would<00:02:32.170> be<00:02:32.319> reset<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.190> the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
computers nearby would be reset and the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.190 
computers nearby would be reset and the
people<00:02:33.580> would<00:02:33.700> have<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.540> restart<00:02:34.930> what<00:02:35.080> they

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
people would have to restart what they

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.220 
people would have to restart what they
were<00:02:35.260> doing

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
were doing

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.080 
were doing
so<00:02:36.409> I<00:02:36.440> wasn't<00:02:36.739> real<00:02:36.860> popular<00:02:37.099> with<00:02:37.459> while<00:02:37.879> Greg

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
so I wasn't real popular with while Greg

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.610 
so I wasn't real popular with while Greg
was<00:02:38.120> doing<00:02:38.420> all<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.659> hard<00:02:38.780> work<00:02:39.050> I<00:02:39.260> was<00:02:39.409> racing

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
was doing all the hard work I was racing

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.100 
was doing all the hard work I was racing
around<00:02:39.890> trying<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.519> find<00:02:41.180> some<00:02:41.510> money<00:02:41.750> to

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
around trying to find some money to

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.259 
around trying to find some money to
resource<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.129> project<00:02:43.549> it<00:02:43.700> was<00:02:43.819> very

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
resource the project it was very

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.000 
resource the project it was very
difficult<00:02:44.540> task<00:02:44.989> at<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.290> time<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.830> that's

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
difficult task at that time so that's

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.550 
difficult task at that time so that's
why<00:02:46.190> we<00:02:46.400> have<00:02:46.580> devices<00:02:47.030> such<00:02:47.390> as<00:02:47.450> this<00:02:48.230> where

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
why we have devices such as this where

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.809 
why we have devices such as this where
we<00:02:48.799> had<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.400> make<00:02:49.549> things<00:02:49.819> from<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:51.680> sins<00:02:52.519> and

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
we had to make things from that sins and

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.420 
we had to make things from that sins and
stereo<00:02:53.780> equipment<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.379> old<00:02:54.650> televisions<00:02:55.280> and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
stereo equipment and old televisions and

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.270 
stereo equipment and old televisions and
pins<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:58.610> I<00:02:58.640> was<00:02:59.000> working<00:02:59.690> at<00:02:59.959> a<00:03:00.470> bench<00:03:00.680> trying

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
pins so I was working at a bench trying

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.380 
pins so I was working at a bench trying
to<00:03:01.340> figure<00:03:01.489> out<00:03:01.610> what<00:03:01.790> these<00:03:01.940> were<00:03:02.180> and

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
to figure out what these were and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.479 
to figure out what these were and
writing<00:03:02.660> down<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.989> values<00:03:03.349> of<00:03:03.379> what<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.280> was

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
writing down the values of what I was

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.490 
writing down the values of what I was
discovering<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.780> got<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.049> important

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
discovering and I got this important

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.410 
discovering and I got this important
call<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.040> had<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.280> take<00:03:07.430> this<00:03:07.610> this<00:03:08.030> number

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
call and I had to take this this number

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.300 
call and I had to take this this number
down<00:03:08.569> blend<00:03:09.230> over<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.769> newest<00:03:10.040> bit<00:03:10.190> of

shock<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.459> guess<00:03:25.480> since<00:03:26.480> then<00:03:26.750> we<00:03:26.959> now<00:03:27.170> have<00:03:27.410> a

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
shock I guess since then we now have a

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.470 
shock I guess since then we now have a
million-dollar<00:03:28.099> laser<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:28.760> allows<00:03:29.060> us<00:03:29.299> to

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
million-dollar laser that allows us to

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.630 
million-dollar laser that allows us to
make<00:03:30.230> our<00:03:30.349> electrodes<00:03:30.859> with<00:03:31.069> exquisite

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
make our electrodes with exquisite

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.670 
make our electrodes with exquisite
quality<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.359> precision<00:03:32.569> so<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.260> progress

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
quality and precision so the progress

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.349 
quality and precision so the progress
that<00:03:33.709> we've<00:03:33.950> made<00:03:33.980> is<00:03:34.340> over<00:03:34.849> the<00:03:34.940> last<00:03:35.120> ten

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
that we've made is over the last ten

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:36.910 
that we've made is over the last ten
years<00:03:35.390> have<00:03:35.720> been<00:03:35.810> absolutely<00:03:36.079> astounding

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
years have been absolutely astounding

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.250 
years have been absolutely astounding
this<00:03:37.489> is<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.849> latest<00:03:38.359> chip<00:03:38.780> that<00:03:38.959> we<00:03:39.079> have

be quite the journey it's been it's
taken<00:04:15.139> us<00:04:15.200> 15<00:04:15.620> years<00:04:15.859> so<00:04:16.370> it<00:04:16.609> has<00:04:16.639> been<00:04:16.789> a<00:04:17.000> slob

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
taken us 15 years so it has been a slob

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.870 
taken us 15 years so it has been a slob
but<00:04:18.380> along<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:18.859> way<00:04:18.889> we've<00:04:19.250> forced<00:04:19.700> some

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
but along the way we've forced some

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.330 
but along the way we've forced some
amazing<00:04:20.419> partnerships<00:04:21.019> with<00:04:21.380> we've<00:04:21.979> created

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
amazing partnerships with we've created

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.490 
amazing partnerships with we've created
some<00:04:22.960> brilliant<00:04:23.960> technology

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
some brilliant technology

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.500 
some brilliant technology
state-of-the-art<00:04:25.000> technology<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.300> I<00:04:26.389> guess

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
state-of-the-art technology and I guess

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.909 
state-of-the-art technology and I guess
what<00:04:26.660> keeps<00:04:26.840> us<00:04:26.930> going<00:04:26.990> with<00:04:27.410> this<00:04:27.530> research

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
what keeps us going with this research

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.800 
what keeps us going with this research
is<00:04:27.950> that<00:04:28.130> we<00:04:28.340> know<00:04:28.490> that<00:04:28.520> at<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:29.210> end<00:04:29.240> point<00:04:29.630> is

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
is that we know that at the end point is

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.779 
is that we know that at the end point is
someone<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.110> really<00:04:31.039> can't<00:04:31.310> see<00:04:31.580> anything

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
someone that really can't see anything

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.159 
someone that really can't see anything
is<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.240> you're<00:04:32.360> going<00:04:32.539> to<00:04:32.630> be<00:04:32.720> able<00:04:32.750> to<00:04:32.990> see

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
is that you're going to be able to see

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.680 
is that you're going to be able to see
something<00:04:33.199> with<00:04:33.770> this<00:04:33.889> device<00:04:34.250> and<00:04:34.520> that<00:04:34.970> is

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
something with this device and that is

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.480 
something with this device and that is
going<00:04:35.930> to<00:04:35.990> be<00:04:36.050> a<00:04:36.080> wonderful<00:04:36.199> reward<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:37.039> it

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
going to be a wonderful reward and it

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.080 
going to be a wonderful reward and it
gets<00:04:37.610> us<00:04:37.760> motivated<00:04:37.910> every<00:04:38.360> day<00:04:38.570> too

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090
