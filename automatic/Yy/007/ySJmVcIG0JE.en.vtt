the<00:00:04.740> fan<00:00:05.009> from<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.730> old<00:00:06.150> radiator<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.899> new

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
the fan from the old radiator to the new

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.640 
the fan from the old radiator to the new
radiator<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:08.220> should<00:00:08.429> be<00:00:08.550> good<00:00:08.760> on<00:00:09.650> some

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
radiator and you should be good on some

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.280 
radiator and you should be good on some
Honda's<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.460> may<00:00:11.610> have<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.269> transmission<00:00:13.110> line

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
Honda's you may have a transmission line

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.939 
Honda's you may have a transmission line
like<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.130> coolant<00:00:14.549> line<00:00:15.320> so<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.350> thought<00:00:16.590> at<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
like a coolant line so I thought at the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.300 
like a coolant line so I thought at the
most<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.490> have<00:00:17.609> four<00:00:17.880> lines<00:00:18.320> to<00:00:19.320> take<00:00:19.500> out<00:00:19.680> on

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
most you have four lines to take out on

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.790 
most you have four lines to take out on
my<00:00:20.550> system<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.300> have<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.810> lower<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
my system I just have the lower and the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.710 
my system I just have the lower and the
upper<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.970> that's<00:00:24.330> it

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
upper and that's it

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.710 
upper and that's it
so<00:00:24.990> drain<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> system<00:00:25.800> first<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:27.090> then

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
so drain the system first and then

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.689 
so drain the system first and then
you're<00:00:27.869> going<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.019> basically<00:00:28.699> unhook

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
you're going to basically unhook

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.849 
you're going to basically unhook
everything<00:00:30.119> first<00:00:30.810> piece<00:00:31.080> could<00:00:31.380> come<00:00:31.529> out<00:00:31.679> is

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
everything first piece could come out is

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.810 
everything first piece could come out is
that<00:00:32.070> reservoir<00:00:32.660> second<00:00:33.660> piece<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.820> unhook

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
that reservoir second piece is unhook

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.299 
that reservoir second piece is unhook
this<00:00:38.059> thirdly<00:00:39.559> unhook<00:00:40.559> your<00:00:40.739> top<00:00:40.950> radiator

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
this thirdly unhook your top radiator

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.560 
this thirdly unhook your top radiator
hose<00:00:42.260> fourth<00:00:43.260> bottom<00:00:43.950> radiator<00:00:44.309> hose<00:00:44.570> fifth

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
hose fourth bottom radiator hose fifth

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.920 
hose fourth bottom radiator hose fifth
remove<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.550> pull<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.640> radiator<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:48.090> so

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
remove this pull the radiator out so

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:58.950 
remove this pull the radiator out so
very<00:00:49.260> easy<00:00:49.440> all<00:00:50.430> right

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.170 

first<00:00:59.829> of<00:00:59.950> all<00:01:00.100> usually<00:01:00.399> put<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.760> lower<00:01:00.910> hose

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
first of all usually put the lower hose

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.850 
first of all usually put the lower hose
on<00:01:01.360> first<00:01:01.660> but<00:01:02.020> we<00:01:02.140> were<00:01:02.260> going<00:01:02.379> to<00:01:02.469> install<00:01:02.710> a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
on first but we were going to install a

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.430 
on first but we were going to install a
brand<00:01:03.160> new<00:01:03.219> hose<00:01:03.550> so<00:01:04.059> pull<00:01:04.629> deal<00:01:04.809> one<00:01:04.989> off

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
brand new hose so pull deal one off

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.320 
brand new hose so pull deal one off
and<00:01:05.530> I<00:01:06.369> recommend<00:01:06.820> if<00:01:07.060> you're<00:01:07.150> going<00:01:07.240> to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
and I recommend if you're going to

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.850 
and I recommend if you're going to
replace<00:01:07.540> your<00:01:07.780> radiator<00:01:08.170> definitely<00:01:08.619> replace

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
replace your radiator definitely replace

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.100 
replace your radiator definitely replace
your<00:01:09.070> lower<00:01:09.250> and<00:01:09.520> upper<00:01:09.729> hoses<00:01:10.150> my<00:01:10.780> upper<00:01:10.990> hose

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
your lower and upper hoses my upper hose

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.749 
your lower and upper hoses my upper hose
is<00:01:11.290> newer<00:01:11.470> so<00:01:11.860> we're<00:01:12.280> going<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.460> leave<00:01:12.580> that

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
is newer so we're going to leave that

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.940 
is newer so we're going to leave that
where<00:01:12.909> it<00:01:12.970> is<00:01:13.409> we're<00:01:14.409> going<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.560> go<00:01:14.680> ahead<00:01:14.740> and

where it is we're going to go ahead and

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.640 
where it is we're going to go ahead and
replace<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.369> lower<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:17.229> what<00:01:17.409> we're<00:01:17.500> going<00:01:17.590> to

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
replace the lower so what we're going to

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.080 
replace the lower so what we're going to
do<00:01:17.740> first<00:01:17.979> is<00:01:18.369> we're<00:01:18.580> going<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.729> go<00:01:18.820> ahead<00:01:18.909> and

do first is we're going to go ahead and

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.780 
do first is we're going to go ahead and
install<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.570> hose<00:01:19.899> where<00:01:20.830> it<00:01:20.920> should<00:01:21.100> be<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.640> as

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
install a hose where it should be and as

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.950 
install a hose where it should be and as
you<00:01:21.940> can<00:01:22.060> see<00:01:22.119> you<00:01:22.390> want<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.600> make<00:01:22.690> sure<00:01:22.810> that

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
you can see you want to make sure that

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.600 
you can see you want to make sure that
when<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.229> reinstall<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:24.040> get<00:01:24.190> that<00:01:24.310> hose

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
when you reinstall and you get that hose

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.200 
when you reinstall and you get that hose
on<00:01:24.640> there<00:01:25.119> is<00:01:25.360> close<00:01:26.320> as<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:26.890> can<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.520> the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
on there is close as you can to the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.650 
on there is close as you can to the
actual<00:01:29.550> radiator<00:01:30.550> so<00:01:31.179> get<00:01:31.330> it<00:01:31.420> on<00:01:31.509> there

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
actual radiator so get it on there

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.870 
actual radiator so get it on there
really<00:01:31.840> good<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.710> then<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:33.190> pull<00:01:33.490> down<00:01:33.520> that

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
really good and then you pull down that

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.270 
really good and then you pull down that
clamp<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.530> lock<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:35.679> right<00:01:35.710> there<00:01:36.039> on<00:01:36.070> the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
clamp and lock it right there on the

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.419 
clamp and lock it right there on the
hose<00:01:36.840> another<00:01:37.840> thing<00:01:38.050> to<00:01:38.140> remember<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.679> these

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
hose another thing to remember is these

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.260 
hose another thing to remember is these
feet<00:01:39.759> go<00:01:40.479> into<00:01:41.020> those<00:01:41.830> holes<00:01:42.280> down<00:01:42.640> there<00:01:42.940> so

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
feet go into those holes down there so

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.660 
feet go into those holes down there so
two<00:01:43.330> one<00:01:43.869> for<00:01:44.050> each<00:01:44.080> foot<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:45.369> radiator

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
two one for each foot and the radiator

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.060 
two one for each foot and the radiator
sits<00:01:46.090> perfectly<00:01:46.390> in<00:01:46.929> there<00:01:47.500> now<00:01:47.800> that<00:01:47.920> we<00:01:47.979> got

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
sits perfectly in there now that we got

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.029 
sits perfectly in there now that we got
that<00:01:48.280> back<00:01:48.399> on<00:01:48.869> radiator<00:01:49.869> is<00:01:50.110> in<00:01:50.409> there<00:01:50.800> good

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
that back on radiator is in there good

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.990 
that back on radiator is in there good
we're<00:01:51.580> going<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.970> put<00:01:52.179> on<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.890> top<00:01:53.890> hose<00:01:54.130> get

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
we're going to put on the top hose get

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.800 
we're going to put on the top hose get
that<00:01:55.179> back<00:01:55.360> in<00:01:55.539> there

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
that back in there

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.870 
that back in there
and<00:01:56.020> then<00:01:57.009> we're<00:01:57.130> going<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.310> hook<00:01:57.369> up<00:01:57.580> the

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
and then we're going to hook up the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.070 
and then we're going to hook up the
bottom<00:01:58.179> hose<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:59.380> can<00:01:59.440> do<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.830> hoses<00:02:00.190> however

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
bottom hose you can do the hoses however

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.480 
bottom hose you can do the hoses however
luckily<00:02:02.080> we<00:02:02.500> aren't<00:02:02.830> doing<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.159> down<00:02:03.280> there

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
luckily we aren't doing it down there

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.800 
luckily we aren't doing it down there
we're<00:02:03.670> actually<00:02:03.820> hooking<00:02:04.180> it<00:02:04.270> up<00:02:04.360> over<00:02:04.509> here

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810
