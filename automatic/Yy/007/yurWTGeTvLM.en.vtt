00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
implication that it was going to be do I

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.199

is<00:02:34.480> really<00:02:35.200> what<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.500> implication<00:02:36.130> was<00:02:36.160> am<00:02:36.580> I

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
is really what the implication was am I
