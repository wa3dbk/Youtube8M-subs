let's<00:00:10.390> look<00:00:10.600> at<00:00:10.750> cleaning<00:00:11.260> a<00:00:11.350> window<00:00:11.680> some<00:00:11.980> of

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
let's look at cleaning a window some of

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.260 
let's look at cleaning a window some of
the<00:00:12.160> basic<00:00:12.640> steps<00:00:12.940> first<00:00:13.930> of<00:00:14.110> all<00:00:15.120> extend<00:00:16.120> the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
the basic steps first of all extend the

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.200 
the basic steps first of all extend the
pole<00:00:16.450> up<00:00:17.250> until<00:00:18.250> it<00:00:18.369> is<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:18.640> correct<00:00:18.970> height

pole up until it is the correct height
for<00:00:19.450> reaching<00:00:19.779> the<00:00:19.869> window<00:00:20.200> then<00:00:21.190> using<00:00:21.640> a

flap starting at the top of the window

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.660 
flap starting at the top of the window
scrub<00:00:29.500> the<00:00:29.529> top<00:00:30.009> edge<00:00:30.279> of<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:31.270> glass<00:00:31.750> and<00:00:32.670> this

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
scrub the top edge of the glass and this

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.790 
scrub the top edge of the glass and this
ensures<00:00:34.150> that<00:00:34.180> it's<00:00:34.510> clean<00:00:34.810> and<00:00:35.440> everything

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
ensures that it's clean and everything

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.740 
ensures that it's clean and everything
that<00:00:35.920> comes<00:00:36.070> down<00:00:36.430> from<00:00:36.700> that<00:00:36.970> will<00:00:37.239> be<00:00:37.360> plated

that comes down from that will be plated

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.290 
that comes down from that will be plated
and<00:00:37.870> then<00:00:38.700> using<00:00:39.700> an<00:00:39.910> up-and-down<00:00:40.390> motion<00:00:42.300> of
