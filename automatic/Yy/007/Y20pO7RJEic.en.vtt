00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.629
 very good to all kids welcome 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.980
 a class my channel and I Kripper 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.690
 we are back in modern warfare 3 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.639
 Today I bring you a new fashion in this 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.740
 case using the ak-47 with 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.330
 mufflers large and good chargers 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.579
 today I wanted to comment on many things 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.290
 between them as an idea that I have in 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.210
 mind and the reason why yesterday did not 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.980
 I went up video as you will notice because I am 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.500
 quite pretty happy the truth to 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.360
 Despite everything I am completely happy 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.520
 right now and well then I like it 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.260
 transmit good feelings 9 mis 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.820
 videos and you feel happy 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.680
 you also put you say 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.570
 a little more than good good mood 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.940
 first the subject by which yesterday I did not go up 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.649
 video I really planned to upload it and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.050
 until the scheduled video but as well 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.899
 You know, a few days ago, 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.579
 I no longer have a partner and the video in theory 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.260
 was going to be a zombie video which already 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.760
 was programmed and when I removed the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.550
 partner the option to program the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.469
 videos disappears and it's something of what it is 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.629
 of what did not fall at the time 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.339
 then the video was scheduled but 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.469
 when I 've taken off on the partner the 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.670
 video was then deprogrammed then that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.499
 is the reason why yesterday not 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.019
 you had videos is something that happened to me 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:05.460
 Host failure did not say I was so 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.450
 quiet studying, I say good 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.969
 I have all afternoon for 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.899
 to do what he wants and well then to 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:14.490
 end of this video I realized already by 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.369
 late-night I said good as it does not happen 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.710
 nothing will go up tomorrow tomorrow we are with 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.729
 the load 27 and tomorrow you will have the zombies 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.729
 so well I hope you can 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.350
 excuse me that little loop failure already 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.360
 normally because if not remove me 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.789
 it's like that for the face and good, well, in this 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.710
 case and you already know a small bug 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.600
 technical good what I meant guys 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.119
 I would like to start with a series to see 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.209

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.250
 I do not know if I could do it live or is 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.869
 a live is a direct I do not know if I can 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.130
 but what I have very clear is 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.439
 that could make a gameplay 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.810
 commented 2.0 answering yours 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.039
 questions or just with my face and 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.959
 Well, I think it would be pretty 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.220
 well not so that you go knowing me already 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.200
 Well, well, these days I do not have 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.729
 absolutely nothing of time and good 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.979
 Well, we can start by saying that 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.599
 this afternoon this afternoon I have a 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.890
 Access test exam quite 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.959
 important and that's why I've been these days 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.100
 absent studying and others and good a 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.569
 couple of little things that have taken me 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.299
 quite a bit more private time 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.639
 it's good maybe later I'll tell you 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.260
 we'll see according to how sportage and good 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.939
 Well, those are the most private things 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.099
 my intimate life and what good some 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.769
 obviously I will not tell them but other 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.030
 Well maybe I'll encourage you and you can 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.859
 know a little more about me and that 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.329
 many will say but what the fuck 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.250

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.200
 gameplays then everyone who does not want 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.090
 see me know or know nothing about me 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.409
 life simply because I do not see the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.359

 I feel good to me right now the 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:50.169
 idea that I have right now is to do something
