00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
comfortable they look authentic but the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.850 
comfortable they look authentic but the
white<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:36.090> looks<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.420> little<00:01:36.570> off<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.530> ear

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
white just looks a little off on the ear

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.160 
white just looks a little off on the ear
piece<00:01:38.070> right<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.270> plastic<00:01:39.929> over

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
piece right here this is plastic over

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.520 
piece right here this is plastic over
here<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.470> rubber<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.750> plastic<00:01:43.319> and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
here it's rubber so this is plastic and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.469 
here it's rubber so this is plastic and
here's<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.149> odd-shaped<00:01:45.170> carrying<00:01:46.170> case<00:01:47.479> so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
here's the odd-shaped carrying case so

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.819 
here's the odd-shaped carrying case so
again<00:01:48.719> if<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:48.990> could<00:01:49.140> see<00:01:49.289> the<00:01:49.439> difference

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
again if you could see the difference

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.130 
again if you could see the difference
between<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.310> white<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.819> this<00:01:50.939> white<00:01:51.149> this

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
between this white and this white this

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.719 
between this white and this white this
is<00:01:52.319> the<00:01:52.439> color<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> plastic<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:53.460> beats

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
is the color of the plastic on the beats

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.279 
is the color of the plastic on the beats
and<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.179> is<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.539> actual<00:01:54.689> color<00:01:55.110> that

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
and this is the actual color that

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:05.740 
and this is the actual color that
reciprocal<00:01:57.979> all<00:01:58.979> right<00:02:02.869> here's<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.929> wires

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
reciprocal all right here's the wires

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.499 
reciprocal all right here's the wires
not<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.989> tangle-free<00:02:07.439> wire<00:02:08.239> just<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.299> regular

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
not the tangle-free wire just a regular

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.440 
not the tangle-free wire just a regular
circle<00:02:10.170> wire<00:02:10.730> whatever<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.230> felt<00:02:13.230> awk<00:02:14.450> comes

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
circle wire whatever I felt awk comes

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.319 
circle wire whatever I felt awk comes
with<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.840> warranty<00:02:16.319> thing<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.370> notice<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.000> no
