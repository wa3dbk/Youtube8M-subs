00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.430
 and hello everyone I find it 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.230
 for a new video that is this 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.000
 this time on a sniper rifle that does not 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.660
 gives that the invaders manufactured by 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.920
 hyperion 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.640
 gold this precision rifle there is also in 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.740
 corrosive electric slide is neutral and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.130
 just down the invaders was 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.360
 in the first borderlands of the name is 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.879
 in fact no no no he had not 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.530
 apply invaders but the executor in 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.300
 done with respect to red texts in 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.429
 actually I think that actually the 1 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.499
 when they coded the game actually had a 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.449
 bug in the codes years after that's all 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:43.859
 what I could see on the wiki to them 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.710
 have been referring to his why he had 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:49.109
 a code bug is simply beats 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.489
 sophie of precision he found himself arrived 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.499
 nexus badlands 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.420
 it is dropped by saturn but hey you 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:56.519
 can also have it in the coffers 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.629
 but you have a greater chance of 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:03.059
 have it from the drop and on saturne and I 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.680
 also advise you to bring weapons 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.080
 corrosive time given that you are and 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.830
 in armor and what I wanted 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.950
 to say other 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.170
 oh yes I wanted to talk to you also about 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.570
 update that takes place on steam Tuesday 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.200
 so by cons I do not know if a 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.670
 update on xbox 360 and ps3 that's 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.070
 just this update is going 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.579
 remove some bugs we had on pc 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.490
 and in fact that they have to patch the 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.539
 amplifier type shields the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.219
 shields that have two types well 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.229
 amplifier we take for example the 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:37.289
 bee in fact they decreased their shots 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.320
 slag actually i had the bee before the 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:43.649
 patch the vÃ©subie at the level 50 years old pulls 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.960
 slag 51000 and after the update I 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.390
 looked at now I in forty 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.939
 thousand years draws that in fact they have 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.499
 also in the update increase the 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.020
 time to reload if I have no 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:55.759
 nonsense they also increased the life of 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.710
 some bosses 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.840
 normally there are three then there are 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.109
 amorphous potting soil 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.759
 willem or a little I find headline 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.050
 years standards when you make fart 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.830
 trains you have to seek an agreement a 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.300
 core and the third is blue actually 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.730
 you are at caustic caves 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.209
 this is the kind of crisis the blue line 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.709
 big crisis blue line is actually 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.269
 according to this update after we 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.610
 learned that they had 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.260
 day actually we were at 3 in fact we 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.590
 was two who were equipped with 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.209
 shield this bi and we were also two to 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.920
 be equipped with conference call and y 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.620
 had a name was level 47 but that's 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.079
 true that normally to a2 normally to 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.739
 2 is one who pays debit conference 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.910
 call 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.849
 even with a third that is low 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.709
 level normally amorphous land does 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.329
 really not long fire balla actually 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.090
 realized that this is 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.560
 really become pitiful we are put I 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.230
