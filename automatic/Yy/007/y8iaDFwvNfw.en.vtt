00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
tell us a little bit more about backyard

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.359 
tell us a little bit more about backyard
brains<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.230> if<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.380> could<00:00:28.590> explain<00:00:29.070> what<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
brains and if you could explain what the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.999 
brains and if you could explain what the
roboroach<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.240> yeah<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.349> goal<00:00:31.800> of

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
roboroach is yeah so the goal of

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.790 
roboroach is yeah so the goal of
backyard<00:00:32.219> brains<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.540> basically<00:00:34.530> bring

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
backyard brains is to basically bring

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.410 
backyard brains is to basically bring
neuroscience<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:36.000> something<00:00:36.329> that

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
neuroscience like something that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.910 
neuroscience like something that
typically<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.930> only<00:00:37.110> done<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.530> graduate

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
typically is only done in graduate

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.190 
typically is only done in graduate
school<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.640> make<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.090> bring<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.629> into<00:00:40.020> like

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
school and make and bring that into like

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.360 
school and make and bring that into like
the<00:00:40.320> high<00:00:40.440> school<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.890> even<00:00:41.040> down<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the high school and even down to the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.850 
the high school and even down to the
fifth<00:00:41.520> grade<00:00:41.610> classroom<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.710> what<00:00:43.710> we're

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
fifth grade classroom and so what we're

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.580 
fifth grade classroom and so what we're
trying<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.670> make<00:00:45.469> experiments<00:00:46.469> that

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
trying to do is make experiments that

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.260 
trying to do is make experiments that
sort<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.100> gradually<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.760> harder<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.210> harder

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
sort of gradually get harder and harder

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.600 
sort of gradually get harder and harder
harder<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.530> by<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.950> time<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.460> you're

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
harder so that by the time that you're

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.100 
harder so that by the time that you're
in<00:00:50.670> high<00:00:50.910> school<00:00:50.940> you're<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.750> be<00:00:51.870> doing

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
in high school you're going to be doing

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.720 
in high school you're going to be doing
experiments<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.890> are<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.219> are<00:00:53.280> currently

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
experiments that are that are currently

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.360 
experiments that are that are currently
even<00:00:54.570> difficult<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.559> neuroscience

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
even difficult to do in a neuroscience

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.369 
even difficult to do in a neuroscience
lab<00:00:56.550> at<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.789> graduate<00:00:57.180> research<00:00:57.210> university<00:00:58.109> so

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
lab at a graduate research university so

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.520 
lab at a graduate research university so
the<00:00:58.649> roboroach<00:00:59.100> is<00:01:00.140> one<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.230> our<00:01:01.350> latest

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the roboroach is one of our latest

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.460 
the roboroach is one of our latest
inventions<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.280> allows<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.470> sort

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
inventions that allows you to do a sort

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.820 
inventions that allows you to do a sort
of<00:01:04.530> neural<00:01:05.430> stimulation<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:07.409> peripheral

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
of neural stimulation of the peripheral

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.250 
of neural stimulation of the peripheral
neurons<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.549> allow<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.869> cockroach<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.080> move

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
neurons to allow the cockroach to move

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.390 
neurons to allow the cockroach to move
in<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> direction<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.100> want<00:01:11.220> them<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
in the direction that you want them to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.580 
in the direction that you want them to
move<00:01:11.580> into<00:01:11.760> Wow<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:12.930> you're<00:01:13.200> doing<00:01:13.320> this

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
move into Wow and so you're doing this

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.800 
move into Wow and so you're doing this
with<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> smartphone<00:01:14.430> right<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.330> how<00:01:15.630> does<00:01:15.689> that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
with a smartphone right so how does that

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.870 
with a smartphone right so how does that
work<00:01:16.259> what<00:01:16.710> do<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.890> push<00:01:17.400> around<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
work what do you push around on the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.760 
work what do you push around on the
smartphone<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.600> make<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.840> move<00:01:18.930> around<00:01:19.229> so

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
smartphone and make it move around so

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.890 
smartphone and make it move around so
when<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.100> pick<00:01:20.640> up<00:01:20.790> your<00:01:20.939> cell<00:01:21.360> phone<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.659> you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
when you pick up your cell phone and you

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.440 
when you pick up your cell phone and you
want<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> cockroach<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.860> move<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.450> right

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
want the cockroach to move to the right

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.539 
want the cockroach to move to the right
for<00:01:24.750> example<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.619> swipe<00:01:25.830> your<00:01:25.950> finger<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
for example you swipe your finger on the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.249 
for example you swipe your finger on the
on<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> cell<00:01:27.060> phones<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.780> want<00:01:28.049> them<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
on the cell phones that you want them to

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.039 
on the cell phones that you want them to
go<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.530> direction<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:29.100> what<00:01:29.220> happens<00:01:29.610> is

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
go in that direction of what happens is

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.050 
go in that direction of what happens is
there<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.770> talks<00:01:32.159> over<00:01:32.340> Bluetooth<00:01:32.820> Low

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
there is a it talks over Bluetooth Low

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.030 
there is a it talks over Bluetooth Low
Energy<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.659> sends<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.049> command<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
Energy and it sends a command to the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.649 
Energy and it sends a command to the
backpack<00:01:35.490> that's<00:01:35.790> sitting<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.180> cockroach

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
backpack that's sitting on the cockroach

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.460 
backpack that's sitting on the cockroach
just<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.829> guy<00:01:38.009> right<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:39.470> this

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
just like this guy right here and this

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.840 
just like this guy right here and this
guy<00:01:40.619> interprets<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.159> signal<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.729> says

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
guy interprets that signal and says

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.700 
guy interprets that signal and says
alright<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.299> want<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.689> go<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.110> right<00:01:43.290> so

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
alright you want to go to the right so

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.469 
alright you want to go to the right so
what<00:01:43.860> he's<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.130> do<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> send<00:01:45.180> a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
what he's going to do is going to send a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.469 
what he's going to do is going to send a
pulse<00:01:46.380> into<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.009> left<00:01:47.250> hand<00:01:47.490> left<00:01:47.970> antenna

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
pulse into the left hand left antenna

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.870 
pulse into the left hand left antenna
and<00:01:49.070> there's<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.159> current<00:01:50.549> that's<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:50.729> to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
and there's a current that's going to

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.969 
and there's a current that's going to
pass<00:01:51.060> between<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.659> left<00:01:51.869> antenna<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.890> it's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
pass between the left antenna and it's

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.380 
pass between the left antenna and it's
going<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.159> go<00:01:53.220> back<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> ground<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
going to go back to the ground and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.660 
going to go back to the ground and
that's<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.780> allow<00:01:54.960> us<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.280> cause<00:01:56.280> those

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
that's going to allow us to cause those

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.429 
that's going to allow us to cause those
neurons<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.390> fire<00:01:57.600> all<00:01:57.990> right<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.290> you're

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
neurons to fire all right so you're

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.679 
neurons to fire all right so you're
firing<00:01:58.799> neurons<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.610> cockroaches<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.390> get

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
firing neurons and cockroaches I get

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.420 
firing neurons and cockroaches I get
that<00:02:00.869> part<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:01.469> how<00:02:01.860> does<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.100> actually

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
that part but how does that actually

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.700 
that part but how does that actually
make<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> cockroach<00:02:03.060> move<00:02:03.450> that's<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.290> step<00:02:04.500> back

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
make a cockroach move that's a step back

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.230 
make a cockroach move that's a step back
one<00:02:04.950> more<00:02:05.100> time<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.579> explain<00:02:05.909> what<00:02:06.210> a

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
one more time and explain what a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.930 
one more time and explain what a
cockroach<00:02:06.689> does<00:02:07.369> naturally<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.759> get

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
cockroach does naturally I can get

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.089 
cockroach does naturally I can get
natural<00:02:09.179> behavior<00:02:09.690> cockroach<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:10.920> he

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
natural behavior cockroach and so he

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.309 
natural behavior cockroach and so he
does<00:02:11.310> um<00:02:11.750> turning<00:02:12.750> bass

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
does um turning bass

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.979 
does um turning bass
with<00:02:13.650> antennas<00:02:14.129> so<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.549> uses<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.030> antennas<00:02:15.480> to

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
with antennas so it uses the antennas to

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.640 
with antennas so it uses the antennas to
sort<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.230> navigate<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.739> world<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:18.560> one<00:02:19.560> of

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
sort of navigate the world and one of

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.720 
sort of navigate the world and one of
the<00:02:19.709> things<00:02:19.859> it<00:02:19.950> does<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.250> when<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.519> touches

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the things it does is when it touches

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.190 
the things it does is when it touches
something<00:02:20.909> it<00:02:21.390> wants<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.719> turn<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.109> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
something it wants to turn in the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.500 
something it wants to turn in the
opposite<00:02:22.560> direction<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.579> what<00:02:24.359> we're

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
opposite direction and so what we're

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.599 
opposite direction and so what we're
doing<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.900> we're<00:02:25.049> sort<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.260> like<00:02:25.609> simulating

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
doing is we're sort of like simulating

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.030 
doing is we're sort of like simulating
as<00:02:26.819> if<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.359> was<00:02:27.569> touching<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.290> wall<00:02:28.469> so<00:02:28.890> when

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
as if it was touching the wall so when

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.979 
as if it was touching the wall so when
these<00:02:29.129> neurons<00:02:29.549> fire<00:02:29.790> like<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.480> neurons

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
these neurons fire like the neurons

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.690 
these neurons fire like the neurons
don't<00:02:31.170> know<00:02:31.379> if<00:02:31.709> it's<00:02:31.980> firing<00:02:32.220> because<00:02:32.549> it's

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
don't know if it's firing because it's

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.069 
don't know if it's firing because it's
touching<00:02:32.879> something<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.299> a<00:02:33.390> swine<00:02:33.599> because<00:02:33.780> of

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
touching something of a swine because of

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.509 
touching something of a swine because of
those<00:02:34.290> electrical<00:02:34.769> current<00:02:35.129> that's<00:02:35.310> causing

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
those electrical current that's causing

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.910 
those electrical current that's causing
it<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.849> fire<00:02:36.030> right<00:02:36.329> so<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.049> brain<00:02:37.290> receives<00:02:37.680> a

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
it to fire right so the brain receives a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.679 
it to fire right so the brain receives a
signal<00:02:38.159> and<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.849> thinks<00:02:39.180> there's<00:02:39.389> something

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
signal and it thinks there's something

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.599 
signal and it thinks there's something
there<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:39.930> it's<00:02:40.139> going<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.319> turn<00:02:40.530> because<00:02:41.489> of

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
there and it's going to turn because of

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.030 
there and it's going to turn because of
all<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.239> you're<00:02:42.389> manipulating<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.349> brains<00:02:43.739> of

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
all so you're manipulating the brains of

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.309 
all so you're manipulating the brains of
cockroaches<00:02:44.579> that's<00:02:45.389> pretty<00:02:45.659> cool

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
cockroaches that's pretty cool

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.140 
cockroaches that's pretty cool
what<00:02:46.950> kind<00:02:47.129> of<00:02:47.250> discoveries<00:02:47.760> are<00:02:47.909> you<00:02:47.970> guys

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
what kind of discoveries are you guys

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.119 
what kind of discoveries are you guys
making<00:02:48.420> doing<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.170> one<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.859> things<00:02:50.040> I

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
making doing this one of the things I

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.270 
making doing this one of the things I
will<00:02:50.189> tell<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.810> from<00:02:51.810> when<00:02:52.500> we<00:02:52.650> ship<00:02:53.099> these

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
will tell you from when we ship these

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.129 
will tell you from when we ship these
out<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.609> high<00:02:53.730> school<00:02:54.000> kids<00:02:54.269> there<00:02:55.019> was<00:02:55.109> a

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
out to high school kids there was a

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.929 
out to high school kids there was a
group<00:02:55.349> in<00:02:55.530> New<00:02:55.560> York<00:02:55.889> City<00:02:56.129> that<00:02:56.430> found<00:02:56.790> out

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
group in New York City that found out

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.970 
group in New York City that found out
last<00:02:57.209> summer<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:58.230> if<00:02:58.409> they<00:02:58.500> put<00:02:58.709> in<00:02:58.829> their

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
last summer that if they put in their

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.909 
last summer that if they put in their
iPods<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.790> just<00:03:00.480> play<00:03:00.689> the<00:03:01.200> current<00:03:01.620> from<00:03:01.799> an

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
iPods and just play the current from an

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.979 
iPods and just play the current from an
iPod<00:03:02.220> they<00:03:02.939> could<00:03:03.120> get<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.359> cockroaches<00:03:03.870> to

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
iPod they could get the cockroaches to

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.629 
iPod they could get the cockroaches to
turn<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.530> they<00:03:04.590> wouldn't<00:03:04.889> adapt<00:03:05.189> as<00:03:05.370> quickly

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
turn and they wouldn't adapt as quickly

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.520 
turn and they wouldn't adapt as quickly
as<00:03:06.000> they<00:03:06.299> were<00:03:06.359> doing<00:03:06.689> with<00:03:06.810> our<00:03:06.930> stuff<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.409> so

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
as they were doing with our stuff and so

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.039 
as they were doing with our stuff and so
that<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:08.639> made<00:03:08.819> us<00:03:08.939> think<00:03:09.150> like<00:03:09.269> you<00:03:10.019> know

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
that that made us think like you know

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.140 
that that made us think like you know
they're<00:03:10.650> on<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:10.919> something<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.310> mean<00:03:11.459> if<00:03:11.730> you

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
they're on to something I mean if you

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.970 
they're on to something I mean if you
randomized<00:03:12.689> the<00:03:12.959> stimuli<00:03:13.349> maybe<00:03:13.739> that's

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
randomized the stimuli maybe that's

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.470 
randomized the stimuli maybe that's
what's<00:03:14.220> causing<00:03:14.459> then<00:03:14.790> maybe<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.120> brain

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
what's causing then maybe the brain

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.780 
what's causing then maybe the brain
adapts<00:03:15.780> quicker<00:03:16.079> to<00:03:16.349> like<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> constant<00:03:17.400> you

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
adapts quicker to like a constant you

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.020 
adapts quicker to like a constant you
know<00:03:17.819> frequency<00:03:18.359> of<00:03:18.479> a<00:03:18.900> tone<00:03:19.109> so<00:03:19.819> that<00:03:20.819> really

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
know frequency of a tone so that really

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.199 
know frequency of a tone so that really
pushed<00:03:21.359> us<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:22.079> go<00:03:22.799> into<00:03:22.979> the<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.489> Bluetooth

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
pushed us to go into the the Bluetooth

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.420 
pushed us to go into the the Bluetooth
option<00:03:24.810> because<00:03:24.959> now<00:03:25.169> we<00:03:25.949> have<00:03:26.040> an<00:03:26.129> option

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
option because now we have an option

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.069 
option because now we have an option
that<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.609> can<00:03:26.729> turn<00:03:26.970> on<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:27.299> randomization

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
that you can turn on this randomization

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.990 
that you can turn on this randomization

mode which which is not a standard
frequency<00:03:30.510> but<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:31.079> a<00:03:31.139> range<00:03:31.440> of

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
frequency but it's a range of

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.069 
frequency but it's a range of
frequencies<00:03:32.159> which<00:03:32.750> we're<00:03:33.750> hoping<00:03:34.019> to

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
frequencies which we're hoping to

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.990 
frequencies which we're hoping to
discover<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.859> you<00:03:35.040> can<00:03:35.190> actually<00:03:35.370> maybe

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
discover that you can actually maybe

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.360

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
maybe launch the next version of what we

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.819 
maybe launch the next version of what we
call<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.479> neuro<00:04:06.689> revolutions<00:04:07.290> like<00:04:07.349> just

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
call the neuro revolutions like just

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.099 
call the neuro revolutions like just
like<00:04:07.919> in<00:04:08.099> the<00:04:08.340> in<00:04:08.639> the<00:04:08.939> 1970s<00:04:09.689> you<00:04:09.720> could<00:04:09.930> buy<00:04:10.079> a

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
like in the in the 1970s you could buy a

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.080 
like in the in the 1970s you could buy a
computer<00:04:10.650> right<00:04:11.040> but<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:11.459> would<00:04:11.579> cost<00:04:11.790> you

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
computer right but it would cost you

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.999 
computer right but it would cost you
lots<00:04:12.479> of<00:04:12.629> money<00:04:12.689> to<00:04:13.049> do<00:04:13.169> that<00:04:13.349> it's<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.769> same

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:14.009 
lots of money to do that it's the same

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:16.729 
lots of money to do that it's the same
for<00:04:14.340> neuroscience<00:04:14.909> right<00:04:15.060> now<00:04:15.239> and<00:04:16.109> so<00:04:16.380> I'm

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
for neuroscience right now and so I'm

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.069 
for neuroscience right now and so I'm
hoping<00:04:16.979> it<00:04:17.310> with<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:17.579> this<00:04:18.269> DIY<00:04:18.810> bio

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
hoping it with this this DIY bio

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.629 
hoping it with this this DIY bio
revolution<00:04:19.769> in<00:04:19.889> it<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.400> neuro

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
revolution in it and the neuro

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.039

revolution<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.239> we're<00:04:21.389> trying<00:04:21.539> to<00:04:21.659> push<00:04:21.840> is

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
revolution that we're trying to push is

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.990 
revolution that we're trying to push is
that<00:04:22.229> if<00:04:22.650> we<00:04:22.770> make<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.070> tools<00:04:23.460> and

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
that if we make the tools and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.850 
that if we make the tools and
technologies<00:04:24.659> cheap<00:04:24.930> enough<00:04:25.229> that<00:04:25.620> you<00:04:25.740> can

get them from the hand
some<00:04:26.669> amateurs<00:04:27.120> we<00:04:27.659> can<00:04:27.780> start<00:04:28.020> pushing<00:04:28.470> that

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500
