00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
independently of my cursor so that way I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.650

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.570 
then say I could whip out a bow and
arrow<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.970> shoot<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.510> mobs<00:02:22.099> separate<00:02:23.099> from<00:02:23.430> me
