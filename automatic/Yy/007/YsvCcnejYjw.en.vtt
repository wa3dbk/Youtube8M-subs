 knife today I present you a 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.019
 hot heart brand model the leak 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.240
 I will try to make a small 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.469
 video really has it very very short for 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.450
 present you this model I will not 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.859
 you do some cutting tests that's 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.869
 really for you to introduce it if you 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.220
 feel free to buy it if you just want 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.720
 to know him a little more in detail 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.090
 this chorus show logic I find that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.490
 it's an excellent knife not very very 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.130
 dear it is one of the flagship models of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.520
 shaker hot so that's small 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.170
 presentation main use of 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.350
 this knife is going to be an ed his knives 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.180
 of town very thin pocket knife very 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.980
 lightweight very practical to use small 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.840
 pinball opening semi assisted this is 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.040
 really it's really very well done 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.390
 gold I just wanted to bring a 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.430
 precision I say every time when we 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.260
 see medini at the tests must not be 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.460
 to deceive it does not 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.780
 they are entitled to marked made in us and 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.059
 because these united states assemblies 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.870
 the materials they come from elsewhere 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.520
 China I imagine 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.989
 these united states assemblies so they 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.340
 have the right to mark made in us must not 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.620
 to be wrong one is not a knife all 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.030
 is made in the united states it's a 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.979
 guarantee of quality even if they are 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.680
 assembled we agree so length 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.080
 closed on this knife its 10.5 cm 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.200
 length of the blade 8 cm and the edge 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.110
 7.1 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.810
 I compare it with other models well 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.799
 known to hot shaker the skyline so 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.180
 we go right away with the mans 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.729
 change 10 the skyline it does it anyway 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.060
 a little more tactical than the heart 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.189
 hot 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.020
 lee who is a little more gentleman 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.549
 folder it contributes to the elegance of the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.950
 knife puts it next to you salvo who 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.360
 is for me the big brother of leak a 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.430
 little bigger still heavier and a 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.380
 little wider more or less the same 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.290
 same blade shape steel used on 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.460
 these three knives 14 and 28 n steel of 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.310
 good quality it's me okay we're going 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.170
 say for fun I put it to you next 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.189
 the delicate 4g still not done 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.869
 happy sight on the delicate four 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.219
 kittens a bit since this is a 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.149
 knife that is well known to all for 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.670
 very good reasons it's a 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.780
 excellent excellent and test by 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.759
 against there are tons and tons of 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.950
 videos on the internet so you're fine 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.820
 there are tons too on the leak but 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.500
 I start with the leak 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.730
 so that gives you an idea of ​​the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.530
 size weight on the links and 90 g 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:18.690
 the acid used as I said 14 and 28 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.239
 n drawn by ken onion shape of blades 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.470
 quite special as we are used to 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.629
 with the omnium he always makes 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.790
 forms a little bit unusual it's 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.640
 almost flat you just have a whole 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.280
 little bit immediately had belie here 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.930
 curvature but really very very very 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:41.150
 very slight peculiarity on this blade 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.160
 it's the hyper hyper fine point then 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.519
 it has advantages and this to a big 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.239
 disadvantage it is very fragile 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.550
 for sure if you drop it 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.680
 on the low point she breaks that it's 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.440
 sure it's going to be super convenient 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.269
 for death task and open boxes 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.690
 open from the package cut through the 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:04.140
 scotch cut through cellophane 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.940
 see it that it fits very well 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.060
 it's really big 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.120
 the particularity of this blade its strength 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.860
 and its weaknesses 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.330
 a little bit of jingping on the top 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.659
 but it is anecdotal not do much 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.610
 thing 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:24.800
 the two stable women act as 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:27.020
 this top spin here is it blocks 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.950
 I was talking about opening semi opening 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.720
 therefore assisted pinball small 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.640
 pinball but it's not embarrassing since if 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.100
 the semi opening assist a little bit 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.250
 pressure on it and the blade comes out 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.390
 closing a hand quite possible 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.560
 it's always interesting for the 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.660
 death of being able to do so but of a 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.040
 hand 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.560
 opening we managed it every time 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.880
 a thanks to the assisted opening there is a 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.930
 hard there is a spring but that is not 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.230
 very very hard so we arrive you see 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.330
 easily she closes and with one hand 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.940
 it's really very well I 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.470
 beat my knowledge it's pretty solid 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.440
 there are people who have a lot of fun 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.800
 with and it never breaks so really 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.720
 have no problem 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.010
 it's a little extra for this knife 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.270
 these practices or a charter and approach 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.940
 stock you 're just cut something 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.940
 we close it just as well and 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.380
 so disappears a little reproach that I 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.670
 I'm going to do it's the pocket clip it's 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.470
 simply huge 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.350
 so he was delivered types of weapons 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.540
 point down I do not like so 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.860
 I swap it here you do not have 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.770
 a lot of knife coming out of the pocket 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.680
 so does he put you pocket clip with the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.050
 point down against there I'm going 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.300
 show you with the paper the knife 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.710
 there is a lot of knife coming out of 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.640
 the pocket really big blame 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.250
 watch everything that comes out 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.040
 it really is not really discreet 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.250
 poké type he is huge 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.410
 it's a pity it's a pity a hole for 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.090
 pass the cord 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.380
 that's security as if a 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.669
 opening began insistence and never 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.350
 in the pole if it opens 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:05.330
 it can do damage so there you 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:08.870
 block here that just block the tip 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.169
 do not see there and there it opens and pu 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.910
 so that's not bad little security good 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.810
 I do not put it often but that's it 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.610
 wants to be sure they do not open on 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.140
 can put security that is everything 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.380
 simple all stupid but it's very 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.380
 effective 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:32.430
 centering the blade it's perfect it's 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.850
 a frame block like on the bastard 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:39.310
 so small frame block 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:43.570
 he closed his rates by 50% 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:46.000
 it's pretty easy to use really 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:49.120
 only quality on this knife 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.550
 nothing to say that's it if the form 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.130
 please the opening is assisted 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.970
 the shape of the blade the steel grip 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:59.200
 hyper hyper end hyper hyper fine 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.850
 will put next to the delicate four 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.630
 to show you his finer than a 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:09.370
 tricky then see that this disadvantage 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.110
 in the pocket it disappears it's s is 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.940
 so it can be a little bit more 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.650
 more necessarily slippery than a 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.000
 handle indeed reindeer it's a little 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.990
 more slippery but after that for a 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.590
 everyday knife a little 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.140
 town knife 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.140
 it's not fear that's fairly quiet his 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.520
 fineness 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.530
 it's elegant me I'm going to finish on 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.210
 a big rebuke I always keep 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.290
 better for the end then I am 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.430
 a quick tap to show you 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.410
 I try to get closer to home 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.970
 passion is going to see his so-called 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.260
 stainless steel to the handle then 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.470
 look a little at all these points 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:47.950
 has moved from one spot rusting 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:49.630
 also here but it's a shame 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.210
 knife I always pass wd 40 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.919
 above before putting them away 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.620
 this one I very very little used I 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:07:00.790
 take the salvo instead to go out and 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:03.580
 sailboats here are rust stains on 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.330
 one on a stainless steel it's 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:11.130
 amazing and it's a shame 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:13.900
 when knife at level 60 3 euros 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:16.810
 apart from this little worry it's worth 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.250
 largely it starts to not be given 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.340
 now you have a quality steel 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.780
 semi-assisted opening is solid 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.950
 I will not talk about the game but there is 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.300
 really zero game for an opening 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:29.440
 assisted is quite rare for the 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:31.120
 specify to frolics 0 lateral 0 that's it 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.610
 it's not bad it's elegant these little ones 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.740
 games 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.780
 if the shape of the blade you like the 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.680
 shape of the general knife you can there 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.449
 go with your eyes closed 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:42.379
 it exists in full of colors 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:44.870
 different in black back in pink 

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:46.189
 you have the rainbow too which is 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.240
 a blade of all colors finally 

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:50.689
 I do not like it that's my taste 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.699
 perso that's with these rations without 

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:54.319
 these rations of the blades ans tournament auch 

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:55.789
 finally here is full full of 

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:59.060
 models and different declinations 

00:07:55.789 --> 00:08:00.789
 on this hyper popular shaker knife
