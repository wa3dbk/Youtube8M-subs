 from 4 or 5 years to an older person 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.530
 that I 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:34.579
 Well, I had today as a partner 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:38.510
 and as a student people of 60 years and 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:41.060
 even older and there is no problem 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.329
 and also even Japanese that the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.010
 Japanese hallucinates with cante 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.260
 flamenco in general and it seems 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.780
 amazing a Japanese with another language to 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.040
 another country another culture come to sing 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.040
 flamenco too 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.150
 go 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.150
 gaby is fine 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.660
 of the carnation 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.890
 the middle 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.350
 Y 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.980
 and academic 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.280
 and my case was something 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.209
 an internal and external call was the 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.069
 two things I 've always liked 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.250
 a lot of singing I always been singing 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.290
 and there were people who knew me and told me 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.299
 you are always singing and then I 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.939
 I said you never sing and no no I do not sing 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.819
 and that's because I already felt that I had a 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:04.720
 special connection with music 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.150
 with the singing and it was coming to me I was 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.590
 arriving first then what in general 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.230
 it reaches the whole world 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.969

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.579

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.680
 Antonio Mairena adds the combs Manuel 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.130
 tower and the cante was entering me 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.130
 same as me 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.940
 good 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.530

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:57.490
 or 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.490
 and what I want 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.800
 for you as a student I throw myself three years 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.190
 with a 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.590
 great cantaora esperanza fernÃ¡ndez 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.710
 I've also had Paco as a teacher 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.830
 taranto and another great cantaora who 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.700
 llama sonia miranda and I've done my 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.770
 pinitos with hope fernandez made me 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.510
 gave the possibility of a scholarship with 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.400
 her in the Lope de Vega after 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.990
 been in england all my 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.930
 performances has been have been more in the 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.330
 foreigner in england in germany 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.400
 is also a little bit for japan and 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.710
 Well now it has reached here to me 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:41.620
 town because I feel it is a land 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:45.350
 very flamenco and that there is nobody 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.490
 have the door open to teach a 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.490
 little sing 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.980
 but 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.980
 to 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.349
 look 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:12.940
 It is an experience that you always is 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:15.310
 contributing are you teaching but 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.130
 they also teach you all the people who 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.380
 comes to you and the truth is that it is a 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.110
 super nice experience and I trust 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.480
 who is going to call because it's worth it 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.550
 know flamenco here we have a 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.590
 piece of teacher with the guitar that 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.270
 melchor then down at school 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.160
 there is also a dancer who teaches 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.590
 dance but in the cante it seems that 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.410
 there was always more reservation and I bet 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:42.070
 because the cante has a teacher 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:45.570
 also a support and good for me is a 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.570
 Super big satisfaction
