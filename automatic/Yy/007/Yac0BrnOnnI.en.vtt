different<00:00:11.190> things<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:12.179> think<00:00:12.210> it's

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
different things and I think it's

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.400 
different things and I think it's
something<00:00:12.719> it's<00:00:12.870> definitely<00:00:13.259> worth

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
something it's definitely worth

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.629 
something it's definitely worth
recording<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:13.980> obviously<00:00:14.219> if<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.460> found

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
recording and obviously if you found

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.129 
recording and obviously if you found
this<00:00:14.759> video<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.179> probably<00:00:15.210> searched<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:16.020> up

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
this video you probably searched it up

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.080 
this video you probably searched it up
so<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.619> figured<00:00:16.920> I'd<00:00:17.100> explain<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.820> right

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
now let's go so basically should call

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.260 
now let's go so basically should call
any<00:00:20.100> other<00:00:20.189> console<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:20.850> actually<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> pretty

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
any other console it's actually a pretty

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.820 
any other console it's actually a pretty
simple<00:00:21.600> concept<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.230> I'm<00:00:22.289> H<00:00:22.380> gonna<00:00:22.619> explain

don't mind taking up the extra space at
HTTP<00:01:09.060> or<00:01:09.210> -<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.869> pretty<00:01:10.110> small<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.409> it's

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
HTTP or - it's pretty small and it's

and so fine if you want to record an

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.450 
and so fine if you want to record an
extra<00:01:16.049> C<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.740> simple<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.250> plug

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
extra C it's that simple you plug

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.190 
extra C it's that simple you plug
everything<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:17.939> boom<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.479> works<00:01:18.689> however

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
everything in and boom it works however

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.020 
everything in and boom it works however
if<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.560> want<00:01:19.680> record<00:01:19.950> ps3<00:01:20.490> will<00:01:20.700> cover<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
if you want record ps3 will cover that

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.899 
if you want record ps3 will cover that
first<00:01:21.470> on<00:01:22.470> both<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> ps3<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> ps4

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
first on both the ps3 and the ps4

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.990 
first on both the ps3 and the ps4
right<00:01:24.090> now<00:01:24.299> there<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.659> HDCP<00:01:25.530> HDCP<00:01:26.520> basically

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
right now there is HDCP HDCP basically

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.730 
right now there is HDCP HDCP basically
stops<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.390> from<00:01:27.420> recording<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.320> they

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
stops you from recording it because they

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.980 
stops you from recording it because they
fear<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.520> people<00:01:29.850> use<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.270> blu-ray<00:01:30.420> but

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
fear that people use it for blu-ray but

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.719 
fear that people use it for blu-ray but
it's<00:01:31.170> unfortunate<00:01:31.619> turn<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.920> all<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.250> time<00:01:32.430> so

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it's unfortunate turn on all the time so

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.880 
it's unfortunate turn on all the time so
basically<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.210> circumvent<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
basically you have to circumvent it and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.319 
basically you have to circumvent it and
on<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> ps3<00:01:35.460> that's<00:01:35.729> pretty<00:01:35.909> simple<00:01:36.240> because

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
on the ps3 that's pretty simple because

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.480 
on the ps3 that's pretty simple because
it<00:01:36.570> accepts<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> component<00:01:37.619> output<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.280> just

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
it accepts a component output you just

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.890 
it accepts a component output you just
plug<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> component<00:01:39.180> cables<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.720> and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
plug the component cables in and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.749 
plug the component cables in and
basically<00:01:40.500> these<00:01:40.829> cost<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.250> maybe<00:01:41.400> five

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
basically these cost you maybe five

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.340 
basically these cost you maybe five
dollars<00:01:42.090> four<00:01:42.420> pounds<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:42.810> whatever<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.110> eBay

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
dollars four pounds or whatever on eBay

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.980 
dollars four pounds or whatever on eBay
and<00:01:43.530> sorry<00:01:44.490> Amazon<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.090> basically<00:01:45.600> they<00:01:45.930> will

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
and sorry Amazon and basically they will

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.569 
and sorry Amazon and basically they will
just<00:01:46.259> magically<00:01:46.799> make<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.130> whole<00:01:47.280> thing<00:01:47.310> work

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
just magically make the whole thing work

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.780 
just magically make the whole thing work
and<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.740> need<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> converter<00:01:50.310> box<00:01:50.430> turn

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
and you just need a converter box turn

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.520 
and you just need a converter box turn
that<00:01:50.880> back<00:01:51.030> into<00:01:51.060> HDMI<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.810> then<00:01:52.320> boom

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
that back into HDMI and then boom

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.200 
that back into HDMI and then boom
there's<00:01:52.770> no<00:01:52.860> more<00:01:53.009> HDCP<00:01:53.579> because<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.000> can't

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
there's no more HDCP because you can't

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.450 
there's no more HDCP because you can't
put<00:01:54.360> HDCP<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.110> an<00:01:55.200> analog<00:01:55.439> signal<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:56.340> that

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
put HDCP on an analog signal if that

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.770 
put HDCP on an analog signal if that
doesn't<00:01:56.640> make<00:01:56.700> any<00:01:56.790> sense<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:57.570> fit

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
doesn't make any sense to you think fit

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.800 
doesn't make any sense to you think fit
like<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.729> analog<00:01:59.969> signal<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
like the the analog signal is just the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.539 
like the the analog signal is just the
signal<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> HDMI<00:02:01.680> signal<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.520> signal

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
signal the HDMI signal is the signal

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.429 
signal the HDMI signal is the signal
with<00:02:03.210> lots<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.509> extra<00:02:03.780> information<00:02:03.869> about<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
with lots of extra information about the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.499 
with lots of extra information about the
signal<00:02:04.770> plus<00:02:04.950> power<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.310> stuff<00:02:05.460> CA<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.299> just

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
signal plus power and stuff CA you just

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.999 
signal plus power and stuff CA you just
need<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.659> convert<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.320> power<00:02:07.530> box<00:02:07.829> it

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
need to convert that in a power box it

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.100 
need to convert that in a power box it
will<00:02:08.069> cost<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.399> about<00:02:08.489> $50<00:02:09.420> or<00:02:09.629> 40<00:02:09.869> pounds

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
will cost you about $50 or 40 pounds

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.869 
will cost you about $50 or 40 pounds
less<00:02:10.259> power<00:02:10.410> box<00:02:10.679> let's<00:02:11.340> definitely<00:02:11.520> worth

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
less power box let's definitely worth

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.340 
less power box let's definitely worth
paying<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.300> money<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.840> want

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
you can get the optimal quality without

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.790 
you can get the optimal quality without
having<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.480> do<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.960> know<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.290> extra

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
splitter and converter stuff and it's

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.240 
splitter and converter stuff and it's
definitely<00:02:28.140> worth<00:02:28.320> in<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> long<00:02:28.830> run<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.130> my

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
definitely worth in the long run in my

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.400 
definitely worth in the long run in my
opinion<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:29.910> next<00:02:30.240> up<00:02:30.630> how<00:02:30.870> do<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.020> record<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
opinion so next up how do you record the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.410 
opinion so next up how do you record the
Pierce<00:02:31.590> pool<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.610> slightly<00:02:32.850> more<00:02:33.000> shady

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
Pierce pool this is slightly more shady

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.870 
Pierce pool this is slightly more shady
because<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:34.350> can<00:02:34.680> be<00:02:34.830> considered<00:02:35.190> lis<00:02:35.430> illegal

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
because it can be considered lis illegal

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.820 
because it can be considered lis illegal
to<00:02:36.030> strip<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.360> singing<00:02:36.600> on<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.720> ps4<00:02:37.080> right<00:02:37.590> now

to strip the singing on a ps4 right now
so<00:02:38.400> if<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:38.610> really<00:02:39.180> are<00:02:39.300> careful<00:02:39.900> about<00:02:39.990> those

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
so if you really are careful about those

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.350 
so if you really are careful about those

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.210 
clips or flaws and you don't believe in
any<00:02:42.510> form<00:02:43.020> of<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.350> know<00:02:43.440> hard<00:02:43.770> floor<00:02:44.010> breaking

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
any form of you know hard floor breaking

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.860 
any form of you know hard floor breaking
then<00:02:44.730> obviously<00:02:44.940> that's<00:02:45.300> what<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.660> need<00:02:45.780> to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
then obviously that's what you need to

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.240 
then obviously that's what you need to
do<00:02:45.990> but<00:02:46.530> tech<00:02:46.650> me<00:02:46.800> because<00:02:46.980> you're<00:02:47.100> not

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
do but tech me because you're not

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.800 
do but tech me because you're not
recording<00:02:47.460> movies<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.030> okay<00:02:48.480> what<00:02:48.720> you

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
recording movies this is okay what you

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.630 
recording movies this is okay what you
need<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:49.080> do<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.590> need<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.770> get<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.010> HDMI

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
need to do is you need to get a HDMI

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.460 
need to do is you need to get a HDMI
stripper<00:02:51.000> or<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.240> splitter<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:52.230> splitter

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
stripper or a splitter the splitter

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.960 
stripper or a splitter the splitter
makes<00:02:52.680> more<00:02:52.830> sense<00:02:53.100> because<00:02:53.220> it's<00:02:53.490> not<00:02:53.730> just

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
makes more sense because it's not just

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.180 
makes more sense because it's not just
directly<00:02:54.390> circumventing<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:56.010> some

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
directly circumventing it the some

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.680 
directly circumventing it the some
splitter<00:02:56.460> is<00:02:56.550> basically<00:02:56.880> what<00:02:57.090> they'll<00:02:57.210> do<00:02:57.390> is

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
splitter is basically what they'll do is

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.240 
splitter is basically what they'll do is
though<00:02:57.960> they<00:02:58.320> won't<00:02:58.530> actually<00:02:58.740> properly

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
though they won't actually properly

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.890 
though they won't actually properly
split<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.730> they'll<00:02:59.910> just<00:02:59.940> display<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.630> same

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
split it they'll just display the same

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.690 
split it they'll just display the same
signal<00:03:01.230> twice<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:02.010> means<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.460> it<00:03:02.580> won't

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
signal twice this means that it won't

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.280 
signal twice this means that it won't
detect<00:03:03.030> it's<00:03:03.300> plugged<00:03:03.510> into<00:03:03.660> two<00:03:03.870> things<00:03:04.050> it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
detect it's plugged into two things it

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.330 
detect it's plugged into two things it
will<00:03:04.380> just<00:03:04.470> think<00:03:04.650> it's<00:03:04.770> plugged<00:03:04.890> into<00:03:05.100> one

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
will just think it's plugged into one

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.100 
will just think it's plugged into one
thing<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.790> one<00:03:06.240> of<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.450> outputs<00:03:06.780> can<00:03:06.930> go<00:03:07.020> to

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
thing and one of the outputs can go to

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.080 
thing and one of the outputs can go to
your<00:03:07.260> TV<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.740> one<00:03:08.040> can<00:03:08.280> go<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.640> caps<00:03:08.820> guard

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
your TV and one can go to the caps guard

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.240 
your TV and one can go to the caps guard
so<00:03:09.750> yeah<00:03:09.870> that's<00:03:10.080> why<00:03:10.260> split<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.650> useful<00:03:11.040> and

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
so yeah that's why split is useful and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.850 
so yeah that's why split is useful and
these<00:03:11.550> will<00:03:11.700> cost<00:03:11.850> you<00:03:12.120> about<00:03:13.050> twenty<00:03:13.650> thirty

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
these will cost you about twenty thirty

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.530 
these will cost you about twenty thirty
dollars<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.520> can't<00:03:14.730> give<00:03:14.820> an<00:03:14.910> exact<00:03:15.150> price<00:03:15.270> but

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
dollars I can't give an exact price but

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.690 
dollars I can't give an exact price but
the<00:03:15.600> description<00:03:16.020> can<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.470> basically<00:03:17.220> these

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
the description can and basically these

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.430 
the description can and basically these
will<00:03:18.090> just<00:03:18.330> make<00:03:18.870> your<00:03:18.990> whole<00:03:19.230> setup

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
will just make your whole setup

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.470 
will just make your whole setup
magically<00:03:19.950> work<00:03:20.100> I'll<00:03:20.760> get<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.000> list<00:03:21.270> of<00:03:21.390> them

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
magically work I'll get a list of them

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.610 
magically work I'll get a list of them
in<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.750> description<00:03:22.110> if<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.380> want<00:03:22.560> to

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
in the description if you want to

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.560 
in the description if you want to
segment<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:23.190> but<00:03:23.340> that's<00:03:23.490> how<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.700> called<00:03:24.030> ps4

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
segment it but that's how you called ps4

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.220 
segment it but that's how you called ps4
you<00:03:25.020> need<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.350> get<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.530> splitter<00:03:25.920> or<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.730> stripper

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
you need to get a splitter or a stripper

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.530 
you need to get a splitter or a stripper
because<00:03:28.770> right<00:03:28.950> now<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.190> cannot<00:03:29.790> like<00:03:30.210> as<00:03:30.360> you

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
because right now you cannot like as you

recall<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.020> they're<00:03:31.200> not<00:03:31.230> patching<00:03:31.740> it<00:03:31.830> at

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
recall it and they're not patching it at

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.070 
recall it and they're not patching it at
least<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.550> doesn't<00:03:32.760> seem<00:03:32.910> so<00:03:32.940> they<00:03:33.540> say<00:03:33.840> they

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
least it doesn't seem so they say they

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.810 
least it doesn't seem so they say they
will<00:03:34.260> but<00:03:34.590> they<00:03:34.770> haven't<00:03:35.310> put<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.430> proper<00:03:35.670> time

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
will but they haven't put a proper time

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.120 
will but they haven't put a proper time
frame<00:03:36.090> on<00:03:36.210> so<00:03:36.660> yeah<00:03:36.810> that's<00:03:37.110> how<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.350> record

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
frame on so yeah that's how you record

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.040 
frame on so yeah that's how you record
ps4<00:03:38.910> without<00:03:39.240> using<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.630> in-game

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
ps4 without using the in-game

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.750 
ps4 without using the in-game
thingamajig<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:40.980> that's<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.280> record<00:03:41.520> Pierce
