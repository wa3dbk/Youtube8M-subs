00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:15.320
 The episode is composed of all 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.320
 better is the fire number of votes insisted 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:26.880
 these are in the pensions publications and 10 in the 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.680
 publishing the working child care board 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.320
 for me looking at me 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.560
 attention I want you guys to originate 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.320
 these tools exit 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.820
 even the opposition drawing attention and 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.670
 interest multiplication occurs today 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.370
 the last main line holy the reason is 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.530
 using any market using the two 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.700
 first involves the deployment of 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.430
 Chulapa 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.780
 after maceiÃ³ then see here you 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.930
 do that 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:02.430
 so you want to participate with me 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.430
 or unification when heretofore 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:12.120
 10 nail 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:13.560
 here is what destroys the frog the moment 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.310
 nobody 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.600
 now he was not signing with the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.620
 material played as dedication and 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.730
 job and a certain gentleman should 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:33.540
 to present 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:37.530
 I know it's often to stay when the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.590
 del hierro sir, you will give more than 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.640
 another way of presenting without 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.050
 to represent Brazil well 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.190
 If I did this month, it would be okay. 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.800
 maybe I'll do yes, but I can 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.490
 do 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.820
 I need the exact same 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.909
 the CSDP are the thousand and must plan 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.560
 because then my memory the following 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.560
 Arriving back at school 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.070
 in Japan 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.620
 I came to help with a 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.900
 attention and I fight is that maybe 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.680
 You introduce me here and you 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.680

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.770
 It is good that you will present a 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.410
 unification will you do there has its 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.790
 worse 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.100
 then pleasure pays off 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.070
