tail landed he just it just ended I
can't<00:06:08.569> do<00:06:08.719> that<00:06:08.749> so<00:06:09.499> fortunate<00:06:10.039> that<00:06:10.219> is

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:10.909 
can't do that so fortunate that is

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:20.889 
can't do that so fortunate that is
unfortunate<00:06:13.989> all<00:06:14.989> right<00:06:15.109> so<00:06:15.799> I<00:06:17.259> guess<00:06:19.779> we<00:06:20.779> need

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:20.899 
unfortunate all right so I guess we need

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:22.389 
unfortunate all right so I guess we need
to<00:06:21.019> find<00:06:21.259> some<00:06:21.499> kind<00:06:21.649> of<00:06:21.739> trail<00:06:21.979> like<00:06:22.189> this

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:22.399 
to find some kind of trail like this

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:27.210 
to find some kind of trail like this
time<00:06:23.979> that<00:06:24.979> is<00:06:25.219> 10

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
time that is 10

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:35.780 
time that is 10
there's<00:06:27.700> one<00:06:27.850> I'm<00:06:28.120> things<00:06:28.600> in<00:06:28.990> he<00:06:29.200> and<00:06:29.350> I<00:06:29.910> great
