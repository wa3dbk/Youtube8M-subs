 Well then 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:20.120
 That's why the keyword here 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.130
 A certain girls rock 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:27.380
 1 learn in 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.030
 The Tteyuu and high that released in the fact that the r Girl lock released better was the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.270
 I from the previous Well 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:40.010
 I've been there a couple of times, but about the cover album 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:43.250
 I here a Nde'd say did not say exactly about what that that explanation album 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.190
 When I talk a lot, I think Heine first 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.190
 r 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.900
 This time I'm limited to girls rock this time 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.020
 Not cd 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.440
 It is trying to make the Yeah cover that 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:01.740
 For example, r is a designated assessment. 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.980
 r specified and Kaato is I've been with r in r Toka many ways of Respect 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.730
 but 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.190
 How was the recording 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:12.710
 I co-Managing 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:16.740
 I thought was their own feed their lyrics softening up anymore 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.230
 Somehow Na or Jansoda was Toka 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.760
 Original tone 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:26.730
 Such a song 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:31.860
 In Nari another their Nante great difficult me to Tteyuu sing 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:34.410
 So what their likeness Tteyuu softening scan if the user also has said so because it is important while 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:40.750
 I try to sing but seasoned 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:45.620
 However , there is no way that I feel that something is pulled by the original song 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:52.400
 It looks like I'm going to do something else 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:53.930
 Became an actress Became a protagonist of the lyrics with such an impetus 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.210
 Seems to be 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:02.630
 I do wonder if it was felt that say singing on, taken sell something dog 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:10.130
 And a completely different yan ban Tengu is something way of testimony 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:12.990
 Say Naa became like a completely different song I Shinobu N Now thou do Yaro exactly the same result because 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.060

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.120

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.330
 Great 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.130

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:26.160

 The song's great love Sa Toka I hope this person school or know at Toka something TV 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.120
 The color that he made this time for the song that I thought after 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.599
 Whether Sinan was happy 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.950
 I was able to record while tension was rising , and this constituency is a member too 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.300
 Properly 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.970
 Anu 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.330
 So listening to various songs to true 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.380
 While giving various opinions 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:03.900
 Which song is good if you are Yamaguchi Momoe ? 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:06.290

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.480
 Ask tell me I'm there is a 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.730
 I heard Taraii 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:16.890
 I mention old times 昔 Let's 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:21.319
 It's a talk about "favor", so it's about trying to play music 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.400
 After Sunny Day Sunday is Well um previous week 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.780
 Hit but possible 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.160
 Gave birth for the first time unreasonable profitable not do is § a lot of various challenge 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.100
 I thing there I there 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.430
 Which song do you want 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.120
 Well it is great that I sing for the first time 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.319
 Hmmm 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:47.700
 Or something say Datte talk unless spoken Te Nyan I Pandoya 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:51.180
 I'm writing from Rambo, but I'm told it's like I'm not going to get it at all 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.560
 I do not know how to answer 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.510
 so 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:00.110
 I thought all the way also I Na what to do such a scene is small purchases at the live 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:05.570
 Because it is something like that 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:08.290
 The empire was able to make things that say I'll have a little singing voice that something answer is found 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.160
 But it was very personal 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:15.290
 Think 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:20.989
 What would you say some other time? 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:24.530
 If you or stomach Fu Tteyuu Naa there is a strength that does not change the old days still even now I women 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:30.650
 But I'm really feeling good and gar 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:32.450
 The best three boys and girls are feeling and that 's why I'm riding myself 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.520
 Toka or to or whether end 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:41.180
 Something to everyone Ya has received Shizu kana had it in quite Shingin feeling 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.550
 Some old people say more Zubazuba 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.360
 A little something I sell joy's cut 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.360
 Expression that is not behind that now 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:56.540
 4 It becomes a square or a word that you do not know 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:05:02.080
 It contains a lot 1 Well then it looks like I'm anti In other words something also this kind of thing 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:04.110
 In Yeah Toka great study Nante or was found good or say that this work 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.570
 Dolphin that became were many orchid 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:11.100
 I went to choose a place Charles lock e girls rock limited Risana 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:16.230
 It is an illusion 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:18.340
 Again after all it means Kana such emotion Tsu strength of girl 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:23.430
 I know that I understand 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:26.730
 Now maybe because you do change from softening students long time ago I'm Ya think that I wish no change Yappa 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:30.000
 There is a do Ya, but whether the juice beyond the softening generation 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:36.849
 So palm also those of kindergarten went into Honma 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:41.740
 The'm yan made as a woman, such as there was me change does emotions in people who become Suzue place 80-year-old 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:42.940
 Wow something deep Naa I cute I wonder guy Nante how cute I thought 2 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.380
 Hey That's right 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:52.690
 If you really compared to the old days or what one by little I think 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:57.090
 When it comes to doing things , it's because I 'm an adult and I know it in various ways, but maybe 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:06:02.190
 It's of Tteyuu Toka and go real intention, which I thought in my mind 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.350
 A woman is a woman no matter how long it is 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:08.240
 Hmmm 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:10.330
 I can say something like that, but I was able to express something like strength 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.430
 Mr Gone that 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:18.550
 Well, I've covered a lot of songs from a long time ago and started from a day dream 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:23.439
 For example, I did also secret race at'm Itteyuu 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:28.870
 Various Toka be for themselves by covering say so softening softening 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:30.350
 There was so much to gain something so I went without saying this album in that sense 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.300
 Wait by covering 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:37.220
 Full of that notice something 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:41.000
 I would think I wonder if Attan not it for that live 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:44.030
 What kind of posture or human beings to be covered without a park 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.380
 Direction Tsukasa length arranged by 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.169
 Then years 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:52.469
 1 Chan Neru true new March 9 I will not come out 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:55.030
 I thought that I did through this album 

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:58.260
 Well I guess we shape the approach 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:04.920
 I think that Kido Shina Yes 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:08.660
 So , this keyword r Girls Rock and girls who are the same as ever 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.660
 It is an album that covered
