you cut your bell pepper you want to cut
it<00:02:02.880> skin<00:02:03.270> side<00:02:03.600> down<00:02:03.710> if<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.829> try<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.100> cut<00:02:05.340> it

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
it skin side down if you try to cut it

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.469 
it skin side down if you try to cut it
the<00:02:05.549> other<00:02:05.670> way<00:02:05.880> where<00:02:06.090> you're<00:02:06.210> cutting

the other way where you're cutting
through<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.869> skin<00:02:07.170> first<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:08.099> don't<00:02:08.220> have

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
through the skin first you don't have

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.949 
through the skin first you don't have
your<00:02:08.670> cutting<00:02:08.970> board<00:02:09.179> directly<00:02:09.599> underneath

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
your cutting board directly underneath

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.839 
your cutting board directly underneath
it<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.619> can't<00:02:11.099> really

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
it so you can't really

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.369 
it so you can't really
cut<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.239> as<00:02:12.359> easily<00:02:12.599> because<00:02:12.989> there's<00:02:13.170> like

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
cut it as easily because there's like

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.619 
cut it as easily because there's like
that<00:02:13.530> little<00:02:13.799> pocket<00:02:14.159> of<00:02:14.219> air<00:02:14.400> underneath<00:02:14.730> so

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
that little pocket of air underneath so

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.530 
that little pocket of air underneath so
cut<00:02:16.049> it<00:02:16.139> skin<00:02:16.409> side<00:02:16.439> down<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.219> then<00:02:17.909> do<00:02:18.359> your

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
cut it skin side down and then do your

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.809 
cut it skin side down and then do your
red<00:02:18.719> bell<00:02:18.930> pepper<00:02:19.170> as<00:02:19.379> well<00:02:19.409> put<00:02:20.400> them<00:02:20.549> into<00:02:20.670> a

about a quarter-inch thick
I've<00:02:39.060> also<00:02:39.569> washed<00:02:39.840> these<00:02:40.139> mushrooms<00:02:40.739> in<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
I've also washed these mushrooms in the

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.920 
I've also washed these mushrooms in the
way<00:02:41.249> that<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.459> do<00:02:41.579> that<00:02:41.849> is<00:02:41.909> by<00:02:42.269> swirling<00:02:42.540> them

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
way that I do that is by swirling them

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.500 
way that I do that is by swirling them
in<00:02:43.169> a<00:02:43.260> bowl<00:02:43.409> of<00:02:43.560> water<00:02:43.849> notice<00:02:44.849> that<00:02:45.209> there's<00:02:45.419> a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
in a bowl of water notice that there's a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.839 
in a bowl of water notice that there's a
membrane<00:02:45.840> going<00:02:46.560> over<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.250> gills<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.730> the

membrane going over the gills of the

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.300 
membrane going over the gills of the
mushroom<00:02:48.389> so<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.049> can't<00:02:49.349> see<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.739> gills<00:02:49.980> that
