00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
wasn't really that interesting so let's

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.900 
wasn't really that interesting so let's
continue<00:02:06.229> on<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:06.979> review<00:02:09.519> so<00:02:10.519> if<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.789> are

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
continue on to the review so if you are

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.580

wondering<00:02:11.120> if<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.600> skin<00:02:11.900> could<00:02:12.110> go<00:02:12.350> in<00:02:12.470> the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
wondering if the skin could go in the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.130 
wondering if the skin could go in the
case<00:02:12.799> I<00:02:13.100> have<00:02:13.130> my<00:02:13.489> tech<00:02:13.760> 21<00:02:14.090> case<00:02:14.480> right<00:02:14.780> here

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
case I have my tech 21 case right here

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.759 
case I have my tech 21 case right here
and<00:02:15.370> putting<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.459> on<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:16.910> pretty<00:02:17.840> easy<00:02:18.170> still

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
and putting it on is pretty easy still

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.740 
and putting it on is pretty easy still
and<00:02:19.130> it's<00:02:19.459> just<00:02:19.640> like<00:02:19.820> if<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.150> have<00:02:20.299> no<00:02:20.510> case

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
and it's just like if you have no case

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.440 
and it's just like if you have no case
on<00:02:20.989> it<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:21.739> that's<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.370> good<00:02:22.700> thing<00:02:22.910> if<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.299> like

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
on it so that's a good thing if you like

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.250 
on it so that's a good thing if you like
cases<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.890> more<00:02:25.160> stylish<00:02:25.670> design<00:02:26.260> one

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
cases and a more stylish design one

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.280 
cases and a more stylish design one
