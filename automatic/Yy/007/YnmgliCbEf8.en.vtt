dry<00:01:52.799> porcelain<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.659> absolutely<00:01:54.659> love<00:01:55.649> it

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
dry porcelain I absolutely love it

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.090 
dry porcelain I absolutely love it
because<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:57.180> very<00:01:57.719> similar<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.649> here

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
because it's very similar to this here

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.039 
because it's very similar to this here
but<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> only<00:01:59.909> thing<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.930> be

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
but the only thing that you have to be

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.749 
but the only thing that you have to be
concerned<00:02:01.469> about<00:02:01.590> when<00:02:01.979> you're<00:02:02.189> using<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
concerned about when you're using the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.289 
concerned about when you're using the
stuff<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.180> I've<00:02:03.299> made<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:04.520> don't<00:02:05.520> make<00:02:06.090> it

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
stuff that I've made is don't make it

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.119 
stuff that I've made is don't make it
too<00:02:06.479> too<00:02:06.750> thick<00:02:07.079> see<00:02:07.350> what<00:02:07.500> happens<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:07.950> it's

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
too too thick see what happens if it's

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.339 
too too thick see what happens if it's
too<00:02:08.369> thick<00:02:08.670> it's<00:02:09.149> actually<00:02:09.569> started<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.080> crack

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
too thick it's actually started to crack

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.330 
too thick it's actually started to crack
but<00:02:10.890> fortunately<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:12.000> hasn't<00:02:12.510> cracked

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
but fortunately it hasn't cracked

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.400 
but fortunately it hasn't cracked
underneath<00:02:13.610> there's<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.180> little<00:02:14.690> bit<00:02:14.840> but<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
underneath there's a little bit but the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.259 
underneath there's a little bit but the
cracks<00:02:15.739> haven't<00:02:16.099> gone<00:02:16.280> right<00:02:16.519> through<00:02:16.550> now

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
cracks haven't gone right through now

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.780 
cracks haven't gone right through now
this<00:02:17.540> can<00:02:17.840> be<00:02:17.870> repaired<00:02:18.620> quite<00:02:19.220> easily<00:02:19.459> by

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
this can be repaired quite easily by

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.430 
this can be repaired quite easily by
just<00:02:19.819> getting<00:02:20.300> a<00:02:20.360> little<00:02:20.540> bit<00:02:20.750> more<00:02:21.019> of<00:02:21.140> this

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
just getting a little bit more of this

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.559 
just getting a little bit more of this
and<00:02:21.739> then<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.250> can<00:02:22.489> just<00:02:22.760> sort<00:02:22.879> of<00:02:22.940> like<00:02:23.090> push

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
and then you can just sort of like push

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.250 
and then you can just sort of like push
that<00:02:23.810> into<00:02:24.080> those<00:02:24.830> cracks<00:02:25.340> like<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.330> you

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
that into those cracks like that and you

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.800 
that into those cracks like that and you
can<00:02:27.410> cover<00:02:27.680> those<00:02:27.920> up<00:02:27.950> but<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:29.239> other<00:02:29.450> thing

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
can cover those up but the other thing

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.360 
can cover those up but the other thing
is<00:02:29.989> that<00:02:30.019> if<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:30.410> too<00:02:30.650> thick<00:02:30.950> it's<00:02:31.129> going<00:02:31.160> to

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
is that if it's too thick it's going to

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.059 
is that if it's too thick it's going to
take<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.610> long<00:02:32.030> long<00:02:32.420> long<00:02:32.660> time<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.230> dry<00:02:33.379> but

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
take a long long long time to dry but

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.729 
take a long long long time to dry but
anyway<00:02:34.400> let<00:02:34.790> me<00:02:34.819> just<00:02:35.000> show<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:35.540> how<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.349> go

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
anyway let me just show you how to go

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.420 
anyway let me just show you how to go
about<00:02:37.040> making<00:02:37.970> you're<00:02:38.930> making<00:02:39.010> your<00:02:40.010> pleasure

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
about making you're making your pleasure

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.020 
about making you're making your pleasure
now<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.330> look<00:02:42.230> at<00:02:42.319> our<00:02:42.590> years<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.519> good<00:02:43.730> now

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
now I look at our years this is good now

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.940 
now I look at our years this is good now
that's<00:02:44.209> still<00:02:44.569> it<00:02:44.870> see<00:02:45.319> how<00:02:45.470> it's<00:02:45.620> sort<00:02:45.769> of<00:02:45.860> a

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
that's still it see how it's sort of a

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.710 
that's still it see how it's sort of a
little<00:02:46.099> bit<00:02:46.190> creaky<00:02:46.790> like<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.209> that's

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
little bit creaky like that that's

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.650 
little bit creaky like that that's
because<00:02:48.260> when<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:49.010> did<00:02:49.069> it<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.730> got<00:02:50.060> all<00:02:50.209> sticky

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
because when I did it it got all sticky

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.050 
because when I did it it got all sticky
so<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.170> just<00:02:51.349> need<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.590> like<00:02:52.160> lead<00:02:52.549> that<00:02:52.880> up

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
so you just need to like lead that up

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.750 
so you just need to like lead that up
again<00:02:53.420> until<00:02:54.049> you<00:02:54.170> get<00:02:54.319> all<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.620> those<00:02:54.769> fibers

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
again until you get all of those fibers

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.860 
again until you get all of those fibers
or<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:57.470> dough<00:02:57.769> or<00:02:58.129> all<00:02:59.030> sort<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.480> like<00:02:59.660> -

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
or the the dough or all sort of like -

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.490 
or the the dough or all sort of like -
that's<00:03:00.079> right<00:03:00.319> consistency<00:03:01.099> right<00:03:01.610> with<00:03:01.879> this

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
that's right consistency right with this

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.080 
that's right consistency right with this
pull<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.530> bit<00:03:03.739> off<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.519> other<00:03:04.670> thing<00:03:04.910> is

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
pull a bit off and the other thing is

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.390

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
when I'm not using it I put a little bit

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.670 
when I'm not using it I put a little bit
of<00:03:07.489> baby<00:03:07.940> oil<00:03:08.360> in<00:03:08.480> there<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:08.930> then<00:03:09.290> put<00:03:09.560> it

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
careful see how that started to fit its

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.659 
careful see how that started to fit its
roll<00:03:57.169> there<00:03:57.500> well<00:03:58.040> that's<00:03:58.190> going<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.579> go

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
roll there well that's going to go

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.220 
roll there well that's going to go
through<00:03:58.910> onto<00:03:59.180> that<00:03:59.299> side<00:03:59.569> there<00:03:59.720> so<00:03:59.900> just<00:04:00.079> be

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
through onto that side there so just be

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.710 
through onto that side there so just be
