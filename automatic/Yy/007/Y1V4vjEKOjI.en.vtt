numbers<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:29.930> have<00:01:30.920> this<00:01:31.040> strange<00:01:31.370> feeling<00:01:31.490> that

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
numbers I have this strange feeling that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.040 
numbers I have this strange feeling that
if<00:01:31.910> I<00:01:31.970> don't<00:01:32.030> make<00:01:32.210> an<00:01:32.300> exception<00:01:32.750> this<00:01:32.780> one

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
if I don't make an exception this one

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.500 
if I don't make an exception this one
time<00:01:33.080> I'm<00:01:33.440> really<00:01:33.620> gonna<00:01:33.860> regret<00:01:34.070> it

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.910 

so<00:01:41.510> you're<00:01:41.870> assuming<00:01:42.140> there's<00:01:42.560> gonna<00:01:42.680> be<00:01:42.890> a

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
so you're assuming there's gonna be a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.390 
so you're assuming there's gonna be a
next<00:01:43.160> time

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.730 

so<00:01:46.400> I<00:01:46.640> think<00:01:47.360> secrets<00:01:47.870> are<00:01:47.990> an<00:01:48.080> important<00:01:48.560> part

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
so I think secrets are an important part

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.700 
so I think secrets are an important part
of<00:01:48.830> every<00:01:49.100> relationship<00:01:49.960> wouldn't<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:51.110> agree

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
of every relationship wouldn't you agree

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.250 
of every relationship wouldn't you agree
you<00:01:52.130> have<00:01:52.340> no<00:01:52.550> idea<00:01:53.479> other<00:01:53.780> guys<00:01:54.020> are<00:01:54.050> probably

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
you have no idea other guys are probably

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.810 
you have no idea other guys are probably

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
interested in you and they're probably

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.250 
interested in you and they're probably
much<00:01:56.000> better<00:01:56.030> looking<00:01:56.510> than<00:01:56.570> me<00:01:56.630> it's<00:01:57.050> funny
