00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.550
 hello everyone welcome let's do 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:10.170
 a review on some concepts 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.390
 basic pharmacology 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.330
 let's start by defining what is a 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.180
 drug to try to explain then 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.150
 how they act to relieve or cure 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.289
 The diseases 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.689
 drug is a chemical that 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.990
 by a chemical reaction is capable 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.610
 to modify a biological function 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.070
 Ordinarily to produce an effect 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.860
 therapeutic purposes sometimes 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.949
 diagnostics the medicine is the 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.290
 set of one or more drugs plus the 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:46.030
 excipients and preservatives needed 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.579
 for pharmaceutical preparation 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.630
 there is a huge amount of diseases 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.210
 and an even greater number of drugs 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.540
 although the diseases affect in greater 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.060
 or lesser degree to the whole organism its 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.120
 origin are the cellular alterations of 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.910
 the diseased organs the human body 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.800
 contains many organs that are associated 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.350
 each other to complement each other in the 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.770
 compliance with a certain function 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.370
 organic each group of organs forms a 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.400
 apparatus or system an example from the 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.190
 circulatory system constituted by the 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.150
 heart that is responsible for receiving and 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.070
 pump blood throughout the body and 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.340
 the blood vessels that are three 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.960
 types arteries that carry blood 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.350
 from the heart to the different 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.300
 organs the capillaries that allow the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.500
 substance exchange between 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.470
 blood and tissues 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.290
 and the veins that collect the blood from 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.970
 the periphery and take them back to the 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.580
 heart 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.460
 Each organ is made up of several 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.560
 tissues that are sets of millions of 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.800
 cells with a form and function 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.950
 similar the main elements of 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.110
 some cells are the covered membrane 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.750
 protective that allows the exchange of 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.400
 substances between the cytoplasm and the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.209
 inter cellular liquid 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.220
 the cytoplasm formed by water in which 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.270
 float the organs that are in charge 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.420
 to fulfill vital functions 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.380
 like the lysosomes that digest the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.820
 foods 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.740
 the mitochondria that produce energy 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:36.390
 oxidizing that is burning the 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.010
 foods and ribosomes that synthesize 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.360
 proteins and other compounds 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.390
 organic ones of the cell 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.350
 more of the nucleus in which the chromatin or 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.390
 adn stores all the information 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.630
 inherited or acquired 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.640
 the cell membrane is formed of a 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:03.170
 90 to 95 percent for lipids or fats 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:06.020
 and in the remaining 5 to 10% per protein 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.569
 the proteins form the pores or channels 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.180
 ionic small perforations that 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.300
 they cross the membrane and allow the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.840
 ion entry or exit ie from 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.819
 atoms or molecules with electrical charge 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.330
 and they also form the receptors 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.489
 molecular macro proteins capable of 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.390
 get to other molecules like 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.819
 drugs from which they will receive 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.970
 stimuli or messages the receivers 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.250
 molecular are related to either 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.340
 the channels of some script that can 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.640
 open or close or with enzymes from the 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.269
 own membrane or the inside of the 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.830
 cell whose activity they modify 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.019
 altering the behavior 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.540
 and the result of some reaction 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.379
 chemistry 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.269
 so that the molecular receptors 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.250
 including the pharmacological ones are 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.770
 fundamental to regulate the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.850
 cellular operation 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:09.040
 in summary the cells are grouped 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.849
 forming tissues 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.920
 with which organs are formed that 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.729
 they are grouped together forming devices or 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:22.030
 systems the disease that affects a 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:25.060
 last body is the 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.610
 cells of which this one is formed 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.180
 about which they will have to act 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.699
 the drugs or medicines with the 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.710
 object to modify favorably 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.300
 some of its functions for which 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.460
 first they will have to link to the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.830
 corresponding molecular receptors 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.720
 to those who gave an order that 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.630
 will modify the permeability of some 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.020
 ion channel or an activity of some 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.020
 enzyme 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.570
 the difference between an agonist drug 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.610
 and an antagonist is that the first one occupies 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.970
 the receivers and temporarily the 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.430
 modify to thereby impart them 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.220
 a certain message 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.210
 while the antagonist only occupies 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.350
 two receivers without altering them 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.080
 simply by preventing them from being 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.689
 stimulated by other molecules 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.150
 in this way it can be concluded that the 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:20.719
 most times what drugs 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.520
 they do to exert their therapeutic effect 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:27.000
 is to modify the permeability 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.699
 of some niko change or the activity of 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.349
 some enzyme whether it's located in 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.349
 the membrane the cytoplasm 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.930
 and still in the cell nucleus 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.710
 thank you for your attention we see you in the 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.710
 next lesson
