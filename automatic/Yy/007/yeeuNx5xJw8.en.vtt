express<00:00:21.580> a<00:00:21.610> XE<00:00:22.360> it's<00:00:22.660> a<00:00:23.470> program<00:00:24.100> that's

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
express a XE it's a program that's

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.280 
express a XE it's a program that's
already<00:00:24.580> built<00:00:24.880> into<00:00:25.119> all<00:00:25.330> computers<00:00:26.080> that

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
already built into all computers that

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.950 
already built into all computers that
are<00:00:26.350> windows<00:00:27.120> to<00:00:28.120> get<00:00:28.270> to<00:00:28.450> it<00:00:28.600> you<00:00:28.660> have<00:00:28.720> to<00:00:28.870> go

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
are windows to get to it you have to go

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.210 
are windows to get to it you have to go
to<00:00:29.020> arrow<00:00:30.270> start<00:00:32.580> my<00:00:33.580> computer<00:00:34.710> C<00:00:35.710> go<00:00:36.190> to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
to arrow start my computer C go to

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.510 
to arrow start my computer C go to
Windows<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:37.290> then<00:00:38.290> you<00:00:38.470> have<00:00:38.559> to<00:00:38.620> go<00:00:38.710> down<00:00:38.949> to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.350 

system<00:00:42.520> 32<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:44.230> then<00:00:45.129> you<00:00:45.730> can<00:00:45.879> slow<00:00:46.089> down

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
system 32 and then you can slow down

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.009 
system 32 and then you can slow down
there's<00:00:46.720> list<00:00:47.470> of<00:00:47.680> different<00:00:48.100> stuff<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:49.030> it's

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
there's list of different stuff and it's

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.579 
there's list of different stuff and it's
il<00:00:50.800> yeah<00:00:51.670> I<00:00:51.699> expressed<00:00:52.300> uxe<00:00:53.080> so<00:00:53.379> you<00:00:53.470> go<00:00:53.530> down

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
il yeah I expressed uxe so you go down

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.219 
il yeah I expressed uxe so you go down
to<00:00:53.830> I<00:00:53.860> Emily<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:56.110> a<00:00:56.140> little<00:00:56.260> faster

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
to I Emily go a little faster

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:06.700 
to I Emily go a little faster
here's<00:00:59.229> I

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.520 

it<00:01:07.250> is<00:01:07.460> right<00:01:07.640> here<00:01:07.900> just<00:01:08.900> create<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.230> shortcut

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
it is right here just create a shortcut

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.530 
it is right here just create a shortcut
or<00:01:09.830> drag<00:01:10.100> it<00:01:10.220> to<00:01:10.280> your<00:01:10.310> desktop<00:01:10.540> automatically

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
or drag it to your desktop automatically

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.290 
or drag it to your desktop automatically
I<00:01:11.750> think<00:01:12.050> create<00:01:12.350> a<00:01:12.410> shortcut<00:01:12.850> so<00:01:13.850> yeah<00:01:13.970> so

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
I think create a shortcut so yeah so

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.330 
I think create a shortcut so yeah so
that's<00:01:14.420> how<00:01:14.540> you<00:01:14.600> get<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:14.780> it<00:01:15.010> when<00:01:16.010> you<00:01:16.130> open

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
that's how you get to it when you open

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.120 
that's how you get to it when you open
it<00:01:16.370> up<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:16.640> looks<00:01:16.670> like<00:01:16.940> this<00:01:17.740> pretty<00:01:18.740> much<00:01:18.860> it

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
it up it looks like this pretty much it

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.120 
it up it looks like this pretty much it
what<00:01:19.250> it<00:01:19.340> does<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:19.700> it<00:01:20.180> creates<00:01:20.360> dot<00:01:21.290> exe<00:01:21.530> files

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
what it does is it creates dot exe files

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.840 
what it does is it creates dot exe files
which<00:01:22.490> are<00:01:22.610> executable<00:01:23.330> files<00:01:23.890> so<00:01:24.890> I<00:01:25.340> have

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
which are executable files so I have

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.450 
which are executable files so I have
down<00:01:26.210> here<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.750> new<00:01:27.320> wave<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:27.979> new<00:01:28.100> text

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
down here a new wave and new text

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.060 
down here a new wave and new text
document<00:01:28.490> which<00:01:29.119> all<00:01:29.900> these<00:01:30.080> legs<00:01:30.290> example<00:01:30.800> so

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
document which all these legs example so

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.910 
document which all these legs example so
we'll<00:01:31.970> say<00:01:32.150> create<00:01:32.510> a<00:01:32.540> new<00:01:32.780> one<00:01:32.990> self

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
we'll say create a new one self

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.340 
we'll say create a new one self
extracting<00:01:34.430> directive<00:01:34.910> vile<00:01:35.150> all<00:01:36.050> right<00:01:36.200> and

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
extracting directive vile all right and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.760 
extracting directive vile all right and
then<00:01:36.440> we'll<00:01:36.500> do<00:01:36.650> extract<00:01:37.040> only<00:01:38.259> buy<00:01:39.259> a<00:01:39.290> package

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
then we'll do extract only buy a package

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.590 
then we'll do extract only buy a package
side<00:01:40.009> we'll<00:01:40.250> call<00:01:40.460> it<00:01:40.670> a<00:01:44.080> we'll<00:01:45.080> call<00:01:45.290> it<00:01:45.380> law

then<00:03:54.170> in<00:03:54.260> those<00:03:54.410> run<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:54.860> file<00:03:55.040> then<00:03:55.370> we'll

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
then in those run the file then we'll

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.270 
then in those run the file then we'll
just<00:03:55.640> copy<00:03:55.880> certain<00:03:56.570> files<00:03:56.810> onto<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.860> desktop
