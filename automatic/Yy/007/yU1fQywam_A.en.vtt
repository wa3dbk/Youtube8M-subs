around<00:00:30.380> this<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> great<00:00:31.859> deal<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.880> good

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
around this is a great deal and a good

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.549 
around this is a great deal and a good
bet<00:00:33.829> the<00:00:35.000> Valencia<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:36.870> say<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> nylon

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
bet the Valencia is as we say a nylon

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.770 
bet the Valencia is as we say a nylon
string<00:00:37.890> guitar<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.940> most<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.750> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
string guitar so it's most like a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.560 
string guitar so it's most like a
classical<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:40.739> Spanish<00:00:41.280> guitar<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
classical or Spanish guitar and the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.540 
classical or Spanish guitar and the
great<00:00:42.780> thing<00:00:42.960> about<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.980> neck<00:00:44.250> width

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
great thing about it is the neck width

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.779 
great thing about it is the neck width
is<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.789> same<00:00:45.239> as<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.739> standard<00:00:47.129> size<00:00:47.309> guitar

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
is the same as the standard size guitar

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.600 
is the same as the standard size guitar
so<00:00:48.390> if<00:00:48.809> you're<00:00:49.320> switching<00:00:49.530> back<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:49.890> forth<00:00:50.280> or

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
so if you're switching back and forth or

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.910 
so if you're switching back and forth or
you're<00:00:50.820> practicing<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.289> before<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> gig

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
