00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
room that you spawn in I have to survive

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.080 
room that you spawn in I have to survive
and<00:02:25.829> everyone<00:02:26.829> has<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.069> be<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.489> or<00:02:27.730> else<00:02:27.969> it

and everyone has to be on or else it
won't<00:02:28.239> work<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.620> once<00:02:30.069> you<00:02:30.189> do<00:02:30.370> this<00:02:30.640> like

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
won't work and once you do this like

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.440 
won't work and once you do this like
them<00:02:31.359> a<00:02:32.049> bunch<00:02:32.409> of<00:02:32.500> zombies<00:02:32.920> will<00:02:33.040> come<00:02:33.219> out

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
them a bunch of zombies will come out

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.970 
them a bunch of zombies will come out
most<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.629> the<00:02:34.720> time<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:35.140> lot<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.409> times<00:02:35.620> it'll<00:02:35.829> be

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
most of the time a lot of times it'll be

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.830 
most of the time a lot of times it'll be
jugged<00:02:36.310> but<00:02:36.579> sometimes<00:02:37.030> it's<00:02:37.239> speed<00:02:37.540> color

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
jugged but sometimes it's speed color

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.289 
jugged but sometimes it's speed color
you<00:02:38.049> just<00:02:38.079> got<00:02:38.439> a<00:02:38.470> kind<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.519> a<00:02:39.609> lock<00:02:39.790> thing<00:02:40.120> I

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
you just got a kind of a lock thing I

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.880 
you just got a kind of a lock thing I
think<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:40.659> kind<00:02:40.810> of<00:02:40.870> stupid<00:02:41.349> but<00:02:41.500> that's<00:02:41.680> how

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
think it's kind of stupid but that's how

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.440 
think it's kind of stupid but that's how
it<00:02:41.980> works<00:02:42.189> yeah<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:44.700> I'll<00:02:45.700> say<00:02:45.879> I<00:02:45.909> think<00:02:46.120> it

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
it works yeah so I'll say I think it

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.420 
it works yeah so I'll say I think it
spawns<00:02:46.780> like<00:02:47.109> different<00:02:47.620> every<00:02:47.859> other<00:02:48.040> time

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
spawns like different every other time

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.970 
spawns like different every other time
like<00:02:49.209> if<00:02:49.389> you<00:02:49.540> spawn<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.109> it's<00:02:50.230> jog-trot<00:02:50.560> when

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
like if you spawn and it's jog-trot when

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.849 
like if you spawn and it's jog-trot when
you<00:02:51.069> spawn<00:02:51.870> it'll<00:02:52.870> be<00:02:52.989> speed<00:02:53.290> color<00:02:53.560> when<00:02:53.769> you

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
you spawn it'll be speed color when you

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.849 
you spawn it'll be speed color when you
try<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.069> come<00:02:54.340> back<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:54.939> then<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:56.200> then<00:02:56.739> the

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
try to come back and then and then the

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.319 
try to come back and then and then the
next<00:02:57.189> time<00:02:57.370> we<00:02:57.519> try<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.730> go<00:02:57.939> it<00:02:58.120> should<00:02:58.150> be

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
next time we try to go it should be

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.640 
next time we try to go it should be
juggernaut<00:02:59.019> so<00:02:59.470> but<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.189> takes<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.579> lot<00:03:00.819> for<00:03:01.120> the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
juggernaut so but it takes a lot for the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.770 
juggernaut so but it takes a lot for the
type<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.680> telephone<00:03:03.310> come<00:03:03.790> by<00:03:04.000> but<00:03:04.359> that's

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
type of telephone come by but that's

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.360 
type of telephone come by but that's
where<00:03:05.019> you<00:03:05.169> but<00:03:05.379> that's<00:03:05.500> where<00:03:05.739> you<00:03:05.859> get<00:03:06.010> jug

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
where you but that's where you get jug
