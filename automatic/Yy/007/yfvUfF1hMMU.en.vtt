00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
it's a completely different game code is

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.770 
it's a completely different game code is
always<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.890> game<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.250> hair<00:02:44.370> crutches<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.720> you

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
always a game the hair crutches so you

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.410 
always a game the hair crutches so you
know<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.500> just<00:02:46.650> comes<00:02:46.890> with<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.100> territory

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
know that just comes with the territory

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.120 
know that just comes with the territory
so<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:48.600> like<00:02:48.660> alphas<00:02:49.110> oranges<00:02:49.560> at<00:02:49.740> least<00:02:49.980> to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
so it's like alphas oranges at least to

so it's like alphas oranges at least to
me<00:02:50.280> that's<00:02:50.610> why<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.760> can<00:02:51.090> deal<00:02:51.270> with<00:02:51.450> call<00:02:51.630> of
