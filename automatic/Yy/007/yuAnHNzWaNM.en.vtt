nail line but it's not very streaky the
formula<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.149> one<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.420> pretty<00:00:48.480> good<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
formula on this one is pretty good it

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.660 
formula on this one is pretty good it
might<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> tiny<00:00:49.530> bit<00:00:49.649> thin<00:00:50.160> but<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.520> not

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
might be a tiny bit thin but it's not

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.250 
might be a tiny bit thin but it's not
bad<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.090> still<00:00:51.210> fairly<00:00:51.539> easy<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.079> work<00:00:52.199> with

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
bad it's still fairly easy to work with

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.619 
bad it's still fairly easy to work with

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
stop for red it's showing up a little

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.060 
stop for red it's showing up a little
bit<00:01:43.509> more<00:01:43.630> orange<00:01:44.049> on<00:01:44.200> my<00:01:44.229> camera<00:01:44.710> than<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:44.979> is

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
bit more orange on my camera than it is

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.180 
bit more orange on my camera than it is
in<00:01:45.220> person<00:01:45.430> so<00:01:46.150> here's<00:01:46.390> one<00:01:46.840> coat<00:01:47.110> of<00:01:47.320> I<00:01:47.860> stop

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
in person so here's one coat of I stop

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.480 
in person so here's one coat of I stop
for<00:01:48.490> red<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:50.470> one<00:01:50.680> actually<00:01:50.950> covers<00:01:51.340> pretty

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
for red this one actually covers pretty

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.100 
for red this one actually covers pretty
well<00:01:51.729> on<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.060> first<00:01:52.270> coat<00:01:52.479> it's<00:01:52.750> more<00:01:52.930> of<00:01:53.020> a

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
well on the first coat it's more of a

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.080 
well on the first coat it's more of a
jelly<00:01:53.380> red<00:01:53.649> but<00:01:53.860> it's<00:01:53.979> still<00:01:54.159> really<00:01:54.490> opaque<00:01:54.820> I

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
jelly red but it's still really opaque I

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.090 
jelly red but it's still really opaque I
can't<00:01:55.690> see<00:01:55.869> my<00:01:56.049> nail<00:01:56.229> line<00:01:56.470> though<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:56.979> I'm

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
can't see my nail line though so I'm

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.320 
can't see my nail line though so I'm
gonna<00:01:57.220> have<00:01:57.399> to<00:01:57.490> build<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.759> up<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.940> little<00:01:58.030> bit

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
gonna have to build it up a little bit

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.359 
gonna have to build it up a little bit
the<00:01:58.690> formula<00:01:59.200> is<00:01:59.229> great<00:01:59.740> it's<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.039> little<00:02:00.250> bit

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
the formula is great it's a little bit

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.130 
the formula is great it's a little bit
thin<00:02:00.700> but<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:00.940> don't<00:02:01.119> mind<00:02:01.360> when<00:02:01.600> jellies<00:02:01.990> are

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
thin but I don't mind when jellies are

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.600 
thin but I don't mind when jellies are
thin<00:02:02.350> because<00:02:02.619> sometimes<00:02:02.890> jellies<00:02:03.190> can<00:02:03.399> tend

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
thin because sometimes jellies can tend

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.940 
thin because sometimes jellies can tend
to<00:02:03.640> be<00:02:03.759> really<00:02:04.030> thick<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:04.600> kind<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.110> goopy<00:02:05.560> so

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
to be really thick and kind of goopy so

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.560 
to be really thick and kind of goopy so
I<00:02:05.979> like<00:02:06.369> this<00:02:06.520> one<00:02:06.670> it's<00:02:06.850> easy<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.180> apply<00:02:07.330> it's

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
I like this one it's easy to apply it's

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.969 
I like this one it's easy to apply it's
easy<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.930> spread<00:02:08.229> out<00:02:08.380> you<00:02:08.530> just<00:02:08.619> have<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:08.860> be<00:02:08.950> a

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
easy to spread out you just have to be a

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.620 
easy to spread out you just have to be a
little<00:02:09.160> bit<00:02:09.399> careful<00:02:09.640> not<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.300> flood<00:02:10.509> your

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
little bit careful not to flood your

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.870 
little bit careful not to flood your
cuticles<00:02:11.050> so<00:02:11.560> there's<00:02:11.739> one<00:02:11.950> coat<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.550> stop

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
cuticles so there's one coat of I stop

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.850

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
for red I'm gonna let that dry and come

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.800 
for red I'm gonna let that dry and come
back<00:02:14.980> for<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.250> second<00:02:15.580> coat<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.269> here<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.540> two

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
back for a second coat so here is two

back for a second coat so here is two
coats<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.500> stop<00:02:17.830> for<00:02:18.100> red<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.660> can<00:02:19.660> still<00:02:19.959> see

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
coats of I stop for red I can still see

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.809 
coats of I stop for red I can still see
a<00:02:20.110> bit<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.440> my<00:02:20.560> nail<00:02:20.769> line<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.280> am<00:02:21.489> gonna<00:02:21.610> do<00:02:21.790> a

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
a bit of my nail line so I am gonna do a

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.090 
a bit of my nail line so I am gonna do a
third<00:02:22.120> coat<00:02:22.390> again<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:23.110> formula<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.709> this<00:02:23.860> is

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
third coat again the formula on this is

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.830 
third coat again the formula on this is
a<00:02:24.130> really<00:02:24.519> good<00:02:24.670> do<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:24.970> be<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.090> little<00:02:25.720> bit

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
a really good do to be a little bit

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.570 
a really good do to be a little bit
careful<00:02:26.019> but<00:02:26.500> not<00:02:26.680> much<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.130> applies<00:02:27.370> really

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
careful but not much it applies really

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.400 
careful but not much it applies really
easily<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.330> wide<00:02:28.510> brush<00:02:28.810> really<00:02:29.140> helps

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
easily and the wide brush really helps

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.199 
easily and the wide brush really helps
with<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.560> formula<00:02:30.010> like<00:02:30.220> this<00:02:30.250> too<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:31.060> there

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
with the formula like this too so there

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.300 
with the formula like this too so there
is<00:02:31.360> two<00:02:31.690> coats<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.140> ice<00:02:32.350> stop<00:02:32.650> for<00:02:32.920> red<00:02:33.040> I'm

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
is two coats of ice stop for red I'm

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.979 
is two coats of ice stop for red I'm
gonna<00:02:33.580> let<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.790> dry<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.420> come<00:02:34.630> back<00:02:34.750> for<00:02:34.959> a

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
gonna let that dry and come back for a

gonna let that dry and come back for a
third<00:02:35.049> coat<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:35.980> here<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.220> three<00:02:36.459> coats<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.910> I

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
third coat so here is three coats of I

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.770 
third coat so here is three coats of I
stop<00:02:37.480> for<00:02:37.750> red<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:40.030> one<00:02:40.239> does<00:02:40.480> cover

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
stop for red this one does cover

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.259 
stop for red this one does cover
completely<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.980> say<00:02:42.579> that<00:02:42.730> with<00:02:42.850> finger<00:02:43.150> quotes

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
completely I say that with finger quotes

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.569 
completely I say that with finger quotes
on<00:02:43.660> three<00:02:44.170> coats<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.709> can<00:02:44.860> see<00:02:45.070> my<00:02:45.190> nail<00:02:45.370> line

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
on three coats I can see my nail line

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.250 
on three coats I can see my nail line
but<00:02:45.820> again<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.269> have<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.510> look<00:02:46.720> really<00:02:47.079> really

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
but again I have to look really really

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.900 
but again I have to look really really
closely<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.769> see<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:48.070> so<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.459> definitely<00:02:48.610> think

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
closely to see it so I definitely think

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.580 
closely to see it so I definitely think
you'd<00:02:49.090> be<00:02:49.180> fine<00:02:49.209> it<00:02:49.600> with<00:02:49.720> three<00:02:50.049> on<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.410> one

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
you'd be fine it with three on this one

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.160 
you'd be fine it with three on this one
as<00:02:50.739> well<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.160> there<00:02:51.970> is<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.120> three<00:02:52.450> coats<00:02:52.660> of<00:02:52.900> I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
as well so there is a three coats of I

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.020 
as well so there is a three coats of I
stopped<00:02:53.560> for<00:02:53.799> red

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.940 

the<00:02:59.660> next<00:02:59.870> polish<00:03:00.140> is<00:03:00.320> called<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.710> berry

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
the next polish is called the berry

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.910 
the next polish is called the berry
thought<00:03:01.310> of<00:03:01.550> you<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.060> this<00:03:02.240> is<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:03.020> consider<00:03:03.470> it

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
thought of you and this is I consider it

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.820 
thought of you and this is I consider it
more<00:03:04.130> of<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.430> very<00:03:05.150> very<00:03:05.450> very<00:03:05.780> pink<00:03:06.200> toned

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
more of a very very very pink toned

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.730 
more of a very very very pink toned
purple<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:08.240> makes<00:03:08.450> sense<00:03:08.690> so<00:03:09.230> here<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.530> one

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
purple that makes sense so here is one

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.410 
purple that makes sense so here is one
coat<00:03:09.980> of<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.370> very<00:03:10.610> thought<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:13.270> this<00:03:14.270> one

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
coat of the very thought of you this one

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.600 
coat of the very thought of you this one
is<00:03:14.570> another<00:03:14.750> jelly<00:03:15.170> like<00:03:15.410> formula<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.250> covers

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
is another jelly like formula it covers

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.610 
is another jelly like formula it covers
well<00:03:16.940> but<00:03:17.300> I<00:03:17.330> can<00:03:17.600> see<00:03:17.840> through<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.350> my<00:03:18.440> nail

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
well but I can see through it to my nail

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.930 
well but I can see through it to my nail
line<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:18.920> little<00:03:19.160> bit<00:03:19.280> so<00:03:19.520> I<00:03:19.580> think<00:03:19.670> I'm<00:03:19.820> gonna

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
line a little bit so I think I'm gonna

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.910 
line a little bit so I think I'm gonna
have<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.240> build<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:20.570> up<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:21.200> formula<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.740> good

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
have to build it up the formula is good

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.040 
have to build it up the formula is good
it<00:03:22.070> feels<00:03:22.280> just<00:03:22.490> like<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:23.060> stopped<00:03:23.630> for<00:03:23.870> red

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
it feels just like I stopped for red

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.560 
it feels just like I stopped for red
where<00:03:24.320> it's<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.560> tiny<00:03:25.130> bit<00:03:25.850> thin<00:03:26.210> but<00:03:26.480> it's

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
where it's a tiny bit thin but it's

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.810 
where it's a tiny bit thin but it's
still<00:03:26.720> easy<00:03:26.960> to<00:03:27.170> work<00:03:27.290> with<00:03:27.370> so<00:03:28.370> there<00:03:28.520> is<00:03:28.610> one

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
still easy to work with so there is one

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.580 
still easy to work with so there is one
coat<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.270> the<00:03:29.420> very<00:03:29.660> thought<00:03:29.990> of<00:03:30.020> you<00:03:30.170> I'm

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
coat of the very thought of you I'm

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.320 
coat of the very thought of you I'm
gonna<00:03:30.800> let<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.160> dry<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.760> come<00:03:31.970> back<00:03:32.060> for<00:03:32.270> a

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
gonna let that dry and come back for a

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.449 
gonna let that dry and come back for a
second<00:03:32.630> coat<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.410> here<00:03:33.560> is<00:03:33.680> two<00:03:33.890> coats<00:03:34.130> of<00:03:34.400> the

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
second coat so here is two coats of the

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.820 
second coat so here is two coats of the
berry<00:03:34.760> thought<00:03:35.090> of<00:03:35.240> you

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
berry thought of you

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.470 
berry thought of you
this<00:03:36.830> one<00:03:37.040> it<00:03:37.190> looks<00:03:37.340> like<00:03:37.459> it's<00:03:37.610> as<00:03:37.790> opaque<00:03:38.180> on

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
this one it looks like it's as opaque on

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.710 
this one it looks like it's as opaque on
two<00:03:38.810> coats<00:03:39.110> as<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:40.010> eye<00:03:40.400> stop<00:03:40.730> for<00:03:40.940> red<00:03:41.090> was<00:03:41.420> on

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
two coats as the eye stop for red was on

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.650 
two coats as the eye stop for red was on
three<00:03:42.170> so<00:03:43.100> I<00:03:43.130> can<00:03:43.370> still<00:03:43.670> see<00:03:43.880> my<00:03:44.030> nail<00:03:44.209> line<00:03:44.420> if

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
three so I can still see my nail line if

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.870 
three so I can still see my nail line if
I<00:03:44.780> look<00:03:45.110> but<00:03:45.410> I<00:03:45.470> really<00:03:45.980> have<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.220> look<00:03:46.520> for<00:03:46.790> it

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
I look but I really have to look for it

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.640 
I look but I really have to look for it
so<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.330> would<00:03:47.510> call<00:03:47.690> this<00:03:47.810> one<00:03:47.870> good<00:03:48.230> on<00:03:48.440> two

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
so I would call this one good on two

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.350 
so I would call this one good on two
coats<00:03:48.860> it's<00:03:49.160> not<00:03:49.310> worth<00:03:49.520> that<00:03:49.790> third<00:03:50.090> coat

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
coats it's not worth that third coat

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.250 
coats it's not worth that third coat
because<00:03:50.480> I<00:03:50.570> don't<00:03:50.720> think<00:03:50.840> it's<00:03:50.930> gonna<00:03:51.050> make<00:03:51.200> a

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
because I don't think it's gonna make a

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.770 
because I don't think it's gonna make a
huge<00:03:51.470> difference<00:03:51.980> so<00:03:52.250> there<00:03:52.940> is<00:03:53.060> two<00:03:53.300> coats<00:03:53.570> of

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
huge difference so there is two coats of

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.559 
huge difference so there is two coats of
the<00:03:53.990> very<00:03:54.230> thought<00:03:54.530> of<00:03:54.560> you

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.990 

so<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.230> next<00:04:01.409> polish<00:04:01.739> is<00:04:01.920> called<00:04:02.129> I<00:04:02.310> see<00:04:02.579> where

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
so the next polish is called I see where

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.720 
so the next polish is called I see where
OPI<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.959> this<00:04:04.140> is<00:04:04.319> a<00:04:04.349> blue<00:04:04.829> almost<00:04:05.189> foil

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
OPI and this is a blue almost foil

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.179 
OPI and this is a blue almost foil
metallic<00:04:06.420> with<00:04:06.659> a<00:04:06.719> slight<00:04:07.140> purple<00:04:07.620> flash<00:04:07.829> to

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
metallic with a slight purple flash to

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.500 
metallic with a slight purple flash to
it<00:04:08.340> here<00:04:08.909> is<00:04:09.030> one<00:04:09.269> coat<00:04:09.510> of<00:04:09.719> ICU<00:04:10.170> where<00:04:10.500> OPI

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
it here is one coat of ICU where OPI

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.849 
it here is one coat of ICU where OPI
this<00:04:12.510> one<00:04:12.659> is<00:04:12.780> pretty<00:04:12.989> sheer<00:04:13.319> on<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.650> first

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
this one is pretty sheer on the first

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.890 
this one is pretty sheer on the first
coat<00:04:14.129> it's<00:04:14.400> not<00:04:14.579> as<00:04:14.790> much<00:04:14.939> streaky<00:04:15.450> as<00:04:15.569> it<00:04:15.689> just

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
coat it's not as much streaky as it just

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.529 
coat it's not as much streaky as it just
is<00:04:16.049> sheer<00:04:16.470> it's<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.310> tiny<00:04:17.639> bit<00:04:17.910> thin<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.419> do

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
is sheer it's a tiny bit thin so you do

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.060 
is sheer it's a tiny bit thin so you do
want<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.720> be<00:04:18.840> careful<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.259> it<00:04:19.500> doesn't<00:04:19.530> run

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
want to be careful that it doesn't run

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.850 
want to be careful that it doesn't run
or<00:04:20.430> pool<00:04:20.759> so<00:04:21.539> there<00:04:21.720> is<00:04:21.810> one<00:04:21.989> coat<00:04:22.229> of<00:04:22.410> ICU

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
or pool so there is one coat of ICU

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.219 
or pool so there is one coat of ICU
where<00:04:23.160> OPI<00:04:23.580> I'm<00:04:24.000> gonna<00:04:24.300> let<00:04:24.509> that<00:04:24.630> dry<00:04:24.690> and

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
where OPI I'm gonna let that dry and

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.350 
where OPI I'm gonna let that dry and
come<00:04:25.440> back<00:04:25.530> for<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.800> second<00:04:26.130> coat<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:27.060> here<00:04:27.240> is

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
come back for a second coat so here is

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.040 
come back for a second coat so here is
two<00:04:27.600> coats<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:28.020> ICU<00:04:28.650> where<00:04:28.860> OPI<00:04:29.900> this<00:04:30.900> one

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
two coats of ICU where OPI this one

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.960 
two coats of ICU where OPI this one
builds<00:04:31.350> up<00:04:31.470> pretty<00:04:31.710> well<00:04:31.800> on<00:04:32.190> two<00:04:32.460> coats<00:04:32.639> but<00:04:32.940> I

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
builds up pretty well on two coats but I

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.339 
builds up pretty well on two coats but I
can<00:04:33.150> still<00:04:33.389> see<00:04:33.419> my<00:04:33.660> nail<00:04:33.810> line<00:04:34.020> so<00:04:34.229> it<00:04:34.320> is

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
can still see my nail line so it is

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.230 
can still see my nail line so it is
gonna<00:04:34.590> need<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.800> third<00:04:35.070> again<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.729> formula<00:04:36.120> is

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
gonna need a third again the formula is

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.550 
gonna need a third again the formula is
a<00:04:36.270> little<00:04:36.630> bit<00:04:36.750> thin<00:04:36.960> so<00:04:36.990> you<00:04:37.229> would<00:04:37.349> want<00:04:37.530> to

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
a little bit thin so you would want to

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.890 
a little bit thin so you would want to
be<00:04:37.680> careful<00:04:38.039> with<00:04:38.160> this<00:04:38.280> one<00:04:38.419> so<00:04:39.419> there<00:04:39.570> is<00:04:39.720> two

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
be careful with this one so there is two

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.290 
be careful with this one so there is two
coats<00:04:40.139> of<00:04:40.380> ICU<00:04:40.830> where<00:04:41.009> OPI<00:04:41.430> I'm<00:04:41.789> gonna<00:04:42.120> let

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
coats of ICU where OPI I'm gonna let

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.050 
coats of ICU where OPI I'm gonna let
that<00:04:42.330> dry<00:04:42.479> and<00:04:42.990> come<00:04:43.199> back<00:04:43.289> for<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.560> third<00:04:43.800> coat

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
that dry and come back for a third coat

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.430 
that dry and come back for a third coat
so<00:04:45.060> here's<00:04:45.300> three<00:04:45.599> coats<00:04:45.840> of<00:04:46.110> ICU<00:04:46.620> where<00:04:46.800> OPI

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
so here's three coats of ICU where OPI

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.020 
so here's three coats of ICU where OPI
this<00:04:49.440> one<00:04:49.620> does<00:04:49.800> cover<00:04:50.039> completely<00:04:50.669> in<00:04:50.789> three

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
this one does cover completely in three

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.659 
this one does cover completely in three
coats<00:04:51.470> this<00:04:52.470> third<00:04:52.740> coat<00:04:52.949> really<00:04:53.160> deepens<00:04:53.520> the

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
coats this third coat really deepens the

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.760 
coats this third coat really deepens the
color<00:04:53.699> up<00:04:54.060> quite<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:54.330> bit<00:04:54.509> as<00:04:54.660> well<00:04:54.690> so<00:04:55.500> there<00:04:55.650> is

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
color up quite a bit as well so there is

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.830 
color up quite a bit as well so there is
three<00:04:56.039> coats<00:04:56.250> of<00:04:56.490> ICU<00:04:57.000> where<00:04:57.210> OPI

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.930 

the<00:05:03.320> next<00:05:03.560> polish<00:05:03.830> is<00:05:04.010> called<00:05:04.250> my<00:05:04.430> car<00:05:04.670> has

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
the next polish is called my car has

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.050 
the next polish is called my car has
navigation<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:06.020> this<00:05:06.230> is<00:05:06.410> a<00:05:06.830> navy-blue

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
navigation and this is a navy-blue

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.540 
navigation and this is a navy-blue
so<00:05:08.840> here<00:05:09.050> is<00:05:09.139> one<00:05:09.380> coat<00:05:09.650> of<00:05:09.830> my<00:05:10.070> car<00:05:10.310> has

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
so here is one coat of my car has

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.010 
so here is one coat of my car has
navigation<00:05:13.240> this<00:05:14.240> one<00:05:14.419> actually<00:05:14.720> covers

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
navigation this one actually covers

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.320 
navigation this one actually covers
really<00:05:15.500> well<00:05:15.650> on<00:05:16.100> the<00:05:16.280> first<00:05:16.520> coat<00:05:16.790> it's<00:05:17.060> a<00:05:17.150> bit

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
really well on the first coat it's a bit

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.030 
really well on the first coat it's a bit
of<00:05:17.450> a<00:05:17.540> jelly<00:05:17.780> so<00:05:18.020> I<00:05:18.050> can<00:05:18.320> see<00:05:18.560> through<00:05:18.830> in<00:05:18.919> my

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
of a jelly so I can see through in my

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.220 
of a jelly so I can see through in my
nail<00:05:19.190> line<00:05:19.430> just<00:05:19.639> a<00:05:19.760> little<00:05:20.000> bit<00:05:20.210> the<00:05:20.840> formula

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
nail line just a little bit the formula

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.960 
nail line just a little bit the formula
and<00:05:21.410> this<00:05:21.530> one<00:05:21.710> is<00:05:21.919> pretty<00:05:22.250> good<00:05:22.370> it's<00:05:22.610> not<00:05:22.760> as

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
and this one is pretty good it's not as

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.200 
and this one is pretty good it's not as
thin<00:05:23.360> as<00:05:23.630> the<00:05:23.990> other<00:05:24.169> jelly<00:05:24.830> /<00:05:25.520> creams<00:05:25.940> in<00:05:26.180> the

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
thin as the other jelly / creams in the

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.400 
thin as the other jelly / creams in the
collection<00:05:26.600> it<00:05:26.690> feels<00:05:26.870> like<00:05:26.990> it's<00:05:27.139> a<00:05:27.200> little

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
collection it feels like it's a little

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.900 
collection it feels like it's a little
bit<00:05:27.500> thicker<00:05:27.770> so<00:05:27.889> I<00:05:28.040> have<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.310> bit<00:05:28.580> more<00:05:28.610> control

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
bit thicker so I have a bit more control

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.210 
bit thicker so I have a bit more control
and<00:05:29.330> it's<00:05:29.419> easier<00:05:29.720> to<00:05:29.780> work<00:05:29.870> with<00:05:30.020> so<00:05:30.980> there<00:05:31.130> is

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
and it's easier to work with so there is

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.430 
and it's easier to work with so there is
one<00:05:31.400> coat<00:05:31.610> of<00:05:31.669> my<00:05:32.000> car<00:05:32.270> has<00:05:32.510> a<00:05:32.540> navigation<00:05:32.780> I'm

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
one coat of my car has a navigation I'm

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.170 
one coat of my car has a navigation I'm
gonna<00:05:33.800> let<00:05:33.980> that<00:05:34.010> dry<00:05:34.370> and<00:05:34.669> come<00:05:34.820> back<00:05:34.940> for<00:05:35.120> a

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
gonna let that dry and come back for a

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.870 
gonna let that dry and come back for a
second<00:05:35.510> coat<00:05:35.690> so<00:05:36.650> here<00:05:36.830> is<00:05:36.919> two<00:05:37.160> coats<00:05:37.400> that<00:05:37.580> my

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
second coat so here is two coats that my

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.140 
second coat so here is two coats that my
car<00:05:38.120> has<00:05:38.390> navigation<00:05:39.610> so<00:05:40.610> this<00:05:40.730> one<00:05:40.880> covers

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
car has navigation so this one covers

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.240 
car has navigation so this one covers
completely<00:05:41.690> on<00:05:41.870> two<00:05:42.140> coats<00:05:42.440> and<00:05:42.770> it<00:05:42.919> deepens

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
completely on two coats and it deepens

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.670 
completely on two coats and it deepens
the<00:05:43.400> color<00:05:43.430> up<00:05:43.790> quite<00:05:44.090> a<00:05:44.120> bit<00:05:44.410> again<00:05:45.410> the

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
the color up quite a bit again the

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.620 
the color up quite a bit again the
formula<00:05:45.950> is<00:05:46.220> a<00:05:46.250> little<00:05:46.520> bit<00:05:46.640> thicker<00:05:46.880> than<00:05:47.000> the

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
formula is a little bit thicker than the

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.409 
formula is a little bit thicker than the
other<00:05:47.810> jelly<00:05:48.560> ish<00:05:48.950> creams<00:05:49.430> in<00:05:49.790> the<00:05:49.820> collection

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
other jelly ish creams in the collection

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.090 
other jelly ish creams in the collection
so<00:05:50.570> it<00:05:50.660> is<00:05:50.780> quite<00:05:51.110> a<00:05:51.140> bit<00:05:51.290> easier<00:05:51.590> to<00:05:51.620> work<00:05:51.740> with

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
so it is quite a bit easier to work with

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.130 
so it is quite a bit easier to work with
I<00:05:52.460> will<00:05:53.150> say<00:05:53.300> that<00:05:53.450> this<00:05:53.540> one<00:05:53.690> does<00:05:53.840> have<00:05:54.020> that

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
I will say that this one does have that

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.770 
I will say that this one does have that
weird<00:05:54.410> smell<00:05:55.100> that<00:05:55.580> some<00:05:55.820> blue<00:05:56.030> polishes<00:05:56.570> have

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
weird smell that some blue polishes have

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.969 
weird smell that some blue polishes have
I<00:05:57.110> don't<00:05:57.229> know<00:05:57.350> if<00:05:57.500> you<00:05:57.560> guys<00:05:57.710> have<00:05:57.890> noticed

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
that but some blue polishes have a very

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.600 
that but some blue polishes have a very
unique<00:06:00.350> smell<00:06:00.530> to<00:06:00.680> them<00:06:00.919> and<00:06:01.100> it's<00:06:01.190> definitely

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
unique smell to them and it's definitely

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.250 
unique smell to them and it's definitely
some<00:06:01.940> kind<00:06:01.970> of<00:06:02.210> blue<00:06:02.389> pigment<00:06:02.840> that's<00:06:02.960> used

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
some kind of blue pigment that's used

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.830 
some kind of blue pigment that's used
but<00:06:03.860> this<00:06:03.950> one<00:06:04.160> does<00:06:04.310> have<00:06:04.340> that<00:06:04.850> so<00:06:05.389> that<00:06:05.570> is

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
but this one does have that so that is

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:13.459 
but this one does have that so that is
