hi this is James from mission and today
we're<00:00:04.890> talking<00:00:05.040> about<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.640> mission<00:00:06.029> vm1

volume<00:00:07.799> pedal<00:00:08.059> with<00:00:09.059> mute<00:00:09.360> switch<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:10.019> tuner

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
volume pedal with mute switch and tuner

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:34.620 
volume pedal with mute switch and tuner
and<00:00:11.179> so<00:00:12.179> let's<00:00:12.389> get<00:00:12.570> started

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:49.970 

you

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.979 

so<00:00:50.980> this<00:00:51.160> is<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.489> mission<00:00:51.910> vm1<00:00:52.720> volume<00:00:53.680> pedal

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
so this is the mission vm1 volume pedal

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.930 
so this is the mission vm1 volume pedal
it's<00:00:55.989> a<00:00:56.050> fairly<00:00:56.320> straightforward<00:00:56.940> standard

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
it's a fairly straightforward standard

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.290 
it's a fairly straightforward standard
passive<00:00:58.390> volume<00:00:58.780> pedal<00:00:59.610> with<00:01:00.610> an<00:01:00.730> input<00:01:00.910> on

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
passive volume pedal with an input on

passive volume pedal with an input on
the<00:01:01.629> right-hand<00:01:02.019> side<00:01:02.110> and<00:01:03.509> two<00:01:04.509> outputs<00:01:04.989> on

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
the right-hand side and two outputs on

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.990 
the right-hand side and two outputs on
the<00:01:05.379> left-hand<00:01:05.770> side<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:09.100> top<00:01:09.310> output<00:01:09.790> here

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
the left-hand side the top output here

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.550 
the left-hand side the top output here
goes<00:01:10.930> straight<00:01:11.200> out<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.530> an<00:01:11.619> amp<00:01:11.860> and<00:01:13.289> one<00:01:14.289> nice
