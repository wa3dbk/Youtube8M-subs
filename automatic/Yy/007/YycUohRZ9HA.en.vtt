00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.609
 can teach your dog the side 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.560
 to switch if you are with him at the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.800
 LINE annoying with us is called the command 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.360
 the other side here starts the exercises in the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.309
 stand with the dog on a leash and 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.590
 a toy or a delicious in 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.390
 the hand if your dog migros already on 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.369
 yours looks and reacts without anything in 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.560
 Having a hand could get away from you 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.539
 even so show the hand will then be behind 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.680
 the back without comment on the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.330
 other side led 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.010
 the dog should store the neckar 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.130
 toy or just the hand behind 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.840
 follow you 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.410
 he arrives on the other side 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.390
 rewarded 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.570
 either stroking the toy 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.489
 or feed the their repeated indefinitely 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.530
 until the dog sure times the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.660
 page changes then he leads the command 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.250
 for example, another page 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.260
 He says the command and for the dog 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.960
 directly in connection to the other side 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.340
 Rewarded there immediately if that 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.520
 Am works well you do that 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.230
 same year while running so easy 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.879
 the dog with your hand behind yours 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.699
 lure back to the other side and 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.220
 reward him there and you know that 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.220

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.900
 repeat like your dog by the way 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.850
 The can teach walk on a leash 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.799

 By the way, this can be done during the training 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.780
 happen that your dog independently 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.530
 the page wants to change to a delicious 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.049
 to get 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.369
 you have to prevent that you can 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.750
 either over the leash make him 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.880
 just go back to the other one 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.950
 side pull his way with his foot 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.650
 barred or him by hand just 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.150
 push back again 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.070
 the page will only be changed if you 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.759
