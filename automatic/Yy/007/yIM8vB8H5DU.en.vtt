 japan but we are in milan 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.910
 however we say that the event was 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.189
 organized everything in Japanese style the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.380
 person you see orazio corva di di 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.080
 sony mobile and will introduce us to some of the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.869
 news in particular one of the sony 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.000
 xperia z the new smartphone presented 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.710
 recently from da sony 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.620
 here is what you want us to see 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.820
 with so much compliments x the kimono for the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:44.250
 he also filmed a real movie 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:47.039
 mass has set us are actually 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.230
 we are here in a Japanese setting 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.610
 because clearly this is japan 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.160
 home recalls our mother house 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.140
 I am in Japan to its culture and 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.030
 internet and innovation in this too 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.440
 case related to the Japanese world sony 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.969
 let's talk now about collectivity 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.559
 this product has explains z2 technologies 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.260
 that allow us to you with one 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.490
 collectivity very simple wifi aims 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.970
 therefore the possibility of 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.020
 transmit in duplicate the cacace the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.970
 produced on a TV set, for example 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.100
 enel.si to enable this 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.100
 technology with just a touch 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.110
 same speech for television 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.420
 displays and on the TVs that bit 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.220
 support and foreign and remote control with 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.590
 enel.si t integrated 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.670
 at this point I do nothing but 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.840
 bring the two products together in such a way 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.179
 who recognize themselves as 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.460
 well so we'll see you see for a moment 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.539
 a little but puts we must also say that 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.240
 both products 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.179
 we say no the definitive software are 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.709
 still two samples are found again 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:58.299
 let's see now the two connect and this 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.549
 and then the final result is the 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:06.159
 possibilities as we will see now of 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.780
 play the real phone interface 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.869
 of the smartphone by explains z 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.090
 directly on the big screen like 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.690
 you see wheel automatically absurd 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.540
 as obviously the phone rotates 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.910
 sorry we can pay to review 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.739
 this is this scene that is important to you 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.489
 please excuse this idea 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.170
 important we see it here and then 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.459
 clearly one of the uses more 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.750
 frequent can be that of 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.510
 sharing of multimedia content 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.700
 of pictures of images here I enter 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.190
 in my album and obviously select 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.140
 I see an image of yours as you see it 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.170
 real time on the TV 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.370
 obviously I can then peek into this 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.549
 case on par 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.010
 among the various images and view them 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.720
 directly without lag this important 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.680
 so in a really beautiful way 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.400
 reactivity on the display of my treviso lo 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.420
 same text as speech itself 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.920
 we can make the entity with others 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.200
 multimedia content and we can 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.030
 do also with the games with maps with 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.819
 youtube and browse so let's say that 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.010
 we have a 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.230
 accurate production of exact ideas 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.019
 endless that of this is wifi nigra 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.879
 cas this and sony one touch 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.939
 here is a little insight 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.709
 then soon after we will turn instead the 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.999
 video to see more in detail all 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.099
 phone features 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:27.099
 absolutely thanks thanks to all 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.609
 here we see another study 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:36.919
 always on the sony xperia ze it is the 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:40.189
 mirror link now you want to explain yes 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.510
 we first saw wifi technology 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.700
 aims at cas then other way of 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.590
 display connectivity on the TV today 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.780
 instead now we see instead the 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.669
 display duplication found 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.959
 produced on a car audio system with 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.909
 another technology that is called 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.060
 mirrorlink a standard we don't talk about 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.669
 system or protocol closed where however 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.500
 here on the car audio system in this 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:03.469
 case obviously I know farini we can 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.299
 reproduce the entire interface of the 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.819
 product now let's see how it is activated 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.409
 automatically a sony car application 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.229
 which evidently has as its purpose that 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:15.019
 utri until I can simply 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:19.099
 touch directly from my display 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:22.970
 home card system and enjoy the music 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:24.800
 which I eg in my phone in the 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.580
 my smartphone rather than clearly 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.919
 go to reproduce the maps reproduce 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.500
 navigation for example therefore 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.150
 using google maps or other 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.159
 important thing even going 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.199
 now we'll see him see it all 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.360
 complete interface interface 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.830
 phone oil then other 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.970
 connectivity technology in this 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.970
 case for the car world
