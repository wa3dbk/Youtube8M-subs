 which is a good js point file 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.189
 then we go to the installation first 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.169
 obviously they have to install the blog 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.509
 launcher and good as lots 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.340
 administered we open it and good since 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.200
 is open the blog launcher what 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.200
 we are going to do is click the button at 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.379
 button of adjustments or options we give 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.880
 click there and we will manage mod 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.980
 scripts 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.070
 we give him for example I here I have it 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.450
 but we will eliminate and good for you 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.210
 they will have it like that if they have it turned off 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.400
 then they start it then let's go 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.700
 to import then we're going to 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.650
 local storage and download where 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.300
 will be the file downloaded or in the 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.739
 folder that you have it and good 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.440
 then we are going to download it is called 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.440
 tumán items point jy if we click there 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.659
 we give it here and it's already activated 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.340
 let's give it back 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.700
 and well, now all that's missing is a world 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.140
 see to see if the good mode is ok 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.140
 let's create a world of survival 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.800
 we wait for the boys to load us 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.190
 so there is not much lag 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.840
 and well I think it is already if it is 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.970
 so what we 're going to see now is that 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.440
 here below there is a button with a letter m 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.300
 then let's open it 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.520
 and with here he tells us that start 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.750
 building blocks armor e 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.570
 instruments we are going to see for example 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.320
 instruments let's diamond sword 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.520
 let's put a lot of swords of 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.600
 diamond that we want for example to 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.060
 put two we give in 64 position and you 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.820
 we give in adding 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.409
 we already have 64 space and diamond we are going to 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.840
 put us to mature for example helmet 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.659
 diamond add 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.369
 and how they see it would be the dynamics so 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.600
 I think this mode is pretty good 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.359
