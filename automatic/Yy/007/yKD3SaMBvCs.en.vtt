a<00:02:38.010> triangle<00:02:38.400> section<00:02:38.819> here<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:40.260> now<00:02:40.829> we<00:02:40.889> have

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
a triangle section here so now we have

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.280 
a triangle section here so now we have
our<00:02:41.519> triangle<00:02:41.819> section<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.019> I'm<00:02:43.109> going<00:02:43.230> to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
our triangle section so I'm going to

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.699 
our triangle section so I'm going to
split<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.739> hair<00:02:43.769> in<00:02:44.159> three<00:02:45.709> working

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
underhanded I'm going to take our

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.300 
underhanded I'm going to take our
section<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.889> our<00:02:49.919> from<00:02:50.430> our<00:02:50.519> right<00:02:52.010> under<00:02:53.010> our

into the middle so now we're going to

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.470 
into the middle so now we're going to
work<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.859> same<00:03:02.400> technique<00:03:02.879> all<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.359> way

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
now that I'm getting to the ends I'm

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.640 
now that I'm getting to the ends I'm
gonna<00:03:51.760> leave<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:52.090> couple<00:03:52.330> inches<00:03:52.540> out<00:03:52.930> because

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
gonna leave a couple inches out because

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.650 
gonna leave a couple inches out because
we're<00:03:53.830> gonna<00:03:53.950> pancake<00:03:54.580> this<00:03:54.790> out<00:03:55.060> so<00:03:55.360> I<00:03:55.420> want

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
we're gonna pancake this out so I want

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.660 
we're gonna pancake this out so I want
the<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:56.200> don't<00:03:56.500> want<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.739> elastic<00:03:57.190> to<00:03:57.220> travel

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
the I don't want the elastic to travel

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.490 
the I don't want the elastic to travel
too<00:03:57.819> far<00:03:57.849> up<00:03:58.269> so<00:03:58.989> I'm<00:03:59.050> going<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.260> end<00:03:59.410> this

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
too far up so I'm going to end this

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.930 
too far up so I'm going to end this
simply<00:03:59.950> just<00:04:00.910> secure<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.480> with<00:04:01.569> an<00:04:01.690> elastic

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
simply just secure it with an elastic

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.000 
simply just secure it with an elastic

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
and now I'm going to repeat the same

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:21.090 
and now I'm going to repeat the same
technique<00:04:06.280> on<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.970> opposite<00:04:07.420> side

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
so now I'm just gonna secure the ends

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.260 
so now I'm just gonna secure the ends
with<00:04:23.480> an<00:04:23.690> elastic<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:24.770> now<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.340> fun<00:04:25.760> begins

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270
