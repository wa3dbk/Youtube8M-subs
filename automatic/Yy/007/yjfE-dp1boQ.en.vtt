 wants to come to help 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.580
 subsequently I will have to attack the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.729
 pulmonary cardiopulmonary resuscitation 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.710
 I will perform 30 massage and 2 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.090
 insufflations 30 massages I come 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.680
 place my hands on the chest at 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.280
 middle of the chest and I come 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:52.740
 4 to 5 cm deep on a naked body and 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:56.700
 on a hard surface 1 2 es3 es4 es5 es6 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.679
 es7 es8 es9 es10 i do this 30 times 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.380
 after I come to do two breaths 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.750
 I just toggle back was past 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.130
 the nose and come to blow by encompassing 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.479
 my mouth around the mouth of the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.479
 victim not to leak 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.450
 I just get my breathing 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.820
 on it and I'm doing a second 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.900
 insufflations and I went back on 30 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.640
 massage two three three four five thirty 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.590
 times until help arrives 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.090
 the situation you just saw so 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.460
 the unconscious victim who does not breathe 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.450
 not that actually corresponds to a stop 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.930
 cardiac that this product about 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.730
 seventy nine times a year in France 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.170
 the effectiveness of the relief is conditioned 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.360
 to the reaction of the first witnesses as 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.130
 you could see the first gestures 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.780
 which are the chest compressions and 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.580
 the 21 string outputs are essential 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.810
 by the first witness so that the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.880
 relief constituted that these are the 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.770
 firefighters then and the barges 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.020
 may have the best 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.190
 chances to animate the person what 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.870
 means that the first witnesses a 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.780
 essential role in the chain of 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.060
 first aid it is very important 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.370
 that the first witness on the victims 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.720
 how do these chest compressions 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.290
 face to mouth face prevent 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.240
 rescue 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.430
 it will greatly improve efficiency 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.350
 relief and it will allow a rate of 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.130
 recovery of cardiac arrest 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.190
 much more important than the hour 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.190
 current
