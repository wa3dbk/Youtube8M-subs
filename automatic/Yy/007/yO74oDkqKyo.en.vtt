let's say these motors are more of a
torque<00:02:49.500> motor<00:02:49.709> than<00:02:50.010> they<00:02:50.099> were<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.250> horsepower

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
torque motor than they were a horsepower

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.030 
torque motor than they were a horsepower
motor<00:02:51.260> it's<00:02:52.260> got<00:02:52.410> plenty<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.800> torque

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
motor it's got plenty of torque

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.770

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
see it kicks and kicks down good

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.869

good solid little truck rear end was

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.170 
good solid little truck rear end was
real<00:03:56.569> rebuilt<00:03:57.170> in<00:03:57.350> it<00:03:57.500> as<00:03:57.620> well<00:03:57.650> i<00:03:58.100> did<00:03:58.670> when<00:03:59.060> i

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
real rebuilt in it as well i did when i

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.940 
real rebuilt in it as well i did when i
bought<00:03:59.420> it<00:03:59.450> i<00:03:59.660> did<00:03:59.810> put<00:04:00.050> in<00:04:00.230> mobile<00:04:00.770> one

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950

he royal with the

limited-slip differential additive

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.809 
limited-slip differential additive
because<00:04:08.950> this<00:04:09.069> does<00:04:09.250> have<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.459> limited-slip

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
because this does have a limited-slip

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
rear end in it I just did that basically

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.030 
rear end in it I just did that basically
because<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.780> truck<00:04:14.019> came<00:04:14.230> out<00:04:14.409> of<00:04:14.530> Texas<00:04:14.920> and

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
because the truck came out of Texas and

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.259 
because the truck came out of Texas and
I<00:04:15.099> don't<00:04:15.250> know<00:04:15.310> what<00:04:15.459> he<00:04:15.549> had<00:04:15.730> in<00:04:15.760> there<00:04:16.120> and

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
I don't know what he had in there and

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.550 
I don't know what he had in there and
our<00:04:16.389> winners<00:04:16.690> are<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.900> little<00:04:17.019> colder<00:04:17.410> here

our winners are a little colder here

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.670 
our winners are a little colder here
than<00:04:17.620> they<00:04:17.889> are<00:04:18.040> down<00:04:18.250> there<00:04:18.430> so<00:04:19.320> just<00:04:20.320> want<00:04:20.590> to

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
than they are down there so just want to

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.580 
than they are down there so just want to
make<00:04:20.769> sure<00:04:20.829> it<00:04:21.130> was<00:04:21.250> good<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.519> protect
