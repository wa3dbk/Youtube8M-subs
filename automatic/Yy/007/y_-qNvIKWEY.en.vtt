away<00:01:17.810> at<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.290> ends<00:01:25.990> by<00:01:26.990> pulling<00:01:27.350> sections<00:01:27.799> of

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
away at the ends by pulling sections of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.310

this isn't cut diagonally to create
gradual<00:01:32.810> layers<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:35.710> repeat<00:01:36.710> this<00:01:36.890> step<00:01:37.189> many

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
gradual layers I repeat this step many

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.350 
gradual layers I repeat this step many
times<00:01:37.759> throughout<00:01:38.090> my<00:01:38.330> hair<00:01:38.600> on<00:01:43.119> parts<00:01:44.119> of<00:01:44.240> my

of<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.789> feathered<00:01:47.149> kind<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.539> texture<00:01:50.110> this<00:01:51.110> will

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
of a feathered kind of texture this will

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:52.899 
of a feathered kind of texture this will
make<00:01:51.319> the<00:01:51.590> end<00:01:51.770> sharp<00:01:51.890> art<00:01:52.429> and<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.700> layers

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
make the end sharp art and the layers

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.539 
make the end sharp art and the layers
will<00:01:53.179> appear<00:01:53.509> more<00:01:53.720> obviously<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:57.280> then<00:01:58.280> take

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
will appear more obviously I then take

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.340 
will appear more obviously I then take
figger<00:01:58.850> sections<00:01:59.390> of<00:01:59.509> hair<00:01:59.539> and<00:01:59.990> using<00:02:00.319> my

figger sections of hair and using my

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.380 
figger sections of hair and using my
thinning<00:02:00.860> scissors<00:02:01.429> on<00:02:01.580> them<00:02:01.819> this<00:02:02.179> will<00:02:02.360> take

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
thinning scissors on them this will take

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.300 
thinning scissors on them this will take
her<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.869> lot<00:02:03.110> of<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.350> bulk<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.740> hair<00:02:03.950> that's<00:02:04.190> on

one side as I have a side pong I

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.229 
one side as I have a side pong I
obviously<00:02:06.920> have<00:02:07.250> more<00:02:07.280> hair<00:02:07.729> on<00:02:07.759> one<00:02:07.970> side

than<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.450> other<00:02:08.539> which<00:02:09.289> then<00:02:09.530> makes<00:02:09.739> that

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
than the other which then makes that

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.570 
than the other which then makes that
size<00:02:10.280> vicar<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:10.970> heavier<00:02:12.190> once<00:02:13.190> I've<00:02:13.370> cut

that<00:02:17.750> section<00:02:18.109> isn't<00:02:18.290> us<00:02:18.560> because<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.040> just

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
that section isn't us because it just

was<00:02:20.890> now<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:21.920> we<00:02:22.220> want<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.549> cut<00:02:22.760> in<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:22.970> layers

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
was now I we want to cut in the layers

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.210 
was now I we want to cut in the layers
on<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.480> top<00:02:23.720> part<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.019> my<00:02:24.079> head<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.709> clipping

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
on the top part of my head and clipping

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.679 

by<00:02:31.069> clipping<00:02:31.370> sections<00:02:31.909> of<00:02:32.030> hair<00:02:32.060> out<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.510> the

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
by clipping sections of hair out of the

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.330 
by clipping sections of hair out of the
way<00:02:32.900> this<00:02:33.290> will<00:02:33.500> make<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.739> process<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.159> lot

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
way this will make the process a lot

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.610 
way this will make the process a lot
easier<00:02:34.400> for<00:02:35.060> me<00:02:35.209> otherwise<00:02:35.900> I'll<00:02:36.319> have<00:02:36.379> to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
easier for me otherwise I'll have to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:44.230 
easier for me otherwise I'll have to
work<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.220> lot<00:02:37.489> of<00:02:37.519> hair<00:02:37.849> in<00:02:37.939> one<00:02:38.150> go

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.510 

I<00:02:44.390> trim<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.230> layers<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.770> top<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.070> my<00:02:46.340> head

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
I trim the layers on the top of my head

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.370 
I trim the layers on the top of my head
a<00:02:46.580> lot<00:02:46.820> shorter<00:02:47.150> which<00:02:47.690> will<00:02:47.870> give<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.170> hair

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
a lot shorter which will give the hair

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.960 
a lot shorter which will give the hair
more<00:02:48.620> volume<00:02:49.100> because<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.550> weight<00:02:49.730> from<00:02:49.880> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
more volume because the weight from the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.580 
more volume because the weight from the
hair<00:02:50.180> has<00:02:50.270> been<00:02:50.420> cut<00:02:50.480> out

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.130 

this<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.519> how<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.700> get<00:02:58.000> short<00:02:58.269> choppy<00:02:58.569> layers<00:02:58.870> in

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
this is how I get short choppy layers in

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.910 
this is how I get short choppy layers in
my<00:02:59.170> hair<00:02:59.349> as<00:03:00.840> I'm<00:03:01.840> growing<00:03:02.050> my<00:03:02.140> fringe<00:03:02.560> are<00:03:02.769> I

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
my hair as I'm growing my fringe are I

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.350 
my hair as I'm growing my fringe are I

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
won't be able to show you how I usually

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:31.410 
won't be able to show you how I usually
have<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.810> cut

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.780 

to<00:03:32.020> cut<00:03:32.230> pieces<00:03:32.500> in<00:03:32.770> the<00:03:32.890> back<00:03:33.069> of<00:03:33.250> my<00:03:33.280> hair<00:03:33.640> I

my head hopefully now you can see some
of<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.110> layers<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.709> put<00:03:44.980> back<00:03:45.130> into<00:03:45.340> my

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
of the layers that I put back into my

i<00:04:20.380> can<00:04:20.530> because<00:04:21.100> it<00:04:21.220> was<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.400> lot<00:04:21.610> lighter<00:04:21.850> and

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
i can because it was a lot lighter and

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.980 
i can because it was a lot lighter and
