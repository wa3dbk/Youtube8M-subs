00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
what kind of matrix switcher you have a

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.370 
what kind of matrix switcher you have a
4<00:00:25.140> by<00:00:25.320> 2<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.980> 4<00:00:26.279> by<00:00:26.430> 4<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:27.000> 8<00:00:27.480> by<00:00:27.720> 8<00:00:27.750> we're

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
4 by 2 a 4 by 4 and 8 by 8 we're

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.670 
4 by 2 a 4 by 4 and 8 by 8 we're
supporting<00:00:28.710> wire<00:00:29.099> storm<00:00:29.580> which<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.140> this<00:00:31.969> HDMI

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680

supporting wire storm which is this HDMI
matrix<00:00:34.680> switcher<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.309> can<00:00:35.430> see<00:00:35.670> you've

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
matrix switcher and you can see you've

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.700 
matrix switcher and you can see you've
got<00:00:36.350> 1<00:00:37.350> 2<00:00:37.710> 3<00:00:39.469> 4<00:00:40.760> outputs<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:42.989> output<00:00:43.170> 1

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
got 1 2 3 4 outputs so this is output 1

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.590 
got 1 2 3 4 outputs so this is output 1
output<00:00:43.980> 2<00:00:44.870> output<00:00:45.870> 3<00:00:46.200> output<00:00:46.739> 4<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.480> you

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
output 2 output 3 output 4 and then you

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.310 
output 2 output 3 output 4 and then you
have<00:00:48.750> 1<00:00:49.170> 2<00:00:49.440> 3<00:00:49.739> 4<00:00:50.160> 4<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> inputs<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:52.110> then<00:00:52.199> we've

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
have 1 2 3 4 4 the inputs and then we've

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.990 
have 1 2 3 4 4 the inputs and then we've
got<00:00:52.440> our<00:00:52.500> keypads<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.640> standard

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
got our keypads you just your standard

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.650 
got our keypads you just your standard
you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.390> keypads<00:00:55.460> this<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.760> zone<00:00:57.000> 1<00:00:57.030> and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
you know keypads this one is zone 1 and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.139 
you know keypads this one is zone 1 and
this<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.649> zone<00:00:59.160> 2<00:00:59.480> so<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.600> go<00:01:00.750> over<00:01:00.960> here<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
this is zone 2 so we go over here to the

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.450 
this is zone 2 so we go over here to the
little<00:01:03.149> web-based<00:01:03.600> admin<00:01:04.199> page<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.860> we'll

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
little web-based admin page and we'll

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.899 
little web-based admin page and we'll
select<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.420> 4<00:01:07.380> by<00:01:07.530> 4<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:08.670> we'll<00:01:08.790> just

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
select that it's a 4 by 4 and we'll just

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.149 
select that it's a 4 by 4 and we'll just
do<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> pretty<00:01:09.420> simple<00:01:09.960> set<00:01:10.439> up<00:01:10.560> here<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.920> will

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
do a pretty simple set up here that will

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.980 
do a pretty simple set up here that will
just<00:01:11.400> do<00:01:13.189> rust<00:01:14.189> sound<00:01:14.400> source<00:01:14.760> one<00:01:15.210> with

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
just do rust sound source one with

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.880 
just do rust sound source one with
switcher<00:01:16.409> input<00:01:16.740> 1<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.470> we'll<00:01:19.470> set<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.740> up

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
switcher input 1 and we'll set that up

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.380 
switcher input 1 and we'll set that up
as<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> rough<00:01:20.369> sound<00:01:20.549> controller<00:01:21.060> since<00:01:21.299> we

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
as a rough sound controller since we

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.530 
as a rough sound controller since we
only<00:01:21.509> have<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.920> we<00:01:22.920> only<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> single<00:01:24.360> one

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
only have one we only do the single one

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.039 
only have one we only do the single one
and<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:26.100> rough<00:01:26.430> sound<00:01:26.700> zone<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.750> essence

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
and the rough sound zone so in essence

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.800 
and the rough sound zone so in essence
what<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.350> basically<00:01:28.740> means<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.810> any

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
what this basically means is that any

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.550 
what this basically means is that any
source<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.829> let's<00:01:32.040> say<00:01:32.130> I've<00:01:32.280> got<00:01:32.310> source<00:01:32.850> 1<00:01:33.240> in

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
source so let's say I've got source 1 in

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.940 
source so let's say I've got source 1 in
this<00:01:34.560> case<00:01:34.799> our<00:01:35.070> source<00:01:35.549> one<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.420> XM<00:01:37.259> Radio<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
this case our source one is XM Radio and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.069 
this case our source one is XM Radio and
that's<00:01:38.729> how<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.060> set<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.509> up<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.720> your<00:01:39.840> Russ

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
that's how you set it up in your Russ

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.499 
that's how you set it up in your Russ
sound<00:01:40.320> system<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:40.939> we're<00:01:41.939> gonna<00:01:42.030> say<00:01:42.299> that

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
sound system so we're gonna say that

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.639 
sound system so we're gonna say that
source<00:01:42.899> 1<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.979> had<00:01:44.100> an<00:01:44.220> XM<00:01:44.670> radio<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:46.229> in

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
source 1 if we had an XM radio in in

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.490 
source 1 if we had an XM radio in in
this<00:01:46.770> case<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.060> connected<00:01:48.390> via<00:01:48.659> HDMI

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
this case that it was connected via HDMI

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.230 
this case that it was connected via HDMI
we<00:01:50.430> had<00:01:50.549> mapped<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.509> input<00:01:53.030> we'd<00:01:54.030> map

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
we had mapped that to input we'd map

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.780 
we had mapped that to input we'd map
that<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.570> input<00:01:54.960> 1<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.189> go<00:01:56.520> down<00:01:56.729> here

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
that to input 1 and you can go down here

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.639 
that to input 1 and you can go down here
and<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.420> know<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.750> sake<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.380> switch

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and you know for the sake we can switch

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.850 
and you know for the sake we can switch
it<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> input<00:01:59.250> 2<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.820> switch<00:01:59.939> these<00:02:00.329> two

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
it to input 2 and switch these two

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.950 
it to input 2 and switch these two
around<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.790> hit<00:02:03.030> save<00:02:03.299> settings<00:02:03.630> that

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
around and if you hit save settings that

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.770 
around and if you hit save settings that
actually<00:02:04.290> saves<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.710> into<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.040> EEPROM<00:02:05.430> and

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
actually saves that into the EEPROM and

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.930 
actually saves that into the EEPROM and
there<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.960> got<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.590> we'll<00:02:08.429> do<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.700> little

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
there you got it so we'll do this little

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.450 
there you got it so we'll do this little
test<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:10.319> way<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.679> should<00:02:11.009> work<00:02:11.250> is

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
test and the way that it should work is

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.860 
test and the way that it should work is
when<00:02:13.970> we<00:02:14.090> go<00:02:14.240> to<00:02:14.300> source<00:02:15.340> one<00:02:16.540> which<00:02:17.540> would<00:02:17.720> be

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
when we go to source one which would be

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.750 
when we go to source one which would be
X<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.260> radio<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:19.460> switcher<00:02:20.120> on<00:02:20.350> zone<00:02:21.350> 1<00:02:21.760> should

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
X on radio the switcher on zone 1 should

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:31.210 
X on radio the switcher on zone 1 should
switch<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:24.170> input<00:02:24.680> 2<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:26.980> on<00:02:27.980> zone<00:02:28.610> 2<00:02:30.220> we

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
switch to input 2 and on zone 2 we

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
switch to input 2 and on zone 2 we
should<00:02:31.520> have<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:34.220> same<00:02:34.250> thing<00:02:34.760> happen<00:02:35.120> as

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
should have the same thing happen as

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.750 
should have the same thing happen as
well<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:35.660> we're<00:02:35.990> just<00:02:36.020> doing<00:02:36.260> our<00:02:36.470> mapping<00:02:36.770> for

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
well so we're just doing our mapping for

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.940 
well so we're just doing our mapping for
the<00:02:37.790> HDMI<00:02:38.300> switcher<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:39.220> we're<00:02:40.220> gonna<00:02:40.310> go<00:02:40.880> here

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
the HDMI switcher so we're gonna go here

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.130 
the HDMI switcher so we're gonna go here
XM<00:02:42.950> radio<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.610> you'll<00:02:43.700> look<00:02:44.120> at<00:02:44.270> zone<00:02:44.600> 2<00:02:44.930> down

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
XM radio and you'll look at zone 2 down

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.470 
XM radio and you'll look at zone 2 down
there<00:02:45.440> when<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.460> cycle<00:02:47.450> through<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.400> AM<00:02:49.700> FM<00:02:50.090> we

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
there when I cycle through so AM FM we

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.650 
there when I cycle through so AM FM we
just<00:02:50.690> pushed<00:02:50.990> AM<00:02:51.290> FM<00:02:51.590> which<00:02:52.430> we<00:02:52.880> switch<00:02:53.270> so<00:02:53.540> it

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
just pushed AM FM which we switch so it

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.530 
just pushed AM FM which we switch so it
should<00:02:53.870> go<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.400> input<00:02:55.400> 1<00:02:55.760> which<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.090> just<00:02:56.360> did

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
should go to input 1 which you just did

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.760 
should go to input 1 which you just did
that<00:02:56.890> now<00:02:57.890> when<00:02:58.220> we<00:02:58.370> go<00:02:58.490> to<00:02:58.550> input<00:02:59.440> 3<00:03:00.440> which<00:03:00.620> is

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
that now when we go to input 3 which is

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.290 
that now when we go to input 3 which is
media<00:03:01.040> server<00:03:01.400> it<00:03:02.270> just<00:03:02.540> changed<00:03:02.990> it<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.470> input

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
media server it just changed it to input

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.220 
media server it just changed it to input
3<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:06.350> if<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.590> go<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.280> DVD<00:03:07.550> changer<00:03:07.990> it<00:03:08.990> just

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
3 and if I go to the DVD changer it just

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.510 
3 and if I go to the DVD changer it just
switched<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:09.740> to<00:03:10.840> input<00:03:11.840> 4<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.980> then<00:03:13.370> we'll

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
switched it to input 4 and then we'll

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.010 
switched it to input 4 and then we'll
zoom<00:03:14.060> out<00:03:14.240> here<00:03:14.300> a<00:03:14.510> little<00:03:14.630> bit<00:03:14.780> so<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.990> can

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
zoom out here a little bit so you can

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.930 
zoom out here a little bit so you can
see<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.640> how<00:03:16.640> quickly<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:17.209> actually<00:03:17.540> does<00:03:17.750> it

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
see it how quickly it actually does it

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.550 
see it how quickly it actually does it
now<00:03:19.940> we're<00:03:20.120> in<00:03:20.209> you<00:03:20.930> can<00:03:21.080> see<00:03:21.260> we're<00:03:21.440> actually

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
now we're in you can see we're actually

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.930 
now we're in you can see we're actually
in<00:03:21.920> input<00:03:22.489> 5<00:03:22.880> which<00:03:23.840> we<00:03:23.989> don't<00:03:24.140> have<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.320> 5<00:03:24.709> or<00:03:25.070> 6

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
in input 5 which we don't have a 5 or 6

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.150 
in input 5 which we don't have a 5 or 6
if<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.810> have<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.019> 8<00:03:27.140> by<00:03:27.320> 8<00:03:27.350> you<00:03:27.890> could

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
if you have the 8 by 8 you could

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.640 
if you have the 8 by 8 you could
actually<00:03:28.400> switch<00:03:28.940> that<00:03:29.209> as<00:03:29.330> well<00:03:29.540> or<00:03:29.780> map<00:03:30.350> any

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
actually switch that as well or map any

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.130 
actually switch that as well or map any
one<00:03:30.860> of<00:03:30.890> these<00:03:31.090> further<00:03:32.090> ones<00:03:32.360> you<00:03:32.720> know<00:03:32.810> you

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
one of these further ones you know you

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.220 
one of these further ones you know you
just<00:03:33.320> change<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.830> source<00:03:34.160> over<00:03:34.489> here<00:03:35.110> so<00:03:36.110> now

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
just change the source over here so now

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.350 
just change the source over here so now
we're<00:03:36.320> going<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.500> go<00:03:36.560> back<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.950> source<00:03:37.250> input<00:03:37.610> 1

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
we're going to go back to source input 1

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.770 
we're going to go back to source input 1
which<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:38.900> should<00:03:39.110> see<00:03:39.140> it<00:03:39.470> switch<00:03:39.830> to<00:03:40.780> number

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
which you should see it switch to number

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.870 
which you should see it switch to number
2<00:03:42.170> because<00:03:42.500> remember<00:03:42.530> we<00:03:42.890> change<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:43.670> and

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
2 because remember we change that and

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.270 
2 because remember we change that and
then<00:03:44.510> number<00:03:44.989> 2<00:03:45.410> source<00:03:46.989> will<00:03:47.989> be<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.890> input

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
then number 2 source will be the input

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.090 
then number 2 source will be the input
number<00:03:49.790> 1<00:03:50.000> on<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.360> HDMI<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.410> then<00:03:51.650> we<00:03:51.769> go<00:03:51.890> over

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
number 1 on the HDMI and then we go over

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.770 
number 1 on the HDMI and then we go over
to<00:03:52.220> zone<00:03:53.030> 1

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
to zone 1

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.050 
to zone 1
we're<00:03:54.410> on<00:03:54.530> am/fm<00:03:56.860> now<00:03:57.860> we're<00:03:58.190> on<00:03:58.310> media<00:03:58.670> server

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
we're on am/fm now we're on media server

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.470 
we're on am/fm now we're on media server
you<00:03:59.540> just<00:03:59.780> switched<00:04:00.019> it<00:04:01.030> we're<00:04:02.030> on<00:04:02.150> DVD

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
you just switched it we're on DVD

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.420 
you just switched it we're on DVD
changer<00:04:02.750> which<00:04:03.170> is<00:04:03.350> number<00:04:04.130> four<00:04:04.900> now<00:04:05.900> five

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
changer which is number four now five

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.670 
changer which is number four now five
six<00:04:07.430> we<00:04:08.209> go<00:04:08.360> back<00:04:08.600> to<00:04:08.780> 1<00:04:09.019> you<00:04:09.290> can<00:04:09.440> see<00:04:09.590> it

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
six we go back to 1 you can see it

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.640 
six we go back to 1 you can see it
mapped<00:04:09.920> it<00:04:10.130> to<00:04:10.250> 2<00:04:10.600> which<00:04:11.600> is<00:04:11.720> XM<00:04:12.049> Radio<00:04:12.380> and

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
mapped it to 2 which is XM Radio and

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.640 
mapped it to 2 which is XM Radio and
then<00:04:13.250> am/fm<00:04:14.030> mapped<00:04:14.269> it<00:04:14.450> to<00:04:14.570> 1<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.530> other

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
then am/fm mapped it to 1 and the other

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.190 
then am/fm mapped it to 1 and the other
cool<00:04:15.890> thing<00:04:16.100> too<00:04:16.310> is<00:04:16.489> that<00:04:16.519> let's<00:04:17.450> say<00:04:17.690> someone
