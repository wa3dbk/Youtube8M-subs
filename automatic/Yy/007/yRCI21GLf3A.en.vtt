00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
juicing and look at what you haven't

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.970

putting<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.599> your<00:00:27.720> juice<00:00:27.960> machines<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.800> going

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
putting in your juice machines and going

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.189 
putting in your juice machines and going
through<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> learning<00:00:29.400> curve<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:30.240> what<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
through the learning curve of what to

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.120 
through the learning curve of what to
juice<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> thought<00:00:32.790> I'd<00:00:32.940> do<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> video<00:00:33.510> on

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
juice and so I thought I'd do a video on

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.740 
juice and so I thought I'd do a video on
the<00:00:35.130> best<00:00:35.340> fruits<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.760> veggies<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.210> juice<00:00:36.450> and

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the best fruits and veggies to juice and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.970 
the best fruits and veggies to juice and
also<00:00:37.440> I've<00:00:37.500> been<00:00:37.620> getting<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> lot<00:00:37.920> of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
also I've been getting a lot of

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.920 
also I've been getting a lot of
questions<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.640> what<00:00:39.090> are<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.450> best<00:00:39.600> fruits

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930

through<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.750> learning<00:00:42.870> curve<00:00:43.200> myself<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.950> I

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
through a learning curve myself and I

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.150 
through a learning curve myself and I
thought<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.210> would<00:00:45.390> share<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.980> what<00:00:46.980> are

produce a better yield of in from the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.069 
produce a better yield of in from the
juicer<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.670> find<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.360> spinach<00:01:42.899> and

juicer and I find that the spinach and
the<00:01:43.259> microgreens<00:01:43.979> kind<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.909> my<00:01:45.210> juicer

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the microgreens kind of in my juicer

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.560 
the microgreens kind of in my juicer
anyway<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.200> kind<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.560> sit<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
anyway just kind of sit in the in the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.450 
anyway just kind of sit in the in the
receptacle<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.460> rather<00:01:50.460> than<00:01:52.220> produce<00:01:53.220> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
receptacle here rather than produce a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.819 
receptacle here rather than produce a
lot<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.880> juice<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.780> for<00:01:55.170> me<00:01:55.290> they're

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
lot of juice and so for me they're

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.880 
lot of juice and so for me they're
better<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.939> my<00:01:57.840> high<00:01:58.110> speed<00:01:58.380> blender<00:02:00.409> so<00:02:01.409> here

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
better in my high speed blender so here

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.959

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
nutritional content in berries so in my

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.000 
nutritional content in berries so in my
