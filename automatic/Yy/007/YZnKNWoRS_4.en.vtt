00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
some of them are small holes where you

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.490 
some of them are small holes where you
just<00:00:56.160> stick<00:00:56.370> one<00:00:56.520> finger<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.090> these<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.260> trick

just stick one finger in these the trick

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.549 
just stick one finger in these the trick
is<00:00:58.710> since<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.879> hole<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.390> rather<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.960> ring<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
is since the hole is rather the ring is

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.680 
is since the hole is rather the ring is
rather<00:01:01.770> large<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:03.809> trick<00:01:04.079> is<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:05.390> SiC<00:01:06.390> three

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
rather large the trick is to SiC three

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.300 
rather large the trick is to SiC three
fingers<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:08.780> leaving<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.979> thumb<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
fingers in leaving out the thumb and the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.850 
fingers in leaving out the thumb and the
pinkie<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.880> taking<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:12.720> two<00:01:13.170> fingers<00:01:13.590> on

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
pinkie and taking your two fingers on

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.950 
pinkie and taking your two fingers on
the<00:01:14.070> edges<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> Ring<00:01:14.790> your<00:01:15.330> index<00:01:15.690> in<00:01:15.840> your

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the edges of the Ring your index in your

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.640 
the edges of the Ring your index in your
pointer<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.470> sort<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.990> pushing<00:01:18.990> them<00:01:19.140> against

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
pointer and sort of pushing them against

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.140 
pointer and sort of pushing them against
the<00:01:20.189> ring<00:01:20.460> four<00:01:21.200> so<00:01:22.200> you're<00:01:22.430> stabilized<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the ring four so you're stabilized the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.490 
the ring four so you're stabilized the
move<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.590> fan<00:01:26.340> doesn't<00:01:26.549> fly<00:01:27.380> when<00:01:28.380> you're

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
move so the fan doesn't fly when you're

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.679 
move so the fan doesn't fly when you're
doing<00:01:28.830> your<00:01:28.860> spin<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.670> hits<00:01:29.880> yourself<00:01:30.450> or

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
doing your spin and it hits yourself or

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.350 
doing your spin and it hits yourself or
someone<00:01:30.960> else<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:32.790> used<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
someone else so it's just used to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.990 
someone else so it's just used to
stabilize<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.619> movement<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:37.250> once<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.490> get

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
stabilize that movement so once you get

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.679 
stabilize that movement so once you get
the<00:01:39.150> hang<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:40.040> your<00:01:41.040> fire<00:01:41.340> fans<00:01:41.700> try<00:01:42.270> simple

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the hang of your fire fans try simple

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.840 
the hang of your fire fans try simple
simply<00:01:43.140> doing<00:01:43.880> one<00:01:44.880> spin<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.570> then<00:01:45.869> lock<00:01:46.850> so

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
simply doing one spin and then lock so

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.670 
simply doing one spin and then lock so
once<00:01:48.119> pin<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.630> lock<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.229> helps<00:01:49.560> with

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
once pin and lock this helps with

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.140 
once pin and lock this helps with
control<00:01:50.100> when<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> first<00:01:50.579> start<00:01:50.880> your

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
control when you first start your

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.760 
control when you first start your
spinning<00:01:51.659> moves<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:54.240> lock<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.720> simply<00:01:55.170> just

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
spinning moves to lock you simply just

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.960 
spinning moves to lock you simply just
grab<00:01:56.119> grab<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.630> ring<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.590> when<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.860> spin<00:01:59.159> it's

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
grab grab the ring so when you spin it's

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.620 
grab grab the ring so when you spin it's
open<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:01.530> use<00:02:03.020> your<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:05.670> use<00:02:05.880> your<00:02:06.180> wrist
