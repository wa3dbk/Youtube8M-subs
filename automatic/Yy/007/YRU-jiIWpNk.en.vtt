00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:09.620
 so then another result of my labors 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:13.830
 this cattle to sunny window frame 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.420
 usually I already glazed was the base 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:22.080
 from her prisal 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:24.510
 and with sizes with further here it is 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.070
 walls that splice the previous 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.740
 video telling how to make them 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:37.250
 Sinok assholes throw this proponent such 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.840
 corner just a press washer 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:48.170
 anyone hooked on does not go anywhere 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.170
 and this is already stubborn 2 just in case 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.890
 like this 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.750
 corner was a drilled hole 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:11.870
 then cut the slot with scissors 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:16.520
 now it is here open 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:19.550
 here is a tray of folded from tinned 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.590
 tin used to bee stores sold 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.690
 I had a box we chopped like a container not 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.830
 the most successful option but I took it apart 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:36.650
 on life bent tray good just 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:40.880
 almost the size of the rim of the dawn and doing here 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.620
 pins this barrel with a hole through 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.300
 which will flow molten 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.580
 wax 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:52.190
 died will remain here razmerchik 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:57.560
 decent here you can get it 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:01.300
 here flocks of the frame of all from Lena 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:10.670
 several layers of shops and at least some 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:23.120
 or here is the framework succeeded 2 rows of 11 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:26.709
 pieces each row will go in like this 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.709
 riveted all soldered 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:39.620
 from behind it rests on a bar bolted 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:44.080
 body in front until the bath is true 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.510
 handbag, too, seems swung very 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.260
 some kind of high volume rollers too 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:55.220
 the same tin second sheet truth not 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.970
 very good first damn lump second 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.000
 the box will be better there is space below 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.150
 remains think someday you suddenly 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.760
 there tile stuffed but if you suddenly want 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.420
 an end in itself save on electricity for 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.420
 account sun 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.030
 In the future, of course painted black 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:26.160
 painted from all over the outside again rather 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:34.080
 From the inside I do not know what can be and not what 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:38.670
 let it be for sure 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:49.860
 there will be a second glass here it is rather 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:53.100
 just put the second glass 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:57.900
 just overlap the top straight and stick 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.770
 its on silicone sealant this is to 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.530
 In case of precipitation , let the water roll down from 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.220
 he doesn't get inside the frame here in 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.210
 mailers 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.090
 and here between the frame and the case is just 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:15.290
 window seals corpse checks sticking 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:19.310
 will normally well here such here 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.310
 another device
