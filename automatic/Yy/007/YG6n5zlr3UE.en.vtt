00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.379
 fault is at the request of the club administration 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.260

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.579
 still do not adhere to the principle 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.770
 no matter how much the concert starts 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.090
 legalism in time to trouble we 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.460
 finish then when it allows 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.840

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.100

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.320
 such a clip 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.540
 this is such a futuristic clip 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.780
 cosmic what is it new yes it at all 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.240
 they honestly say it themselves 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.310
 shoot a clip and we don't know when 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.200
 what will be the output so we are very me 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.579
 it always seems like that or or or this 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.290
 only here you always seem to me 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.450
 we say that it is only with us because 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.520
 we shoot less often than not and because 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.950
 if we shoot a clip this is about 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.380
 always something unexpected turns out 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.180
 something so supernatural even for 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.659
 us so it is amazing costumes 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.420
 silvery multicolored with 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.319

 sell well 7 understand pro March 24 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.720
 I would like to ask more details 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.700
 because March 24th and already posters starting 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.250
 meet in the ice palace 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.810
 I thought May 20 affectionate why affectionate 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.450
 but not clear but in the first group 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.480
 affectionate may 25 years old i was born in the past 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.370
 in this year 25 we decided to connect 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.069
 wait you wait you decide 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.500
 connect on the ground that the producers 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.660
 Bari Karimovitch Alibasov and Mr. Razin 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.090
 something like that is not very unworthy task 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.190
 very simple since bar and andrew 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.109
 Razin they sworn friends by the way 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.569
 get along in a group with Barry 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:55.430
 karim than alibasovym how many lines 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.049
 this master for you at the end is fair in 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.209
 concert he of course you when here 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:03.220
 put the program and you think in 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.260
 I think this program is not without 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.970
 him at every concert backstage and 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.130
 the fact is that here we are only with glory 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.889
 can tell the truth in time save 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.400
 I do not the first such lightning rod 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:20.750
 tolerates 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.569
 I'm probably a little bit behind my character 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.310
 with buy conflict and I have my own truth 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.360
 whatever it is I understand that adults 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.310
 experienced person and 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.040
 behind my back and yet for how long 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.900
 traveled into behind him is either 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:41.720
 already in group 6 a little over 6 years old 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:43.909
 how do we have a concert bar read to us 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.000
 lecture for hours after 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:51.010

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.010
 viewers and photographing say 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.879
 after these we hang out he tries it in 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.500
 case to control the situation what 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.409
 happens on stage yes how does it work 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.930
