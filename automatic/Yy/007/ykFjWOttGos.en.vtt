00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
what's up guys you're watching JS to

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.439 
what's up guys you're watching JS to
sins<00:00:02.220> and<00:00:02.429> I<00:00:02.490> hear<00:00:02.669> it<00:00:02.760> almost<00:00:03.030> every<00:00:03.419> single

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
sins and I hear it almost every single

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.240 
sins and I hear it almost every single
day<00:00:03.870> with<00:00:04.049> people<00:00:04.200> asking<00:00:04.470> what<00:00:04.980> they<00:00:05.100> should

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
day with people asking what they should

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.590 
day with people asking what they should
buy<00:00:05.400> for<00:00:05.460> their<00:00:05.730> brand-new<00:00:06.029> computers<00:00:06.450> or

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
buy for their brand-new computers or

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.210 
buy for their brand-new computers or
when<00:00:06.810> they're<00:00:06.930> upgrading<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.620> they<00:00:07.919> want<00:00:08.130> to

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
when they're upgrading and they want to

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.680 
when they're upgrading and they want to
know<00:00:08.309> if<00:00:08.429> solid<00:00:08.790> states<00:00:09.059> are<00:00:09.240> worth<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.660> price

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
know if solid states are worth the price

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.570 
know if solid states are worth the price
are<00:00:10.170> they<00:00:10.320> really<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.620> much<00:00:10.950> better<00:00:11.280> than

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
are they really that much better than

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.310 
are they really that much better than
hard<00:00:12.090> drives<00:00:12.330> do<00:00:12.480> they<00:00:12.599> perform<00:00:12.780> are<00:00:13.170> they

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
hard drives do they perform are they

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.079 
hard drives do they perform are they
fast<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.860> are<00:00:13.920> they<00:00:14.009> worth<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.309> price<00:00:14.610> and

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
fast and are they worth the price and

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.790 
fast and are they worth the price and
today<00:00:15.210> that's<00:00:15.630> exactly<00:00:16.199> what<00:00:16.560> we're<00:00:16.710> gonna

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
today that's exactly what we're gonna

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:28.189 
today that's exactly what we're gonna
find<00:00:17.010> out<00:00:26.449> okay<00:00:27.449> guys<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.900> gonna<00:00:28.019> be<00:00:28.140> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
find out okay guys this is gonna be a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.870 
find out okay guys this is gonna be a
really<00:00:28.529> quick<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.769> easy<00:00:28.949> video<00:00:29.220> because<00:00:29.730> when

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
really quick and easy video because when

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.429 
really quick and easy video because when
it<00:00:30.000> comes<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.330> solid<00:00:30.689> state<00:00:30.929> versus<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
it comes to solid state versus the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.889 
it comes to solid state versus the
mechanical<00:00:31.920> drive<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.969> definitely<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
mechanical drive this is definitely a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.660 
mechanical drive this is definitely a
no-brainer<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> cost<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.309> solid-state

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
no-brainer with the cost of solid-state

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.430 
no-brainer with the cost of solid-state
drives<00:00:36.120> really<00:00:36.480> dropping<00:00:36.989> over<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> last

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
drives really dropping over the last

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.619 
drives really dropping over the last
year<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.730> should<00:00:39.059> really<00:00:39.390> consider

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
year so you should really consider

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.720 
year so you should really consider
dropping<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.260> solid-state<00:00:40.829> drive<00:00:41.129> as<00:00:41.370> your

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
dropping a solid-state drive as your

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.250 
dropping a solid-state drive as your
main<00:00:41.850> operating<00:00:42.390> system<00:00:42.719> drive<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.110> your

bucks but your operating system on it

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.130 
bucks but your operating system on it
which<00:00:50.460> will<00:00:50.640> dramatically<00:00:51.420> improve<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
which will dramatically improve the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.170 
which will dramatically improve the
performance<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:52.890> computer<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.059> can

game that you want to load faster you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.450 
game that you want to load faster you
just<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.589> know<00:01:04.710> right<00:01:04.739> off<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> bat<00:01:05.430> that

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
just have to know right off the bat that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.000 
just have to know right off the bat that
having<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> solid-state<00:01:06.450> drive<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.960> not<00:01:07.350> going

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
having a solid-state drive is not going

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.620 
having a solid-state drive is not going
to<00:01:08.100> increase<00:01:08.400> your<00:01:08.729> gaming<00:01:09.000> performance

the hard drive is spinning it's only

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.340
