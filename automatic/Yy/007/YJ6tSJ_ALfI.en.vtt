this<00:00:36.030> computer<00:00:36.600> back<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.739> summer<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.070> 2010

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
this computer back in the summer of 2010

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.549 
this computer back in the summer of 2010
at<00:00:38.910> an<00:00:39.180> eleven<00:00:39.570> hundred<00:00:39.690> dollar<00:00:39.989> price<00:00:40.290> tag

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
at an eleven hundred dollar price tag

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.310 
at an eleven hundred dollar price tag
but<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> was<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> limited<00:00:41.489> run<00:00:41.750> production<00:00:42.750> item

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
but it was a limited run production item

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.869 
but it was a limited run production item
because<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.710> was<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.950> celebrate<00:00:44.160> their<00:00:44.550> 25th

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
because it was to celebrate their 25th

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.490 
because it was to celebrate their 25th
year<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.510> business<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.469> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
year in the business so really a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.860 
year in the business so really a
proof-of-concept<00:00:47.190> device<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.239> show<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.660> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
proof-of-concept device to show that a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.990 
proof-of-concept device to show that a
dual<00:00:49.440> screen<00:00:49.920> computer<00:00:50.579> could<00:00:50.850> be

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
dual screen computer could be

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.639 
dual screen computer could be
manufactured<00:00:51.629> again<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.079> only<00:00:52.289> dual

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
manufactured again this is the only dual

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.310 
manufactured again this is the only dual
screen<00:00:53.010> device<00:00:53.280> out<00:00:53.550> there<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.660> runs<00:00:54.960> any

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
screen device out there that runs any

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.430 
screen device out there that runs any
operating<00:00:55.890> system<00:00:56.210> let<00:00:57.210> alone<00:00:57.239> windows<00:00:57.870> 7<00:00:58.260> of

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
operating system let alone windows 7 of

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.840 
operating system let alone windows 7 of
course<00:00:58.649> there<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.890> nothing<00:00:59.219> out<00:00:59.399> there<00:00:59.640> like

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
course there is nothing out there like

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.880 
course there is nothing out there like
this<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.629> that's<00:01:00.809> why<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.440> proof<00:01:01.800> of

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
this so that's why it was a proof of

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.310 
this so that's why it was a proof of
concept<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.359> companies<00:01:03.750> take

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
concept I like to see companies take

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.380 
concept I like to see companies take
this<00:01:04.559> or<00:01:04.830> make<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.369> sort<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.760> gamble<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.360> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
this or make this sort of gamble on a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.330 
this or make this sort of gamble on a
product<00:01:06.750> unfortunately<00:01:07.439> toshiba<00:01:07.890> didn't<00:01:08.189> go

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
product unfortunately toshiba didn't go

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.679 
product unfortunately toshiba didn't go
you<00:01:09.240> know<00:01:09.330> broad<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.130> risk<00:01:12.030> because<00:01:12.210> they

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
you know broad on that risk because they

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.929 
you know broad on that risk because they
did<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> limited<00:01:13.619> run<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.580> you're<00:01:14.790> able

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
did do a limited run so if you're able

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.190 
did do a limited run so if you're able
to<00:01:15.119> find<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.509> these<00:01:15.659> they'll<00:01:15.900> still

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
to find one of these they'll still

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.359 
to find one of these they'll still
probably<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.860> eleven<00:01:17.280> hundred

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
probably be in that eleven hundred

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.730 
probably be in that eleven hundred
dollar<00:01:17.640> ballpark<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.720> they<00:01:19.020> originally

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
dollar ballpark that they originally

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.100 
dollar ballpark that they originally
retailed<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.299> may<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.869> device

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
retailed for but it may be the device

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.260 
retailed for but it may be the device
for<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.340> point<00:01:23.700> eight<00:01:23.909> pound

processor<00:01:34.369> so<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.670> didn't

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
processor so they really didn't

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.940 
processor so they really didn't
sacrifice<00:01:36.180> anything<00:01:36.659> there<00:01:37.140> like<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> lot

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
sacrifice anything there like that a lot

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.280 
sacrifice anything there like that a lot
it<00:01:38.790> does<00:01:39.060> eat<00:01:39.299> into<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> battery<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> little

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
it does eat into the battery a little

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.310 
it does eat into the battery a little
bit<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:42.450> know<00:01:42.570> really<00:01:42.780> nothing<00:01:43.229> to

ahead<00:05:07.790> and<00:05:08.240> close<00:05:08.480> it<00:05:08.540> up<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:08.930> actually<00:05:09.140> show

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
ahead and close it up and actually show

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.440 
ahead and close it up and actually show
you<00:05:09.500> guys<00:05:09.770> what<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:10.580> build<00:05:10.790> is<00:05:10.940> actually<00:05:11.270> like

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
you guys what the build is actually like

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.260 
you guys what the build is actually like
they<00:05:12.290> did<00:05:12.500> build<00:05:12.740> all<00:05:13.070> of<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.400> components

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
they did build all of the components

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.960 
they did build all of the components
into<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.140> lid<00:05:15.380> so<00:05:16.100> as<00:05:16.220> you<00:05:16.340> can<00:05:16.460> see<00:05:16.700> up<00:05:16.940> here

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
into the lid so as you can see up here

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.300 
into the lid so as you can see up here
we've<00:05:17.390> got<00:05:17.420> a<00:05:17.900> fan<00:05:18.440> as<00:05:18.770> well<00:05:18.800> as<00:05:19.070> you<00:05:19.160> may<00:05:19.280> have

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
we've got a fan as well as you may have

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.400 
we've got a fan as well as you may have
noticed<00:05:19.670> the<00:05:19.820> vent<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.540> ventilation<00:05:21.110> here

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
noticed the vent the ventilation here

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.850 
noticed the vent the ventilation here
that's<00:05:22.130> because<00:05:22.520> all<00:05:22.730> of<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:23.290> the<00:05:24.290> CPU

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
that's because all of the the CPU

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.130 
that's because all of the the CPU
essentially<00:05:25.730> all<00:05:25.910> of<00:05:25.940> those<00:05:26.330> hard<00:05:27.050> working

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
essentially all of those hard working

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.770 
essentially all of those hard working
parts<00:05:27.830> that<00:05:28.010> are<00:05:28.130> going<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:28.580> get<00:05:28.730> hot<00:05:29.000> are<00:05:29.300> in

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
parts that are going to get hot are in

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.140 
parts that are going to get hot are in
the<00:05:29.930> lid<00:05:30.080> now<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.380> idea<00:05:30.860> there<00:05:31.280> is<00:05:31.310> is<00:05:31.880> that

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
the lid now the idea there is is that

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.690 
the lid now the idea there is is that
this<00:05:32.330> is<00:05:32.390> the<00:05:32.750> handheld<00:05:33.260> device<00:05:33.650> so<00:05:34.040> much<00:05:34.520> like

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
this is the handheld device so much like

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.760 
this is the handheld device so much like
a<00:05:34.730> laptop<00:05:35.270> where<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:36.050> bottom<00:05:36.410> is<00:05:36.500> prone<00:05:36.740> to

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
a laptop where the bottom is prone to

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.530 
a laptop where the bottom is prone to
get<00:05:37.010> hot<00:05:37.160> I<00:05:37.370> think<00:05:37.580> toshiba<00:05:37.940> realized<00:05:38.300> it

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
get hot I think toshiba realized it

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.030 
get hot I think toshiba realized it
wouldn't<00:05:38.690> make<00:05:38.810> a<00:05:38.870> lot<00:05:39.050> of<00:05:39.080> sense<00:05:39.200> to<00:05:39.710> put<00:05:39.860> all

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
wouldn't make a lot of sense to put all

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.190 
wouldn't make a lot of sense to put all
those<00:05:40.250> components<00:05:40.580> in<00:05:40.880> the<00:05:40.970> bottom<00:05:41.300> since

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
those components in the bottom since

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.050 
those components in the bottom since
this<00:05:42.350> is<00:05:42.410> really<00:05:42.710> going<00:05:43.040> to<00:05:43.130> be<00:05:43.310> handheld<00:05:43.640> do

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
this is really going to be handheld do

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.670 
this is really going to be handheld do
you<00:05:44.120> descend<00:05:44.660> up<00:05:44.750> burning<00:05:45.050> your<00:05:45.170> hands<00:05:45.410> now

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
you descend up burning your hands now

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.170 
you descend up burning your hands now
I'm<00:05:45.980> not<00:05:46.130> saying<00:05:46.340> that<00:05:46.400> this<00:05:46.580> top<00:05:46.790> lid<00:05:47.000> has

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
I'm not saying that this top lid has

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.790 
I'm not saying that this top lid has
ever<00:05:47.330> gotten<00:05:47.540> that<00:05:47.720> hot<00:05:47.990> but<00:05:48.500> it<00:05:48.590> does

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
ever gotten that hot but it does

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.130 
ever gotten that hot but it does
certainly<00:05:49.040> heat<00:05:49.550> up<00:05:49.790> as<00:05:50.510> you<00:05:50.630> can<00:05:50.780> see<00:05:50.930> here

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
certainly heat up as you can see here

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.800 
certainly heat up as you can see here
