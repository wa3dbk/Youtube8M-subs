00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hi in this tutorial i will show you how 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.640
 the photos of your flipbook 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.280
 imports 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.679
 premiere I will let you first 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.950
 see how you look like a folder structure 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.950
 must see 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:22.320
 just look at where my documents 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.029
 I made it on Sint Lucas with the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.119
 different periods is now in 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.970
 period one point a leaf and root 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.270
 and in how you project flipbook 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.170
 I have collected my photos therein 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.480
 Neatly numbered and the sound as you please 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.879
 project flipbook in this way 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.739
 that is structured and that is already sufficient 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.239
 for your review 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.850
 there a number of points come by but 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.870
 the later I come to the tutorial and you 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.520
 Start 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.489
 premiere on restart 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.460
 so then you get this window then you go 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.879
 start a new project so click your 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.879
 project 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.420
 then you can choose a lot inside the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.750
 window starts here that is default 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.189
 well that goes immediately the location of 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.229
 point your folder where come premiere 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.759
 find your project it goes how much 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.299
 location pope then i go very briefly 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.950
 look at me 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.290
 documents lucas here he stood this is 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:40.020
 so my head can have this one 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:42.210
 select i am i click choose the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.040
 name of my project that would not 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.720
 call flipbook because if you later 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.119
 the stuff going in life go 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.100
 and everyone who mentions 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.850
 project flip book then becomes natural 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.470
 a bit difficult 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.240
 so you just enter your name here 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.920
 may add the flipbook as an addition 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.710
 or you give your flipbook a 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.290
 title but in this case put your name 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:09.440
 neighborhood 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:11.670
 rens is nice booklet and i click okay 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.720
 then I come back to events where I have one 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.170
 many choices must and can make 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:22.200
 we do not we work on big screen 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.650
 also not very high quality so the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.000
 I would now choose the dv setting 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.380
 paul 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.320
 that 's for standard 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.740
 setting for europe and living now 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.380
 where live in the europe so this one 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.380
 standard 48 times hits 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.390
 is fine you can get a name again 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.380
 You can also fill pacey injury on one 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:55.890
 late 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:55.890
 I cookie okay 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.280
 if he needs some time you will come 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.140
 in the window of 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:08.080
 premiere itself in which you can work with 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.790
 different separate windows what you like 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.300
 must do first if you go stuff 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.760
 import into the career program 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.470
 set preferences and preference 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.230
 the ones that sit with the people that are on the PC 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.260
 are there this with the people who are up? 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.860
 the mac are if you put it under the heading 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.470
 premiere pro itself first to the 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.570
 preferences and I just go for a moment 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.810
 to the general the general 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.810
 people 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.860
 this is standard on 25 frames 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.730
 because you have 24 or 25 frames per second 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.500
 125 below is standard here 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.570
 we do not want this because you do 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.260
 make a stop motion and then consists of 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.690
 fewer frames per second 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.290
 so this I am already half center 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.290
 12 left and how long I have my image 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.050
 in picture we let be the still image 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.540
 level party I can imagine here 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.240
 can of course check what 125 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.600
 frames is on screen let alone that 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.700
 very long so I would go here 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.560
 and now the case a lot this number to 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.540
 downstairs where I think you are 6 a 8 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.790
 frame sin world that what for 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.020
 Stop-motion is sufficient, I put it here 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.020
 at 8 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.930
 this is handy sizes that fill up 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.479
 skill to frame size then it fits 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:37.340
 automatically your images 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.270
 I now click okay well then I can 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.090
 to start 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.030
 where will i start i have above in 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.860
 I have make library it can be so 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.669
 that look a bit different and then 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.490
 the workspace is the workspace 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.009
 otherwise set that you can hear here 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:59.000
 changing luxspace may state 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.860
 million so late I 'll be like that 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.449
 I myself also think it 's handy to be on that 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.060
 other way to work but well me 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.060
 now let it stand as it is open 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.729
 that manual is and then I go here 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.539
 just a few pictures and some stuff 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.539
 bring in 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.729
 by the way, I see that with you 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.860
 that manual and the windows look different 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.949
 looking will point as well as equalize 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.330
 and what I have here in the upper left is listed 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:31.690
 you 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.430
 in the bottom left, I take a quick look at how 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.979
 Hereby you will look the same and you 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.400
 sees that this window here he is too 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.919
 colored yellow and means I'm in that 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.740
 window working 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.810
 I also see Francis flipbook here 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.870
 everyone has their own name there 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:56.840
 project if I am in this window 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:59.240
 now double click I can import stuff 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.909
 this is immediately in control for yourself 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.039
 if you come to the right folder now 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:06.289
 then you know you are at the beginning when it 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:08.030
 start of project the right easy 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.039
 reigns here you come now again a whole 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.130
 another folder correctly means that you have one 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.900
 have not set the correct number of steps 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.970
 so then it seems wise to briefly 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.639
 to start again 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:23.289
 well you see here in my pet flip book 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:26.979
 that mat with pictures 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:27.610
 I can click this folder and I can 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:30.089
 say 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.089
 import 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.999
 grabbed that whole folder with those photos 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:39.520
 at the same time 

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:42.819
 look here they are all standing on 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.729
 order and the handy is now you can now 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:49.300
 pick it up i click on we go 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:50.499
 mouse and I go to the timeline 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.419
 place 

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:58.719
 you put it on a video layer and release it 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:01.689
 and that's what it says on my space bar 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:03.189
 printing plays in my video right away 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:05.020
 or 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:09.490
 Pressing my spacebar he stops 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.639
 the movie and initially it would 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.819
 I 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:16.460
 just a moment on the button 

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:18.819
 backspace or you don't backspace 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.819
 on 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:26.509
 do you do at siemens and then run and facts 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:28.460
 in 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:31.370
 work and yes this is his knowledge as 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.830
 you get that impression right away you 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:37.009
 projects are now all that you already have 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.960
 have done if let that a project on 

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:41.389
 well this first tutorial here too 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:45.289
 leave and then I will go soon 

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:47.470
 continue with the top two 

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:51.580
 and I'll leave you some other things there 

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:55.039
 needed and get enough for 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:57.970
 I slip you in to your stop motion of you
