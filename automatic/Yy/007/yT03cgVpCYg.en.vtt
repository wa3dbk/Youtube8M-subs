mates have suggested which is the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.540 
mates have suggested which is the
chaotic<00:00:14.370> staff<00:00:15.109> versus<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.619> virtus<00:00:17.190> formed

chaotic staff versus the virtus formed

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.609 
chaotic staff versus the virtus formed
and<00:00:17.730> booked<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.660> let's<00:00:18.840> get<00:00:19.050> straight<00:00:19.320> into

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
and booked so let's get straight into

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.060 
and booked so let's get straight into
these<00:00:20.010> stats<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:21.090> if<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.570> watch<00:00:21.750> my<00:00:22.080> recent

Gore long sword versus dry gourmets you
may<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.449> known<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:31.019> my<00:00:31.529> friends<00:00:32.009> made<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
may have known that my friends made the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.250 
may have known that my friends made the
thumbnail<00:00:32.820> well<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.270> haven't<00:00:33.840> made<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
thumbnail well I haven't made the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.990 
thumbnail well I haven't made the
thumbnail<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.860> time<00:00:35.100> as<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.430> might<00:00:35.610> be<00:00:35.790> able

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.780 
thumbnail this time as you might be able
to<00:00:36.090> know<00:00:36.350> are<00:00:37.350> seeing<00:00:37.739> as<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.129> may<00:00:38.370> be<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.579> bit

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
to know are seeing as it may be a bit

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.380 
to know are seeing as it may be a bit
simpler<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:39.930> anyway<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.530> my<00:00:41.250> friends<00:00:41.820> because

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
simpler but anyway so my friends because

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.080 
simpler but anyway so my friends because
I<00:00:42.719> don't<00:00:42.750> actually<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.320> these<00:00:43.530> weapons

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
I don't actually have these weapons

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.880 
I don't actually have these weapons
volunteered<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.420> they<00:00:45.960> are<00:00:46.050> both<00:00:46.200> tier<00:00:46.620> 80

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
volunteered and they are both tier 80

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.790 
volunteered and they are both tier 80
weapons<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:49.079> chaotic<00:00:50.039> staff<00:00:50.430> has<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:51.800> 1924

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
weapons and the chaotic staff has a 1924

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.630 
weapons and the chaotic staff has a 1924
accuracy<00:00:53.460> same<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.420> he<00:00:54.600> virtus<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.920> that

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
accuracy same as he virtus but that

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.670 
accuracy same as he virtus but that
costs<00:00:57.320> 200,000<00:00:58.320> dungeoneering<00:00:58.920> tokens<00:00:59.550> and

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
costs 200,000 dungeoneering tokens and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.750 
costs 200,000 dungeoneering tokens and
basically<00:01:01.680> he<00:01:01.920> killed<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> king<00:01:02.579> black

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
basically he killed the king black

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.119 
basically he killed the king black
dragon<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.899> not<00:01:04.320> weak<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.710> anything

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
dragon as this is not weak to anything

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.210 
dragon as this is not weak to anything
and<00:01:05.369> he<00:01:06.180> recorded<00:01:06.630> speed<00:01:07.110> time<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.619> 50<00:01:07.979> kills

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and he recorded speed time of 50 kills

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.120 
and he recorded speed time of 50 kills
so<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> fastest<00:01:09.600> kill<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.200> was<00:01:10.830> around

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
so the fastest kill with this was around

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.240 
so the fastest kill with this was around
37<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.360> half<00:01:12.390> seconds<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.590> slowest<00:01:14.040> was

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
37 and a half seconds the slowest was

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.420 
37 and a half seconds the slowest was
around<00:01:14.549> 45<00:01:15.270> seconds<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.680> average<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.159> all

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
around 45 seconds and the average of all

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.859 
around 45 seconds and the average of all
the<00:01:17.460> kills<00:01:17.820> was<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.570> over<00:01:18.990> 40<00:01:19.470> seconds<00:01:19.950> so

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
the kills was just over 40 seconds so

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.719 
the kills was just over 40 seconds so
the<00:01:21.869> same<00:01:22.650> was<00:01:23.100> virtus<00:01:23.869> accuracy<00:01:24.869> was<00:01:25.729> 1924

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the same was virtus accuracy was 1924

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.569 
the same was virtus accuracy was 1924
and<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.720> not<00:01:28.020> stun<00:01:28.350> generic<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.460> be

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and this is not stun generic this can be

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.740 
and this is not stun generic this can be

so<00:02:13.880> another<00:02:14.120> reason<00:02:14.360> why<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.870> might<00:02:15.290> want<00:02:15.319> to

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
so another reason why you might want to

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.479 
so another reason why you might want to
buy<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.890> vs.<00:02:16.459> book<00:02:16.700> is<00:02:17.800> why<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:18.860> fond<00:02:19.190> of<00:02:19.220> books

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
buy the vs. book is why so fond of books

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.180 
buy the vs. book is why so fond of books
re<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:20.030> they<00:02:20.720> may<00:02:20.930> be<00:02:20.989> better<00:02:21.260> because<00:02:21.770> there's

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
re is they may be better because there's

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.009 
re is they may be better because there's
your<00:02:22.370> wheel<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.000> basically<00:02:23.360> what<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.630> mean<00:02:23.840> by

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
your wheel so basically what I mean by

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.100 
your wheel so basically what I mean by
this<00:02:24.080> is<00:02:24.470> when<00:02:25.370> you're<00:02:25.670> using<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.239> using<00:02:26.959> them

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
this is when you're using you using them

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.710 
this is when you're using you using them
you<00:02:27.319> can<00:02:27.470> form<00:02:27.920> an<00:02:28.130> ability<00:02:28.370> called

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
you can form an ability called

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.420 
you can form an ability called
concentrated<00:02:29.720> blast<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.349> it's<00:02:30.890> your<00:02:31.040> target

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
concentrated blast and it's your target

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.550 
concentrated blast and it's your target
three<00:02:31.700> times<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.420> each<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.840> increases<00:02:33.380> the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
three times and each it increases the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.890 
three times and each it increases the
chances<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.459> your<00:02:34.640> next<00:02:34.910> hit<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.300> be<00:02:35.390> critical

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
chances of your next hit to be critical

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.860 
chances of your next hit to be critical
so<00:02:36.080> that's<00:02:36.230> when<00:02:36.440> it's<00:02:36.620> like<00:02:37.450> it's<00:02:38.450> kind<00:02:38.780> of

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
so that's when it's like it's kind of

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.110 
so that's when it's like it's kind of
exploded<00:02:39.560> like<00:02:39.709> 3d<00:02:40.310> rather<00:02:40.670> than<00:02:40.850> just<00:02:41.030> a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
exploded like 3d rather than just a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.199 
exploded like 3d rather than just a
normal<00:02:41.299> hit<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:42.190> most<00:02:43.190> people<00:02:43.610> think<00:02:43.880> it's

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
normal hit and most people think it's

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.600 
normal hit and most people think it's
quite<00:02:44.480> overpowered<00:02:45.170> at<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.250> level<00:02:46.519> of

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
quite overpowered at the level of

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.270 
quite overpowered at the level of
fattest<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.269> is<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:48.110> if<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.980> use<00:02:49.130> the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
fattest that is so if you use the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.330 
fattest that is so if you use the
ability<00:02:49.700> with<00:02:49.940> something<00:02:50.269> like<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:51.100> don't<00:02:52.100> know

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
ability with something like I don't know

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.140 
ability with something like I don't know
level<00:02:53.000> 61<00:02:53.569> that<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.799> graphic<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:55.640> think<00:02:55.910> and

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
level 61 that is graphic I think and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150 
level 61 that is graphic I think and
then<00:02:56.720> you<00:02:56.750> hit<00:02:56.989> that<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.319> won't<00:02:57.500> be<00:02:57.650> overpower

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
then you hit that it won't be overpower

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.670 
then you hit that it won't be overpower
but<00:02:58.430> with<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:58.880> level<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.299> virtus<00:02:59.690> and<00:02:59.989> even

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
but with the level of virtus and even

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.550 
but with the level of virtus and even
seismic<00:03:01.190> really<00:03:01.670> good<00:03:01.850> but<00:03:02.390> he<00:03:02.510> can<00:03:02.690> hit<00:03:02.870> 1000

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
seismic really good but he can hit 1000

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.539 
seismic really good but he can hit 1000
1000<00:03:04.340> 1000<00:03:04.970> in<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.599> quick<00:03:05.930> succession<00:03:06.680> which<00:03:07.400> is

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
1000 1000 in a quick succession which is

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.759 
1000 1000 in a quick succession which is
very<00:03:07.790> effective<00:03:08.180> if<00:03:08.540> you're<00:03:08.780> pvm<00:03:09.319> get<00:03:09.620> out

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
very effective if you're pvm get out

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.460 
very effective if you're pvm get out
those<00:03:10.190> high<00:03:10.580> hits<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.180> carry<00:03:12.079> on<00:03:12.260> with

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
those high hits and carry on with

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.500 
those high hits and carry on with
building<00:03:12.890> up<00:03:13.100> adrenaline<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.060> can<00:03:14.299> get

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
building up adrenaline so you can get

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.900 
building up adrenaline so you can get
onto<00:03:14.690> those<00:03:15.100> Ultimates<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.310> thresholds

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
onto those Ultimates and thresholds

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.330 
onto those Ultimates and thresholds
which<00:03:17.060> ultimately<00:03:17.359> gives<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.410> most<00:03:18.530> XP<00:03:19.040> I

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
which ultimately gives the most XP I

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.240 
which ultimately gives the most XP I
mean<00:03:20.299> does<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.840> most<00:03:20.989> damage

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
mean does the most damage

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.790 
mean does the most damage
so<00:03:23.180> really<00:03:23.600> just<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.990> conclude<00:03:24.200> at<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.680> end

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
so really just to conclude at the end

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.850 
so really just to conclude at the end
here<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.880> buy<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.510> versus<00:03:27.050> won<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.410> book<00:03:27.650> if

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
here you buy the versus won the book if

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.340 
here you buy the versus won the book if
you<00:03:28.190> have<00:03:28.400> for<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.760> money<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.300> because<00:03:30.200> you

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
you have for the money and because you

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.830 
you have for the money and because you
do<00:03:30.470> have<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.680> repair<00:03:31.160> them<00:03:31.370> as<00:03:31.490> well<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:32.480> do

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
do have to repair them as well you do

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.330 
do have to repair them as well you do
have<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:33.080> repair<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.380> chaotic<00:03:33.710> staff<00:03:34.070> as<00:03:34.220> well

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
have to repair the chaotic staff as well

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.100 
have to repair the chaotic staff as well
but<00:03:34.580> that's<00:03:34.700> with<00:03:34.940> tokens<00:03:35.360> and<00:03:35.630> only<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:35.930> small

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
but that's with tokens and only a small

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.610 
but that's with tokens and only a small
amount<00:03:36.530> of<00:03:36.620> XP<00:03:37.040> but<00:03:37.520> basically<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.780> could<00:03:39.410> be

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
amount of XP but basically it could be

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.290 
amount of XP but basically it could be
more<00:03:39.860> effective<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.340> use<00:03:40.460> versus<00:03:40.970> one<00:03:41.150> than

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
more effective to use versus one than

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.930 
more effective to use versus one than
book<00:03:41.450> as<00:03:41.630> it's<00:03:41.810> faster<00:03:42.320> but<00:03:42.500> it<00:03:43.490> does<00:03:43.700> cost

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
book as it's faster but it does cost

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.420 
book as it's faster but it does cost
money<00:03:44.180> whereas<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.230> chaotic<00:03:45.560> staff<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.280> only

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
money whereas the chaotic staff you only

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.570 
money whereas the chaotic staff you only
need<00:03:46.700> 200,000<00:03:47.690> dungeoneering<00:03:48.200> tokens<00:03:48.860> to

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
need 200,000 dungeoneering tokens to

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.250 
need 200,000 dungeoneering tokens to
actually<00:03:50.510> buy<00:03:50.750> it

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
actually buy it

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.100 
actually buy it
they<00:03:51.590> both<00:03:51.800> last<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.580> same<00:03:52.790> length<00:03:53.270> of<00:03:53.570> combat

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
they both last the same length of combat

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.100 
they both last the same length of combat
which<00:03:54.290> is<00:03:54.470> ten<00:03:54.740> hours<00:03:55.030> ten<00:03:56.030> hours<00:03:56.450> of<00:03:56.480> solid

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
which is ten hours ten hours of solid

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.770 
which is ten hours ten hours of solid
combat<00:03:57.530> so<00:03:57.800> if<00:03:57.890> you<00:03:58.100> go<00:03:59.030> back<00:03:59.209> into<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.600> normal

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
combat so if you go back into the normal

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.180 
combat so if you go back into the normal
stance<00:04:00.170> that<00:04:00.350> means<00:04:00.620> you're<00:04:00.740> not<00:04:00.800> in<00:04:00.980> combat

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
stance that means you're not in combat

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.000 
stance that means you're not in combat
anymore<00:04:01.670> but<00:04:02.420> it<00:04:02.959> depends<00:04:03.500> what<00:04:03.650> kind<00:04:03.830> of

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
anymore but it depends what kind of

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.920 
anymore but it depends what kind of
person<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:04.459> are<00:04:04.520> whether<00:04:05.090> you're<00:04:05.360> rich<00:04:05.600> and

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
person you are whether you're rich and

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.870 
person you are whether you're rich and
you<00:04:06.110> don't<00:04:06.320> turn<00:04:06.560> if<00:04:06.770> you<00:04:07.100> don't<00:04:07.310> dungeon<00:04:07.730> here

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
and as I said it depends what kind of

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.920 
and as I said it depends what kind of
person<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:25.310> are<00:04:25.340> if<00:04:25.730> you<00:04:25.940> do<00:04:26.120> have<00:04:26.300> both<00:04:26.600> and
