in<00:00:13.840> this<00:00:14.349> lesson<00:00:14.559> we're<00:00:14.920> going<00:00:14.949> to<00:00:15.070> learn<00:00:15.160> our

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459 
in this lesson we're going to learn our

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.650 
in this lesson we're going to learn our
first<00:00:15.879> minor<00:00:16.270> chord<00:00:16.660> which<00:00:17.080> is<00:00:17.259> a<00:00:17.560> minor<00:00:18.480> now<00:00:19.480> a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
first minor chord which is a minor now a

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.720 
first minor chord which is a minor now a
minor<00:00:19.960> is<00:00:20.230> actually<00:00:20.619> very<00:00:20.650> very<00:00:20.919> similar<00:00:21.400> to

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
minor is actually very very similar to

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.490 
minor is actually very very similar to
the<00:00:21.910> first<00:00:22.180> chord<00:00:22.480> we<00:00:22.630> learn<00:00:22.869> which<00:00:23.079> was<00:00:23.259> C

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
the first chord we learn which was C

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.800 
the first chord we learn which was C
major<00:00:23.910> now<00:00:24.910> we're<00:00:25.029> just<00:00:25.150> going<00:00:25.270> to<00:00:25.300> break<00:00:25.570> down

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
major now we're just going to break down

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.419 
major now we're just going to break down
the<00:00:26.019> notes<00:00:26.230> and<00:00:26.500> just<00:00:26.650> see<00:00:26.830> the<00:00:26.980> differences

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429 
the notes and just see the differences

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.240 
the notes and just see the differences
between<00:00:27.490> them<00:00:28.169> I'll<00:00:29.169> just<00:00:29.529> play<00:00:29.740> a<00:00:29.769> C<00:00:30.039> chord

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
between them I'll just play a C chord

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.869 
between them I'll just play a C chord
just<00:00:30.519> to<00:00:30.640> refresh<00:00:30.910> you

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.250 

if<00:00:36.879> we<00:00:37.030> look<00:00:37.149> at<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.420> core<00:00:37.570> block<00:00:37.840> on<00:00:37.989> the<00:00:38.020> top

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
if we look at the core block on the top

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.930 
if we look at the core block on the top
right<00:00:38.469> we<00:00:38.680> can<00:00:38.829> see<00:00:39.040> that<00:00:39.219> the<00:00:39.280> first<00:00:39.670> and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
right we can see that the first and

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.420 
right we can see that the first and
second<00:00:40.270> fingers<00:00:40.660> are<00:00:41.320> actually<00:00:41.469> identical<00:00:41.800> to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
second fingers are actually identical to

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.759 
second fingers are actually identical to
the<00:00:42.520> C<00:00:42.730> major<00:00:42.940> chord<00:00:43.199> so<00:00:44.199> there's<00:00:44.379> only<00:00:44.530> really

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
the C major chord so there's only really

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.619 
the C major chord so there's only really
one<00:00:44.949> note<00:00:45.340> that's<00:00:45.579> changed<00:00:46.180> and<00:00:46.329> it's<00:00:46.449> the

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
one note that's changed and it's the

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.830 
one note that's changed and it's the
third<00:00:46.870> finger<00:00:47.320> so<00:00:47.980> in<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.790> C<00:00:49.000> major<00:00:49.269> chord<00:00:49.449> we

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
third finger so in the C major chord we

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.130 
third finger so in the C major chord we
had<00:00:49.989> our<00:00:50.110> third<00:00:50.320> finger<00:00:50.590> here<00:00:51.070> on<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.670> cenote

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
had our third finger here on the cenote

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.110 
had our third finger here on the cenote
what<00:00:53.140> we're<00:00:53.230> going<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.409> do<00:00:53.559> now<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:54.100> create<00:00:54.879> the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
what we're going to do now to create the

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.340 
what we're going to do now to create the
a<00:00:55.149> minor<00:00:55.570> is<00:00:55.870> just<00:00:56.199> move<00:00:56.500> this<00:00:56.710> third<00:00:57.010> finger

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
a minor is just move this third finger

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.560 
a minor is just move this third finger
to<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.190> second<00:01:00.609> fret<00:01:00.879> of<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:02.370> 3rd<00:01:03.370> string<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
to the second fret of the 3rd string and

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.830 
to the second fret of the 3rd string and
that's<00:01:04.750> an<00:01:04.930> a<00:01:05.019> note<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:07.240> together<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.750> will

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
that's an a note so together it will

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:18.779 
that's an a note so together it will
sound<00:01:08.020> like<00:01:08.170> this

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.249 

so<00:01:19.789> let<00:01:19.939> us<00:01:19.969> break<00:01:20.299> down<00:01:20.539> the<00:01:20.659> core<00:01:20.869> just<00:01:21.049> a

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
so let us break down the core just a

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.139 
so let us break down the core just a
little<00:01:21.530> just<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.799> show<00:01:22.039> you<00:01:22.070> how<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.700> fingers

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
little just to show you how the fingers

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.630 
little just to show you how the fingers
are<00:01:23.299> positioned<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:24.710> much<00:01:24.890> like<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.219> sequel

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
are positioned so much like the sequel

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.630 
are positioned so much like the sequel
have<00:01:25.759> got<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.030> first<00:01:26.270> finger<00:01:27.100> very<00:01:28.100> close<00:01:28.429> to

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
have got the first finger very close to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.389 
have got the first finger very close to
the<00:01:28.670> first<00:01:29.000> fret<00:01:29.319> not<00:01:30.319> too<00:01:30.619> close<00:01:30.859> to<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.189> nuts

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
the first fret not too close to the nuts

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.249 
the first fret not too close to the nuts
so<00:01:31.670> that's<00:01:31.880> a<00:01:32.030> very<00:01:32.060> important<00:01:32.689> position<00:01:33.110> for

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
so that's a very important position for

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.410 
so that's a very important position for
this<00:01:33.380> court<00:01:33.679> as<00:01:33.799> well<00:01:33.909> so<00:01:34.909> keep<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:35.240> nice<00:01:35.360> and

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
this court as well so keep it nice and

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.539 
this court as well so keep it nice and
close<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.990> that<00:01:36.140> first<00:01:36.380> fret

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.840 

now<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:40.610> second<00:01:41.150> finger<00:01:41.509> is<00:01:41.960> on<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:43.009> 2nd<00:01:43.670> fret

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
now the second finger is on the 2nd fret

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.600 
now the second finger is on the 2nd fret
of<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.180> 4th<00:01:44.509> string<00:01:45.009> now<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.070> problem<00:01:46.369> is

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
of the 4th string now the problem is

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.580 
of the 4th string now the problem is
because<00:01:47.240> we've<00:01:47.509> got<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.720> squeeze<00:01:47.930> two<00:01:48.200> fingers

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
because we've got to squeeze two fingers

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.719 
because we've got to squeeze two fingers
in<00:01:48.710> these<00:01:48.860> two<00:01:49.130> frets<00:01:49.400> and<00:01:49.549> they're<00:01:49.700> very

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
in these two frets and they're very

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.149 
in these two frets and they're very
close<00:01:50.030> together<00:01:50.590> we've<00:01:51.590> actually<00:01:51.770> got<00:01:52.070> to

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
close together we've actually got to

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.789 
close together we've actually got to
have<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.340> second<00:01:52.909> finger<00:01:53.290> closer<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.680> the

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
have that second finger closer to the

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.460 
have that second finger closer to the
first<00:01:55.040> fret<00:01:55.369> so<00:01:55.670> not<00:01:55.970> close<00:01:56.690> up<00:01:56.930> to<00:01:57.080> there<00:01:57.259> like

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
first fret so not close up to there like

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.749 
first fret so not close up to there like
that<00:01:57.649> otherwise<00:01:58.009> this<00:01:58.220> finger<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.549> going<00:01:58.700> to

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
that otherwise this finger is going to

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.510 
that otherwise this finger is going to
have<00:01:58.850> trouble<00:01:59.200> move<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.350> back<00:02:00.619> closer<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.220> that

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
have trouble move it back closer to that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.960 
have trouble move it back closer to that
fret<00:02:01.789> there<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:03.250> then<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.430> third<00:02:04.460> finger

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
fret there and then the third finger

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.399 
fret there and then the third finger
will<00:02:05.090> just<00:02:05.270> slaughter<00:02:05.539> and<00:02:05.750> just<00:02:05.960> blow<00:02:06.259> it

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
will just slaughter and just blow it

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.620 
will just slaughter and just blow it
nice<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.070> comfortably<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.910> all<00:02:11.330> together

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
nice and comfortably so all together

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.619 
nice and comfortably so all together
again

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.030 

what<00:02:20.629> going<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.840> do<00:02:21.019> now<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.230> just<00:02:21.349> from<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:21.890> a

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
what going to do now is just from the a

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.900 
what going to do now is just from the a
minor<00:02:22.370> chord

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:43.290 

I

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.070 

now<00:02:44.300> i'm<00:02:44.390> going<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.570> try<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.810> little<00:02:44.960> exercise

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
now i'm going to try a little exercise

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.020 
now i'm going to try a little exercise
where<00:02:45.860> we're<00:02:46.010> going<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.250> move<00:02:46.400> from<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.820> c

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
where we're going to move from the c

rest<00:02:52.490> on<00:02:52.820> each<00:02:53.390> chord<00:02:53.780> or<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.170> show<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.380> what<00:02:54.500> I

rest on each chord or to show you what I
mean<00:02:55.450> strong<00:02:56.450> rest<00:02:57.350> rest

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:17.540 

you

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:30.900 

you

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.600 

so<00:03:31.910> as<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.270> notice<00:03:32.630> like<00:03:32.870> your<00:03:33.110> fingers<00:03:33.610> can

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
so as you notice like your fingers can

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.520 
so as you notice like your fingers can
stay<00:03:34.970> down<00:03:35.239> but<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.630> actually<00:03:35.780> find<00:03:36.080> it<00:03:36.260> just

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
stay down but you actually find it just

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.110 
stay down but you actually find it just
a<00:03:36.650> little<00:03:36.680> bit<00:03:36.890> easy<00:03:37.099> just<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.520> lift<00:03:37.760> them<00:03:37.970> off

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
a little bit easy just to lift them off

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.479 
a little bit easy just to lift them off
just<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:39.020> move<00:03:39.200> between<00:03:39.349> your<00:03:40.040> first<00:03:40.280> finger

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
just to move between your first finger

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.570 
just to move between your first finger
can<00:03:40.790> stay<00:03:41.090> around<00:03:41.390> pretty<00:03:41.750> much<00:03:41.959> on<00:03:42.170> that<00:03:42.349> note

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
can stay around pretty much on that note

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.130 
can stay around pretty much on that note
but<00:03:43.580> you'll<00:03:43.700> just<00:03:43.819> find<00:03:44.030> it<00:03:44.239> second<00:03:44.870> finger

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
but you'll just find it second finger

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.710 
but you'll just find it second finger
needs<00:03:45.350> to<00:03:45.500> sort<00:03:45.680> of<00:03:45.770> lift<00:03:45.950> off<00:03:46.330> to<00:03:47.330> move<00:03:47.540> into

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
needs to sort of lift off to move into

00:03:47.720 --> 00:04:26.720 
needs to sort of lift off to move into
that<00:03:47.930> position<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:50.239> once<00:03:50.450> again

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.790
