00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.400
 called the popular movement to 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.040
 gather around the socialist party 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.670
 to save and impose the goals of 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.170
 the union of the left 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.970
 it seems to me that it helps musan 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.650
 content understood by the electorate yes you 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.720

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.609
 presidential novel there we in 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.130
 break if the party that if the leaders 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.390
 of choral parties val the failure of the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.250
 left as it seems today 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.460
 demonstrated of course they can the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.219
 make 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.129
 I already said once I repeat myself very 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.480
 the victory depends on the socialist party 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.090
 but the party's defeat Door 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.469
 communist so I would not want more than 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.210
 our interview ends here and to be 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.440

 until 1:34 pm hold and less 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.030
 still talking about sport 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:58.039
 cgg told you about it with david and bonce 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.039
 allow me to say that limited 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.080
 then say nothing before the end of 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.000
 the show I shared mitterrand 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.619
 because I had a lot of notes 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.729
 coming in the other nation no I 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.180
 will not have time I already know that 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.470
 I do not have the time 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.880
 I just have time to get angry 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.229
 when I started with it in no it 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.670
 the French information system 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.530
 who does it so I'll have time a 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.880
 minute to annoy me just to get upset 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.619
 to appear for a little shit a 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.210
 little young man from the mess everywhere 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.740
 I prefer to leave immediately if 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.630
 I knew how to say I would have slept 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.180
 much later ten years wanted 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.890
 your presence the balavoine alley dances 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.330
 their studio to talk about the problems of 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.510
 youth I think we 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.950
 thor 2 orioli time to talk about it was 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.270
 just unlucky there will be some 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.870
 others and it was not songs 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.000
 I was talking about 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.410
 for at least 10 minutes from the sphere 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.760
 georges walked where everyone 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.840
 Strictly speaking, I tell you that 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.040
 French youth are strictly 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.270
 from what sir market was doing 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.710
 during the war that it is 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.910
 completely equal these interests would be 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.230
 more the youth to know what is 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.150
 goes on and how does the communist party in 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.770
 money box to spend it 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.000
 after including the town hall of bagnolet 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.710
 his interests would be better to know 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.240
 how gaston defferre runs his town hall 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.100
 socialist who is not a model of 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.270
 company in Marseille would be interested more 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.500
 to know the young french how 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.210
 sir raymond bar who arrived there 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.380
 five years or four years ago I know more 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.429
 how much time said that wages do not 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.050
 would not be diminished but to increase 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.430
 social security contributions 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.930
 it's a lot more interesting than anything 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.250
 what are you saying george walked on 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.870
 do not care about george walk it must be 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.640
 know of what he was doing during the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.290
 war we are completely equal the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.910
 drug problem the way we 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.440
 the treaty the French ministers we are 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.660
 do not you ever have a young minister 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.590
 beyond youth in France there is 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.810
 never is it all old 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.120
 look at sir soissons finally you 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.050
 do not tell me it's a man 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.040
 representative of youth watching 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.450
 how I am dressed they are more 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.010
 often bias com - young people as like 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.480
 sir soissons, you do not have to 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.590
 to dream all that these are trades I 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.850
 still took a lot of notes as you 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.110
 as you speak what would you like 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.700
 know what they're dying about it's 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.140
 to know who the workers 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.300
 immigrants pay rent that pays 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.769
 we saw earlier people who 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.120
 want to pay 700 francs a month I 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.709
 would like to know that they are cashing in 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.209
 the money to rent garbage cans the same 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.680
 that's what I would like to be told 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.090
 it's not how we can 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.950
 to do to change game murray who dares 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.209
 every month requested 700 francs to 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.410
 immigrant workers to live in 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.640
 garbage cans in slums 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.750
 that's what I would like us to 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.220
 do not explain to me what I do not know 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.360
 it's not the strength of training 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.670
 who tells me I would like to know why 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.959
 Mr. Boulin was committed suicide or 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.370
 suicide or we'll never know 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.450
 why sir fontanes inherited this 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.190
 sign is why the sphere the brÃ¼ggli 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.480
 was never enlightened why the judge 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.709
 renaud we are not neither why nor 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.330
 how he was murdered 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.650
 I have others the only thing I 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.640
 can you tell mister mitterrand I 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.220
 run away from having you because I'm 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.330
 proud to be here i can tell you it on 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.709
 may not notice it but you 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.000
 can not imagine what it is for a 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.200
 young to have the opportunity to speak 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.730
 a minute that's why I had 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.530
 afraid of not being able to talk because 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.160
 it never happens 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.930
 that in mind 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.190
 it never stops watching the show 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.820
 who had last night on the air 2 the 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.950
 screen folders 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.030
 finally you 're not going to tell me that the 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.750
 who were concerned with the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.250
 counter attack 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.980
 I gave up it's really lucky 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.480
 he is obliged to you and you exaggerate 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.910
 the information I am obliged to 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.500
 the hexagon to sum it up I summarize it to 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.340
 my way that I try to read 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.810
 quickly my notes 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.700
 what I gave you in any case 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.870
 usually it's a warning I 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.980
 maybe some nerve to do that I'm 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.700
 obliged to do it like that because I 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.040
 have to hurry 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.990
 what I can tell you is that the 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.820
 youth despairs she is deep and 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.530
 deeply desperate because she did not 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.250
 more supports she no longer believes in the 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.350
 French politics 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.690
 and I think that is the general rule 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.130
 sums up in a little good reason what I 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.230
 can you tell is that despair and 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.060
 mobilizer and that when he becomes 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.739
 mobilizer it is dangerous and that it 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.450
 causes terrorism the band to baader 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.730
 and things like that and that it has to be 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.739
 the big people who run the 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.390
 world be warned that young people are going 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.650
 end up on the wrong side because 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.060
 that they will have no other solution 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.680
 here I thank you for letting 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.570
 talk sowing who wanted 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.800
 places to chat with a young you 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.870
 listened to it with a lot of attention 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.970
 that what interests me a lot is 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.380
 that this way of thinking of reality 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.510
 also express himself because in daniel face 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.490
 balavoine expresses himself by screaming 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.440
 music has the right of city 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.290
 then his 30 years of and so can be 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.979
 said included in his own way it is 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:57.600
 responsible for these words it's a 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:58.860
 citizen like another but typical and 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.479
 when I say typical it's because they 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:06.740
 represent in my opinion hundreds of 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.430
 thousands of young living conditions or 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.690
 in which suburbs 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.479
 what housing what hobbies going into 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.850
 a concrete society that is closing 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.490
 everywhere selling with unemployment for 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.890
 perspective think someone who knows 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.070
 to say and to sing, to express 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.630
 in the form of drama art lived from 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.919
 this force had to be heard during 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.700
 of a show to chamber why 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.680
 condemn balaban speak 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.970
 he rejects information that's another 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.900
 problem but I have the impression that they 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.390
 reject all politicians 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.990
 whether they are right or even if he has 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.420
 the right 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.970
 and why not me he has the right me I 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.290
 am for everything to be said and for that 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.430
 any politician can be handed over 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.440
 in question it happens to me every day 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.030
 and if that were to happen with daniel 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.750
 balavoine well I 'll listen anyway 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.700
 he has to tell me 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.550
 good so that's why this should only 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.440
 not bring us second incident of 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.780
 sitting at the bottom of this broadcast sprouted 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.600
 as it was 13h 30 points you have 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.860
 nineteen become 34 years old I won the 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.980
 turf has not yet in the unite 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.210
 and passionate about football not know 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.200
 how do you say daniel bremen that one 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.510
 can not summarize the policy 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.430
 French with conflicts elsewhere 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.860
 artificially provoke by the party 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.470
 communist between george marchais me 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.220
 confess rene andrÃ© I'm sure that such 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.960
 was your intention 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.310
 in the name so I did not want to but 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.960
 simply no one here we address ourselves to 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.710
 millions of people who need to 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.660
 know we could not talk yet 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.850
 1.9 percent price increase 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.570
 in January of one million five 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.210
 a hundred thousand unemployed 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.070
 today from 9 billion deficit 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.420
 foreign trade on both 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.760
 first months of the year is almost 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.830
 as much as all of last year that we 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.590
 could not talk about the situation of the 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.450
 savers who may be able to see 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.610
 increase from 6 and a half percent to 7 % 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:52.330
 the remuneration of their savings 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.710
 while speculation driven by 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.130
 example and the big corporations that 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:59.500
 can borrow large corporations 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.710
 can borrow at 20% in the usa 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.720
 of America and the de facto devaluation of 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.490
 Frank it was the last success of 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.770
 sir bah devaluation of fact in front 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.410
 from one dollar to 440 and one marking of 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.330
 francs 40 years so I mean kenya 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.130
 we go and lights anyway 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.200
 are still two policies must 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.790
 make the choice to the one I denounce and 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.890
 there are those that is contained in the 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:23.020
 socialist project holds no other 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:26.520
 that's why I told them even if we 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.520
 did not leave much of the Bible
