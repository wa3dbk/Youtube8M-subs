cooking<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.360> sauce<00:00:46.230> has<00:00:46.500> reduced

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
cooking the sauce has reduced

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.639 
cooking the sauce has reduced
dramatically<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.989> been<00:00:49.170> brought<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.620> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
dramatically and it's been brought to a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.010 
dramatically and it's been brought to a
165<00:00:50.219> degrees<00:00:51.030> which<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.809> need<00:00:51.989> for

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
165 degrees which is what you need for

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.459 
165 degrees which is what you need for
poultry<00:00:53.449> we're<00:00:54.449> gonna<00:00:54.570> first<00:00:54.930> melt<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
poultry we're gonna first melt the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.700 
poultry we're gonna first melt the
butter<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> sauce<00:00:56.989> because<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.320> roof

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
butter for the sauce because the roof

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.110 
butter for the sauce because the roof
thickens<00:00:59.600> based<00:01:00.600> on

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
thickens based on

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.080 
thickens based on
the<00:01:02.510> reactions<00:01:03.140> of<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.500> fat<00:01:03.770> and<00:01:04.040> flour<00:01:04.670> and

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
the reactions of the fat and flour and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.300 
the reactions of the fat and flour and
butter<00:01:05.390> has<00:01:05.480> water<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.560> ideally<00:01:07.040> what<00:01:07.160> you

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
butter has water so ideally what you

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.160 
butter has water so ideally what you
want<00:01:07.460> to<00:01:07.580> do<00:01:07.730> is<00:01:08.240> cook<00:01:08.510> some<00:01:08.750> of<00:01:08.870> that<00:01:08.960> water

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
want to do is cook some of that water

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.990 
want to do is cook some of that water
out<00:01:09.290> first<00:01:09.680> or<00:01:10.340> make<00:01:10.490> your<00:01:10.640> room<00:01:10.850> more

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
out first or make your room more

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.540 
out first or make your room more
effective

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:34.110 

melt<00:01:18.880> that<00:01:19.090> down

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.780 

like<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.660> you<00:01:35.590> can<00:01:35.740> probably<00:01:35.980> see<00:01:36.400> it<00:01:36.430> start

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
like that you can probably see it start

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.620 
like that you can probably see it start
to<00:01:36.850> bubble<00:01:37.170> that's<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.440> water

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.539 

when<00:01:42.080> all<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.380> water<00:01:42.590> disappears<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:43.369> butter

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
when all the water disappears the butter

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.910 
when all the water disappears the butter
will<00:01:43.790> start<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.150> brown

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.350 

we<00:01:47.920> want<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.190> catch<00:01:48.370> it<00:01:48.400> right<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.210> between

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
we want to catch it right in between

00:01:49.360 --> 00:02:05.070 
we want to catch it right in between
there

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:28.839 

you<00:02:06.080> get<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.500> flower

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.660 

we'll<00:02:29.360> take<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.599> few<00:02:29.870> minutes

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.340 

the<00:02:33.030> interesting<00:02:33.510> thing<00:02:33.720> about<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.110> bruise

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
the interesting thing about the bruise

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.020 
the interesting thing about the bruise
is<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.770> longer<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.250> cook<00:02:35.490> them<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.850> more

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
is the longer you cook them the more

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.150 
is the longer you cook them the more
effective<00:02:36.570> they<00:02:36.720> are<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.710> there's<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.980> lot<00:02:38.130> of

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
effective they are so there's a lot of

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.220 
effective they are so there's a lot of
different<00:02:38.520> types<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.880> ruined<00:02:39.330> French<00:02:39.720> cooking
