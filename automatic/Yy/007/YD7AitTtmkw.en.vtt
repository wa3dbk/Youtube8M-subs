dinosaur from the Super Mario series now
the<00:00:07.470> main<00:00:07.710> reason<00:00:08.069> I'm<00:00:08.220> tracing<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.000> can

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
the main reason I'm tracing is I can

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.140 
the main reason I'm tracing is I can
give<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.780> more<00:00:10.290> accurate<00:00:10.580> sketch<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.940> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
give you a more accurate sketch of the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.020 
give you a more accurate sketch of the
drawing<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.630> also<00:00:12.990> my<00:00:13.170> setup<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.830> crazy<00:00:14.309> chaos

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
drawing and also my setup is crazy chaos

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.300 
drawing and also my setup is crazy chaos
at<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.330> moment<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:16.500> was<00:00:16.560> easier<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.070> do

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
at the moment so it was easier to do

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.310 
at the moment so it was easier to do
this<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:17.850> apologize<00:00:18.119> in<00:00:18.690> advance<00:00:18.750> for<00:00:19.140> you

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
guys hey guys so basically we're gonna

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.820 
guys hey guys so basically we're gonna
start<00:00:23.580> off<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:24.119> drawing<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.109> eye<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.590> which

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
start off with drawing the eye and which

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.849 
start off with drawing the eye and which
is<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> really<00:00:26.660> elongated<00:00:27.660> oval<00:00:28.199> shape<00:00:28.500> about

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
is a really elongated oval shape about

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.910 
is a really elongated oval shape about
more<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> half<00:00:29.990> over<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.380> then<00:00:31.619> underneath

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
more of a half over and then underneath

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.950 
more of a half over and then underneath
will<00:00:32.369> be<00:00:32.460> drawing<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.820> small<00:00:33.120> curved<00:00:33.450> line<00:00:33.630> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
will be drawing a small curved line and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.319 
will be drawing a small curved line and
then<00:00:34.770> for<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> eyelid<00:00:35.670> we're<00:00:35.969> going<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.239> be

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
then for the eyelid we're going to be

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.869 
then for the eyelid we're going to be
drawn<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> curve<00:00:37.110> line<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.950> just

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
drawn in of the curve line is so I just

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.819 
drawn in of the curve line is so I just
fell<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.270> pupil<00:00:39.710> like<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:43.530> drais

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
fell in the pupil like that and to drais

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.799 
fell in the pupil like that and to drais
like<00:00:44.399> more<00:00:44.730> mouths<00:00:45.030> shape<00:00:45.450> we're<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
like more mouths shape we're going to

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.100 
like more mouths shape we're going to
draw<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.469> big<00:00:47.059> slightly<00:00:48.059> big<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.600> half

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
draw a really big slightly big on half

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.709 
draw a really big slightly big on half
circle<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:50.700> draw<00:00:50.940> another<00:00:51.120> curve<00:00:51.449> line

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
circle and then draw another curve line

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.670 
circle and then draw another curve line
up<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:53.300> then<00:00:54.300> we're<00:00:54.510> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> draw<00:00:54.899> another

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
up and then we're going to draw another

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.709 
up and then we're going to draw another
curved<00:00:56.039> line<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> define<00:00:57.030> his<00:00:57.180> cheek<00:00:57.480> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
curved line just to define his cheek and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.810 
curved line just to define his cheek and
then<00:00:58.500> under<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.890> we're<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.609> keep

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
then under that we're going to just keep

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.490 
then under that we're going to just keep
continuing<00:01:00.030> because<00:01:00.719> that's<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.109> your<00:01:01.289> life

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
continuing because that's on your life

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.549 
continuing because that's on your life
where<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.520> know<00:01:02.640> he's<00:01:02.820> white<00:01:03.500> compared<00:01:04.500> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
where you know he's white compared to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.980 
where you know he's white compared to
the<00:01:04.710> green<00:01:05.640> over<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> rest<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.420> his<00:01:06.510> body<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the green over the rest of his body and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.020 
the green over the rest of his body and
we're<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.890> draw<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.220> straight<00:01:08.610> but

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
we're going to draw a straight but

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.899 
we're going to draw a straight but
curved<00:01:09.390> line<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.350> makes<00:01:10.560> sense<00:01:10.710> down<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
curved line if that makes sense down and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.609 
curved line if that makes sense down and
we'd<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.270> leaving<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:12.780> gap<00:01:13.020> later<00:01:13.320> for

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
we'd be leaving a little gap later for

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.210 
we'd be leaving a little gap later for
his<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:14.490> his<00:01:14.670> arm<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.619> then<00:01:16.619> where<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.040> drew

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
his for his arm and then where we drew

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.920 
his for his arm and then where we drew
the<00:01:17.250> curve<00:01:17.549> early<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.150> his<00:01:18.270> cheek<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.750> want

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the curve early for his cheek you want

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.719 
the curve early for his cheek you want
it<00:01:20.000> draw<00:01:21.200> another<00:01:22.200> line<00:01:22.320> down<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.490> I

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
it draw another line down like so I

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.260 
it draw another line down like so I
leave<00:01:24.420> another<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.869> gap<00:01:26.000> this<00:01:27.000> really

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
leave another little gap this really

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.120 
leave another little gap this really
defines<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.720> two<00:01:28.170> different<00:01:28.530> contrasts<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
defines the two different contrasts the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.580 
defines the two different contrasts the
colors<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.700> white<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.180> green<00:01:30.590> his

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
colors of the white and the green his

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.760 
colors of the white and the green his
body<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.150> draw<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.360> little<00:01:34.020> hand

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
body and you just draw the little hand

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.130 
body and you just draw the little hand
kind<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.670> don't<00:01:36.420> know<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.659> yeah<00:01:36.900> hand

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
kind of like I don't know as yeah hand

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.740 
kind of like I don't know as yeah hand
or<00:01:37.290> claw<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.159> then<00:01:38.970> we'll<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.570> back

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
or claw like that and then we'll go back

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.460 
or claw like that and then we'll go back
up<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.229> we'll<00:01:40.439> draw<00:01:40.710> another<00:01:41.840> more<00:01:42.840> define<00:01:43.259> of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
up and we'll draw another more define of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.690 
up and we'll draw another more define of
his<00:01:43.590> head<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.729> will<00:01:44.880> fit<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.570> UM<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
his head and I will fit in the UM the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.300 
his head and I will fit in the UM the
little<00:01:47.700> spikes<00:01:48.090> or<00:01:48.710> I'm<00:01:49.710> not<00:01:49.829> too<00:01:49.950> sure<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
little spikes or I'm not too sure you

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.370 
little spikes or I'm not too sure you
call<00:01:50.520> them<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:50.909> little<00:01:51.750> triangles<00:01:52.200> would

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
call them but little triangles would

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.100 
call them but little triangles would
start<00:01:52.590> begging<00:01:52.799> then<00:01:53.100> go<00:01:53.310> down<00:01:53.430> small<00:01:54.110> when

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
start begging then go down small when

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.810 
start begging then go down small when
the<00:01:55.170> next<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.530> will<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.680> doing<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.430> rest<00:01:56.670> of

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the next up will be doing the rest of

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
another you into that which will define

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.590 
another you into that which will define
the<00:02:04.350> rest<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:05.960> if<00:02:06.960> you're<00:02:07.140> doing

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
wanna just go up and do a point to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.170 
wanna just go up and do a point to
define<00:02:17.540> his<00:02:17.690> tail<00:02:17.960> and<00:02:19.030> then<00:02:20.030> we're<00:02:20.150> just

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
define his tail and then we're just

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.450 
define his tail and then we're just
going<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.480> go<00:02:20.570> down<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:21.770> kind<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.040> bring<00:02:22.280> it

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
going to go down and kind of bring it

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.210 
going to go down and kind of bring it
and<00:02:22.580> then<00:02:22.790> leave<00:02:22.940> another<00:02:23.150> large<00:02:23.510> gap<00:02:24.220> larger

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
and then leave another large gap larger

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.610 
and then leave another large gap larger
gap<00:02:25.370> then<00:02:25.790> design<00:02:26.390> just<00:02:26.630> we<00:02:26.840> can<00:02:27.020> draw<00:02:27.200> in<00:02:27.380> is

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
gap then design just we can draw in is

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.500 
gap then design just we can draw in is
like<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.070> tie<00:02:28.840> our<00:02:29.840> leg<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:32.300> should<00:02:32.480> be

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
like is tie our leg and it should be

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.690 
like is tie our leg and it should be
something<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.290> I'm<00:02:34.070> going<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.310> just<00:02:34.400> fill

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
something like so I'm going to just fill

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.220 
something like so I'm going to just fill
in<00:02:34.820> his<00:02:34.970> boot<00:02:35.210> now<00:02:35.570> what<00:02:35.810> we're<00:02:35.930> going<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.110> do

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
in his boot now what we're going to do

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.200 
in his boot now what we're going to do
is<00:02:36.380> we're<00:02:36.650> going<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.830> be<00:02:36.950> just<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.060> give<00:02:38.180> him

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
is we're going to be just to give him

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.500 
is we're going to be just to give him
more<00:02:38.540> like<00:02:38.780> instead<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.590> just<00:02:39.740> one<00:02:39.950> leg<00:02:40.510> we're

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
more like instead of just one leg we're

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.400 
more like instead of just one leg we're
going<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.660> do<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:43.240> kind<00:02:44.240> of<00:02:44.300> like<00:02:45.700> another<00:02:47.410> look

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
going to do a kind of like another look

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.470 
going to do a kind of like another look
into<00:02:48.800> it<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.490> it<00:02:49.550> looks<00:02:49.580> like<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:50.030> know<00:02:50.120> the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
into it so it looks like you know the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.230 
into it so it looks like you know the
two<00:02:50.660> legs<00:02:50.900> are<00:02:51.170> there<00:02:51.490> so<00:02:52.490> I<00:02:52.700> know<00:02:52.820> it's<00:02:53.060> very

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
two legs are there so I know it's very

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.840 
two legs are there so I know it's very
faint<00:02:53.450> but<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:54.560> can<00:02:54.770> contrast<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:55.430> with<00:02:55.490> the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
faint but you can contrast this with the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.790 
faint but you can contrast this with the
finished<00:02:56.330> results<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.080> you<00:02:57.110> can<00:02:57.320> kind<00:02:57.530> of<00:02:57.620> get

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
finished results so you can kind of get

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.040 
finished results so you can kind of get
um<00:02:59.740> so<00:03:00.740> you<00:03:00.800> can<00:03:00.920> kind<00:03:01.130> of<00:03:01.190> see<00:03:01.430> what<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:02.050> leg

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
um so you can kind of see what the leg

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.100 
um so you can kind of see what the leg
is<00:03:03.200> like<00:03:03.910> well<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:05.150> gives<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.480> more<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.840> depth

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
is like well it gives it more of a depth

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.220 
is like well it gives it more of a depth
and<00:03:06.440> more<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.770> 3d<00:03:07.220> look<00:03:07.840> by<00:03:08.840> adding<00:03:08.870> the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
and more of a 3d look by adding the

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:17.560 
and more of a 3d look by adding the
extra<00:03:09.890> um<00:03:11.110> extra<00:03:12.110> boot<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:12.680> leg<00:03:16.330> so<00:03:17.330> once<00:03:17.480> you

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
extra um extra boot and leg so once you

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.380 
extra um extra boot and leg so once you
have<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:17.720> done<00:03:17.960> you<00:03:18.170> can<00:03:19.000> start<00:03:20.000> going<00:03:20.240> back

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
have that done you can start going back

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.910 
have that done you can start going back
on<00:03:20.630> any<00:03:20.810> bits<00:03:21.050> that<00:03:21.230> you've<00:03:21.380> done<00:03:21.530> mistake

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
on any bits that you've done mistake

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.070 
on any bits that you've done mistake
with<00:03:22.130> or<00:03:22.370> anything<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:22.970> I'm<00:03:23.870> start<00:03:24.380> shading

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
with or anything and I'm start shading

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.950 
with or anything and I'm start shading
so<00:03:27.080> you<00:03:27.170> should<00:03:27.350> have<00:03:27.380> something<00:03:27.740> like<00:03:27.890> that

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
so you should have something like that

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.470 
so you should have something like that
and<00:03:29.960> that's<00:03:30.440> basically<00:03:30.680> really<00:03:31.160> all<00:03:32.150> there<00:03:32.450> is

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
and that's basically really all there is

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.140 
and that's basically really all there is
to<00:03:32.750> do<00:03:32.900> it<00:03:33.050> you<00:03:33.170> all<00:03:33.320> sheet<00:03:33.670> are<00:03:34.670> you<00:03:34.820> like<00:03:34.970> this
