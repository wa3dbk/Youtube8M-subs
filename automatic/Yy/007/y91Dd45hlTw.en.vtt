in<00:02:00.499> the<00:02:00.709> beginning<00:02:00.859> is<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:02.090> if<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.389> don't<00:02:02.630> get

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
in the beginning is that if I don't get

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.230 
in the beginning is that if I don't get
the<00:02:02.959> kill<00:02:03.170> right<00:02:03.319> away<00:02:03.700> it's<00:02:04.700> often<00:02:04.939> that

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
the kill right away it's often that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.690 
the kill right away it's often that
they'll<00:02:05.420> respond<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.349> the<00:02:07.009> refresh<00:02:07.369> that<00:02:07.399> I

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
they'll respond and the refresh that I

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.730 
they'll respond and the refresh that I
can<00:02:07.939> use<00:02:07.969> them<00:02:08.300> again<00:02:08.599> and<00:02:09.259> you'll<00:02:09.440> see<00:02:09.619> me

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740
