mental<00:00:13.710> toughness<00:00:13.920> for<00:00:14.730> me<00:00:14.880> was<00:00:15.120> basically

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
mental toughness for me was basically

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.040 
mental toughness for me was basically
what<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.020> based<00:00:16.529> my<00:00:17.160> game<00:00:17.369> on<00:00:17.400> really<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.480> wasn't

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
what I based my game on really I wasn't

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.679 
what I based my game on really I wasn't
super<00:00:19.350> talented<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:20.100> filled<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.000> very<00:00:21.240> unique

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
super talented I filled a very unique

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.960 
super talented I filled a very unique
niche<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> team<00:00:22.650> where<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.220> had<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.640> go<00:00:23.789> and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
niche in the team where I had to go and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.370 
niche in the team where I had to go and
nullify<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.449> best<00:00:24.750> player<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.289> other

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
nullify the best player on the other

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.099 
nullify the best player on the other
opposition<00:00:26.240> nullify<00:00:27.240> his<00:00:27.420> influence<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
opposition nullify his influence on the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.679 
opposition nullify his influence on the
game<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.310> had<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.699> have<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> really<00:00:30.359> steely

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
game so I had to have a really steely

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.620 
game so I had to have a really steely
focus<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.160> game<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.730> felt<00:00:33.469> it<00:00:34.469> changes

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
focus in the game of I felt it changes

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.860 
focus in the game of I felt it changes
really<00:00:36.630> quickly<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.640> think<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.750> to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
really quickly and I think you have to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.350 
really quickly and I think you have to
make<00:00:40.050> decisions<00:00:40.170> within<00:00:40.800> 1<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:41.250> 2<00:00:41.399> seconds<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
make decisions within 1 or 2 seconds and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.049 
make decisions within 1 or 2 seconds and
it<00:00:42.840> goes<00:00:43.020> over<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.410> two<00:00:43.590> hour<00:00:43.739> period<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.850> be

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
it goes over a two hour period so to be

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.920 
it goes over a two hour period so to be
honest<00:00:45.539> Ain<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.610> moment-by-moment

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
honest Ain that moment-by-moment

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.910 
honest Ain that moment-by-moment
second-by-second<00:00:48.930> minute-by-minute<00:00:49.200> for

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
second-by-second minute-by-minute for

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.950 
second-by-second minute-by-minute for
two<00:00:50.100> hours<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.969> something<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.719> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
two hours is something that you have to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.369 
two hours is something that you have to
have<00:00:52.230> mental<00:00:52.469> toughness<00:00:52.530> for<00:00:53.160> probably<00:00:53.910> the

in<00:02:00.350> front<00:02:00.499> of<00:02:00.619> mind<00:02:00.829> I<00:02:01.159> think<00:02:01.579> in<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.789> sporting

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
in front of mind I think in the sporting

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.830

arena<00:02:03.170> or<00:02:03.499> a<00:02:03.560> sporting<00:02:04.100> world<00:02:04.280> we<00:02:05.030> focus<00:02:05.659> so

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
arena or a sporting world we focus so

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.510 
arena or a sporting world we focus so
much<00:02:05.869> on<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.229> physical<00:02:06.710> aspect<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.219> the<00:02:07.280> game

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
much on the physical aspect of the game

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.500 
much on the physical aspect of the game
but<00:02:09.039> there's<00:02:10.039> only<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.369> certain<00:02:10.789> point<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.360> can

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
but there's only a certain point you can

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.449 
but there's only a certain point you can
take<00:02:11.690> those<00:02:11.900> players<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.290> physically<00:02:12.799> I<00:02:13.099> think
