00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
it look like an accident so I'm gonna be

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.950 
it look like an accident so I'm gonna be
fast-forwarding<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.270> lot<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.840> won't

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
fast-forwarding a lot here and I won't

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.119 
fast-forwarding a lot here and I won't
actually<00:00:52.110> be<00:00:52.289> talking<00:00:52.440> through<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> entire

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
actually be talking through the entire

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.680 
actually be talking through the entire
video<00:00:53.460> I'll<00:00:53.579> kind<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.850> end<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.180> little<00:00:54.300> early

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
video I'll kind of end a little early

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.240

or number two if you don't have any
welrod<00:01:14.850> ammo<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.450> me<00:01:15.750> unfortunately<00:01:16.200> there

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
welrod ammo like me unfortunately there

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.690 
welrod ammo like me unfortunately there
is<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> noise<00:01:17.759> making<00:01:18.290> like<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> motor<00:01:20.130> generator

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
is a noise making like a motor generator

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.370 
is a noise making like a motor generator
which<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.210> sabotage<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.930> order<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.229> make

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
which you can sabotage in order to make

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.890 
which you can sabotage in order to make
sound<00:01:22.890> there's<00:01:23.580> also<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.970> plane<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.689> flies

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
sound there's also a plane that flies

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.050 
sound there's also a plane that flies
above<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.430> use<00:01:26.460> those<00:01:26.820> two

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
above you so you can use those two

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.880 
above you so you can use those two
things<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.600> mask<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.140> sound<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.500> your<00:01:28.619> sniper
