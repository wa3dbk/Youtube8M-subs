00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.679 
so we do get classics which are your
more<00:01:44.900> common<00:01:45.460> figures<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:46.640> would<00:01:47.000> imagine<00:01:47.479> that

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
more common figures I would imagine that

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.440 
more common figures I would imagine that
you<00:01:47.960> get<00:01:48.080> special<00:01:48.439> which<00:01:48.950> are<00:01:49.310> harder<00:01:50.270> to

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
you get special which are harder to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.070 
you get special which are harder to
achieve<00:01:51.229> a<00:01:51.590> little<00:01:52.130> harder<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.670> find<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.299> then

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
achieve a little harder to find and then

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.160 
achieve a little harder to find and then
we<00:01:54.320> get<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:54.650> our<00:01:54.680> raised<00:01:55.100> braack<00:01:55.549> braack<00:01:56.170> shet
