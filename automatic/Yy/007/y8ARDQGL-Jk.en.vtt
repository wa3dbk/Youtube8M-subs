not saving somebody else's game you're
living<00:00:24.960> our<00:00:25.230> own<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:26.660> it's<00:00:27.660> freaking

living our own so it's freaking

living our own so it's freaking
someone<00:00:40.309> we<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> lot<00:00:41.699> of<00:00:41.730> pressure<00:00:42.000> riding

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
someone we have a lot of pressure riding

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.979 
someone we have a lot of pressure riding
on<00:00:42.449> these<00:00:42.540> tests<00:00:43.070> we've<00:00:44.070> been<00:00:44.250> very

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
on these tests we've been very

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.079 
on these tests we've been very
exhaustive<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.230> our<00:00:46.800> approach<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.940> don't

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
exhaustive in our approach so we don't

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.150 
exhaustive in our approach so we don't
expect<00:00:48.300> any<00:00:48.960> surprises<00:00:50.540> nevertheless<00:00:52.160> they

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
expect any surprises nevertheless they

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.009 
expect any surprises nevertheless they
wouldn't<00:00:53.460> call<00:00:53.970> it<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.180> test<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.690> knew<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
wouldn't call it a test if you knew the

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.670 
wouldn't call it a test if you knew the
outcome<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:56.360> we<00:00:57.360> fully<00:00:57.570> expect<00:00:58.019> them<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.379> be

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
outcome so we fully expect them to be

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.060 
outcome so we fully expect them to be
successful<00:00:59.030> I<00:01:00.230> dare<00:01:01.230> say<00:01:01.260> we're<00:01:01.589> confident

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
successful I dare say we're confident

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.750 
successful I dare say we're confident

but anytime you deploy parachute you

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.789 
but anytime you deploy parachute you

final change to do the test setup

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.490 
final change to do the test setup
required<00:01:30.180> maneuvering<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> scissor<00:01:31.470> lift

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
required maneuvering the scissor lift

left<00:01:38.249> before<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:38.670> lose<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.939> proof<00:01:39.179> of<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
left before we lose the proof of the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.859 
left before we lose the proof of the
night<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.520> right<00:01:41.520> now<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:42.420> very<00:01:42.479> much<00:01:42.689> in

replaced<00:01:48.740> tonight<00:01:49.100> they<00:01:50.030> only<00:01:50.150> hope<00:01:50.360> is<00:01:50.480> to

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
replaced tonight they only hope is to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.500 
replaced tonight they only hope is to
find<00:01:50.750> a<00:01:50.900> spare<00:01:51.170> here<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:53.060> we<00:01:53.180> don't<00:01:53.270> have<00:01:53.480> a

find a spare here and we don't have a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.120 
find a spare here and we don't have a
spare<00:01:53.810> do<00:01:54.080> we<00:01:54.170> have<00:01:54.200> another<00:01:54.500> scissor<00:01:54.770> lift<00:01:55.010> we

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
spare do we have another scissor lift we

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.940 
spare do we have another scissor lift we
can<00:01:55.250> cannibalize<00:01:55.550> we<00:01:56.540> can't<00:01:56.780> just<00:01:57.050> go<00:01:57.260> pick<00:01:57.800> up

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
can cannibalize we can't just go pick up

can cannibalize we can't just go pick up
another<00:01:58.190> tire<00:01:58.490> these<00:01:58.820> are<00:01:59.030> not<00:01:59.270> commonly

I'm<00:02:25.370> going<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.640> do<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:32.200> we're<00:02:33.200> stuck<00:02:35.050> we're

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
I'm going to do it we're stuck we're

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.380 
I'm going to do it we're stuck we're
running<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.410> test<00:02:36.650> but<00:02:37.030> we're<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.120> ones<00:02:38.240> being

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
running a test but we're the ones being

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.720 
running a test but we're the ones being
tested<00:02:38.930> biggest<00:02:39.920> wind<00:02:40.100> tunnel<00:02:40.370> in<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.550> world

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
tested biggest wind tunnel in the world

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.390 
tested biggest wind tunnel in the world
and<00:02:41.060> we're<00:02:41.150> on<00:02:41.530> hold<00:02:42.530> because<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.950> flat<00:02:43.160> tire

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
and we're on hold because of a flat tire

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.750 
and we're on hold because of a flat tire
so<00:02:44.740> doesn't<00:02:45.740> always<00:02:45.950> go<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.100> way<00:02:46.220> we<00:02:46.340> want<00:02:46.670> it

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
so doesn't always go the way we want it

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.870 
so doesn't always go the way we want it
to<00:02:47.380> in<00:02:48.380> terms<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.770> being<00:02:48.920> tested<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.490> I<00:02:49.520> think

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
to in terms of being tested I I think

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.240 
to in terms of being tested I I think
the<00:02:49.970> hardest<00:02:50.120> thing<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:50.720> just<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.500> maintain

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
the hardest thing is just to maintain

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.500 
the hardest thing is just to maintain
your<00:02:53.980> focus<00:02:54.980> on<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.970> problem<00:02:56.300> you're<00:02:56.450> trying

we try to make this mission succeed at

and<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.590> can<00:03:21.150> just<00:03:22.150> grow<00:03:22.330> tired<00:03:22.690> it's<00:03:23.680> easy<00:03:24.040> to

and you can just grow tired it's easy to

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
overlook something that you might not

overlook something that you might not
have<00:03:25.840> overlooked<00:03:26.349> before<00:03:26.800> just<00:03:27.790> through

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
have overlooked before just through

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.080 
have overlooked before just through
mental<00:03:29.140> exhaustion<00:03:29.560> once<00:03:30.489> we<00:03:30.640> launch<00:03:30.790> we

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
mental exhaustion once we launch we

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.150 
mental exhaustion once we launch we
can't<00:03:31.300> take<00:03:31.450> anything<00:03:31.660> back<00:03:31.959> so<00:03:32.769> we<00:03:32.890> have<00:03:33.010> to

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
can't take anything back so we have to

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.410 
can't take anything back so we have to
think<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.430> everything<00:03:33.519> ahead<00:03:33.879> of<00:03:34.030> time<00:03:34.239> and

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
think of everything ahead of time and

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.509 
think of everything ahead of time and
make<00:03:34.930> sure<00:03:35.200> that<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.830> don't<00:03:36.099> let<00:03:36.310> anything

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
make sure that you don't let anything

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.520 
make sure that you don't let anything
slip<00:03:36.849> through<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.180> cracks<00:03:37.209> I<00:03:37.810> think<00:03:38.379> that's

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
slip through the cracks I think that's

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.080 
slip through the cracks I think that's
probably<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.890> most<00:03:39.040> difficult<00:03:39.220> thing<00:03:39.700> it's

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
probably the most difficult thing it's

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.059 
probably the most difficult thing it's
very<00:03:40.239> taxing<00:03:40.599> there's<00:03:41.530> no<00:03:41.650> limit<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:41.950> the

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
very taxing there's no limit to the

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.309 
very taxing there's no limit to the
amount<00:03:42.160> of<00:03:42.370> hours<00:03:42.730> we<00:03:42.849> can<00:03:43.180> work<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.629> day<00:03:43.810> how

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
amount of hours we can work a day how

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.750 
amount of hours we can work a day how
many<00:03:44.379> hours<00:03:44.560> were<00:03:44.799> you<00:03:44.860> allowed<00:03:45.099> to<00:03:45.160> work<00:03:45.580> in<00:03:45.670> a

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
many hours were you allowed to work in a

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:56.699 
many hours were you allowed to work in a
day<00:03:45.940> 12<00:03:46.980> when<00:03:47.980> did<00:03:48.099> we<00:03:48.220> get<00:03:48.340> here<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:56.560> guys

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
day 12 when did we get here so you guys

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.180 
day 12 when did we get here so you guys
are<00:03:56.829> happy<00:03:56.980> with<00:03:57.160> this<00:03:57.280> don't<00:03:57.910> work<00:03:59.010> all<00:04:00.010> right

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
are happy with this don't work all right

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.620 
are happy with this don't work all right
then<00:04:00.400> I<00:04:00.900> guess<00:04:01.900> we'll<00:04:02.200> stand<00:04:02.380> back
