it but anyway when I had put your bacon
on<00:02:57.569> there<00:02:58.639> if<00:02:59.639> you<00:03:00.180> want<00:03:00.359> and<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.930> course<00:03:01.170> I

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
on there if you want and of course I

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.259 
on there if you want and of course I
made<00:03:01.889> these<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.160> little<00:03:02.430> big<00:03:02.639> so<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.850> can<00:03:03.090> see

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
made these a little big so you can see

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.150 
made these a little big so you can see
them<00:03:03.389> easier<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.410> you'd<00:03:04.560> make<00:03:04.680> them<00:03:04.859> a<00:03:04.889> little

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
them easier so you'd make them a little

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.110 
them easier so you'd make them a little
bit<00:03:05.250> smaller<00:03:05.430> for<00:03:05.910> your<00:03:06.030> plate<00:03:06.269> actually<00:03:08.120> so

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
bit smaller for your plate actually so

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.970 
bit smaller for your plate actually so
they'd<00:03:09.299> be<00:03:09.450> like<00:03:10.079> on<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.290> side<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.620> your<00:03:10.829> plate

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
they'd be like on the side of your plate

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.180 
they'd be like on the side of your plate
and<00:03:11.280> then<00:03:12.000> what<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.209> use<00:03:12.510> for<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.380> oil<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.040> the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
and then what I use for the oil and the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.690 
and then what I use for the oil and the
grouse<00:03:14.430> nests<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.120> make<00:03:15.269> it<00:03:15.420> shiny<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.900> use

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700
