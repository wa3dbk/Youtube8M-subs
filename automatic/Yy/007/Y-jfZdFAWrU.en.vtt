 funny step in the direction of the country 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.110
 Swinging not known there 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.110
 Reference to the zero point 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.990
 if you take that from Zuber 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.550
 one has you and mitigate

 again and again from the top and from the top 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.420
 what does that tell us that we'll have a look

 this new unit 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.240
 it should be a kind 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.240
 even Ireland has lost its

 May with a gesture changes and also with the graphic 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:43.669
 When the couple met, you had the geometry you programmed

 has Peter Kropp seat and mattresses view 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:49.089
