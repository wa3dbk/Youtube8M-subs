it's gonna work towards that pull point
it<00:01:10.590> cause<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.770> crankbait<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.670> run<00:01:11.850> off<00:01:12.030> at<00:01:12.210> an

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it cause that crankbait to run off at an

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.270 
it cause that crankbait to run off at an
angle<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:13.049> if<00:01:13.140> you've<00:01:13.290> got<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.500> place<00:01:13.830> like
