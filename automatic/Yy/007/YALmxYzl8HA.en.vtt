00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:14.559
 Hey, people, I'm here with everything. 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.830
 the headset ozone st 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.930
 It's stereo made for players. 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.800
 smart 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:28.540
 However, but it's okay and I'm here to 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:42.280
 make a quick boxing has some 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:44.680
 specifications here of him to play nÃ© 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.910
 it 's nothing to supertop but neither 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.930
 it's trash, right? 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.399
 I bought at UNITEC and paid staff 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.340
 130 reais 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.790
 there the largest reliable center is worth 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:06.700
 Worth buying there but not because it matters 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:10.920
 I'll open it here, I think it's cool here despite 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.920
 cool, it's no use at all, huh? 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:38.770
 here if you think you think that the party 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:40.869
 really matters is that as he is a 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:51.939
 serious man so but he has one 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:54.759
 very cool and illegal finishing is well 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:59.310
 finished a nightmare but neither will 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.310
 to annoy very well upholstered 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.869
 I tested it is not only good and it is comfortable 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:12.470
 You can use it for several hours by playing 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:15.770
 then his adjustment type're here at most 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.710
 It 's the cool size but it will have some 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.520
 People's head will take where it 's nothing. 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.950
 with more heads for whom a symptom 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.110
 This is not going to have a bit of a problem. 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.950
 that it does not have a very large fit 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.430
 but it's still a big deal 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.430
 cabin 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:46.220
 is a setting just going to regulate 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:53.230
 volume is that microphone taste the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.230
 long hair look right here 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:11.360
 if I'm not mistaken, it's a good size 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:14.600
 rhythm even when speaking cable 250 cm sang 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:23.269
 Thank you 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:24.200
 there the microphone inputs of the 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:31.940
 sound 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:36.440
 here is the headset look that will not go 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.310
 To work, this is for those who have these 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.310
 microphone questions 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:57.080
 here he has already entered here and is a 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:59.060
 pilot and two canecos here in the 17th place 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.320
 clothes not so popular so he has a 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.320
 side here to fit 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:19.720
 are these people who are also adjustable 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.220
 low - cost r7 cost-effective 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.460
 tecmold an option 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.070
 I recommend listening to nielson music. 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.530
 Good, only one thing will not do 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.070
 but at this point is what each of 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.080
