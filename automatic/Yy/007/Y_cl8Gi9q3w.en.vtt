 your home state 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.549

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.280
 before the competition 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.210

 I come with confidence I come well prepared 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.630
 I feel a good level right now 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.070
 pretty well physically and well already 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.530
 I want to start the show 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.479
 if we believe you because by all 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.179
 shorts that you're posting men 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.450
 social for example facebook youtube 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:06.229
 etcetera etcetera we have in shape almost 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.860
 all year then it is not so expensive 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:13.110
 to be able to get here in excellent shape 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.849
 yes the truth is that all year I deal 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.560
 to take care of myself 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.959
 training does not miss my two 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.349
 trainings a day I train until the 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:26.010
 Sundays and even then never like to 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.140
 food that does not carry 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.239
 Well, the main thing is protein and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.379
 carbohydrates I always eat what 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.239
 better and there is another secret because the cardio 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.819
 when I eat something that has enough 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.269
 calories so if I put a little more 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.739
 time the cardio so that I do not make a 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.470
 deposit of fat out there and how many 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.930
 hours a week on trains you to the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.030
 week then it's two hours in the morning 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.569
 two hours in the afternoon would be four 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.659
 hours a day a week would come being 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:59.430
 28 hours 28 hours if truth and you have 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.829
 words for young people from Mexico and 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.650
 latin america maybe you are seeing 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:07.019
 for the first time an athlete her 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.450
 ethnic group and come up with a mixed 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:13.909
 clean especially in the case of 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:17.400
 mexico to 10 words for them clear 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.470
 mainly that they see in me an example 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.349
 that the door can be opened already 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.810
 opened that more Latinos we can be 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.629
 present in the olympic mister maybe 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.310
 before we do not get alone we 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.889
 hinders we are thinking that no 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.069
 we could arrive but but not here is 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:37.470
 on a server this humbly 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.270
 I say that the door if it can be opened 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.160
 already with me is one more test 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.680
 and in fact in the desire that all dream 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.350
 it becomes a reality between the assembly 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.750
 today because we know that the center of 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.690
 conventions does not open until tomorrow but 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.100
 as a press we were able to come in and talk to 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.070
 some brands of supplements 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.230
 foods in which I 'm not going to 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.620
 name but there were several people that 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.880
 it's okay with you 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.870
 and what good is very dangerous 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.940
 well that's what he's telling me 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.620
 Well, it makes me very happy, it gives me a 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.020
 little bit more security still of the 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.230
 that I already bring because my progress 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.430
 they were very very notorious and mainly 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.460
 now these days I have changed 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.150
 too much and you're going to see me at the event 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.950
