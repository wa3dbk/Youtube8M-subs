00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
kind of unfortunate it makes me sad but

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.020 
kind of unfortunate it makes me sad but
that<00:03:11.260> is<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.440> way<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.769> is<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.700> know<00:03:12.819> my

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
that is the way it is so you know my

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.000 
that is the way it is so you know my
thoughts<00:03:13.299> on<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.569> is<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.410> maybe<00:03:14.739> they

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
thoughts on that is that maybe they

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.289 
thoughts on that is that maybe they
didn't<00:03:15.280> really<00:03:15.459> want<00:03:15.670> people<00:03:15.879> to<00:03:15.940> know<00:03:16.090> and

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
didn't really want people to know and

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.550 
didn't really want people to know and
that's<00:03:16.420> completely<00:03:16.750> understandable<00:03:16.959> now

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
that's completely understandable now

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.920 
that's completely understandable now

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
there are ways to see how many people

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.140 
there are ways to see how many people
have<00:03:20.260> logged<00:03:20.709> in<00:03:20.980> or<00:03:21.250> created<00:03:21.609> an<00:03:21.670> account<00:03:21.760> in

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
going to the leaderboards and on the

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.500 
going to the leaderboards and on the
xbox<00:03:27.430> 1<00:03:27.940> i'm<00:03:28.060> not<00:03:28.150> sure<00:03:28.299> about<00:03:28.359> the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
xbox 1 i'm not sure about the

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.300 
xbox 1 i'm not sure about the
playstation<00:03:28.720> at<00:03:29.079> all<00:03:29.200> but<00:03:29.349> on<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.500> xbox<00:03:29.799> 360<00:03:30.190> i

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
playstation at all but on the xbox 360 i

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.800 
playstation at all but on the xbox 360 i
think<00:03:30.549> there's<00:03:30.700> like<00:03:30.730> three<00:03:31.090> million<00:03:31.359> i<00:03:31.599> want

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
think there's like three million i want

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.879 
think there's like three million i want
to<00:03:31.870> say<00:03:31.989> that<00:03:32.139> last<00:03:32.319> time<00:03:32.470> i<00:03:32.530> checked<00:03:32.739> he<00:03:32.799> was

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
to say that last time i checked he was

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:33.960 
to say that last time i checked he was
like<00:03:32.980> two<00:03:33.099> and<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.220> half<00:03:33.310> million<00:03:33.519> some<00:03:33.760> kind<00:03:33.940> of

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
like two and a half million some kind of

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.819 
like two and a half million some kind of
just<00:03:34.150> like<00:03:34.209> estimating<00:03:35.079> but<00:03:35.319> i<00:03:35.470> think<00:03:35.709> there's

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
just like estimating but i think there's

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.530 
just like estimating but i think there's
like<00:03:35.889> three<00:03:36.220> million<00:03:36.430> now<00:03:36.790> at<00:03:37.030> have<00:03:37.150> created

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
like three million now at have created

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.120 
like three million now at have created
accounts<00:03:37.900> which<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.169> pretty<00:03:38.410> good<00:03:38.650> i<00:03:38.739> guess<00:03:38.950> in

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
accounts which is pretty good i guess in

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.270 
accounts which is pretty good i guess in
the<00:03:39.190> first<00:03:39.430> month<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:39.910> in<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:41.109> xbox<00:03:42.040> one

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
the first month and in the xbox one

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.879 
the first month and in the xbox one
leaderboards<00:03:43.120> i<00:03:43.269> think<00:03:43.660> last<00:03:44.079> time<00:03:44.230> i<00:03:44.349> checked

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
leaderboards i think last time i checked

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.309 
leaderboards i think last time i checked
last<00:03:45.160> time<00:03:45.340> i<00:03:45.430> heard<00:03:45.700> it<00:03:45.970> was<00:03:46.060> 1.6<00:03:46.750> million<00:03:47.019> and

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
last time i heard it was 1.6 million and

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.050 
last time i heard it was 1.6 million and
that<00:03:47.769> was<00:03:47.950> like<00:03:48.069> in<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.280> first<00:03:48.459> week<00:03:48.790> so<00:03:49.030> i

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
that was like in the first week so i

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.430 
that was like in the first week so i
would<00:03:49.329> say<00:03:49.540> that's<00:03:49.720> probably<00:03:49.780> at<00:03:50.079> four<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.380> a

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
would say that's probably at four and a

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.379 
would say that's probably at four and a
half<00:03:50.470> million<00:03:50.859> maybe<00:03:51.250> now<00:03:51.790> i<00:03:51.819> could<00:03:52.030> be<00:03:52.359> wrong

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
half million maybe now i could be wrong

the<00:04:24.400> way<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:24.580> goes<00:04:24.639> but<00:04:25.240> call<00:04:25.570> of<00:04:25.660> duty<00:04:25.810> is

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
the way it goes but call of duty is

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.870 
the way it goes but call of duty is
nowhere<00:04:26.260> near<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.860> dying<00:04:27.039> out<00:04:27.340> at<00:04:27.460> least<00:04:27.639> in<00:04:27.760> my

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
nowhere near to dying out at least in my

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.250 
nowhere near to dying out at least in my
opinion<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.419> think<00:04:28.449> it<00:04:28.750> still<00:04:28.930> has<00:04:29.020> another

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
opinion I think it still has another

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.930 
opinion I think it still has another
three<00:04:29.590> or<00:04:29.620> four<00:04:29.860> years<00:04:30.160> but<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:30.610> guess<00:04:30.760> we'll

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
three or four years but I guess we'll

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.209 
three or four years but I guess we'll
see<00:04:31.210> with<00:04:31.419> the<00:04:31.449> next<00:04:31.720> release<00:04:32.020> of<00:04:32.349> treyarch<00:04:32.919> I

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:33.219 
see with the next release of treyarch I

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:34.260 
see with the next release of treyarch I
don't<00:04:33.430> know<00:04:33.490> what<00:04:33.610> they're<00:04:33.640> gonna<00:04:33.760> do<00:04:33.969> I<00:04:34.000> hope

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
don't know what they're gonna do I hope

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.880 
don't know what they're gonna do I hope
it's<00:04:34.450> black<00:04:34.719> ops<00:04:34.960> 3<00:04:35.260> because<00:04:35.409> I<00:04:35.500> think<00:04:35.680> black

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
it's black ops 3 because I think black

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.490 
it's black ops 3 because I think black
ops<00:04:36.130> 3<00:04:36.490> would<00:04:36.729> be<00:04:36.760> a

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
ops 3 would be a

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.070 
ops 3 would be a
huge<00:04:37.620> huge<00:04:38.340> release<00:04:38.940> because<00:04:39.150> black<00:04:39.510> ops<00:04:39.750> was

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
huge huge release because black ops was

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.380 
huge huge release because black ops was
a<00:04:40.110> big<00:04:40.590> big<00:04:40.830> series<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.670> don't<00:04:41.940> think<00:04:42.300> that

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
a big big series and I don't think that

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.180 
a big big series and I don't think that
they<00:04:42.810> would<00:04:43.050> just<00:04:43.110> kill<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.710> because<00:04:43.920> if<00:04:44.130> you

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
they would just kill it because if you

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.530 
they would just kill it because if you
think<00:04:44.250> about<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.670> things<00:04:45.000> always<00:04:45.240> come<00:04:45.360> down

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
think about it things always come down

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.360 
think about it things always come down
to<00:04:45.750> sales<00:04:46.290> they're<00:04:46.620> going<00:04:46.920> to<00:04:47.010> do<00:04:47.130> things

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
to sales they're going to do things

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.980 
to sales they're going to do things
something<00:04:47.760> that<00:04:47.910> sells<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.570> something<00:04:48.960> that

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
something that sells and something that

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.600 
something that sells and something that
people<00:04:49.260> are<00:04:49.350> gonna<00:04:49.410> die<00:04:49.590> obviously<00:04:50.070> because

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
people are gonna die obviously because

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.670 
people are gonna die obviously because
it<00:04:50.910> is<00:04:51.180> a<00:04:51.210> it's<00:04:51.540> a<00:04:51.660> business<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.290> they<00:04:52.380> want<00:04:52.590> to

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
it is a it's a business and they want to

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.630 
it is a it's a business and they want to
make<00:04:52.800> profit<00:04:53.190> they<00:04:53.250> want<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.460> make<00:04:53.550> the

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
make profit they want to make the

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.400 
make profit they want to make the
biggest<00:04:53.910> profit<00:04:54.390> they<00:04:54.480> possibly<00:04:54.900> can<00:04:55.170> because

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
biggest profit they possibly can because

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.410 
biggest profit they possibly can because
it<00:04:55.800> is<00:04:55.950> a<00:04:56.310> business<00:04:56.730> and<00:04:56.850> that's<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.210> reality

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
it is a business and that's the reality

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.300 
it is a business and that's the reality
of<00:04:57.600> things<00:04:57.750> as<00:04:57.900> well<00:04:58.050> so<00:04:58.440> I<00:04:58.680> think<00:04:58.980> it<00:04:59.100> would<00:04:59.220> be

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
of things as well so I think it would be

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.400 
of things as well so I think it would be
smart<00:04:59.370> if<00:04:59.850> they<00:05:00.030> created<00:05:00.570> black<00:05:00.870> ops<00:05:01.110> 3<00:05:01.380> I

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
smart if they created black ops 3 I

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.260 
smart if they created black ops 3 I
think<00:05:01.680> they're<00:05:01.800> gonna<00:05:01.890> do<00:05:02.190> that<00:05:02.220> now<00:05:02.400> what

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
think they're gonna do that now what

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.360 
think they're gonna do that now what
timezone<00:05:03.900> are<00:05:03.960> gonna<00:05:04.260> place<00:05:04.590> black<00:05:04.860> ops<00:05:05.070> 3<00:05:05.250> and

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
timezone are gonna place black ops 3 and

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.190 
timezone are gonna place black ops 3 and
we<00:05:05.610> don't<00:05:05.790> know<00:05:06.120> because<00:05:06.330> there<00:05:06.810> is<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:06.990> lot<00:05:07.110> of

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
we don't know because there is a lot of

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.420 
we don't know because there is a lot of
discussion<00:05:07.740> on<00:05:07.830> whether<00:05:07.980> or<00:05:08.130> not<00:05:08.250> they're

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
discussion on whether or not they're

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.920 
discussion on whether or not they're
gonna<00:05:08.490> go<00:05:08.670> further<00:05:08.880> into<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.270> future<00:05:09.420> or<00:05:09.780> if

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
we don't know but I think they should

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.550 
we don't know but I think they should
stay<00:05:20.790> in<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.330> modern<00:05:21.750> time<00:05:21.990> I<00:05:22.200> don't<00:05:22.350> know<00:05:22.440> how

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
stay in the modern time I don't know how

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.320 
stay in the modern time I don't know how
I<00:05:22.620> feel<00:05:22.890> about<00:05:22.950> going<00:05:23.340> back<00:05:23.640> in<00:05:23.850> time<00:05:23.970> I<00:05:24.180> know<00:05:24.270> a

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
I feel about going back in time I know a

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.490 
I feel about going back in time I know a
lot<00:05:24.480> of<00:05:24.540> people<00:05:24.630> really<00:05:24.960> want<00:05:25.110> to<00:05:25.169> see<00:05:25.320> that

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
lot of people really want to see that

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.840 
lot of people really want to see that
but<00:05:25.710> I<00:05:25.770> don't<00:05:26.010> know<00:05:26.190> but<00:05:26.370> I<00:05:26.430> hope<00:05:26.490> they<00:05:26.700> call

the<00:05:27.000> next<00:05:27.150> game<00:05:27.300> black<00:05:27.510> ops<00:05:27.690> 3<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:27.960> think<00:05:28.110> that'd

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
the next game black ops 3 I think that'd

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.450 
the next game black ops 3 I think that'd
be<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.380> great<00:05:28.650> step<00:05:29.070> in<00:05:29.190> the<00:05:29.280> right<00:05:29.430> direction

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460
