00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
the Mandrake's running room because

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.120 
the Mandrake's running room because
they're<00:03:29.160> invisible

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
they're invisible

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.760 
they're invisible
but<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.330> helicopter<00:03:33.110> will<00:03:33.290> detect<00:03:33.590> them

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
so in fact I managed to switch views so

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.730 
so in fact I managed to switch views so
that<00:03:38.060> we<00:03:38.150> can<00:03:38.360> see<00:03:39.020> where<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.230> Mandrake's<00:03:39.560> are

doing better economically I feel but the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.090 
doing better economically I feel but the
thing<00:04:05.600> is<00:04:05.630> when<00:04:05.960> chaos<00:04:06.320> play<00:04:06.560> like<00:04:06.740> this<00:04:06.890> they

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
thing is when chaos play like this they

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.280 
thing is when chaos play like this they
can<00:04:07.250> tend<00:04:07.520> to<00:04:07.760> get<00:04:08.630> some<00:04:08.840> really<00:04:09.020> good<00:04:09.140> stuff

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
can tend to get some really good stuff

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.170 
can tend to get some really good stuff
