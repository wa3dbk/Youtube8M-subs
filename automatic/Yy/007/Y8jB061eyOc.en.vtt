00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
a button recording oh it doesn't matter

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.809 
a button recording oh it doesn't matter
if<00:02:08.619> it's<00:02:08.649> covered<00:02:09.009> up<00:02:09.099> you're<00:02:09.280> making<00:02:09.520> videos

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
if it's covered up you're making videos

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.390 
if it's covered up you're making videos
on<00:02:10.030> about<00:02:10.410> pictures<00:02:11.410> though<00:02:11.620> I'm<00:02:12.130> not<00:02:12.160> really

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
on about pictures though I'm not really

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.699 
on about pictures though I'm not really
sure<00:02:12.550> that<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:13.150> don't<00:02:13.239> really<00:02:13.569> use<00:02:14.380> pictures

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
sure that I don't really use pictures

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.970 
sure that I don't really use pictures
along<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.060> have<00:02:16.540> mine<00:02:16.750> covering<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.380> just<00:02:17.830> on

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
along so I have mine covering it just on

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.160 
along so I have mine covering it just on
the<00:02:18.069> outside<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.270> lenses<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:19.900> when<00:02:20.080> it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
the outside of the lenses so when it

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.500 
the outside of the lenses so when it
pops<00:02:20.440> out<00:02:20.650> it's<00:02:21.250> not<00:02:21.430> getting<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.940> lenses<00:02:22.330> way

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
pops out it's not getting the lenses way

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.840 
pops out it's not getting the lenses way
or<00:02:22.750> anything<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.709> make<00:02:24.520> sure<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:25.600> top<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:26.850> the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
or anything and make sure the top of the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.240 
or anything and make sure the top of the
top<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.270> this<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.750> off<00:02:28.989> because<00:02:29.530> if<00:02:29.739> this<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.100> on

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
top of this is off because if this is on

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.410 
top of this is off because if this is on
here<00:02:30.489> it's<00:02:30.700> not<00:02:30.850> going<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.120> work<00:02:31.180> at<00:02:31.390> all

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
here it's not going to work at all

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.750 
here it's not going to work at all
because<00:02:31.690> well<00:02:32.050> this<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.380> in<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.620> way<00:02:32.769> unless

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
because well this is in the way unless

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.390 
because well this is in the way unless
you're<00:02:34.290> going<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.500> don't<00:02:35.769> know<00:02:35.830> make<00:02:36.280> it

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
you're going to I don't know make it

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.830 
you're going to I don't know make it
underneath<00:02:36.640> there<00:02:36.940> something<00:02:37.300> if<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.660> like

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
underneath there something if you like

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.320 
underneath there something if you like
solve<00:02:38.739> this<00:02:38.950> little<00:02:39.220> tip<00:02:39.610> off<00:02:39.790> which<00:02:40.090> might<00:02:40.300> be

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
solve this little tip off which might be

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.509 
solve this little tip off which might be
a<00:02:40.450> pretty<00:02:40.600> good<00:02:40.720> idea<00:02:40.959> actually<00:02:41.430> all<00:02:42.430> right

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
a pretty good idea actually all right

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.009 
a pretty good idea actually all right
well<00:02:42.700> I'm<00:02:43.150> going<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:44.130> fit<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:45.310> in<00:02:46.019> hopefully

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
well I'm going to fit this in hopefully

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.590 
well I'm going to fit this in hopefully
I'll<00:02:47.260> get<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.739> good<00:02:47.920> angle<00:02:48.069> for<00:02:48.280> me<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.670> actually

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
I'll get a good angle for me to actually

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:58.110 
I'll get a good angle for me to actually
help<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:56.459> it's<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.519> little<00:02:57.700> tight<00:02:57.910> though
