00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.610
 hi there are a lot of different anboxings for me 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.870
 already had to do but probably 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:17.310
 But there was not when I came here this 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:23.730
 Here is a small package wrapped she came from 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:27.480
 Russia from Moscow but at least kill me 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.380
 I absolutely do not remember and can not imagine 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.640
 who sent it to me and what is 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:39.899
 here inside so here came out and even to me 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.210
 a bit ashamed of it well some 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.100
 guess I have but nonetheless 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.590
 I can’t say for sure what it is 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.680
 package wrapped although I have some 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.219
 such an intimate premonition that here 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.920
 something interesting 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.170
 before my departure on vacation early August 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.960
 for 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.000
 July, I received several 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.979
 messages in a personal with suggestions from 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.400
 people send me a test and 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.040
 different knives such offers were 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.920
 several and in principle I think I'm on 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.890
 all agreed because that's how I 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.380
 remember these were some knives from 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.400
 Russian producers and 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.640
 but since I don't have access to this 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.909
 But the Russian market 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.610
 good access let's say that not 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:44.040
 of course it was very interesting and I 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.790
 agreed judging by the stamp here but here 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.790
 package wrapped 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.660
 we are customer 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:01.810
 Scotch and now I can not tear more 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:05.640
 108 13 that is , it was sent 6 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.740
 August 2013 that is relatively 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.080
 recently and came to me for several 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.710
 days ago, that is, it was about two-three 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.220
 Weeks and this you boxing it turns out I 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:22.060
 I do for two things 101 of course 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.070
 see what's here and the second is to find 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.220
 sender find this person to me 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:31.000
 really want to Leon when find out 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.730
 my parcel wrote to me, well, we somehow 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.220
 brush with them talked to me 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:43.990
 remembered on the customs declaration 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.970
 written tools so here is how that 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:51.030
 tactile sensations do not feel that 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:55.350
 100 percent of the legs well, let's see 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.350
 my pocket on seba 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.670
 beautifully sealed 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:35.600
 now i remember 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:37.910
 now i remembered that 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.570
 this sentence and this correspondence 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.250
 I completely lost my memory 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.390
 somehow remembered some suggestions 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:52.100
 other people there was a guy who 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:56.270
 offered me to take zero tolerance 550 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.010
 on tests and if I remember correctly on 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.610
 hard us tests 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:06.920
 but this we will clarify but in my opinion it is 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:10.880
 so and if so it will be crazy 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.800
 interesting but if not quite on hard 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.160
 I am sure that mouth will be interesting too 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.160
 how dumb is he 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.930
 looking for myself 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:41.000
 it’s good to be there 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:45.379
 Chinese legs I do not understand you can just 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.949
 tightly pops up the frame and can not 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.949
 improve 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.150
 some kind of crazy sticking 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:06.099
 let's do a little experiment 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.780
 right away 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.780
 3 heel pencil lead 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:23.330
 check again there is still a 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:30.400
 just crazy some kind of sticking on 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:32.990
 knife a little bit yuzany knife 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:38.750
 nevertheless in principle 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:47.919
 excellent condition zero tolerance 550 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:49.900
 with steel with 35 visible and wow i'm already 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.180
 looking forward to 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:56.029
 very interesting development 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:01.129
 She is already coming here is a new clip that is 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:02.090
 this is a copy of the new batches frame 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:06.169
 drops in 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:08.000
 pretty far away I think even before 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.580
 testing I will understand this knife 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.099
 see what happens there that is 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.169
 frame erased and it was originally so 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:19.189
 should drop off should not be so 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:23.960
 so extremely interesting more but this is not 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:27.860
 the thing that can not be here so you need to carry 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:34.120
 you don't need a Chinese knife with you yet 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:37.729
 utter the frame yes here's such 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:40.879
 interesting surprise i hope you 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:43.430
 It was interesting thanks to the man who 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:46.699
 sent this knife and i beg it 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:50.060
 respond in a private message again 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:54.650

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:59.620
