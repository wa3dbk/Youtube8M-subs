favorite wish on a star I just really
like<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.310> paint<00:03:05.579> job<00:03:05.819> on<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.150> one<00:03:06.510> on<00:03:06.629> the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
like the paint job on that one on the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.750 
like the paint job on that one on the
Big<00:03:06.870> Ben<00:03:07.049> mold<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.560> think<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.549> way<00:03:08.730> that

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
Big Ben mold I think the way that

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.589 
Big Ben mold I think the way that
picture<00:03:09.329> looks<00:03:09.980> hazel<00:03:10.980> eyed<00:03:11.099> detail<00:03:11.599> so

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
picture looks hazel eyed detail so

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.300 
picture looks hazel eyed detail so
hopefully<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.379> horse<00:03:13.650> looks<00:03:13.889> the<00:03:14.099> same<00:03:14.250> in

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
hopefully the horse looks the same in

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.890 
hopefully the horse looks the same in
person<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.879> mean<00:03:15.030> sometimes<00:03:15.389> the<00:03:15.599> horse<00:03:15.780> is

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
person I mean sometimes the horse is

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.890 
person I mean sometimes the horse is
very<00:03:15.930> from<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.209> promo<00:03:18.209> picture<00:03:18.629> you<00:03:18.720> see

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
very from the promo picture you see

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.569 
very from the promo picture you see
compared<00:03:19.349> to<00:03:19.409> the<00:03:19.530> actual<00:03:19.650> real<00:03:20.069> model<00:03:20.400> you

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
compared to the actual real model you

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.970 
compared to the actual real model you
get<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:21.720> hopefully<00:03:22.019> all<00:03:22.079> these<00:03:22.349> horses<00:03:22.829> look

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
get so hopefully all these horses look

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.569 
get so hopefully all these horses look
just<00:03:23.340> as<00:03:23.459> great<00:03:23.609> as<00:03:23.819> they<00:03:23.940> do<00:03:24.000> in<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.329> pictures

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
just as great as they do in the pictures

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.530 
just as great as they do in the pictures
so<00:03:26.579> I'm<00:03:26.639> looking<00:03:26.790> forward<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.239> seeing<00:03:27.420> these
