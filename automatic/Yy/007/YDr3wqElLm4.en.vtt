00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 be all welcome in the comment 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.859
 today's random 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.080
 from there my first impressions 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.960
 about the 6 series of the crystal world 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.270
 Released in July 2014 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.190
 this new adaptation is much more loyal 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.420
 in the history of the original manga 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.460
 including changes in the design of the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.960
 characters and the elimination of all 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.770
 stories that had been created 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.779
 exclusively for the anime of 1992 is 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.489
 This is why the series will be very 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.169
 different from the vast majority of fans 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.540
 especially in elements such as 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.610
 detox language participations that you do not use 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.750
 the iconic rose to save the day the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.149
 way that followers are known 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.520
 scouts that is similar but in contexts 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.160
 slightly different and even the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.899
 personalities of these one of the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.100
 aspects that has generated more debate is 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.289
 that the range of expressions of 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.850
 protagonists especially serene is 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.980
 much more limited even in 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.839
 comparison with the sleeve and except cases 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.239
 very specific changes have been omitted 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.290
 of style for comic effects as well as 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.360
 in physical comedy 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.160
 in contrast, it seems a great 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.740
 emphasis on the protagonists being seen 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.330
 beautiful at all times which can 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.670
 be noticed to see that all the women of 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.740
 the series are always made up except 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.170
 the little girls and I put in figures 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.630
 excessively thin with arms and 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.610
 ridiculously long legs in my 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.410
 review this from weeks to criteria 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.660
 of market that to try to make a 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.490
 faithful adaptation to the manga because instead 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.979
 of having protagonists with whom to be able to 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.920
 identified appears to be a crystal 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.600
 be presenting idealized images 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.390
 trying to change the I am like that because of him 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.340
 I want to be like that about the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.020
 technical elements most of the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.880
 animation of the first chapters is 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.410
 quite acceptable but in certain 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.479
 moments and especially during the 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.130
 second half of chapter 3 the 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.990
 illustrations have flaws that although 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.210
 they are not frequent they become very 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.130
 notorious spoiling the attention of the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.780
 scenes and in the case of animations 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.940
 computer used for 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.770
 Transformation sequences are fine 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.330
 made but actually I think that 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.030
 It would have been better if the series 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.009
 keep in a single style as data 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.840
 curious the designs of the henchmen of 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.210
 the queen bale are now a little more 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.310
 delicate but ironically the only 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.840
 exception is I'm safe and now it makes clear 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.519
 that it was really a man 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.709
 even though many dubs 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.620
 including Latin America would not have 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.540
 established as a woman in fact at 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.820
 be more attached to manga this series does not 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.080
 is afraid to expose the aspects 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.120
 bisexuals and homosexuals present in 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.269
 him and that had been softened in the 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.739
 1992 series on the contrary it seems the 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.630
 you want to take some situations to 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.820
 implications greater than those that had 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.739
 in the sleeve itself this is very 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.570
 interesting since I think we're in 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.070
 an era where there is greater acceptance in 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.530
 these issues as something that really 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.060
 it exists and what is spoken unlike 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.739
 22 years ago 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.840
 to conclude I think that this series 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.190
 despite the negative effects 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.260
 previously mentioned is not an evil 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.510
 product itself and is made with 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.070
 quite respect to the franchise at 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.019
 otherwise if he manages to fix his 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.640
 problems has a great potential for 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.830
 make memorable for anime fans 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.819
 Old well as to attract new 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.890
 public 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.689
 so if you have not seen it yet and 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.920
 you enjoyed the previous series you 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.530
 I invite you to see her and get your own 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.329
 conclusions at least if you have not read the 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.159
 manga you will see the story just like 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.389
 the author suggested that this is the way 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.040
 scene 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:15.900
 I am Robert Langdon and that has been my 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.900
 Comment on this until soon 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.380
 do not 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.070
 look 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.590
 to end
