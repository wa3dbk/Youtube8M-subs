00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.620
 Added 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.620
 Hmm 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.519
 dee 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.299
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.299
 Four 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.679
 2 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.679
 I will 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:35.890
 mhf 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:35.890
 b 4 ten 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.430
 I would like to begin the second class, thank you 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:17.620
 The firm where Boo Boo said tee Pharaoh speed was NiÃ±o fusion 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.620
 Let's do it in that child's style so that you can control it 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.770
 Ah 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.770
 Follow 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:40.400
 We are doing a cheap gate or in part as a form between the legs and feet Nogaee 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:42.370
 The reason for this promise is that basically the outside is the main idea outside the turn turn 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.410
 Because I want to move 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:54.430
 I'm not doing very well if I 'm disturbing the brass gate without a single inside 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:02:01.020
 Such of the in move on the turn outside Masho main through the middle of both feet plus gate 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:04.640
 The reverse diarrhea of Turnseher's jewelry and turn rice firmly in a feeling 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.640
 Let's to go with the 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:19.379
 Toward the husband upper body to turn out outside Kedah is over over physician 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.470
 I try to move both interest and upper body firmly in the opposite direction. 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.470
 Let's go 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:32.010
 Inward facing firmly into the inside with respect to turn the outside of the foot 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.010
 Type 4 Day 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:44.819
 From the 10 twist customer Nelly this little bit more line by the side of the gate 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:50.010
 I think perfect and turn can be as to that there are many 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:56.459
 I think that everyone was well done overall, but the important point is 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:59.909
 Such as the wind that you want stripped the outside or toward the inner to the foot should now be a sofa 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:04.069
 It is rude to say that 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:08.749
 It is the same even if the next time this parallel Sukau Nsu 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:12.670
 In advance for the direction the ski is firmly facing 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:19.920
 Face inward in the fact that the turn of veterinary twist 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:25.140
 And in the middle of the next turn, we make a reverse twisting movement against the ski movement 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:30.780
 Let 's do it in the gate that it is connected smoothly 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:34.110
 In the next column, it is still in the state which caught both feet male in the next column 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:39.910
 A certain degree because it is good to not do it until the carving 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:43.060
 Only the upper body skis first in the situation where the ski moves freely 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.060
 I will practice things like preparing for gas 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.150
 Let's do our best 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.650
 Now Come on Come on Come on is is to prevent broken hips 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.000
 My waist is broken now 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.000
 Now very good slip 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.950
 There were a lot of people passing through the whole school for a while at the time of the term fair's arrival 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.030
 I was worried about 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:12.490
 Since only the US and severe head not a particularly at this stage 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.060
 It's not like I'm going to slide up in my head like I'm not going to stand and I'll find it next time 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.960
 To 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:21.080
 You can say that you slip in carding 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:25.910
 Practice times in becoming at that time the love for the first time firmly with him 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:29.600
 In a state of being stably so as not to a difference of the left and right relative to the previous holes 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:35.180
 Cormorant Qi in 6 outward twisting reverse non-profit 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.680
 It is possible to be cured at that stage if you do it with a feeling like doing a carving turn alone 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.289
 There is also sex 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:44.529
 Because there is a child who is not firmly anchored 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:51.249
 In the turn, for example , it is a stance of a pluck 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:54.789
 Now since there is also difficult or write better when I'll use also caught fork But apart 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:59.349
 Also in the stage that such Fu it 's such'm quite difficult 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:01.280
 Every turn I am good at a cardie I can do it well if I do it with a curling turn 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:05.900
 I think it will come next 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:11.090
 Finally in the exercise firmly in the carding turn 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.840
 While controlling the dailies in reverse to the inside twist, finally the pole line is straightened 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:18.020
 Opposite was 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:20.180
 If you can move Hanshin Garuko well with a fairly stable upper body, you will share the slip 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:26.030
 Let's go 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:28.990
 For the light that you don't have stock, just move your feet with your body facing the pole line 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.990
 Look all feel like 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:41.200
 Hey even better as long to change only the orientation of the body in the shaft is not broken in the transverse 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:43.529
 Tsutomu Ueda 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.389
 Come on now Come on 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:47.389
 It became good at studying abroad 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:57.770
 Well your batter in the reverse of the second half of the medium heat Nelly turn of that tax group 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:06:04.400
 At the beginning of the gate it was slow and I got carded afterwards 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:05.479
 It is a curling, and your new body keeps on turning to the natural 4 lightning when speed is increased 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:12.819
 Tamama 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:12.819
 Only firmly stable and legs had changed for the better in the wind no movement called small movement 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:22.200
 In fact the upper body is stable 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:24.510
 You already have to say that you can repeat the right turn and the left turn while facing the fort 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.200
 As you know it is an ideal slip 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:32.430
 Just firm on the side of the body to its ideal slip 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.889
 I think that I can only move the lower body-I can not do it even if it is said 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:38.319
 Because 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:44.590
 Conversely, while moving or moving the upper body here and there 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:47.770
 By raising the level of speed naturally the orientation of the upper body is stable and the result 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:52.659
 While taking into account Shin is a movement to the left to the right 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.880
 Remember if you can clear the gate 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:58.100
 a 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:59.090
 After this , when I was stepping up by myself, my body turned a little 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:04.610
 Or 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:05.780
 How do you fix it when it becomes such a weak point like the body is open 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:11.800
 Whether heal the 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:11.800
 I think it born the idea on their own even for wind place to say
