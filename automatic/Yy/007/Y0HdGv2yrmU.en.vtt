almost<00:02:28.030> like<00:02:28.180> if<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.510> water<00:02:28.720> supposed<00:02:29.200> to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
almost like if the water supposed to

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.920 
almost like if the water supposed to
flow<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.770> way<00:02:29.980> on<00:02:30.220> him<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:30.790> he<00:02:31.480> does<00:02:31.690> have

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
flow that way on him and he does have

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.750 
flow that way on him and he does have
some<00:02:31.960> arrows<00:02:32.760> along<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.880> side<00:02:34.150> right<00:02:34.420> here<00:02:34.810> so

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
some arrows along the side right here so

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.740 
some arrows along the side right here so
she<00:02:36.760> says<00:02:37.000> those<00:02:37.240> are<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.480> things<00:02:37.600> that

not something that looks like a face on
the<00:03:09.370> back<00:03:09.580> it<00:03:09.850> does<00:03:10.090> have<00:03:10.360> something<00:03:10.950> that

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950

kind<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.430> looks<00:03:12.700> like<00:03:12.790> its<00:03:13.270> face<00:03:13.660> let<00:03:14.230> me<00:03:14.260> try

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
kind of looks like its face let me try

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.100

to show it to you off real quick it I

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.090 
to show it to you off real quick it I
guess<00:03:17.350> it's<00:03:17.560> like<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.740> fake<00:03:18.160> face<00:03:19.830> can<00:03:20.830> you<00:03:20.920> see

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.870 
guess it's like a fake face can you see
the<00:03:21.220> eyes<00:03:21.340> down<00:03:21.730> there<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:23.640> is<00:03:24.640> pretty

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
the eyes down there so that is pretty

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.170 
the eyes down there so that is pretty
interesting<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:26.019> know<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.560> lot<00:03:26.860> of<00:03:26.940> animals<00:03:27.940> and

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
interesting I know a lot of animals and

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.090 
interesting I know a lot of animals and
creatures<00:03:28.360> in<00:03:28.690> real<00:03:28.900> life<00:03:29.110> have<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:29.680> where

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
creatures in real life have that where

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.850 
creatures in real life have that where
they<00:03:30.250> try<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.550> miss<00:03:30.850> direct<00:03:31.650> predators<00:03:32.650> from

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
they try to miss direct predators from

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.150 
they try to miss direct predators from
attacking<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:33.989> as<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.410> can<00:03:35.590> see<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.920> feet

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
attacking it and as you can see the feet

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.949 
attacking it and as you can see the feet
are<00:03:36.400> functional<00:03:37.390> in<00:03:37.570> this<00:03:37.900> marble<00:03:38.200> form<00:03:39.959> so

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
are functional in this marble form so

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.500 
are functional in this marble form so
once<00:03:41.320> it<00:03:41.500> transforms<00:03:42.190> she<00:03:42.670> says<00:03:42.970> that<00:03:43.269> she

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
once it transforms she says that she

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.140 
once it transforms she says that she
likes<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:44.019> way<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.560> tail<00:03:44.860> pops<00:03:45.310> out<00:03:45.610> which<00:03:45.910> as

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
likes the way the tail pops out which as

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.210 
likes the way the tail pops out which as
you<00:03:46.390> can<00:03:46.420> see<00:03:46.570> is<00:03:46.780> really<00:03:47.170> huge<00:03:47.500> because<00:03:47.980> it's

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
you can see is really huge because it's

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.550 
you can see is really huge because it's
pretty<00:03:48.970> much<00:03:49.150> it's<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.570> same<00:03:49.870> length<00:03:50.290> as

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
pretty much it's the same length as

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.540 
pretty much it's the same length as
himself<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:52.320> then<00:03:53.320> if<00:03:53.680> you<00:03:53.920> look<00:03:54.070> at<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.310> tail

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
himself and then if you look at the tail

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.900 
himself and then if you look at the tail
right<00:03:55.300> here<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:56.350> sharp<00:03:56.739> blade<00:03:57.250> like<00:03:57.580> it's<00:03:57.820> a

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
right here the sharp blade like it's a

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.090 
right here the sharp blade like it's a
double-edged<00:03:58.420> blade<00:03:58.450> looking<00:03:59.260> thing<00:03:59.530> I<00:03:59.739> think

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
double-edged blade looking thing I think

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.449 
double-edged blade looking thing I think
is<00:04:00.430> really<00:04:00.489> nice<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.959> it<00:04:02.920> looks<00:04:03.220> actually

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
is really nice and it looks actually

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.120 
is really nice and it looks actually
pretty<00:04:03.940> sharp<00:04:04.660> unlike<00:04:06.090> be<00:04:07.090> striker<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:08.130> she

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
pretty sharp unlike be striker and she

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.250 
pretty sharp unlike be striker and she
also<00:04:09.310> said<00:04:09.730> that<00:04:10.030> that's<00:04:10.510> just<00:04:10.630> my<00:04:10.810> comment

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
also said that that's just my comment

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.460 
also said that that's just my comment
and<00:04:11.380> she<00:04:12.130> also<00:04:12.160> said<00:04:12.550> that<00:04:12.580> right<00:04:13.300> here<00:04:13.630> he

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
and she also said that right here he

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.120 
and she also said that right here he
reveals<00:04:14.890> more<00:04:15.220> arrows<00:04:15.760> once<00:04:16.120> he's<00:04:16.390> opened<00:04:16.840> and

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
reveals more arrows once he's opened and

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.860 
reveals more arrows once he's opened and
that's<00:04:18.130> right<00:04:18.340> you<00:04:18.489> could<00:04:18.669> see<00:04:18.880> he<00:04:19.479> also<00:04:19.600> has

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
that's right you could see he also has

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.260 
that's right you could see he also has
arrows<00:04:20.290> that<00:04:20.590> go<00:04:20.739> all<00:04:20.979> along<00:04:21.370> on<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:21.880> inside

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
arrows that go all along on the inside

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.840 
arrows that go all along on the inside
here<00:04:22.840> as<00:04:22.990> well<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:23.979> of<00:04:24.130> course<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.610> face

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
here as well and of course the face

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.300 
here as well and of course the face
doesn't<00:04:25.419> change<00:04:25.720> because<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.530> face<00:04:26.860> is<00:04:26.890> still

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
doesn't change because the face is still

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.110 
doesn't change because the face is still
there

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120

look at look at the form and look at the
way<00:05:42.340> he<00:05:42.520> looks<00:05:42.789> so<00:05:43.539> i<00:05:43.570> can<00:05:43.840> understand<00:05:44.289> even

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
way he looks so i can understand even

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.050 
way he looks so i can understand even
though<00:05:44.830> she<00:05:44.889> did<00:05:45.190> say<00:05:45.370> she<00:05:45.580> was<00:05:45.700> eventually

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
going to get a terror claw so i guess if

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.000 
going to get a terror claw so i guess if
you<00:05:48.849> do<00:05:49.000> have<00:05:49.210> a<00:05:49.240> terror<00:05:49.570> claw<00:05:49.840> you<00:05:50.740> could<00:05:50.889> get

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
you do have a terror claw you could get

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.320 
you do have a terror claw you could get
a<00:05:51.039> limitless<00:05:51.520> and<00:05:51.700> make<00:05:51.849> them<00:05:52.030> fight<00:05:52.300> each

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
a limitless and make them fight each

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.700 
a limitless and make them fight each
other<00:05:52.660> because<00:05:53.050> they're<00:05:53.169> both<00:05:53.349> kind<00:05:53.590> of

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
other because they're both kind of

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.920 
other because they're both kind of
similar<00:05:54.250> in<00:05:54.550> a<00:05:54.639> way<00:05:54.669> so<00:05:55.419> they<00:05:55.570> can<00:05:55.750> make<00:05:55.900> good

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
similar in a way so they can make good
