a cool function I can write down a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.849 
a cool function I can write down a
formula<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.029> easily<00:00:27.869> find<00:00:28.080> an<00:00:28.289> answer<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.710> it

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
formula and easily find an answer to it

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.250 
formula and easily find an answer to it
you<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.849> see<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.420> I'm<00:00:30.689> writing<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.109> down

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
you can see that as I'm writing it down

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.250 
you can see that as I'm writing it down
the<00:00:31.769> formula<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.489> recognized<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.660> like<00:00:33.809> this

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260

now I meant to write down a six but my
handwriting<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.590> not<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.010> great<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.850> I'll

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
handwriting is not so great so I'll

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.479 
handwriting is not so great so I'll
simply<00:00:42.780> erase<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.379> correct<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:44.340> like

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489

this<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.879> as<00:00:45.480> easy<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:45.809> that

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
this so as easy as that

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.240 
this so as easy as that
and<00:00:46.200> I'll<00:00:46.770> write<00:00:46.920> down<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> better<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:49.190> now<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
and I'll write down a better one now the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.160 
and I'll write down a better one now the
formulas<00:00:50.760> been<00:00:50.910> recognized<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.629> let's<00:00:52.020> find

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
formulas been recognized so let's find

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.889 
formulas been recognized so let's find
the<00:00:52.289> answer<00:00:52.559> which<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.180> show<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.719> on
