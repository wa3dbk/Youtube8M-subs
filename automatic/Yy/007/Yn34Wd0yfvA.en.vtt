a little over needs laid length is just

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.850 
a little over needs laid length is just
under<00:04:59.050> three<00:04:59.680> inches<00:05:00.720> for<00:05:01.720> a<00:05:01.750> total<00:05:02.440> length<00:05:02.590> of

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
under three inches for a total length of

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.580 
under three inches for a total length of
just<00:05:03.670> about<00:05:03.940> six<00:05:04.390> and<00:05:04.510> a<00:05:04.600> half<00:05:04.630> inches<00:05:05.350> and<00:05:07.590> the

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
just about six and a half inches and the

just about six and a half inches and the
weight<00:05:08.860> on<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.700> mochi<00:05:10.120> Kronus<00:05:14.220> is<00:05:15.240> just<00:05:16.240> over

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
weight on the mochi Kronus is just over

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.010 
weight on the mochi Kronus is just over
two<00:05:16.870> ounces<00:05:17.320> so<00:05:18.220> it's<00:05:18.340> a<00:05:18.400> really<00:05:18.790> light<00:05:19.030> small

to<00:06:56.460> detail<00:06:56.520> went<00:06:57.300> into<00:06:57.420> the<00:06:58.310> manufacturing<00:06:59.310> of

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
to detail went into the manufacturing of

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.790 
to detail went into the manufacturing of
this<00:06:59.550> knife<00:06:59.760> or<00:07:00.720> the<00:07:00.870> craftsmanship<00:07:01.530> of<00:07:01.560> this

this knife or the craftsmanship of this
nice<00:07:02.010> it<00:07:02.220> I<00:07:02.340> mean<00:07:02.520> these<00:07:02.670> knives<00:07:02.880> are<00:07:03.060> handmade

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540 
nice it I mean these knives are handmade

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.570 
nice it I mean these knives are handmade
I<00:07:03.810> guess<00:07:04.320> it's<00:07:04.470> not<00:07:04.560> really<00:07:04.620> a<00:07:04.830> manufacturing

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
I guess it's not really a manufacturing
