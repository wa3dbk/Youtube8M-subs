00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
skills that I just learned on the

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.219 
skills that I just learned on the
computer<00:01:39.939> as<00:01:40.000> much<00:01:40.210> as<00:01:40.329> possible<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:41.020> I<00:01:41.110> mean

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
computer as much as possible and I mean

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.569 
computer as much as possible and I mean
it's<00:01:41.350> really<00:01:41.409> surprising<00:01:41.649> if<00:01:42.040> I<00:01:42.220> guess<00:01:42.369> it's

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
it's really surprising if I guess it's

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.130 
it's really surprising if I guess it's
once<00:01:43.390> you've<00:01:43.509> found<00:01:43.659> something<00:01:43.960> you're

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
once you've found something you're

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.569 
once you've found something you're
passionate<00:01:44.320> about<00:01:44.649> I<00:01:44.979> guess<00:01:45.189> that's<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.490> way

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
passionate about I guess that's the way
