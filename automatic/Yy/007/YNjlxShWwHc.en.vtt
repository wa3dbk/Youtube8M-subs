00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.240
 Hello such well today I 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.150
 to do a test of 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.340
 of lighting and also audio this 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.470
 this audio right now is a cavalier that 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.259
 I have here with me because I'm 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.509
 I'm at a relatively distance 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.430
 far from the cameras are not going to 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.279
 listen very well they will not catch me very 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.320
 ok the audio but at this moment I'm going to 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.920
 change the audio of the camera that has 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.920
 the light 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.460
 and then it happened to what is the proof 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.530
 of 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.670
 of lighting the test I'm 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.770
 doing very fast because it's 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.270
 starting to rain 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.000
 and I'm going to start 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.810
 for lighting 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.810
 the light of the lamp 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.240
 and I have it to the minimum I'm stopped at 12 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:22.180
 approximately meters of the cameras 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.180
 right now I have lighting to a minimum 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.580
 increase all your power to see 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.650
 Well now without the scope that has 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.650
 the lamp at 12 meters 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.200
 there we are with the maximum power 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.850
 this is the range that light has to 12 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.010
 meters away at its maximum power 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.010
 they are 1250 lumens 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.090
 well 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.390
 Now it's night is 10 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.280
 the night approximately we do not have a 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.750
 other lighting more than the patio 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.200
 with this focus that I have here to my 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.909
 left 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.909
 I'm going to put the light on the lamp 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.160
 turning off the light of the lamp not 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.380
 I only have the focus of 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.140
 from the patio but now I'm going to turn it off 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.290
 also this light so that they can see 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.290
 what 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.980
 the courtyard as virtually unseen 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.700
 I'm going to light again 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.540
 and then I'm going to turn on the first increase 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.910
 also the 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.160
 the light of the lamp 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.080
 at its maximum power I'm going to approach the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.360
 half 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.500
 half of the distance 16 meters 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.260
 approximately 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.720
 It is very likely that I look bad but 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.620
 I will reduce the intensity 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.620
 is to reduce the intensity 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.540
 at least I was 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:59.080
 intensity to the minimum I will go up a bit 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.080
 more likely there is seeing better 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.770
 and then the audio from the cameras 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.770
 that of the camera, it is this 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.810
 and then here concludes this test I will 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.810
 inspect the cameras 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.030
 and well, if everything is fine 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.780
 here it concludes it's starting to rain and 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.780
 I have to finish the test until later 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.780
 Thank you
