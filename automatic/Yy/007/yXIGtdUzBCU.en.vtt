00:00:00.479 --> 00:00:04.390
 solo and welcome to my 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:06.220
 latest product test as you have seen 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.040
 me in the nice little plant and that 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.280
 that a plant is a vertical cd 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.200
 radio system more precisely, as you can see 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.180
 is on the right here once and right 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.290
 left two roxy are very nice 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.700
 but can be attached as well 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.590
 be taken out if I saw that 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.570
 have to be attached to the wall 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.310
 earlier it just display what us women 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.880
 certainly says really great, the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.990
 you can see you see everything that means 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.430
 You can also do it for makeup 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.949
 will not use any fast 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.539
 mirror is near and at least 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.420
 the way it is is not about 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.469
 turned on up here is unfortunately 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.449
 you can see that I mean so well 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:44.469
 Camera is not that good once it's the one 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.149
 slot and once stop usb 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.429
 The whole thing has also headphone output 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.739
 and similar a very nice little one 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.989
 playing for the moment it costs 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.100
 I believe 67 eur 90 official 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.030
 recommended price is 99 euros 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.679
 the whole thing is to build 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.600
 bedroom currently being constructed 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.100
 test or will be here 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.500
 probably stay or ins 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.240
 sport especially did not join in it is so 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.920
 certainly because we have official 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.780
 namely below in our music room which 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.299
 we have a lighting system with us 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.829
 listen to the cds and that 's it 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.600
 just when you're doing sports 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.789
 or in the evening to sleep half music 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.070
 still wants to hear or has a cd or 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.780
 stop audioplus as in this case 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.369
 As you can see my husband has just me 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.380
 I was sick in bed like I was 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.920
 a five friends quote belongs to 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.909
 I have to distract myself 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.740
 am now here's a little bit 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.420
 roughly explain the functions like you 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.180
 Knowing is not exactly like that 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.890
 video all the things allowed musicians 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.960
 Accordingly, I leave that easy 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.850
 once asked away because get in trouble here 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.219
 because I just played something 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.119
 for which have some rights 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.280
 accordingly, just explain like that 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.939
 and I hope you understand anyway 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.670
 what it's about 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.250
 to the whole sound qualities prohibited 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.840
 later but what you see as you have 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.429
 here at first a time what 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.049
 very nice always you wake up at night 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.649
 and just want to know how late 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.960
 it is 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.420
 so be it down here once and 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.409
 Press the switch once and then 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.290
 it's going to be pictures 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.479
 you see yourself still is 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.480
 but rather the whole im 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.040
 background so if your cd and 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.830
 want you can also make up but 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.810
 and then the whole thing goes out the same way 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.110
 even more intact on it and the whole drives 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.570
 back together and let the machart 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.240
 I think it's very well made 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.860
 drives up without problems and has no 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.830
 will not be cheap anyway 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.270
 or something like that else you have 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.620
 a few nice features I explain 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.140
 you just here is for example on 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.300
 1 alarm two half one could as well 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.950
 use backup and keep clock radio and 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.590
 then here is just one thing must work 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.360
 and if you stop usb or sd card 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.190
 one has used the even fuller 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.380
 if you also select which files 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.660
 otherwise I would like the whole 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.300
 programs tune stop for radio in the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.810
 is also there or stop button 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.020
 state break and the like if it is here 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.340
 once again loud and quiet and then are 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.590
 here is the function 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.080
 I have currently stop as I said cd in it 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.739
 and otherwise there is this whole 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:15.000
 nice gimmicks so once sd like 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.160
 you see, then here is usb 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.739
 connection will be the reading though 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.080
 Of course nothing 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.420
 then he has radio only once completely 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.470
 short to switch then here is still 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.090
 in connection and then we are again 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.040
 arrived at the cd 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.470
 so therefore, as this is a very nice 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.690
 plant already with us the first 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.400
 had run test and accordingly 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.730
 we are actually quite whole now 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.400
 satisfied only manko there have been 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.410
 that we just got a CD 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.989
 have said these nice five friends cd 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.880
 And the problem was simple 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.739
 that this nice product stops in the middle 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.630
 It has stopped in there 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.700
 of course that's the whole thing 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.320
 problem but she sees that something 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.630
 scratched two kids genes with the 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.070
 not very careful about that 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.959
 I do not want to deny it now either 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.330
 We're going to watch a little bit now 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.310
 on and later because of my writing 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.950
 review who in a test report then 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.510
 again, otherwise at the 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.670
 second cd the wilke 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.530
 There were no problems at all 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.389
 He walks through it without a jerk 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.269
 without anything distorted or otherwise 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.520
 Something the language quality is just 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.280
 for the trade-boxing very well 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.110
 good as an acceptable one wants now 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.760
 really stop in loudspeaker or that 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.530
 is used to speakers like me 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.810
 now used to 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.850
 it is of course different but so 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.550
 a small system is really good 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.560
 Well, I have to say I had it myself 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.060
 as a child, a small plant around one 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.310
 stepfather still has something like that 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.590
 small with cassette and cdh to listen 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.030
 and accordingly, I can stop 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.190
 Judges if it is very good or 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.660
 Not 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.669
 otherwise the processing of 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.340
 the whole device is very good the boxes 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.500
 are a bit hooked 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.100
 it actually all very nice 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.840
 does one work that way? 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.650
 I would say so the first impression 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.560
 and the first tests are real 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.479
 outstanding what is in any case 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.100
 really enjoyable and you can do it 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.800
 really for private use for 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.360
 use in between 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.860
 as I said I'll tell more to you 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.720
 a test report me then more 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.680
 experience is so far from then 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.680
 time your sarah
