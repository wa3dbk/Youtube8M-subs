another<00:03:15.420> good<00:03:15.630> plug<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.320> it

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
another good plug in and it

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
work so I don't wander again so I

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.120 
work so I don't wander again so I
installed<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:33.270> easy<00:03:33.480> plug<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:34.020> and<00:03:34.200> she<00:03:34.950> just

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
installed this easy plug in and she just

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.150 
installed this easy plug in and she just
basically<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:36.330> kong<00:03:36.540> config<00:03:37.410> file<00:03:37.650> was<00:03:37.890> just

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
basically the kong config file was just

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.640 
basically the kong config file was just
to<00:03:38.370> set<00:03:39.060> into<00:03:39.330> full<00:03:39.540> where<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:39.780> shows<00:03:39.990> up<00:03:40.260> and

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
to set into full where it shows up and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.210 
to set into full where it shows up and
that's<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.580> does<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.030> automatically<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:43.220> so

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
that's it does it automatically and so

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.910 
that's it does it automatically and so
