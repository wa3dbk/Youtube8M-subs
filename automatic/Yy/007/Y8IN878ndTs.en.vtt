carp the anatomy of a triangle of the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.860 
carp the anatomy of a triangle of the
neck<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.280> today<00:00:09.059> I'm<00:00:09.300> going<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.570> be<00:00:09.690> using

some body paints to paint to dr. webson

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.879 
some body paints to paint to dr. webson
here<00:00:12.269> I'm<00:00:12.420> showing<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.170> boundaries<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
here I'm showing the boundaries of the

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.010 
here I'm showing the boundaries of the
posterior<00:00:14.400> triangle<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.000> neck<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.480> some

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
posterior triangle of the neck and some

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.019 
posterior triangle of the neck and some
of<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.289> important<00:00:17.190> nerves<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.730> blood

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
of the important nerves and blood

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.560 
of the important nerves and blood
vessels<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.539> are<00:00:18.600> involved<00:00:20.270> okey-dokey<00:00:21.270> so

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
vessels that are involved okey-dokey so

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.939 
vessels that are involved okey-dokey so
today<00:00:21.869> we're<00:00:22.199> going<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.410> be<00:00:22.500> fighting<00:00:22.859> with

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
today we're going to be fighting with

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.099 
today we're going to be fighting with
the<00:00:23.070> boundaries<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.000> posterior<00:00:24.420> triangle

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the boundaries of the posterior triangle

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.859 
the boundaries of the posterior triangle
of<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.350> neck<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.279> anterior<00:00:27.060> boundary<00:00:27.599> is

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
of the neck so the anterior boundary is

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.380 
of the neck so the anterior boundary is
a<00:00:28.140> big<00:00:28.890> chunk<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.340> muscle<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:29.970> see<00:00:30.150> for

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
a big chunk of muscle that we see for

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.200 
a big chunk of muscle that we see for
the<00:00:30.539> sternocleidomastoid<00:00:31.219> okay<00:00:32.250> now<00:00:32.880> it's

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the sternocleidomastoid okay now it's

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.990 
the sternocleidomastoid okay now it's
got<00:00:33.390> two<00:00:33.780> heads<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.590> what<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
got two heads and what it is on the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
got two heads and what it is on the
sternum<00:00:36.329> or<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> clavicle<00:00:37.739> okay

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
sternum or one is on the clavicle okay

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.950 
sternum or one is on the clavicle okay
and<00:00:38.219> they<00:00:38.309> both<00:00:38.520> come<00:00:38.850> up<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.300> insert<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
and they both come up and insert on the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.229 
and they both come up and insert on the
mastoid<00:00:40.290> process<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.890> temporal<00:00:41.129> bone<00:00:41.610> so

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
mastoid process of the temporal bone so

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.360 
mastoid process of the temporal bone so
if<00:00:42.540> dr.<00:00:43.020> Webster<00:00:43.230> here<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:43.739> can<00:00:43.920> see<00:00:44.160> this

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
if dr. Webster here we can see this

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.720 
if dr. Webster here we can see this
broad<00:00:44.640> boundary<00:00:47.809> yeah<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.140> think<00:00:49.410> come<00:00:50.250> all<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
broad boundary yeah I think come all the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.760 
broad boundary yeah I think come all the
way<00:00:50.760> okay<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.239> quite<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.480> big<00:00:51.660> muscle<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.649> you

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
way okay it's quite a big muscle if you

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.299 
way okay it's quite a big muscle if you
turn<00:00:53.010> your<00:00:53.190> head<00:00:53.250> towards<00:00:54.120> me<00:00:54.949> and<00:00:55.949> now<00:00:56.129> wait

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
turn your head towards me and now wait

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.569 
turn your head towards me and now wait
for<00:00:56.340> me<00:00:57.320> there<00:00:58.320> that's<00:00:58.829> where<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.309> see<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
for me there that's where you can see it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.950 
for me there that's where you can see it
comes<00:00:59.850> straight<00:01:00.090> out<00:01:00.239> there<00:01:00.480> okay<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:00.780> that's

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
comes straight out there okay so that's

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.709 
comes straight out there okay so that's
the<00:01:01.050> anterior<00:01:01.680> border<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.370> triangle<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the anterior border of this triangle the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.050 
the anterior border of this triangle the
posterior<00:01:04.080> border<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.680> another<00:01:05.010> big<00:01:05.670> muscle

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
posterior border is another big muscle

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.500 
posterior border is another big muscle
it<00:01:06.479> comes<00:01:06.720> back<00:01:07.070> like<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.340> okay<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.270> called

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
it comes back like this okay it's called

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.600 
it comes back like this okay it's called
the<00:01:09.600> trapezius<00:01:10.380> muscle<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.189> got<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.400> same

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the trapezius muscle it's got the same

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.190 
the trapezius muscle it's got the same
insertion<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.810> then<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> big

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
insertion up here and then it's a big

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.469 
insertion up here and then it's a big
sheet<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.950> muscle<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.909> actually<00:01:15.180> comes

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
sheet like muscle and it actually comes

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.240 
sheet like muscle and it actually comes
all<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> way<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.290> back<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:16.890> all<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
all the way to the back and then all the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.370 
all the way to the back and then all the
way<00:01:17.310> down<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.880> kind<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.090> triangle<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:19.290> we

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
way down in a kind of triangle but we

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.539 
way down in a kind of triangle but we
won't<00:01:19.560> worry<00:01:19.619> about<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.189> now<00:01:20.340> because

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
won't worry about that for now because

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.520 
won't worry about that for now because
we're<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:20.850> looking<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.150> neck<00:01:21.350> okay<00:01:22.350> so

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
we're just looking at the neck okay so

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.190 
we're just looking at the neck okay so
that's<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.009> posterior<00:01:23.610> border<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.930> base

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
that's the posterior border and the base

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.030 
that's the posterior border and the base
of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.590> triangle<00:01:26.990> is<00:01:27.990> actually<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> clavicle

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
of the triangle is actually the clavicle

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.469 
of the triangle is actually the clavicle
it's<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.280> bone<00:01:29.549> okay<00:01:29.909> so

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.910 

okay<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.890> this<00:01:39.100> now<00:01:40.320> master<00:01:41.320> it's<00:01:41.470> it's<00:01:41.650> coming

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
okay so this now master it's it's coming

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.390 
okay so this now master it's it's coming
down<00:01:42.070> there<00:01:42.310> okay<00:01:42.690> cool<00:01:43.690> comes<00:01:43.869> along<00:01:44.080> there

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
down there okay cool comes along there

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.740 
down there okay cool comes along there
really<00:01:45.460> so<00:01:45.729> this<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.000> posterior<00:01:46.330> triangle

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
really so this is the posterior triangle

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.100 
really so this is the posterior triangle
of<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.110> neck<00:01:47.460> right<00:01:48.460> now<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:49.060> posterior<00:01:49.659> only

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
of the neck right now the posterior only

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.010 
of the neck right now the posterior only
the<00:01:50.259> neck<00:01:50.409> does<00:01:50.800> divide<00:01:51.190> a<00:01:51.610> muscle<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:52.600> comes

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
the neck does divide a muscle that comes

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.960 
the neck does divide a muscle that comes
from<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.380> highway<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.159> scapula<00:01:54.610> comes

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
from the highway to the scapula comes

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.270 
from the highway to the scapula comes
through<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.450> divide<00:01:55.720> this<00:01:56.110> triangle<00:01:56.830> into

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
through and divide this triangle into

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.359 
through and divide this triangle into
two<00:01:57.509> okay<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:59.530> muscle<00:01:59.950> is<00:02:00.040> called<00:02:00.220> the

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
two okay so the muscle is called the

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.660 
two okay so the muscle is called the
omohyoid<00:02:01.050> it's<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.170> inferior<00:02:03.130> value<00:02:03.310> of<00:02:03.550> the

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
omohyoid it's the inferior value of the

omohyoid it's the inferior value of the
Umayyad<00:02:04.090> that<00:02:04.420> we<00:02:04.509> can<00:02:04.660> see<00:02:04.840> in<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.080> posterior

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
Umayyad that we can see in the posterior

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.550 
Umayyad that we can see in the posterior
triangle<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.330> divides<00:02:07.690> this<00:02:08.170> triangle

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
triangle and it divides this triangle

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.729 
triangle and it divides this triangle
into<00:02:08.860> two<00:02:09.190> triangles<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.810> occipital<00:02:11.200> this

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
into two triangles the occipital this

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.920 
into two triangles the occipital this
one<00:02:11.890> here<00:02:12.100> that<00:02:12.130> I'm<00:02:12.340> pointing<00:02:12.489> at<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.030> the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
one here that I'm pointing at and the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.160 
one here that I'm pointing at and the
sub<00:02:14.590> supraclavicular<00:02:15.930> sorry<00:02:17.019> the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
sub supraclavicular sorry the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.020 
sub supraclavicular sorry the
supraclavicular<00:02:17.650> triangle<00:02:18.459> sometimes<00:02:18.820> cook

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
supraclavicular triangle sometimes cook

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.720 
supraclavicular triangle sometimes cook
the<00:02:19.150> subclavian<00:02:19.450> triangle<00:02:20.290> as<00:02:20.410> well<00:02:20.459> okay<00:02:21.489> oh

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
the subclavian triangle as well okay oh

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.180 
the subclavian triangle as well okay oh
the<00:02:22.630> other<00:02:22.750> thing<00:02:23.019> we<00:02:23.140> need<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.320> talk<00:02:23.590> about<00:02:23.650> is

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
the other thing we need to talk about is

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.050 
the other thing we need to talk about is
the<00:02:25.440> spinal<00:02:26.440> accessory<00:02:26.709> nerve<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.790> there's<00:02:27.970> a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
the spinal accessory nerve and there's a

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.550 
the spinal accessory nerve and there's a
plagiarist<00:02:28.569> wrinkles<00:02:29.170> yeah<00:02:30.060> right<00:02:31.319> okay<00:02:32.319> so

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
plagiarist wrinkles yeah right okay so

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.340 
plagiarist wrinkles yeah right okay so
if<00:02:32.769> we<00:02:32.920> look<00:02:33.069> at<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.459> course<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.360> spinal

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
if we look at the course of the spinal

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.710 
if we look at the course of the spinal
accessory<00:02:35.440> nerve<00:02:35.829> we<00:02:36.519> take<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.970> just<00:02:37.450> above

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
accessory nerve we take it just above

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.930 
accessory nerve we take it just above
halfway<00:02:38.320> down<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.920> external<00:02:39.340> head<00:02:39.489> mastoid

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
halfway down the external head mastoid

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.270 
halfway down the external head mastoid
okay<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.780> runs<00:02:41.019> in<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.290> posterior<00:02:41.680> fashion

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
okay and it runs in a posterior fashion

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.259 
okay and it runs in a posterior fashion
it<00:02:42.430> comes<00:02:42.640> through<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:43.000> sternocleidomastoid

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
it comes through the sternocleidomastoid

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.550 
it comes through the sternocleidomastoid
and<00:02:44.110> runs<00:02:44.650> posteriorly<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.880> posterior

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
and runs posteriorly in the posterior

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.310 
and runs posteriorly in the posterior
triangle<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.890> neck<00:02:47.950> through<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.320> hits

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
triangle of the neck through and hits

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.470 
triangle of the neck through and hits
the<00:02:50.560> trapezius<00:02:51.340> where<00:02:51.549> it<00:02:51.640> also<00:02:51.790> innovates

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
the trapezius where it also innovates

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.759 
the trapezius where it also innovates
the<00:02:52.660> trapezius<00:02:53.079> muscles<00:02:53.410> so<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.560> innervates

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
the trapezius muscles so it innervates

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.080 
the trapezius muscles so it innervates
the<00:02:53.980> sternocleidomastoid<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.940> the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
the sternocleidomastoid and the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.000 
the sternocleidomastoid and the
trapezius<00:02:55.600> now<00:02:56.079> why<00:02:56.230> it's<00:02:56.410> important<00:02:56.829> to<00:02:56.890> know

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
trapezius now why it's important to know

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.380 
trapezius now why it's important to know
about<00:02:57.100> this<00:02:57.310> nerve<00:02:57.579> in<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:57.880> region<00:02:58.209> of<00:02:58.299> the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
about this nerve in this region of the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.660 
about this nerve in this region of the
neck<00:02:58.600> is<00:02:59.049> because<00:02:59.350> it's<00:02:59.560> very<00:02:59.670> superficial

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
neck is because it's very superficial

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.430 
neck is because it's very superficial
and<00:03:01.150> isn't<00:03:01.360> protected<00:03:01.810> by<00:03:01.930> anything<00:03:02.110> it's<00:03:02.350> the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
and isn't protected by anything it's the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.060 
and isn't protected by anything it's the
most<00:03:02.590> commonly<00:03:03.040> damaged<00:03:03.459> nerve<00:03:04.350> if<00:03:05.350> you<00:03:05.920> have

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
most commonly damaged nerve if you have

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.740 
most commonly damaged nerve if you have
trauma<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.549> neck<00:03:06.670> in<00:03:06.820> this<00:03:06.910> area<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:07.660> if

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
trauma to the neck in this area so if

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.740 
trauma to the neck in this area so if
you<00:03:07.930> were<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.170> do<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.470> shop<00:03:08.890> like<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.910> you'd

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
you were to do the shop like that you'd

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.940 
you were to do the shop like that you'd
end<00:03:10.930> up<00:03:11.049> with<00:03:11.110> damage<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.620> your<00:03:11.680> spinal

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
end up with damage to your spinal

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.920 
end up with damage to your spinal
accessory<00:03:12.280> nerve<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.910> Sam<00:03:13.480> would<00:03:13.630> be<00:03:13.660> able<00:03:13.840> to

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
accessory nerve and Sam would be able to

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.680 
accessory nerve and Sam would be able to
shrug<00:03:14.109> his<00:03:14.230> shoulders<00:03:14.290> or<00:03:14.829> move<00:03:15.070> his<00:03:15.190> head

em festivals to talk about here is the

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.390 
em festivals to talk about here is the
subclavian<00:03:22.120> artery<00:03:22.750> of<00:03:22.930> cable

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
subclavian artery of cable

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.850 
subclavian artery of cable
subclavian<00:03:24.000> artery<00:03:24.329> comes<00:03:25.019> up<00:03:25.200> just<00:03:25.409> at<00:03:25.799> the

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
subclavian artery comes up just at the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.339 
subclavian artery comes up just at the
base<00:03:26.159> of<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.970> supraclavicular<00:03:27.569> triangle

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
base of the supraclavicular triangle

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.229 
base of the supraclavicular triangle
okay<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.739> comes<00:03:28.769> up<00:03:29.099> just<00:03:29.129> here<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:30.090> it's

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
okay so it comes up just here and it's

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.089 
okay so it comes up just here and it's
actually<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.629> third<00:03:31.019> part<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.980> the

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
actually the third part of the

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.500 
actually the third part of the
subclavian<00:03:32.489> triangle<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.329> we're

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
subclavian triangle that we're

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.360 
subclavian triangle that we're
interested<00:03:33.780> in<00:03:34.170> that's<00:03:34.650> involved<00:03:35.129> in<00:03:35.280> the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
interested in that's involved in the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.069 
interested in that's involved in the
struggle<00:03:35.610> okay<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.569> that's<00:03:36.750> important

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
struggle okay and that's important

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.370 
struggle okay and that's important
obviously<00:03:37.200> cuz<00:03:37.470> it's<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.620> major<00:03:37.769> blood<00:03:38.040> vessel
