00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
that of all the villains ultra-humanite

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.729 
that of all the villains ultra-humanite
was<00:03:49.970> one<00:03:50.120> of<00:03:50.209> the<00:03:50.269> first<00:03:50.510> release<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:51.140> me<00:03:51.709> I

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
was one of the first release to me I

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.860 
was one of the first release to me I
would<00:03:52.010> think<00:03:52.130> he's<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.670> most<00:03:53.060> obscure<00:03:53.660> and

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
would think he's the most obscure and

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.830 
would think he's the most obscure and
the<00:03:54.320> fact<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:54.680> they<00:03:54.860> needed<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.670> new<00:03:55.880> mold<00:03:56.209> I'm

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
the fact that they needed a new mold I'm

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.360 
the fact that they needed a new mold I'm
really<00:03:57.260> surprised<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:57.739> they<00:03:57.890> actually<00:03:58.010> went

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
really surprised that they actually went

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.170 
really surprised that they actually went
and<00:03:58.549> released<00:03:58.880> him<00:03:59.090> first<00:04:00.790> but<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:01.880> is<00:04:02.000> neat

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
and released him first but it is neat

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.910 
and released him first but it is neat
though<00:04:02.390> he's<00:04:02.630> got<00:04:02.810> articulation<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.739> head

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
though he's got articulation in the head

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.550 
though he's got articulation in the head
you<00:04:04.760> can<00:04:04.820> rotate<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.480> arm<00:04:05.750> she<00:04:06.110> can<00:04:06.260> bend<00:04:06.410> at

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560

the elbow and you can bend at the legs

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.170 
the elbow and you can bend at the legs
you<00:04:10.130> can't<00:04:10.310> really<00:04:10.430> do<00:04:10.549> much<00:04:10.610> with<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:10.970> waist

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
you can't really do much with the waist

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.930 
you can't really do much with the waist
just<00:04:11.390> because<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:11.750> way<00:04:11.870> this<00:04:12.049> is<00:04:12.230> all<00:04:12.350> on<00:04:12.590> here

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.819 
just because the way this is all on here
but<00:04:13.940> a<00:04:14.150> decent<00:04:14.690> looking<00:04:14.870> figure<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:15.410> mean<00:04:15.680> it's

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
but a decent looking figure I mean it's

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.640 
but a decent looking figure I mean it's
not<00:04:15.950> bad<00:04:16.160> I<00:04:16.690> prefer<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.840> gorilla<00:04:18.079> grodd<00:04:18.350> more

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
not bad I prefer the gorilla grodd more

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.550 
not bad I prefer the gorilla grodd more
so<00:04:18.919> but<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:19.430> do<00:04:19.850> like<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.209> fact<00:04:20.390> that<00:04:20.510> I<00:04:20.690> do<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:21.169> do

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
so but I do like the fact that I do I do

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.230 
so but I do like the fact that I do I do
respect<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.130> fact<00:04:22.340> that<00:04:22.400> they<00:04:22.550> released<00:04:23.000> a

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
respect the fact that they released a

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.560 
respect the fact that they released a
grill<00:04:23.479> a<00:04:23.919> ultra-humanite<00:04:24.919> in<00:04:25.310> a<00:04:25.460> figure

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
grill a ultra-humanite in a figure

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.260 
grill a ultra-humanite in a figure

certainly one of the most obscure of all
