these<00:01:55.789> previous<00:01:56.789> loops<00:01:57.149> up<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.380> over<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.909> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
these previous loops up and over like a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.499 
these previous loops up and over like a
bind<00:02:00.299> off<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:02.850> kind<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.119> use<00:02:03.179> your

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
bind off so you can kind of use your

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.809 
bind off so you can kind of use your
fingers<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.929> open<00:02:04.799> up<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.159> stitch<00:02:05.459> so<00:02:05.670> it's

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
fingers to open up that stitch so it's

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.230 
fingers to open up that stitch so it's
easier<00:02:06.209> to<00:02:06.359> get<00:02:06.479> your<00:02:06.719> needle<00:02:07.590> into<00:02:07.859> it<00:02:08.240> and

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
easier to get your needle into it and

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.339 
easier to get your needle into it and
then<00:02:09.360> pull<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.690> up<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.170> off<00:02:10.619> your<00:02:11.069> needle<00:02:12.349> with

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
then pull it up and off your needle with

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.740 
then pull it up and off your needle with
a<00:02:13.379> Pete<00:02:13.739> process<00:02:14.400> with<00:02:14.640> these<00:02:14.849> other<00:02:15.060> loops<00:02:15.510> I

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
a Pete process with these other loops I

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.679 
a Pete process with these other loops I
have

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
have

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.780 
have
until<00:02:17.689> i'm<00:02:17.989> down<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.230> just<00:02:18.530> one<00:02:18.980> loop<00:02:19.489> on<00:02:19.670> my

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
until i'm down to just one loop on my

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.809 
until i'm down to just one loop on my
needle<00:02:20.090> again<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:21.650> that's<00:02:21.889> securing<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:22.670> edge

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
needle again so that's securing the edge

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.509 
needle again so that's securing the edge
and<00:02:23.209> now<00:02:23.989> we're<00:02:24.170> going<00:02:24.349> to<00:02:24.409> start<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:24.950> the

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
and now we're going to start on the

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.420 
and now we're going to start on the
gathering<00:02:26.030> stitch<00:02:26.379> to<00:02:27.379> do<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.769> you<00:02:27.980> want<00:02:28.159> to

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
gathering stitch to do that you want to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.849 
gathering stitch to do that you want to
insert<00:02:28.969> your<00:02:29.150> needle<00:02:29.389> into<00:02:29.749> the<00:02:30.049> next<00:02:30.469> four

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859 
insert your needle into the next four

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:36.929 
insert your needle into the next four
loop<00:02:31.519> a's<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.510> here's<00:02:32.750> my<00:02:32.810> first<00:02:33.200> loop<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:35.230> 1

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939

here's the next one to third here's the
fourth<00:02:47.169> once<00:02:48.169> I've<00:02:48.469> stuck<00:02:48.799> my<00:02:48.829> needle<00:02:49.250> through

fourth once I've stuck my needle through

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.280 
fourth once I've stuck my needle through
all<00:02:49.609> those<00:02:49.909> I<00:02:50.209> want<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.569> do<00:02:50.659> the<00:02:50.810> same<00:02:51.019> thing

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
all those I want to do the same thing

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.319 
all those I want to do the same thing
where<00:02:51.439> I<00:02:51.469> pass<00:02:51.769> all<00:02:52.099> these<00:02:52.280> stitches<00:02:52.609> up<00:02:52.969> and

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
where I pass all these stitches up and

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.770 
where I pass all these stitches up and
off<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.780> needle<00:02:54.049> over<00:02:54.439> my<00:02:54.620> first<00:02:54.859> stitch<00:02:55.780> one

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:06.640 
off the needle over my first stitch one
two<00:03:02.560> three<00:03:04.359> and<00:03:05.359> then<00:03:05.629> pull<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:06.019> last<00:03:06.290> loop

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
two three and then pull this last loop

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.709 
two three and then pull this last loop
up<00:03:06.859> and<00:03:07.069> off<00:03:07.189> to<00:03:09.849> now<00:03:10.849> I'm<00:03:10.969> back<00:03:11.120> down<00:03:11.359> to<00:03:11.510> one

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:11.719 
up and off to now I'm back down to one

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.709 
up and off to now I'm back down to one
stitch<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:12.409> now<00:03:13.159> i'm<00:03:13.310> going<00:03:13.519> to<00:03:13.609> work<00:03:13.969> a<00:03:14.269> lock

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:14.719 
stitch and now i'm going to work a lock

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.050 
stitch and now i'm going to work a lock
stitch<00:03:15.169> so<00:03:16.069> instead<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.459> going<00:03:16.819> to<00:03:16.849> another

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
stitch so instead of going to another

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.869 
stitch so instead of going to another
loop<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.659> i'm<00:03:18.079> going<00:03:18.379> to<00:03:18.500> stick<00:03:18.709> my<00:03:18.919> hook<00:03:19.099> stick

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
loop a i'm going to stick my hook stick

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.599 
loop a i'm going to stick my hook stick
my<00:03:20.030> needle<00:03:20.090> into<00:03:20.650> loop<00:03:21.650> be<00:03:21.979> right<00:03:22.310> here<00:03:24.609> stick

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
my needle into loop be right here stick

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.729 
my needle into loop be right here stick
it<00:03:25.729> through<00:03:25.909> and<00:03:26.209> then<00:03:26.359> pull<00:03:26.780> this<00:03:27.229> loop<00:03:27.530> up

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
it through and then pull this loop up

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.780 
it through and then pull this loop up
and<00:03:28.069> over<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:28.750> i'm<00:03:29.750> back<00:03:29.930> down<00:03:30.169> to<00:03:30.349> one<00:03:30.530> loop<00:03:30.790> so

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
and over so i'm back down to one loop so

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.159 
and over so i'm back down to one loop so
those<00:03:31.970> are<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.150> steps<00:03:32.509> so<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:32.810> just<00:03:33.019> keep

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
those are the steps so you just keep

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.140 
those are the steps so you just keep
repeating<00:03:33.379> those<00:03:34.159> two<00:03:34.459> stitches<00:03:34.699> for<00:03:35.120> the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
repeating those two stitches for the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.740 
repeating those two stitches for the
body<00:03:35.359> of<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.659> scarf<00:03:37.090> okay<00:03:38.090> so<00:03:38.150> once<00:03:38.540> your

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
body of the scarf okay so once your

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.240 
body of the scarf okay so once your
scarf<00:03:39.079> has<00:03:39.290> reached<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.680> length<00:03:39.979> that<00:03:40.189> you

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
scarf has reached the length that you

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.339 
scarf has reached the length that you
want<00:03:40.370> it<00:03:40.699> to<00:03:40.729> be<00:03:40.849> you're<00:03:41.540> going<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:41.959> have<00:03:42.109> to

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
want it to be you're going to have to

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.589 
want it to be you're going to have to
finish<00:03:42.799> off<00:03:43.159> the<00:03:43.430> edge<00:03:43.549> and<00:03:43.939> a<00:03:44.030> way<00:03:44.150> similar<00:03:44.209> to

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
finish off the edge and a way similar to

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.240 
finish off the edge and a way similar to
the<00:03:45.639> role<00:03:46.639> that<00:03:46.669> we<00:03:46.970> did<00:03:47.150> at<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.359> beginning<00:03:48.250> to
