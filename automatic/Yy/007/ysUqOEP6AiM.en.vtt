wearable storage and that's that's the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.520 
wearable storage and that's that's the
problem<00:03:41.180> because<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:41.720> can<00:03:41.930> only<00:03:42.050> sell<00:03:42.350> like

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.680 
chipset in the two devices of course
Apple<00:04:07.010> do<00:04:07.280> your<00:04:07.459> own<00:04:07.519> chipset<00:04:07.940> so<00:04:08.120> they<00:04:08.540> have

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
Apple do your own chipset so they have

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.140 
Apple do your own chipset so they have
the<00:04:08.780> Apple<00:04:09.049> a7<00:04:09.380> instead<00:04:10.100> of<00:04:10.190> this<00:04:10.310> one<00:04:10.579> which

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
the Apple a7 instead of this one which

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.900 
the Apple a7 instead of this one which
is<00:04:11.359> really<00:04:11.810> really<00:04:11.959> runs<00:04:12.260> amazing

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
is really really runs amazing

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.940 
is really really runs amazing
but<00:04:13.630> then<00:04:13.780> again<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:14.050> mean<00:04:14.230> this<00:04:14.410> one<00:04:14.620> costs

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
but then again I mean this one costs

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.800 
but then again I mean this one costs
around<00:04:15.100> five<00:04:15.400> times<00:04:15.670> as<00:04:15.970> much<00:04:16.120> money<00:04:16.300> or<00:04:16.450> look

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
around five times as much money or look

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.590 
around five times as much money or look
four<00:04:17.050> times<00:04:17.260> as<00:04:17.440> much<00:04:17.590> money<00:04:17.800> as<00:04:18.480> what<00:04:19.480> you

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
four times as much money as what you

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.000 
four times as much money as what you
would<00:04:19.780> get<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.180> would<00:04:22.330> pay<00:04:22.950> compared<00:04:23.950> to

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
would get that you would pay compared to

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.340 
would get that you would pay compared to
this<00:04:24.130> one<00:04:24.340> which<00:04:24.580> was<00:04:24.760> wrong

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
this one which was wrong

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.960 
this one which was wrong
120<00:04:26.350> euro<00:04:26.500> perhaps<00:04:26.830> in<00:04:27.220> this<00:04:27.490> one<00:04:27.640> like<00:04:27.760> six

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
120 euro perhaps in this one like six

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.730 
120 euro perhaps in this one like six
hundred<00:04:28.030> Europe<00:04:28.450> but<00:04:29.170> you<00:04:29.260> can<00:04:29.350> see<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.590> mood

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
hundred Europe but you can see the mood

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.770 
hundred Europe but you can see the mood
to<00:04:29.890> e<00:04:29.920> really<00:04:30.280> has<00:04:30.520> nice<00:04:30.790> software

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
to e really has nice software

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.660 
to e really has nice software
performance<00:04:32.350> still<00:04:32.560> when<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:32.950> go<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:33.280> menus

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
performance still when you go and menus

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.330 
performance still when you go and menus
and<00:04:33.850> everything<00:04:34.120> it's<00:04:34.420> fast<00:04:34.720> it's<00:04:35.680> very<00:04:35.860> very

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
and everything it's fast it's very very

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.800 
and everything it's fast it's very very
impressive<00:04:36.670> speed<00:04:37.800> for<00:04:38.910> what<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.030> pay<00:04:40.210> for

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
impressive speed for what you pay for

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.600 
impressive speed for what you pay for
so<00:04:41.290> I<00:04:41.320> really<00:04:41.830> really<00:04:42.100> do<00:04:42.220> enjoy<00:04:42.460> that<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:44.610> so

almost<00:04:50.650> three<00:04:50.740> years<00:04:50.920> here<00:04:51.720> and<00:04:52.720> this<00:04:53.020> one

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
almost three years here and this one

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.870 
almost three years here and this one
definitely<00:04:53.470> is<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:53.950> more<00:04:54.220> powerful<00:04:54.370> dual-core

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
definitely is a more powerful dual-core

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.390 
definitely is a more powerful dual-core

amazing and then we do have the Adreno

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.420 
amazing and then we do have the Adreno
302<00:05:06.850> GPU<00:05:07.510> here<00:05:07.870> inside<00:05:08.710> of<00:05:09.540> this<00:05:10.540> one<00:05:11.310> in<00:05:12.310> the

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
302 GPU here inside of this one in the

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.670 
302 GPU here inside of this one in the
Moto<00:05:12.760> e<00:05:12.940> and<00:05:15.930> it's<00:05:16.930> not<00:05:17.080> gonna<00:05:17.230> run<00:05:17.380> every

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
Moto e and it's not gonna run every

Moto e and it's not gonna run every
single<00:05:17.830> game<00:05:18.070> amazing<00:05:18.610> I<00:05:18.760> mean<00:05:18.880> definitely

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
single game amazing I mean definitely

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.190 
single game amazing I mean definitely
not<00:05:19.660> but<00:05:20.280> my<00:05:21.280> guess<00:05:21.490> is<00:05:21.730> most<00:05:22.000> games<00:05:22.630> gonna<00:05:22.960> run

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
not but my guess is most games gonna run

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.850 
not but my guess is most games gonna run
good<00:05:23.530> especially<00:05:24.040> 2d<00:05:24.790> games<00:05:25.090> not<00:05:25.840> like<00:05:26.050> super

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
good especially 2d games not like super

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.890 
good especially 2d games not like super
high-end<00:05:27.220> 3d<00:05:27.430> games<00:05:27.970> new<00:05:28.270> games<00:05:28.300> from<00:05:28.690> like

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
high-end 3d games new games from like
