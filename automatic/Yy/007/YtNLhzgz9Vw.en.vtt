turns off and now I saw
you<00:01:28.360> can<00:01:28.509> see<00:01:28.659> the<00:01:28.780> jerkiness<00:01:29.170> there<00:01:29.530> as<00:01:29.710> well

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
you can see the jerkiness there as well

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.420 
you can see the jerkiness there as well
it's<00:01:31.689> okay<00:01:32.259> to<00:01:32.320> work<00:01:32.680> with<00:01:32.920> I<00:01:32.950> mean<00:01:33.159> you<00:01:33.280> can

it's okay to work with I mean you can

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.690 
it's okay to work with I mean you can
get<00:01:33.610> by<00:01:35.310> when<00:01:36.310> we<00:01:36.430> turn<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:37.000> shadows<00:01:37.450> off<00:01:38.700> and

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
get by when we turn the shadows off and

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.529 
get by when we turn the shadows off and
things<00:01:40.090> are<00:01:40.360> a<00:01:40.390> bit<00:01:40.600> smoother<00:01:42.689> okay

things are a bit smoother okay
now<00:01:46.539> with<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.899> Quadro<00:01:47.409> on<00:01:47.679> the<00:01:47.979> other<00:01:48.100> end

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
now with the Quadro on the other end

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.559 
now with the Quadro on the other end
yeah<00:01:51.069> we<00:01:51.280> are<00:01:51.399> everything<00:01:51.939> set<00:01:52.360> up<00:01:54.420> check<00:01:55.420> this
