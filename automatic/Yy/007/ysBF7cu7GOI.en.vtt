00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.429 

okay<00:00:00.450> before<00:00:00.630> we<00:00:00.930> were<00:00:01.020> looking<00:00:01.290> at<00:00:01.350> the

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
okay before we were looking at the

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:02.869 
okay before we were looking at the
plants<00:00:01.800> when<00:00:01.979> we<00:00:02.100> first<00:00:02.310> arrived<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:02.790> we

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
plants when we first arrived and we

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.579 
plants when we first arrived and we
noticed<00:00:03.210> that<00:00:03.360> they<00:00:03.480> were<00:00:03.510> they<00:00:04.200> were<00:00:04.259> looking

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
noticed that they were they were looking

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.140 
noticed that they were they were looking
like<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.770> little<00:00:05.069> bit<00:00:05.190> iron<00:00:05.430> deficient<00:00:05.970> and

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
like a little bit iron deficient and

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.120 
like a little bit iron deficient and
that's<00:00:06.660> not<00:00:06.839> surprising<00:00:07.020> remember<00:00:07.799> because

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
that's not surprising remember because

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.770 
that's not surprising remember because
we've<00:00:08.340> been<00:00:08.519> running<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:08.970> system<00:00:09.179> really<00:00:09.630> on

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
we've been running this system really on

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.110 
we've been running this system really on
you<00:00:10.440> know<00:00:10.559> very<00:00:10.830> few<00:00:11.099> nutrients<00:00:11.610> just<00:00:11.670> some

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
you know very few nutrients just some

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.539 
you know very few nutrients just some
sea<00:00:12.389> salt<00:00:12.599> some<00:00:12.960> seaweed<00:00:13.349> extract<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.009> it's

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
sea salt some seaweed extract and it's

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.250 
sea salt some seaweed extract and it's
done<00:00:14.700> extremely<00:00:15.150> well<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.750> think<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.109> growth

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
done extremely well I think the growth

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.480 
done extremely well I think the growth
is<00:00:16.500> probably<00:00:16.770> better<00:00:16.949> than<00:00:17.039> you'd<00:00:17.220> get<00:00:17.369> an

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
is probably better than you'd get an

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.910 
is probably better than you'd get an
average<00:00:17.609> garden<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.779> iron<00:00:19.080> deficiency<00:00:19.740> in

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
average garden but iron deficiency in

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920 
average garden but iron deficiency in
aquaponic<00:00:20.490> systems<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.180> quite<00:00:21.449> common

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
aquaponic systems is quite common

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.590 
aquaponic systems is quite common
because<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> fish<00:00:23.189> food<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.240> inputs

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
because in the fish food and the inputs

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.880 
because in the fish food and the inputs
you<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:24.840> into<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.050> system<00:00:25.410> remember<00:00:25.740> all

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
you have into the system remember all

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.859 
you have into the system remember all
the<00:00:26.010> nutrients<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:27.060> come<00:00:27.269> into<00:00:27.420> your<00:00:27.539> system

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the nutrients that come into your system

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.029 
the nutrients that come into your system
are<00:00:27.960> going<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.170> come<00:00:28.349> through<00:00:28.500> your<00:00:28.650> fish<00:00:28.830> food

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
are going to come through your fish food

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.679 
are going to come through your fish food
one<00:00:29.250> way<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.490> another<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.910> there's<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.480> few

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
one way or another and there's a few

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.450 
one way or another and there's a few
things<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.170> don't<00:00:31.380> get<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.309> fish

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
things that we don't get in the fish

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.030 
things that we don't get in the fish
food<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.510> some<00:00:33.809> iron<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.800> is

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
food and that is some iron is is

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.229 
food and that is some iron is is
probably<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.430> main<00:00:35.610> one<00:00:35.760> we're<00:00:35.969> thinking

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
probably the main one we're thinking

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.030 
probably the main one we're thinking
about<00:00:36.329> today<00:00:36.690> anyway<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.829> see<00:00:38.010> that

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
about today anyway and we can see that

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.380 
about today anyway and we can see that
in<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> plants<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.910> see<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
in the plants we can see that in the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.060 
in the plants we can see that in the
leaves<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:40.379> pretty<00:00:40.500> easy<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.920> buy

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
leaves so it's pretty easy you buy

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.310 
leaves so it's pretty easy you buy
chelated<00:00:41.550> iron<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.850> neat<00:00:42.059> plant<00:00:42.329> shop<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.870> it's

well over a year so we just open the
carton<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.020> see<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.379> hear<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.559> it

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
carton and we can see and hear what it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.310 
carton and we can see and hear what it
looks<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.850> yellow<00:00:57.090> powder<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.840> it's

looks like it's a yellow powder and it's

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.950 
looks like it's a yellow powder and it's

iron it's been chelated or made able to
be<00:01:01.050> dissolved<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.710> there's<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.430> spoon

be dissolved and there's a spoon

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.450 
be dissolved and there's a spoon
provided<00:01:03.239> now<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> system<00:01:04.439> today<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:05.100> in

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
provided now with the system today as in

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.010 
provided now with the system today as in
everything<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:06.030> aquaponics<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> bit

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
everything with aquaponics we go a bit

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.210 
everything with aquaponics we go a bit
steady<00:01:07.409> at<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:07.740> don't<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.070> things

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
steady at it we don't do things

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.399 
steady at it we don't do things
ratcheting<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.850> hurry<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.930> I'll<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.229> get<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
ratcheting and hurry and I'll just get a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.039 
ratcheting and hurry and I'll just get a
good<00:01:11.250> heat<00:01:11.400> teaspoon<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
good heat teaspoon of it there and the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.960 
good heat teaspoon of it there and the
easiest<00:01:13.320> way<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.560> find<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.250> add<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.820> put

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
easiest way I find to add it is to put

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.560 
easiest way I find to add it is to put
it<00:01:15.060> down<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.689> auto<00:01:16.650> siphon<00:01:17.479> into<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
it down the the auto siphon into the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.969 
it down the the auto siphon into the
water<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> water<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> side<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
water see the water at the side of the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.230 
water see the water at the side of the
auto<00:01:20.130> siphon<00:01:20.400> there<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.850> I'll<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:21.060> tip<00:01:21.210> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
auto siphon there and I'll just tip it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.600 
auto siphon there and I'll just tip it
down<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> side<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.770> will<00:01:22.890> dissolve<00:01:23.100> and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
down the side and it will dissolve and

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.460 
down the side and it will dissolve and
be<00:01:24.090> carried<00:01:24.420> away<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.900> water<00:01:25.080> into<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
be carried away with the water into the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.289

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
fish tank and of course it will then be

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.550 
fish tank and of course it will then be
circulated<00:01:27.869> right<00:01:28.020> throughout<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.380> system

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
circulated right throughout the system

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.620 
circulated right throughout the system
she<00:01:29.340> later<00:01:29.549> died<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.790> won't<00:01:30.030> hurt<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.329> fish<00:01:30.479> in

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
she later died on won't hurt the fish in

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.780 
she later died on won't hurt the fish in
any<00:01:30.780> way<00:01:30.960> provided<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.890> course<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.670> they

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
any way provided of course you know they

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.460 
any way provided of course you know they
don't<00:01:32.880> get<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> great<00:01:33.299> mouthful<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.380> if

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
don't get a great mouthful of it but if

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.929 
don't get a great mouthful of it but if
you<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.829> way<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.009> by<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> time<00:01:35.790> that

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
you do it that way so by the time that

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.399 
you do it that way so by the time that
arrives<00:01:36.360> at<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> fish<00:01:36.780> tank<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.170> will<00:01:37.290> be

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
arrives at the fish tank it will be

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.899 
arrives at the fish tank it will be
mixed<00:01:37.560> up<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.040> water<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.490> everything

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
mixed up with the water and everything

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.580 
mixed up with the water and everything
will<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.090> fine<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.110> easy<00:01:40.290> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
will be fine so it's just that easy to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.740 
will be fine so it's just that easy to
add<00:01:40.619> chelate<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.340> now<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> find<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.659> will

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
add chelate it on now I find you will

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.200 
add chelate it on now I find you will
probably<00:01:42.960> need<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.770> about<00:01:44.640> once<00:01:45.090> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
probably need to do that about once a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.569 
probably need to do that about once a
month<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:46.140> add<00:01:46.259> iron<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.799> your<00:01:46.920> system<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
month to add iron to your system and

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.280 
month to add iron to your system and
that<00:01:47.880> would<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.450> most<00:01:48.600> home<00:01:48.899> systems

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
that would just be in most home systems

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.109 
that would just be in most home systems
like<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> Maximus<00:01:50.070> we've<00:01:50.250> got<00:01:50.399> here<00:01:50.610> that

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
like the Maximus we've got here that

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.340 
like the Maximus we've got here that
would<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.329> about<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.750> those<00:01:51.930> level

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
would be about one of those level

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.920 
would be about one of those level
teaspoons<00:01:52.829> about<00:01:53.549> once<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.909> month<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.299> you'll

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
teaspoons about once a month and you'll

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.929 
teaspoons about once a month and you'll
quickly<00:01:55.200> get<00:01:55.500> used<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> look<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
quickly get used to the look of the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.700 
quickly get used to the look of the
plant<00:01:57.180> when<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.689> see<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.259> iron

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
plant when you see that it's iron

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.530 
plant when you see that it's iron
deficient<00:01:59.280> because<00:01:59.790> you'll<00:02:00.090> see<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> leaves

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
deficient because you'll see the leaves

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.060 
deficient because you'll see the leaves
start<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.200> funny<00:02:01.500> model<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.920> yellow

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
start to get that funny model to yellow

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.010 
start to get that funny model to yellow
look<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.490> them<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.119> if<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.329> goes<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:03.689> too<00:02:03.840> long

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
look on them and if it goes for too long

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.569 
look on them and if it goes for too long
they<00:02:04.200> look<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.469> yellowing<00:02:05.159> will<00:02:05.280> become

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
they look the yellowing will become

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.760 
they look the yellowing will become
quite<00:02:05.880> veined<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.659> become<00:02:07.350> much<00:02:07.530> more

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
quite veined and become much more

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.740 
quite veined and become much more
pronounced<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.879> it's<00:02:09.030> just<00:02:09.149> amazing<00:02:09.720> how

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
pronounced but it's just amazing how

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.900 
pronounced but it's just amazing how
quickly<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.379> corrected<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:11.610> did<00:02:11.760> some

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
quickly it's corrected if we did some

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.670 
quickly it's corrected if we did some
shots<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.569> couple<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.870> days<00:02:13.020> time

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
shots of this in a couple of days time

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.110 
shots of this in a couple of days time
you'd<00:02:13.890> find<00:02:14.159> that<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.459> yellowing<00:02:14.879> will<00:02:15.030> have

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
you'd find that that yellowing will have

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.369 
you'd find that that yellowing will have
gone<00:02:15.269> already<00:02:15.629> it's<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:16.049> an<00:02:16.170> amazing

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
gone already it's just an amazing

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.160 
gone already it's just an amazing
