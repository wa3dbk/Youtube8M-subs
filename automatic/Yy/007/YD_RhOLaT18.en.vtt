I think that was that was a pity because

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.840 
I think that was that was a pity because
our<00:01:01.590> last<00:01:01.829> two<00:01:02.010> months<00:01:02.160> we've<00:01:02.460> been<00:01:02.489> winning

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and winning and winning in and you could

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.000 
and winning and winning in and you could
see<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:06.060> team<00:01:06.420> had<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.380> quality<00:01:07.830> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
decision and this is this is always the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.249 
decision and this is this is always the
disappointment<00:01:37.680> because<00:01:37.909> you<00:01:38.909> know<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.259> we

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
disappointment because you know we we

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.140 
disappointment because you know we we

had great games we had better games but

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.060 
had great games we had better games but
overall<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> consistency<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.890> look

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
overall this the consistency you look

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.580 
overall this the consistency you look
for<00:01:44.310> endure<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.820> when<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.840> two<00:01:46.229> months

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
for endure and when you have two months

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.520 
for endure and when you have two months
where<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.950> don't<00:01:47.159> play<00:01:47.340> well<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.790> and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
where you don't play well and and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.539 
where you don't play well and and
suddenly<00:01:49.530> everything<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.399> right

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
suddenly everything is not going right

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.389 
suddenly everything is not going right
and<00:01:51.060> obviously<00:01:51.930> need<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.380> show<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.979> character

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
and obviously need to show the character

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.190 
and obviously need to show the character
to<00:01:53.549> go<00:01:53.670> through<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.119> start<00:01:54.479> winning<00:01:54.780> later

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
to go through and start winning later

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.109 
to go through and start winning later
but<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.860> know<00:01:56.100> sometimes<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.939> what

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
but you know sometimes this is what

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.510 
but you know sometimes this is what
caused<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:58.829> titles<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.369> the

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
November December January do you think

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.360 
November December January do you think
no<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.739> thing<00:02:32.099> is<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.549> know<00:02:33.739> it's<00:02:34.739> difficult<00:02:34.950> to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
no I thing is you know it's difficult to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.970 
no I thing is you know it's difficult to
say<00:02:35.549> but<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.819> think<00:02:36.230> ray<00:02:37.230> leaving<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.769> must

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
say but I think ray leaving you must

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.680 
say but I think ray leaving you must
have<00:02:38.099> been<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.340> bit<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.879> course<00:02:39.180> seasons<00:02:39.510> as

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
have been a bit of course seasons as

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.259 
have been a bit of course seasons as
well<00:02:39.870> because<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:41.220> can't<00:02:41.459> just<00:02:41.670> blame<00:02:41.910> the

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
well because you can't just blame the

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.330 
well because you can't just blame the
party<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.750> one<00:02:42.900> culture<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.530> everything<00:02:44.190> which

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
party of one culture on everything which

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.920 
party of one culture on everything which
is<00:02:44.489> not<00:02:44.670> right<00:02:44.849> because<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.329> manager<00:02:45.510> stage

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
is not right because the manager stage

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.100 
is not right because the manager stage
the<00:02:46.170> other<00:02:46.290> people<00:02:46.680> were<00:02:46.829> here<00:02:47.069> and<00:02:47.329> the<00:02:48.329> the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
the other people were here and the the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.559 
the other people were here and the the
quality<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.680> training<00:02:50.010> was<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.310> same<00:02:50.569> the

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
quality of the training was the same the

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.870 
quality of the training was the same the
players<00:02:51.840> were<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.260> same<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:53.610> didn't<00:02:53.849> work

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
players were the same and it didn't work

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.809 
players were the same and it didn't work
so<00:02:54.329> it's<00:02:54.540> not<00:02:54.660> as<00:02:54.870> not<00:02:55.110> only<00:02:55.319> about<00:02:55.709> one<00:02:56.549> person

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
so it's not as not only about one person

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.430 
so it's not as not only about one person
leaving<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.480> club<00:02:57.720> although<00:02:58.079> although
