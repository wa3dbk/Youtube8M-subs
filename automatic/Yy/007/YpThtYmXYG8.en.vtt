00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
out into the world and now you're no

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.110 
out into the world and now you're no
longer<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.960> control

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.360 

what<00:01:16.120> we<00:01:16.240> were<00:01:16.360> looking<00:01:16.810> for<00:01:16.840> was<00:01:17.500> a<00:01:17.890> place

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
what we were looking for was a place

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.340 
what we were looking for was a place
that<00:01:18.400> would<00:01:18.940> be<00:01:19.210> would<00:01:19.600> look<00:01:19.870> like<00:01:20.110> this

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
that would be would look like this

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.320 
that would be would look like this
planet<00:01:20.830> if<00:01:21.010> the<00:01:21.160> thousand<00:01:21.640> years<00:01:21.820> we<00:01:22.090> weren't

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
planet if the thousand years we weren't

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.750 
planet if the thousand years we weren't
here<00:01:22.660> and<00:01:22.810> so<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.500> trees<00:01:24.040> would<00:01:24.370> be<00:01:24.520> of<00:01:24.640> a

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
here and so the trees would be of a

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.430 
here and so the trees would be of a
certain<00:01:24.940> size<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.420> girth<00:01:25.990> there<00:01:26.290> would<00:01:26.410> be

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
certain size and girth there would be

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.320 
certain size and girth there would be
the<00:01:26.620> size<00:01:26.860> of<00:01:27.010> this<00:01:27.160> room<00:01:27.220> three<00:01:27.970> quarters

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
the size of this room three quarters

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.150 
the size of this room three quarters
like<00:01:28.510> for<00:01:28.960> real<00:01:29.110> those<00:01:29.470> trees<00:01:29.740> would<00:01:29.890> be<00:01:30.010> that

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
like for real those trees would be that

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.190 
like for real those trees would be that
big<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:30.570> everything<00:01:31.570> would<00:01:31.690> have<00:01:31.720> that<00:01:31.960> kind

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
big and everything would have that kind

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.960 
big and everything would have that kind
of<00:01:32.260> history<00:01:32.470> and<00:01:32.830> depth<00:01:33.070> to<00:01:33.190> it<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.520> there's

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
of history and depth to it and there's

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.480 
of history and depth to it and there's
very<00:01:34.420> few<00:01:34.690> places<00:01:35.050> on<00:01:35.260> this<00:01:35.500> planet<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:36.100> have

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
very few places on this planet that have

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.520 
very few places on this planet that have
that<00:01:36.670> left<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.240> big<00:01:37.540> thing<00:01:37.900> and<00:01:38.230> the<00:01:38.320> big

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
that left the big thing and the big

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.110 
that left the big thing and the big
survival<00:01:40.530> concept<00:01:41.530> that<00:01:41.830> we<00:01:42.250> both<00:01:42.520> were

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
survival concept that we both were

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.800 
survival concept that we both were
surprised<00:01:43.960> about<00:01:44.320> is<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:45.580> amount<00:01:45.940> of<00:01:46.240> damage

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
surprised about is the amount of damage

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.130 
surprised about is the amount of damage
that<00:01:46.840> human<00:01:47.410> beings<00:01:47.770> are<00:01:47.890> doing<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:49.120> the<00:01:49.870> earth

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
that human beings are doing to the earth

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.110 
that human beings are doing to the earth
doesn't<00:01:50.800> my<00:01:50.860> able<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.190> see<00:01:51.310> another<00:01:51.460> button<00:01:51.910> my

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
doesn't my able to see another button my

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.660 
doesn't my able to see another button my
dad<00:01:52.330> oh<00:01:52.600> my<00:01:52.840> nose<00:01:53.100> human<00:01:54.100> beings<00:01:54.460> have<00:01:54.580> been

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
dad oh my nose human beings have been

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.420 
dad oh my nose human beings have been
happenin<00:01:55.150> this<00:01:55.330> new<00:01:55.600> planet<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.410> there's<00:01:57.190> an

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
happenin this new planet and there's an

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.150 
happenin this new planet and there's an
alien<00:01:58.000> species<00:01:58.300> that<00:01:58.600> doesn't<00:01:59.170> like<00:01:59.380> that

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
alien species that doesn't like that

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.330 
alien species that doesn't like that
we're<00:02:00.760> here<00:02:01.240> so<00:02:01.840> they<00:02:02.080> created<00:02:02.620> essentially<00:02:03.190> a

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
we're here so they created essentially a

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.760 
we're here so they created essentially a
killing<00:02:03.760> machine<00:02:03.910> to<00:02:04.450> hunt<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.080> kill<00:02:05.110> humans

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
killing machine to hunt and kill humans

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.950 
killing machine to hunt and kill humans
based<00:02:06.220> on<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.580> single<00:02:07.000> common<00:02:07.360> denominator

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
based on the single common denominator
