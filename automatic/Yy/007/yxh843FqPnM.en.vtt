to<00:00:37.829> want<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.340> since<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> engine<00:00:39.030> will

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
to want to do is since the engine will

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.690 
to want to do is since the engine will
turn<00:00:39.570> some<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.110> not<00:00:40.410> try<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> use<00:00:41.129> static

turn some is not try to use static

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.340 
turn some is not try to use static
leverage<00:00:42.210> you're<00:00:42.719> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> want<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.079> use<00:00:43.200> an

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
leverage you're going to want to use an

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.860 
leverage you're going to want to use an
impact<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> hammer<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.329> take<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.690> break

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
impact with a hammer to take and break

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.000 
impact with a hammer to take and break
that<00:00:46.050> bolt<00:00:46.260> loose<00:00:46.850> just<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.920> once<00:00:49.920> you

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
that bolt loose just like so once you

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.650 
that bolt loose just like so once you
have<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.280> broken<00:00:50.399> loose<00:00:50.730> most<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.449> time

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
have it broken loose most of the time

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.220 
have it broken loose most of the time
they'll<00:00:51.870> spin<00:00:52.110> right<00:00:52.230> out<00:00:52.379> by<00:00:52.530> hand

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.750 

right<00:00:58.230> there<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.520> harmonic

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
right there that is the harmonic

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.319 
right there that is the harmonic
balancer<00:01:00.329> bolt<00:01:00.539> now<00:01:01.910> you<00:01:02.910> would<00:01:03.030> think<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
balancer bolt now you would think it

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.820 
balancer bolt now you would think it
would<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.449> come<00:01:03.780> off<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.350> doesn't<00:01:04.739> it's

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
would just come off but it doesn't it's

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.800 
would just come off but it doesn't it's
actually<00:01:05.309> squeezed<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> machine

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
actually squeezed on just like a machine

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.140 
actually squeezed on just like a machine
fit<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:08.040> we're<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.520> where<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.119> where

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
fit so we're that where that is where

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.490 
fit so we're that where that is where
our<00:01:09.510> pour<00:01:10.729> comes<00:01:11.729> into<00:01:12.000> play<00:01:12.180> now<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.140> puller

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
our pour comes into play now the puller

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.429 
our pour comes into play now the puller
this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.310> your<00:01:14.460> typical<00:01:14.670> three-jaw<00:01:15.240> puller<00:01:15.509> it

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
this is your typical three-jaw puller it

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.310 
this is your typical three-jaw puller it
takes<00:01:16.740> an<00:01:16.890> hooks<00:01:17.220> onto<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.000> inside<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.540> the

balancer<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.820> drive<00:01:21.180> screw<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:21.930> run

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
balancer the drive screw will run

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.770 
balancer the drive screw will run
through<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.799> way<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.280> apply<00:01:24.060> pressure<00:01:24.420> on

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
through that way and apply pressure on

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.510 
through that way and apply pressure on
the<00:01:25.259> end<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.500> crank<00:01:25.770> shaft<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.400> it

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the end of the crank shaft and as it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.850 
the end of the crank shaft and as it
tightens<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.060> will<00:01:27.180> pull<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:28.320> pulley<00:01:28.619> off

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
tightens it will pull that pulley off

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.469 
tightens it will pull that pulley off
we'll<00:01:29.579> go<00:01:29.610> ahead<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.880> demonstrate<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.360> for

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
we'll go ahead and demonstrate that for

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
going to use the same method for

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.120 
going to use the same method for
removing<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:30.090> or<00:02:30.470> for<00:02:31.470> pulling<00:02:31.769> your<00:02:31.890> pulley

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
removing it or for pulling your pulley

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.090 
removing it or for pulling your pulley
as<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:33.060> did<00:02:33.330> with<00:02:33.930> removing<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.470> bolt<00:02:34.739> as<00:02:34.950> you

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
as you did with removing the bolt as you

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.680 
as you did with removing the bolt as you
can<00:02:35.220> see<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.400> can<00:02:35.640> turn<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.970> engine<00:02:36.150> over<00:02:36.390> like

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
can see I can turn the engine over like

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.140 
can see I can turn the engine over like
so<00:02:36.959> if<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:37.769> take<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.980> real<00:02:38.220> easy<00:02:38.489> turn<00:02:38.820> on<00:02:39.000> it

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
so if I just take a real easy turn on it

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.550 
so if I just take a real easy turn on it
what<00:02:39.690> you're<00:02:39.780> going<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.959> do<00:02:40.019> is<00:02:40.140> run<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.440> down

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
what you're going to do is run it down

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.650 
what you're going to do is run it down
and<00:02:40.860> eventually<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:42.000> may<00:02:42.120> have<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.510> begin

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
and eventually you may have to begin

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.160 
and eventually you may have to begin
tapping<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.440> or<00:02:43.620> even<00:02:44.430> using<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.940> small<00:02:45.180> hammer
