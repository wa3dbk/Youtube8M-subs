two Elliot's destroying what is it 15

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090 
two Elliot's destroying what is it 15
plus<00:01:18.450> workers<00:01:19.049> which<00:01:19.320> was<00:01:19.500> absolute<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.009> they

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
plus workers which was absolute so they

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.710 
plus workers which was absolute so they

didn't have blue flame or anything so
we'll<00:01:22.080> see<00:01:22.229> how<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.350> goes<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.759> to

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
we'll see how it goes and it's going to

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.390 
we'll see how it goes and it's going to
be<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> barracks<00:01:24.720> first<00:01:25.020> from<00:01:25.380> Lao<00:01:25.680> however<00:01:26.189> so

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
be a barracks first from Lao however so

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
of early Hellion play and Lao does know

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.740 
of early Hellion play and Lao does know
very<00:01:31.500> well<00:01:31.740> about<00:01:32.040> Helens<00:01:32.640> he<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:32.939> used<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.329> so

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
very well about Helens he is used in so

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.510 
very well about Helens he is used in so
many<00:01:33.810> times<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:34.530> shows<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> lot<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.189> people<00:01:35.310> on

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
the ladder of played lab was actually

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.899 
the ladder of played lab was actually
lost<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.650> because<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.070> his<00:01:38.189> aliens<00:01:38.549> he's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
lost just because of his aliens he's

and because of his multitasking is micro
here<00:01:45.270> oh<00:01:45.390> actually<00:01:45.780> send<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.579> three<00:01:47.579> prongs<00:01:47.939> of

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
thing is one powerful shot yeah that's

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.580 
thing is one powerful shot yeah that's
it<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> problem<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.119> dead<00:02:03.390> there's<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:04.049> so

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it the problem is dead there's so so

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.139 
it the problem is dead there's so so
hard<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.920> defend<00:02:05.130> against<00:02:05.490> yeah<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.060> an

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
hard to defend against yeah it's an

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.969 
hard to defend against yeah it's an
absolute<00:02:06.540> pain<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.140> as<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> Terran<00:02:07.710> player<00:02:07.829> I

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
absolute pain and as a Terran player I

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.130 
absolute pain and as a Terran player I
absolutely<00:02:08.520> adore<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.149> might<00:02:09.360> add

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
absolutely adore it I might add

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.450 
absolutely adore it I might add
it<00:02:10.289> would<00:02:10.470> make<00:02:10.619> me<00:02:10.800> sad<00:02:10.979> if<00:02:11.100> they<00:02:11.220> were<00:02:11.310> to

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
it would make me sad if they were to

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.730 
it would make me sad if they were to
change<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.940> whatever<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.630> case<00:02:12.780> allow<00:02:13.440> is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
change that whatever the case allow is

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.040 
change that whatever the case allow is
deadly<00:02:14.640> when<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.030> comes<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.330> his<00:02:15.480> control<00:02:15.870> in

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
deadly when it comes to his control in

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.360 
deadly when it comes to his control in
general<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.500> comes<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.770> things<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.069> drop

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
amount of damage now you were expecting

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.660 
amount of damage now you were expecting
perhaps<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.630> one<00:02:28.230> gate<00:02:28.530> into<00:02:28.920> expansion

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
perhaps this one gate into expansion

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.250 
perhaps this one gate into expansion
certainly<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.240> a<00:02:30.270> possibility<00:02:30.480> right<00:02:31.080> now

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
certainly is a possibility right now

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.199 
certainly is a possibility right now
single<00:02:31.620> gate<00:02:31.800> out<00:02:31.950> zella<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.730> way<00:02:32.850> up<00:02:33.030> as

single gate out zella on the way up as

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.840 
single gate out zella on the way up as

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.750 
well as bling what's going into the warp
gate<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.330> there<00:02:36.959> is<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.440> quick<00:02:38.220> chrono<00:02:38.489> boost

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.059 
gate and there is a quick chrono boost
on<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:39.630> we'll<00:02:40.110> see<00:02:40.260> how<00:02:40.290> high<00:02:40.770> his

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
very true yeah that was a bit

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.710 
very true yeah that was a bit

go ahead and build that Nexus down on
low<00:03:12.750> ground<00:03:12.780> will<00:03:13.590> want<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.830> be<00:03:13.950> adding<00:03:14.160> on

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
low ground will want to be adding on

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
that second and third gateway pretty

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.449 
that second and third gateway pretty
much<00:03:15.900> immediately<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.620> did<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:17.070> build<00:03:17.310> is

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
much immediately you did the build is

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.060 
much immediately you did the build is
you<00:03:17.610> literally<00:03:17.850> cut<00:03:18.120> probes<00:03:18.450> now<00:03:18.860> 27<00:03:19.860> then<00:03:19.980> you

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
you literally cut probes now 27 then you

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.680 
you literally cut probes now 27 then you
go<00:03:20.220> immediately<00:03:20.489> second<00:03:21.060> two<00:03:21.180> gateways<00:03:21.420> you

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
go immediately second two gateways you

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.000 
go immediately second two gateways you
don't<00:03:21.810> want<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.019> fall<00:03:22.110> behind<00:03:22.170> in<00:03:22.560> production

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
don't want to fall behind in production

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.520 
don't want to fall behind in production
obviously<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:23.910> never<00:03:24.450> go<00:03:24.660> will<00:03:25.019> have<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.320> one

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
obviously I never go will have the one

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.020 
obviously I never go will have the one
gateway<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.890> second<00:03:26.340> one<00:03:26.430> will<00:03:26.579> follow<00:03:26.820> down

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
gateway the second one will follow down

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.449 
gateway the second one will follow down
now<00:03:27.180> as<00:03:27.360> well<00:03:27.540> meanwhile<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.769> barracks<00:03:29.280> with

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
now as well meanwhile the barracks with

now as well meanwhile the barracks with
the<00:03:29.549> reactor<00:03:29.910> once<00:03:30.150> again<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.989> no<00:03:31.079> bling<00:03:31.350> is

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
the reactor once again you no bling is

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.039 
the reactor once again you no bling is
completely<00:03:32.610> clueless<00:03:32.910> so<00:03:33.570> what<00:03:33.750> he's<00:03:33.870> going

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
completely clueless so what he's going

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.420 
completely clueless so what he's going
to<00:03:34.079> have<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.320> do<00:03:34.500> very<00:03:34.769> very<00:03:34.799> shortly<00:03:35.130> now<00:03:35.280> is

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
to have to do very very shortly now is

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.160 
to have to do very very shortly now is
the<00:03:35.610> mineral<00:03:35.970> count<00:03:36.180> build<00:03:36.450> back<00:03:36.660> up<00:03:36.690> against

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
the mineral count build back up against

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.319 
the mineral count build back up against
200<00:03:37.739> is<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.519> he's<00:03:38.640> going<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.820> have<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.060> go

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
200 is that he's going to have to go

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.910 
200 is that he's going to have to go
ahead<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.750> build<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:39.989> robotics<00:03:40.410> facility<00:03:40.470> he

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
ahead and build the robotics facility he

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.530 
ahead and build the robotics facility he
needs<00:03:41.250> observers<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:41.880> this<00:03:42.000> game<00:03:42.180> because

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
needs observers in this game because

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.479 
needs observers in this game because
this<00:03:42.810> can<00:03:43.019> be<00:03:43.170> so<00:03:43.769> many<00:03:44.010> different<00:03:44.190> builds

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
this can be so many different builds

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.699 
this can be so many different builds
from<00:03:44.610> Terran<00:03:44.910> ya<00:03:45.360> can<00:03:45.660> there<00:03:45.959> we<00:03:46.079> go<00:03:46.200> there<00:03:46.470> is

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
from Terran ya can there we go there is

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.500 
from Terran ya can there we go there is
the<00:03:46.920> two<00:03:47.130> more<00:03:47.280> gateways<00:03:47.489> right<00:03:47.880> year<00:03:48.120> for

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
the two more gateways right year for

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.300 
the two more gateways right year for
delaying<00:03:49.019> at<00:03:49.290> nice<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.709> safe<00:03:49.890> he's<00:03:50.040> got<00:03:50.190> all

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
delaying at nice and safe he's got all

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.979 
delaying at nice and safe he's got all
sorts<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.730> different<00:03:50.940> options<00:03:51.780> different

sorts of different options different
possibilities<00:03:52.799> available<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.400> him<00:03:53.489> going

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
possibilities available to him going

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.160 
possibilities available to him going
down<00:03:54.090> straight<00:03:54.329> for<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.480> robotics<00:03:54.870> as<00:03:55.019> you

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
down straight for the robotics as you

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.810 
down straight for the robotics as you
said<00:03:55.350> before<00:03:55.440> get<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:55.860> observer<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.340> have<00:03:56.790> a

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
said before get that observer I have a

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.850 
said before get that observer I have a
nice<00:03:57.209> idea<00:03:57.570> of<00:03:57.660> what<00:03:57.810> Lao<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.019> going<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.350> do<00:03:58.500> but

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
nice idea of what Lao is going to do but

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.900 
nice idea of what Lao is going to do but
of<00:03:58.980> course<00:03:59.010> Lau's<00:03:59.400> not<00:03:59.610> really<00:03:59.790> getting

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
of course Lau's not really getting

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.610 
of course Lau's not really getting
aggressive<00:04:00.180> at<00:04:00.420> this<00:04:00.510> point<00:04:00.720> he<00:04:00.840> can't<00:04:01.260> he's

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
aggressive at this point he can't he's

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.350 
aggressive at this point he can't he's
only<00:04:01.799> got<00:04:01.980> this<00:04:02.070> single<00:04:02.430> barracks<00:04:02.760> up<00:04:02.910> with

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
only got this single barracks up with

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.990 
only got this single barracks up with

coming<00:04:09.209> up<00:04:09.299> as<00:04:09.420> well<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:09.810> we<00:04:09.930> could<00:04:10.079> be<00:04:10.170> seeing

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
coming up as well so we could be seeing

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.020 
coming up as well so we could be seeing
some<00:04:10.590> early<00:04:10.859> drop<00:04:11.070> play<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.310> follow<00:04:11.609> that<00:04:11.820> one

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
some early drop play to follow that one

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.610 
some early drop play to follow that one
up<00:04:12.180> but<00:04:12.540> he's<00:04:12.630> really<00:04:12.840> got<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:12.989> lot<00:04:13.049> of<00:04:13.200> options

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
up but he's really got a lot of options

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.870 
up but he's really got a lot of options
especially<00:04:13.799> with<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.100> secondary<00:04:14.459> finery

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
especially with the secondary finery

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.449 
especially with the secondary finery
going<00:04:15.180> up<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:15.450> once<00:04:16.440> again<00:04:16.620> we<00:04:16.890> do<00:04:17.039> have<00:04:17.220> a<00:04:17.250> lot

you chrono boost your probes now you you

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.379 
you chrono boost your probes now you you
can<00:04:26.190> basically<00:04:26.370> lose<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.970> game<00:04:27.060> there<00:04:27.270> and

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
can basically lose the game there and

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.520 
can basically lose the game there and
then<00:04:27.479> because<00:04:27.720> if<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:27.900> can't<00:04:28.110> chrono<00:04:28.350> boost

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
then because if you can't chrono boost

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.409 
then because if you can't chrono boost
the<00:04:28.590> WorldGate<00:04:28.919> if<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.370> rush<00:04:29.639> does<00:04:29.940> come<00:04:30.240> around

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
the WorldGate if a rush does come around

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.960 
the WorldGate if a rush does come around
the<00:04:31.199> 7-minute<00:04:31.740> mark<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:32.400> can<00:04:32.580> lose<00:04:32.729> the<00:04:32.850> game

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
the 7-minute mark you can lose the game

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.210 
the 7-minute mark you can lose the game
yeah<00:04:33.360> so<00:04:33.900> he's<00:04:34.020> been<00:04:34.139> very<00:04:34.199> very<00:04:34.919> cautious

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
yeah so he's been very very cautious

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.279 
yeah so he's been very very cautious
with<00:04:35.520> that<00:04:35.699> and<00:04:35.880> you<00:04:36.449> know<00:04:36.539> he's<00:04:36.750> at<00:04:36.900> currently

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
with that and you know he's at currently

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.040 
with that and you know he's at currently
27<00:04:37.919> probes<00:04:38.310> he's<00:04:38.490> still<00:04:38.759> ahead<00:04:38.910> all<00:04:39.300> Terran

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
27 probes he's still ahead all Terran

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.870 
27 probes he's still ahead all Terran
right<00:04:40.229> now<00:04:40.410> simply<00:04:41.039> because<00:04:41.130> of<00:04:41.340> chrono<00:04:41.639> boost

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
right now simply because of chrono boost

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.610 
right now simply because of chrono boost
anyway<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.570> now<00:04:42.780> we<00:04:42.840> see<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.199> going<00:04:43.380> into<00:04:43.530> the

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
anyway and now we see it going into the

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.830 
anyway and now we see it going into the
robotics<00:04:43.979> facility<00:04:44.070> playing<00:04:44.639> very<00:04:45.120> very

robotics facility playing very very

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.900 
robotics facility playing very very
toe-to-toe<00:04:46.199> right<00:04:46.740> now<00:04:46.889> meanwhile<00:04:47.610> we<00:04:47.729> are

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
toe-to-toe right now meanwhile we are

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.730 
toe-to-toe right now meanwhile we are
having<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.360> tanks<00:04:48.720> being<00:04:48.870> added<00:04:49.080> on<00:04:49.169> once

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
having the tanks being added on once

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.159 
having the tanks being added on once

crying<00:05:06.750> boosting<00:05:07.110> right<00:05:07.260> now<00:05:07.380> yeah<00:05:07.949> exactly

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
crying boosting right now yeah exactly

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.490 
crying boosting right now yeah exactly
just<00:05:08.520> once<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.479> know<00:05:09.660> exactly<00:05:10.260> what<00:05:10.380> your

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
just once you know exactly what your

just once you know exactly what your
opponent's<00:05:10.860> doing<00:05:11.070> then<00:05:11.250> you<00:05:11.340> can<00:05:11.520> make<00:05:11.639> the

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729

you know because that could as you've

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.150 
you know because that could as you've
said<00:05:15.330> before<00:05:15.389> cost<00:05:15.930> you<00:05:16.139> the<00:05:16.320> game<00:05:16.349> for<00:05:16.949> very

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160

down at right gear for Lao and I do

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.510 
down at right gear for Lao and I do

remember a mech style actually being
used<00:05:23.550> against<00:05:24.060> playing<00:05:24.360> in<00:05:24.539> the<00:05:24.660> ECL<00:05:25.199> so<00:05:25.470> it's

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
used against playing in the ECL so it's

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.650 
used against playing in the ECL so it's
not<00:05:26.039> entirely<00:05:26.370> unheard<00:05:26.729> of<00:05:26.880> flowers<00:05:27.419> perhaps
