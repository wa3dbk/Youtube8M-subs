geary so again we introduce you in a BMW

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.400 
geary so again we introduce you in a BMW
here<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.520> really<00:00:50.760> good<00:00:50.850> mid-range<00:00:51.840> car

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
here it's a really good mid-range car

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.549 
here it's a really good mid-range car
mid-engine<00:00:53.449> solid<00:00:54.449> feel<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.809> also<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.440> this

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
mid-engine solid feel it's also in this

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.200

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
precursor test lap of the car that you

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.389 
precursor test lap of the car that you
use<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> first<00:00:57.930> career<00:00:58.320> event<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.890> set<00:00:59.280> up

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
use in the first career event to set up

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.910 
use in the first career event to set up
the<00:00:59.520> career<00:00:59.699> economy<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.379> system<00:01:01.710> right

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the career economy so the system right

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.529 
the career economy so the system right
now<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.250> determining<00:01:02.850> how<00:01:03.239> long<00:01:03.390> you're

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
now is determining how long you're

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.090 
now is determining how long you're
staying<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> track<00:01:04.199> how<00:01:04.470> close<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.920> are

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
staying on the track how close you are

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.280 
staying on the track how close you are
to<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.400> race<00:01:05.729> line<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.659> really<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.140> in

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
to the race line and and really just in

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.310 
to the race line and and really just in
a<00:01:07.380> quick<00:01:07.590> test<00:01:07.890> lap<00:01:08.130> around<00:01:08.310> brands<00:01:08.820> hatch<00:01:09.320> lay

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
a quick test lap around brands hatch lay

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260 
a quick test lap around brands hatch lay
out<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.369> going<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.000> give<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
out here it is going to give you a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.570 
out here it is going to give you a
recommendation<00:01:12.420> about<00:01:13.080> your<00:01:13.799> skill<00:01:14.100> settings

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
recommendation about your skill settings

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.670 
recommendation about your skill settings
and<00:01:14.909> again<00:01:15.270> that's<00:01:15.420> also<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.200> mechanic

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and again that's also just a mechanic

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.410 
and again that's also just a mechanic
