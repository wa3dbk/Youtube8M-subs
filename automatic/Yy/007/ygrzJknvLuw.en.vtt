00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
if did was good but other people just

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.940 
if did was good but other people just
want<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.960> get<00:01:43.049> sick<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:43.740> don't

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
want to get sick of it and then don't

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.630 
want to get sick of it and then don't
like<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.369> anymore<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.680> know<00:01:47.280> there's<00:01:47.460> one

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
like it anymore so I know there's one

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.789 
like it anymore so I know there's one
reason<00:01:47.939> why<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> lot<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.270> people<00:01:48.360> don't<00:01:48.689> like

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
reason why a lot of people don't like

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.399 
reason why a lot of people don't like
when<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:50.159> serie<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.329> keeps<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.320> going

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
when a serie just keeps going and going

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.530 
when a serie just keeps going and going
and<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.220> all<00:01:53.369> depends<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.119> course<00:01:54.180> on

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
and going it all depends of course on

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.230 
and going it all depends of course on
what<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.399> but<00:01:56.399> let's<00:01:56.549> let's<00:01:56.909> give<00:01:57.060> some

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
what it is but let's let's give some
