than<00:02:16.230> what<00:02:16.440> we<00:02:16.530> were<00:02:16.620> doing<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:16.980> past<00:02:17.239> it

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
than what we were doing in the past it

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.699 
than what we were doing in the past it
also<00:02:18.360> has<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.660> little<00:02:18.810> more<00:02:19.019> volume<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
also has a little more volume in the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.220 
also has a little more volume in the
stern<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> little<00:02:20.489> bit<00:02:20.580> higher<00:02:21.080> parting<00:02:22.080> line

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
stern a little bit higher parting line

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.860 
stern a little bit higher parting line
this<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.400> keep<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.790> from<00:02:23.970> stern<00:02:24.360> squirting

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
this is to keep you from stern squirting

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.570 
this is to keep you from stern squirting
getting<00:02:25.140> out<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.350> control<00:02:25.440> when<00:02:26.370> you're<00:02:26.459> in

getting out of control when you're in
river<00:02:26.790> running<00:02:27.120> mode<00:02:27.560> but<00:02:28.560> it's<00:02:28.680> still

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
river running mode but it's still

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.070 
river running mode but it's still
possible<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.670> cartwheel<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.600> do<00:02:30.750> stern

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
possible to cartwheel and do stern

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.840 
possible to cartwheel and do stern
squirt<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:31.709> it's<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.920> great<00:02:32.130> combo<00:02:32.549> we<00:02:32.670> think

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
squirt so it's a great combo we think

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.310 
squirt so it's a great combo we think
it's<00:02:32.940> just<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.239> right<00:02:33.360> amount<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.720> volume<00:02:33.930> get

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
it's just the right amount of volume get

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.000 
it's just the right amount of volume get

you down the river easily but also low

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.560 
you down the river easily but also low
enough<00:02:38.220> volume<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.790> can<00:02:38.940> still<00:02:39.180> play<00:02:39.209> it

anyone<00:03:58.200> we've<00:03:58.350> done<00:03:58.530> before<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:59.550> this<00:03:59.730> makes

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
anyone we've done before that this makes

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.350 
anyone we've done before that this makes
it<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.150> lot<00:04:00.240> easier<00:04:00.800> what<00:04:01.800> about<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.180> inside<00:04:03.180> of

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
it a lot easier what about the inside of

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.090 
it a lot easier what about the inside of
the<00:04:03.450> boat<00:04:03.630> there's<00:04:04.230> some<00:04:04.440> really<00:04:04.620> cool<00:04:04.920> new

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
the boat there's some really cool new

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.580 
the boat there's some really cool new
developments<00:04:05.670> on<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.910> inside<00:04:06.300> you'll<00:04:07.200> notice

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
developments on the inside you'll notice

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.650 
developments on the inside you'll notice
that<00:04:07.680> we've<00:04:07.830> got<00:04:08.040> our<00:04:08.190> fiberglass<00:04:08.760> reinforced

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
that we've got our fiberglass reinforced

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.800 
that we've got our fiberglass reinforced
hull<00:04:10.110> track<00:04:11.030> but<00:04:12.030> you'll<00:04:12.150> notice<00:04:12.450> that<00:04:12.630> there

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
hull track but you'll notice that there

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.690 
hull track but you'll notice that there
aren't<00:04:13.050> any<00:04:13.140> welding<00:04:13.710> points<00:04:14.250> on<00:04:14.400> it

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
aren't any welding points on it

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.910 
aren't any welding points on it
now<00:04:15.360> where's<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.840> welding<00:04:16.170> points<00:04:16.560> there

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
now where's the welding points there

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.710 
now where's the welding points there
aren't<00:04:17.250> any<00:04:17.430> no<00:04:17.700> why<00:04:17.880> is<00:04:17.910> that<00:04:18.060> because<00:04:18.390> we

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
aren't any no why is that because we

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.570 
aren't any no why is that because we
found<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.080> better<00:04:19.260> way<00:04:19.560> it's<00:04:19.980> much<00:04:20.190> stronger

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
found a better way it's much stronger

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.440 
found a better way it's much stronger
way<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.720> fix<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.290> track<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.920> home<00:04:23.450> we're

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
way to fix the track to the home we're

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.260 
way to fix the track to the home we're
using<00:04:24.600> a<00:04:24.780> special<00:04:24.930> adhesive<00:04:25.670> that's<00:04:26.670> made<00:04:27.090> by

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
using a special adhesive that's made by

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.590 
using a special adhesive that's made by
3m<00:04:27.660> that<00:04:28.140> locks<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.950> track<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.730> hole<00:04:30.000> and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
3m that locks the track to the hole and

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.050 
3m that locks the track to the hole and
it<00:04:30.900> has<00:04:31.230> a<00:04:31.260> lot<00:04:31.830> of<00:04:31.860> surface<00:04:32.250> area<00:04:32.790> so<00:04:32.970> it

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
it has a lot of surface area so it

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.940 
it has a lot of surface area so it
actually<00:04:33.180> makes<00:04:33.450> it<00:04:33.570> a<00:04:33.660> much<00:04:33.840> stiffer<00:04:34.140> and<00:04:34.920> a

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
actually makes it a much stiffer and a

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.450 
actually makes it a much stiffer and a
much<00:04:35.790> stronger<00:04:36.180> hull<00:04:36.480> system<00:04:37.200> so<00:04:38.010> anyway<00:04:38.280> the

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
much stronger hull system so anyway the

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.070 
much stronger hull system so anyway the
hole<00:04:38.670> you're<00:04:38.850> going<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.060> find<00:04:39.330> is<00:04:39.570> supported

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
hole you're going to find is supported

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.360 
hole you're going to find is supported
really<00:04:40.350> well<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:40.680> it's<00:04:40.830> going<00:04:40.920> to<00:04:40.980> look<00:04:41.190> good

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
really well and it's going to look good

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.400 
really well and it's going to look good
for<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:41.670> really<00:04:41.880> long<00:04:42.060> time<00:04:42.300> no<00:04:42.600> oil<00:04:42.870> canning

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
for a really long time no oil canning

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.440 
for a really long time no oil canning
and<00:04:43.950> you<00:04:44.520> don't<00:04:44.670> have<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:44.970> worry<00:04:45.180> about

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
and you don't have to worry about

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.360 
and you don't have to worry about
breaking<00:04:45.840> your<00:04:46.080> hole<00:04:46.260> on<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.680> welds<00:04:47.040> which<00:04:47.190> is

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
breaking your hole on the welds which is

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.490 
breaking your hole on the welds which is

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
shims out lock it back down really easy

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.900 
shims out lock it back down really easy
I<00:05:33.360> for<00:05:34.350> example<00:05:34.710> use<00:05:34.860> two<00:05:35.100> shims<00:05:35.340> on<00:05:35.550> each<00:05:35.669> side

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
I for example use two shims on each side

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.690 
I for example use two shims on each side
which<00:05:36.180> is<00:05:36.300> why<00:05:36.419> there's<00:05:36.630> two<00:05:36.660> shims<00:05:37.020> in<00:05:37.200> there

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
which is why there's two shims in there

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.100 
which is why there's two shims in there

gets to here it rolls the rest away all
by<00:06:34.919> itself<00:06:35.280> so<00:06:35.610> anyway<00:06:36.060> the<00:06:36.210> fun<00:06:36.419> is<00:06:36.570> just<00:06:36.600> what

you would expect super easy to roll and
it<00:06:39.360> is<00:06:39.510> a<00:06:39.540> lot<00:06:39.870> of<00:06:39.900> fun<00:06:40.169> so<00:06:40.860> that's<00:06:41.010> the<00:06:41.190> 2015

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
it is a lot of fun so that's the 2015

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.440 
it is a lot of fun so that's the 2015
fun<00:06:42.740> last<00:06:43.740> but<00:06:43.950> not<00:06:44.070> least<00:06:44.370> notice<00:06:45.240> we<00:06:45.330> have<00:06:45.419> a

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
full-size grab handle up front that

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.700 
full-size grab handle up front that
means<00:06:48.210> instead<00:06:48.600> of<00:06:48.720> just<00:06:48.930> a<00:06:49.050> security<00:06:49.530> bar

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
means instead of just a security bar

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.770 
means instead of just a security bar
makes<00:06:50.610> it<00:06:50.760> a<00:06:50.790> lot<00:06:50.880> easier<00:06:50.940> you<00:06:51.450> still<00:06:51.660> have

makes it a lot easier you still have
something<00:06:51.960> to<00:06:52.110> lock<00:06:52.320> through<00:06:52.590> think<00:06:53.400> you<00:06:53.490> like

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640 
something to lock through think you like

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.360 
something to lock through think you like
