on this so far right what what it what
is<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.670> most<00:00:08.820> significant<00:00:09.330> factor<00:00:09.360> here<00:00:09.840> in

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
is the most significant factor here in

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:10.970 
is the most significant factor here in
the<00:00:09.990> battery<00:00:10.290> well<00:00:10.500> there's<00:00:10.710> really<00:00:10.860> two

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
the battery well there's really two

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.980 
the battery well there's really two
things<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.759> matter<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.480> utility

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
things that matter to the utility

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.470 
things that matter to the utility
companies<00:00:13.410> one<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:15.059> looks<00:00:15.330> like

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
companies one is that it looks like

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.970 
companies one is that it looks like
they're<00:00:15.599> going<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.780> talk<00:00:15.960> about<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.470> battery

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
they're going to talk about a battery

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.540 
they're going to talk about a battery
that<00:00:17.130> goes<00:00:17.640> at<00:00:18.150> home<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.230> could<00:00:19.470> be<00:00:20.279> used

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
that goes at home and that could be used

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.279 
that goes at home and that could be used
with<00:00:20.699> somebody<00:00:21.090> who<00:00:21.210> had<00:00:21.330> solar<00:00:21.600> panels<00:00:22.109> on

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
with somebody who had solar panels on

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.540 
with somebody who had solar panels on
the<00:00:22.439> roof<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.920> make<00:00:23.070> them<00:00:23.279> even<00:00:23.519> more

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
the roof to make them even more

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.970 
the roof to make them even more
independent<00:00:24.359> from<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.600> grid<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:24.980> arguably

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
independent from the grid and arguably

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.890 
independent from the grid and arguably
more<00:00:26.189> cost<00:00:26.519> competitive<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.390> take<00:00:27.570> people

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
more cost competitive and take people

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.839 
more cost competitive and take people
away<00:00:28.109> from<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.470> utility<00:00:28.830> companies<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:29.730> then

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
away from the utility companies but then

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.189 
away from the utility companies but then
they're<00:00:30.000> also<00:00:30.150> talking<00:00:30.449> about<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> very<00:00:30.960> big

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
they're also talking about a very big

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.139 
they're also talking about a very big
battery<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.099> car-sized<00:00:32.550> batteries

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
battery that the car-sized batteries

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.540 
battery that the car-sized batteries
that<00:00:33.630> would<00:00:33.809> be<00:00:33.930> bought<00:00:34.140> bought<00:00:34.680> by<00:00:34.920> utilities

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
that would be bought bought by utilities

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.450 
that would be bought bought by utilities
to<00:00:36.420> help<00:00:36.600> make<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.960> grid<00:00:37.260> run<00:00:37.500> smoother<00:00:38.219> and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
to help make the grid run smoother and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.060 
to help make the grid run smoother and
more<00:00:38.640> cost-effectively<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.930> he<00:00:40.710> could<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.040> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
more cost-effectively so he could be a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100 
more cost-effectively so he could be a
competitor<00:00:41.730> with<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.329> utilities<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> one

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
competitor with the utilities on the one

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.610 
competitor with the utilities on the one

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.060 
and so here's Tesla with an electric
powertrain<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.229> they're<00:01:37.650> finding<00:01:37.890> this

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
powertrain and they're finding this

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.800 
powertrain and they're finding this
other<00:01:38.310> way<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> use<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.970> use<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.509> battery

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
other way to use it use the battery

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.330 
other way to use it use the battery
which<00:01:40.020> was<00:01:40.200> an<00:01:40.380> important<00:01:40.829> breakthrough<00:01:40.950> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
which was an important breakthrough to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.310 
which was an important breakthrough to
make<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:42.060> whole<00:01:42.210> Tesla<00:01:42.750> auto<00:01:42.990> business

possible right so yeah it's it's very
interesting<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.770> analysts<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.310> really

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
interesting and the analysts have really

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.889 
interesting and the analysts have really
kind<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.790> struggled<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.450> because<00:01:48.750> some

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
kind of struggled with this because some

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.690 
kind of struggled with this because some
of<00:01:48.930> them<00:01:49.110> are<00:01:49.200> tech<00:01:49.439> analysts<00:01:49.920> some<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.579> them

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
of them are tech analysts some of them

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.490 
of them are tech analysts some of them
are<00:01:50.820> Auto<00:01:50.970> analysts<00:01:51.570> now<00:01:51.780> they're<00:01:52.350> getting

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
are Auto analysts now they're getting

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
are Auto analysts now they're getting
into<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> utility<00:01:53.189> space<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.210> isn't

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
into a utility space that that isn't

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.209 
into a utility space that that isn't
theirs<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.290> kind<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.890> valuation

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
theirs it's it's kind of a valuation

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.789 
theirs it's it's kind of a valuation
challenge<00:01:56.880> there<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.780> actually<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.740> very

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
challenge there it is actually is very

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.609 
challenge there it is actually is very
much<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> valuation<00:01:59.640> challenge<00:02:00.509> because<00:02:01.469> now

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
much a valuation challenge because now

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.190 
much a valuation challenge because now
he's<00:02:01.860> competing<00:02:02.310> with<00:02:02.790> other<00:02:03.090> players<00:02:03.659> here

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
he's competing with other players here

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.889 
he's competing with other players here
right<00:02:04.469> that's<00:02:04.890> right<00:02:05.100> okay<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.719> gonna

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
right that's right okay so this is gonna

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.260 
right that's right okay so this is gonna
be<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> big<00:02:07.500> deal<00:02:07.710> for<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.190> gigafactory<00:02:08.550> though

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
be a big deal for the gigafactory though

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.820 
be a big deal for the gigafactory though
right<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.569> mean

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
right I mean

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.320 
right I mean
is<00:02:09.920> this<00:02:10.070> gonna<00:02:10.250> be<00:02:10.340> partly<00:02:10.790> what<00:02:10.940> answers

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
is this gonna be partly what answers

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.300 
is this gonna be partly what answers
where<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.110> demand<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.470> gonna<00:02:12.650> come<00:02:12.860> from<00:02:12.890> from

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
where the demand is gonna come from from

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.680 
where the demand is gonna come from from
the<00:02:13.430> from<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.760> batteries<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.120> he<00:02:14.270> produces

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
the from the batteries that he produces

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.460 
the from the batteries that he produces
there<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:14.990> Vegas

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
there in Vegas

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.470 
there in Vegas
well<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.890> idea<00:02:16.280> would<00:02:16.460> be<00:02:16.670> if<00:02:16.970> if<00:02:17.330> he's

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
well the idea would be if if he's

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.650 
well the idea would be if if he's
effective<00:02:17.990> we've<00:02:18.140> already<00:02:18.350> seen<00:02:18.800> people<00:02:18.830> like

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
effective we've already seen people like

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.140 
effective we've already seen people like
Hawaiian<00:02:20.660> Electric<00:02:21.350> saying<00:02:21.650> if<00:02:22.040> we<00:02:22.820> can<00:02:23.000> get

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
Hawaiian Electric saying if we can get

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.760 
Hawaiian Electric saying if we can get
the<00:02:23.270> batteries<00:02:23.690> we're<00:02:23.840> gonna<00:02:23.960> use<00:02:24.230> them<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.710> I

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
the batteries we're gonna use them and I

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.400 
the batteries we're gonna use them and I
think<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.460> know<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.850> Texas<00:02:26.450> utility<00:02:26.900> encore

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
think I know the Texas utility encore

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.830 
think I know the Texas utility encore
has<00:02:27.860> talked<00:02:28.250> about<00:02:28.580> really<00:02:28.910> being<00:02:29.600> very

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
has talked about really being very

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.020 
has talked about really being very
interested<00:02:30.470> in<00:02:30.590> seeing<00:02:30.830> these<00:02:30.950> things<00:02:31.190> for<00:02:32.000> a

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
interested in seeing these things for a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.700 
interested in seeing these things for a
long<00:02:32.270> time<00:02:32.570> utility<00:02:33.230> people<00:02:33.470> have<00:02:33.590> been

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
long time utility people have been

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.590 
long time utility people have been
saying<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:34.280> batteries<00:02:34.910> are<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.090> Holy<00:02:35.330> Grail

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
saying that batteries are a Holy Grail

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.630 
saying that batteries are a Holy Grail
if<00:02:35.990> it<00:02:36.590> would<00:02:36.800> make<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.130> someone<00:02:37.460> can<00:02:37.610> make

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
if it would make it someone can make

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.370 
if it would make it someone can make
them<00:02:38.000> if<00:02:38.390> someone<00:02:38.750> can<00:02:38.900> make<00:02:38.930> them<00:02:39.230> they're

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
them if someone can make them they're

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.660 
them if someone can make them they're
gonna<00:02:39.500> use<00:02:39.770> them<00:02:40.040> but<00:02:40.220> they<00:02:40.370> have<00:02:40.490> to<00:02:40.610> make

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
gonna use them but they have to make

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.460 
gonna use them but they have to make
them<00:02:40.940> cost-effectively<00:02:41.690> that's<00:02:41.960> really<00:02:42.350> the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
them cost-effectively that's really the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.430 
them cost-effectively that's really the
great<00:02:42.680> sowhat's<00:02:43.070> mean<00:02:43.580> what<00:02:43.760> price<00:02:44.030> well<00:02:44.440> I've

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
great sowhat's mean what price well I've

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.120 
great sowhat's mean what price well I've
seen<00:02:46.540> ideas<00:02:47.540> discussions<00:02:48.260> as<00:02:48.440> low<00:02:48.650> as<00:02:48.860> a

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
seen ideas discussions as low as a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.310 
seen ideas discussions as low as a
little<00:02:49.430> over<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.670> hundred<00:02:49.910> dollars<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.870> kilowatt

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
little over a hundred dollars a kilowatt

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.400 
little over a hundred dollars a kilowatt
hour<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:52.390> Tesla<00:02:53.390> might<00:02:53.630> be<00:02:53.810> able<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.320> do<00:02:56.410> yeah

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
hour that Tesla might be able to do yeah

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.100 
hour that Tesla might be able to do yeah
yeah<00:02:57.890> it's<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.610> it's<00:02:58.730> it's<00:02:59.030> maybe<00:02:59.330> as<00:02:59.900> an

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
yeah it's and it's it's maybe as an

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.660 
yeah it's and it's it's maybe as an
order<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.350> magnitude<00:03:00.740> is<00:03:00.830> five<00:03:01.040> times<00:03:01.340> what

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
order of magnitude is five times what

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.600 
order of magnitude is five times what
utilities<00:03:02.300> produce<00:03:02.690> power<00:03:02.959> for<00:03:03.320> now<00:03:03.530> or<00:03:03.860> more

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
utilities produce power for now or more

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.660 
utilities produce power for now or more
so<00:03:05.240> there's<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.230> long<00:03:06.470> way<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.740> go<00:03:07.010> before<00:03:07.250> it's

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
so there's a long way to go before it's

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.510 
so there's a long way to go before it's
it's<00:03:07.970> really<00:03:08.360> close<00:03:08.660> but<00:03:09.100> they're<00:03:10.100> used<00:03:10.340> in

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
it's really close but they're used in

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.980 
it's really close but they're used in
conjunction<00:03:10.700> with<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.510> grid<00:03:11.750> not

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
conjunction with the grid not

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.930 
conjunction with the grid not
necessarily<00:03:12.890> in<00:03:13.130> opposition

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
necessarily in opposition

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.800 
necessarily in opposition
so<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:15.530> it's<00:03:15.830> it's<00:03:16.310> spread<00:03:16.640> out<00:03:16.820> over<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.269> lot

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
so you it's it's spread out over a lot

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.360 
so you it's it's spread out over a lot
more<00:03:18.080> it's<00:03:18.140> not<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.470> same<00:03:18.680> thing<00:03:18.709> as<00:03:19.130> you

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
more it's not the same thing as you

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.640 
more it's not the same thing as you
either<00:03:19.580> build<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:20.060> gas<00:03:20.239> plant<00:03:20.630> or<00:03:21.140> yeah<00:03:21.320> or<00:03:21.530> you

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
either build a gas plant or yeah or you

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.949 
either build a gas plant or yeah or you
have<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.800> gigantic<00:03:22.310> battery<00:03:22.790> out<00:03:22.910> there<00:03:23.269> Jamie

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
have a gigantic battery out there Jamie

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.540 
have a gigantic battery out there Jamie
how<00:03:24.260> much<00:03:24.440> do<00:03:24.620> we<00:03:24.680> know<00:03:24.890> I<00:03:24.920> mean<00:03:25.040> how<00:03:25.220> much<00:03:25.370> is

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
how much do we know I mean how much is

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.000 
how much do we know I mean how much is
the<00:03:25.670> battery<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.600> cost<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.200> entire<00:03:27.320> Tesla

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
the battery the cost of the entire Tesla

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.560 
the battery the cost of the entire Tesla
car<00:03:28.250> do<00:03:28.340> we<00:03:28.519> know<00:03:28.670> that<00:03:30.310> now<00:03:31.310> really<00:03:31.489> you<00:03:32.120> know
