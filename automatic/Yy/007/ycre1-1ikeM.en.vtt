00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
one in a while when it came out when you

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.090 
one in a while when it came out when you
combine<00:01:00.870> really<00:01:01.230> good<00:01:01.350> characters<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.039> an

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and then you add that really good timing

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.120 
and then you add that really good timing
i<00:01:06.689> think<00:01:06.900> that's<00:01:07.110> when<00:01:07.350> things<00:01:07.530> go<00:01:07.770> supernova
