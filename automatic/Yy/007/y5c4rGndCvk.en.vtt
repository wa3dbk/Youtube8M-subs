00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:03.729
 Hello here is how hail many continue 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.169
 Girl 1 Saarlouis 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:07.989
 Project 

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:10.989
 and consumed besides I show you Crameri Art 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.030
 they can continue on the middle route on the Suter 1 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.999
 why write a mission here again, whatever the word 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.880
 know 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.880
 about himself by John Tripp 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.279
 Yusuf o 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.279
 our goal is to have the Rebels BMW manufactures 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.180
 that should be clear so far 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.050
 2 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.060
 b also a small lead 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.310
 to those of the bark too very beautiful 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.310
 Of course, this also has to play his skimpy that is very clear 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.390
 Northrend 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.390
 Boredom is 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.610
 rtr 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.380
 what is it? 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.180
 Professor Dr 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.310
 the regulation 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.310
 here already the first opponent 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400
 the next opponent 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.470
 look there 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.470
 what is that supposed to be 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.300
 that does not diverge Red 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.980
 well no matter 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.410
 wet cheeses Well, what do I talk about? 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.410
 expresses 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.230
 ARD ZDF Sat 1 RTL and VOX 7 4 percent 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.230
 because I do not always volunteer 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.480
 from 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.480
 according to the city of Rostock 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.409
 had 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:21.679
 There he gets stuck again 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:24.679
 here is everyone of mine 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.780
 although it has certainly been noticed that unlike Lala Horst 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:31.849
 no points required 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.999
 for downed opponents that comes only at the very end and in the form of a 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.319
 Percent indicator 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.319
 similar to the police in Trier 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:45.239
 what percentage of the opponents like an investigator punished so 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.459
 Picture ddp Bamberg come here 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.459
 there meets the president 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.689
 for words 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.689
 Cash at the morning was not just praise 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:04.349
 but no matter 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.139
 we do not have a silver ring which means that we are full of energy again 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.139
 to have 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.719
 Thereupon follows for new elections to come 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.689
 and 8 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.870
 also optimist project work with teddy both sides 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:26.469
 What is he asking? 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:28.820
 the first Macarena penalty 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.820
 r 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.769
 and then again McCann 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:50.209
 then we have no explorer and now we are finally the first boss 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.259
 Final match 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.259
 May the title monster after another 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.819
 and that is we also know a new edition despite this money is missing here 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.069
 that will be solved 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.849
 even a "boss" on Probe Area had been a small consolation, however, always 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.849
 heavier too 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.939
 the deb team with the teens had to become the classic where to get 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:22.539
 could formally decide and run exactly this principle runs 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.740
 So who suffers probably has ever played the has to be 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.740
 also in such a fight as this certainly benefits 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.180
 proved the country » 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.610
 but America would become Magna 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.490
 mellow 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.300
 because we need more sales 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.599
 Hopp but now makes out 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.210
 Fla that I'm quite neat but that's not played in a long time 

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:49.300
 to have 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.400
 we say we have relatively easily passed Condé Area 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:56.309
 which is actually already with the first third 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.680
 Bonn 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.680
 Anyone who holds the event will not 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.039
 what about the status of his buddies 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.169
 Of course, further questions do not ask complacent and everything would have been 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.589
 I would have curious 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:14.430
 Coach Krupp also Abbacher 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.569
 99% and that does not play anymore 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.099
 1a Swede 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:24.860
 that yes 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.610
 that was much better than I thought prayed 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.990
 becomes 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.969
 I'm glad that it went really well 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.120
 and that makes you want more than next 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.559
 At one point I was a sextet 

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:43.639
 about the number and the asteroid Laval in the middle on the first 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.639
 Route and 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:51.770
 without Thurk there is still room for of the things you and twists so now 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.960
 a little something offered on the first lap 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.919
 definitely looking forward to the next day 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.589
 if we take care of the asteroid
