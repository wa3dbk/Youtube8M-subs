another<00:01:39.119> feature<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:40.549> i<00:01:41.549> think<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:42.840> may<00:01:43.140> have

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
another feature that i think it may have

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.289 
another feature that i think it may have
i'm<00:01:43.649> not<00:01:43.860> completely<00:01:44.280> positive<00:01:44.610> about<00:01:45.060> this

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299

they<00:01:51.659> call<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> iphone<00:01:52.200> 4<00:01:52.470> iphone<00:01:52.500> 4g<00:01:53.250> i<00:01:53.460> think

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
they call the iphone 4 iphone 4g i think

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.459 
they call the iphone 4 iphone 4g i think
it's<00:01:54.479> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:56.329> video<00:01:57.329> messaging<00:01:57.960> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.350 
it's going to have a video messaging and
on<00:01:59.159> top<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> video<00:01:59.790> features<00:02:00.000> i<00:02:00.210> think

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
on top of the video features i think

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.789 
on top of the video features i think
it's<00:02:00.450> going<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.719> like<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> video<00:02:01.259> ichat

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
time deal um with that said I think

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.740 
time deal um with that said I think
they're<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.000> put<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> camera<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
they're going to put a camera on the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.710 
they're going to put a camera on the
front<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.200> back<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.149> can<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.360> true

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
front and back so that you can do true

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.919 
front and back so that you can do true
video<00:02:10.050> messaging

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
video messaging

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.490

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
so I'm stretch long shot but i think

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.890 
so I'm stretch long shot but i think
apple<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.340> going<00:02:15.609> to<00:02:15.760> do<00:02:15.939> if<00:02:16.420> they<00:02:16.599> got<00:02:16.780> it

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900

of when they implement features they try

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.530 
of when they implement features they try
to<00:02:23.560> do<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.829> right<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.250> front<00:02:24.700> of<00:02:24.760> half<00:02:24.939> we<00:02:25.180> do<00:02:25.359> it

to do it right in front of half we do it
which<00:02:26.230> is<00:02:26.349> why<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.530> think<00:02:26.859> the<00:02:27.010> absence<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.939> I

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
which is why I think the absence of I

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.170 
which is why I think the absence of I

to take that route and it's going to be

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.930 
to take that route and it's going to be
priced<00:05:16.659> pretty<00:05:16.960> high<00:05:17.340> it's<00:05:18.340> not<00:05:18.550> going<00:05:18.729> to<00:05:18.819> be

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
priced pretty high it's not going to be

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.860

2<00:05:19.330> 99<00:05:20.280> now<00:05:21.280> I'm<00:05:22.030> thinking<00:05:22.240> this<00:05:22.449> is<00:05:22.630> going<00:05:22.780> to

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
2 99 now I'm thinking this is going to

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.020 
2 99 now I'm thinking this is going to
be<00:05:23.020> around<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:23.800> mac<00:05:23.979> mini<00:05:24.009> price<00:05:24.580> range<00:05:24.880> I

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
be around the mac mini price range I

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.700 
be around the mac mini price range I
think<00:05:25.210> it's<00:05:25.330> going<00:05:25.419> to<00:05:25.479> be<00:05:25.539> 700<00:05:26.229> maybe<00:05:26.500> eight

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
think it's going to be 700 maybe eight
