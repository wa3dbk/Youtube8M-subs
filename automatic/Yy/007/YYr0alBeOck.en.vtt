it
the<00:01:26.890> great<00:01:27.130> thing<00:01:27.310> about<00:01:27.369> doing<00:01:27.549> Peter<00:01:28.060> Pan<00:01:28.240> so

the great thing about doing Peter Pan so
many<00:01:28.810> times<00:01:29.140> is<00:01:29.469> that<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:30.130> live<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:31.030> on<00:01:31.450> stage

many times is that you live it on stage
every<00:01:32.110> night<00:01:32.140> it's<00:01:32.409> not<00:01:32.590> something<00:01:32.920> you<00:01:33.009> have

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
every night it's not something you have

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.219 
every night it's not something you have
to<00:01:33.189> even<00:01:33.430> think<00:01:33.640> about<00:01:33.729> so<00:01:34.090> that<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.570> the

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
to even think about so that the the

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.749 
to even think about so that the the
ability<00:01:35.619> to<00:01:35.770> find<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:37.750> spontaneity<00:01:38.619> and<00:01:38.950> a

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
ability to find a spontaneity and a

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.819 
ability to find a spontaneity and a
newness<00:01:40.179> about<00:01:40.450> it<00:01:40.630> is<00:01:40.750> actually<00:01:41.259> easier<00:01:41.710> it

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
newness about it is actually easier it

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.889 
newness about it is actually easier it
says<00:01:42.039> if<00:01:42.189> you<00:01:42.310> put<00:01:42.520> on<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.819> tunic<00:01:43.390> of<00:01:43.450> leaves

window and all the nuances that come

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.270 
window and all the nuances that come
from<00:01:48.850> other<00:01:49.030> actors<00:01:49.509> or<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:49.929> audience<00:01:50.500> strike

from other actors or the audience strike

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.980 
from other actors or the audience strike
you<00:01:51.460> probably<00:01:51.880> more<00:01:52.240> heavily<00:01:52.509> because<00:01:52.750> you're

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
you probably more heavily because you're

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.990 
you probably more heavily because you're
not<00:01:53.140> thinking<00:01:53.439> so<00:01:53.829> much<00:01:54.009> you're<00:01:54.280> not<00:01:54.429> worrying

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
not thinking so much you're not worrying

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.370 
not thinking so much you're not worrying
about<00:01:55.090> where<00:01:55.390> you're<00:01:55.539> supposed<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.899> be<00:01:55.990> and

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
about where you're supposed to be and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.190 
about where you're supposed to be and
there's<00:01:56.920> more<00:01:57.159> there<00:01:57.610> seems<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.179> be<00:01:58.270> more<00:01:58.509> fun

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
there's more there seems to be more fun

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.089 
there's more there seems to be more fun
and<00:01:59.380> mischief<00:01:59.530> than<00:02:00.069> drama<00:02:00.459> and<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.920> just

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
and mischief than drama and it's just

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:08.499 
and mischief than drama and it's just
like<00:02:03.280> being<00:02:03.429> alive<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:03.939> stage

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.990 

it<00:02:08.929> was<00:02:09.080> never<00:02:09.350> scary<00:02:09.740> I<00:02:10.160> think<00:02:10.850> mainly

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
it was never scary I think mainly

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.270 
it was never scary I think mainly
because<00:02:11.300> when<00:02:11.600> you<00:02:11.660> work<00:02:11.840> on<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:12.100> balance<00:02:13.100> beam

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
because when you work on a balance beam

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.040 
because when you work on a balance beam
that's<00:02:13.459> four<00:02:13.700> feet<00:02:14.060> off<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.240> ground<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.660> only

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
that's four feet off the ground and only

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.160 
that's four feet off the ground and only
four<00:02:15.410> inches<00:02:15.590> wide<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.160> there's<00:02:16.610> no<00:02:17.170> fairy

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
four inches wide and there's no fairy

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
little more subdued role not subdued but

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.620 
little more subdued role not subdued but
it's<00:04:57.690> just<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:58.050> little<00:04:58.260> more<00:04:59.330> internal<00:05:00.330> and

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
it's just a little more internal and

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.910 
it's just a little more internal and
thought<00:05:00.870> provoking

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.250 

oh<00:05:07.010> I<00:05:07.850> think<00:05:08.180> there's<00:05:08.330> a<00:05:08.390> part<00:05:08.720> of<00:05:08.840> all<00:05:08.990> of<00:05:09.020> us

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
oh I think there's a part of all of us

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.790 
oh I think there's a part of all of us
that<00:05:09.640> as<00:05:10.640> we<00:05:11.240> not<00:05:11.630> even<00:05:11.810> as<00:05:12.020> we<00:05:12.170> get<00:05:12.320> older<00:05:12.650> but

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
that as we not even as we get older but

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
that as we not even as we get older but
just<00:05:13.070> we<00:05:13.280> think<00:05:13.790> about<00:05:15.430> growing<00:05:16.430> up<00:05:16.580> growing

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
just we think about growing up growing

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.050 
just we think about growing up growing
older<00:05:17.500> you<00:05:18.500> know<00:05:18.650> we<00:05:18.860> were<00:05:19.310> always<00:05:19.520> conscious

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
older you know we were always conscious

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.250 
older you know we were always conscious
of<00:05:20.450> that<00:05:20.630> as<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.590> I<00:05:21.710> think<00:05:23.020> there's<00:05:24.020> a<00:05:24.140> couple
