 to cover and steering wheel leather and put the buttons 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.320

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:44.059
 snap off the latch with some sharp 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.909

 eight 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:11.090
 the screws that hold the back 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:17.439

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.439

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.369

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.360
 and this posting 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.420
 we stretch the skin on the steering wheel 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.760
 fit tight enough to fit 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.870
 then go online and look at the seams 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.300
 I chose this macrame I liked 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:48.120
 more than others and in my opinion 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:51.920
 seemed easier after 4 hours 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:56.030
 the steering wheel is such a seam 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.870
 press the skin with the buttons 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.080
 recommendations before you install 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.330
 skin buttons improved taut those places 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.220
 where is she not stitched 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.220
 she's quite elastic 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.400
 I want to note that the wire can 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.140
 hide specially designated 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.010
 space there are special for 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.210
 slits 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.800
 and there it easily fits the wire from 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:29.670
 buttons here actually here in this form 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.200
 we get the wheel all good luck hope my 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.200
 review will be helpful
