00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.290
 for three generations to get into 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.189
 our fish is my grandfather 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.219
 Italian who landed in Algeria in 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.500
 1940 where he created so two factories of 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.120
 keep the fish in Algeria and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.120
 develop fishing in Algeria 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.699
 in 62 years of independence from Algeria and 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.070
 so have come to port saint louis 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.079
 why port saint louis but because 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.720
 that they had the Rhone and the Rhone that 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:31.329
 does the rhône he brings plankton 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.640
 ie what is salty and water 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.489
 sweet plants have so they started 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.160
 so to develop fishing at holy port 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.040
 louis du rhône and on the sarthe 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.860
 we were at the time in 63 more than 100 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.930
 factories at the national level to do the 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.879
 race sardines r and currently 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.020
 we are in mystery year the only ones 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:55.420
 and it remains that zune in atlantic 1,2 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.399
 producing the torch at the day entered into 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.690
 the company says about 25 years and 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.230
 before at home in a sloping evening 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.699
 in a bank 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.079
 and then after good my father but in 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.070
 getting older we had to take a 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.070
 following what 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.210
 Tonight copé marc so at port de bouc or 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.560
 the trawl boats his input and this 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.780
 evening so the fishing is not good so 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.969
 very few fish of good quality 60 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.039
 sure but very few fish and for the 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.939
 factory so it's not noticeable that there is 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.069
 not this time we press them 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.539
 foreigners while we need 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.069
 qualities more important was that 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.020
 the price is lower so we can 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:40.219
 buy goods for the yard 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:41.450
 set in 2000 and 99 so we had to 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.069
 to separate a little bit from the sector 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.240
 sardines either by saint louis to do 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.530
 manufacturing on Morocco 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.750
 you are always the same, that is to say 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.250
 in Morocco also in the same way but 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.599
 wages are not the same so 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.950
 logically than the most competitive 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:55.020
 so at the level so 2 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.570
 of the box and so we had to 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.640
 either to stop the canning factory 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.710
 licensees everyone or be from 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.929
 therefore reduce the manufacturing and 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.960
 develop something else scorpion fish 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.080
 saint pierre of the grondins of the little ones 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.390
 tales to d 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.160
 I tapped moors to live from rubble 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.930
 and we developed everything that is not 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.930
 cook on the bio test fish 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.209
 a man's job for years 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.490
 it works and it's rare of all the 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.500
 France at national and European level 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.410
 in the skull for spain also to 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.260
 you in spain in belgium 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.870
 so we are also going to our fish soup 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.290

 petra 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.480

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.270
 at home we have where you go 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.940
 your fish soup and that's it 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.739
 So lets two pass and eject 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.220
 so stop them and recover that the 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.170
 south of the fish so that's the soup 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.890
 is not grinding where we do not miss the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.230
