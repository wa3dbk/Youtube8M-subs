00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
small thing of mascara to buy guess I

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.529

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.060 
guess it is so the lid pops right off
and<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.190> has<00:00:50.399> these<00:00:51.140> little<00:00:52.140> grippy<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.980> you

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
long lashes but you know I can build it

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:59.150 
long lashes but you know I can build it
up<00:03:56.360> it's<00:03:57.360> built<00:03:57.720> up<00:03:57.840> really<00:03:58.260> strong<00:03:58.560> stronger

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
up it's built up really strong stronger

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.920 
up it's built up really strong stronger
than<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.489> side<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.880> site<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.239> already<00:04:00.630> dry

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
than the side the site is already dry

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.500 
than the side the site is already dry
and<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:02.010> can<00:04:02.280> do<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.640> little<00:04:02.819> bit<00:04:03.030> faster<00:04:03.239> now

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
and I can do it a little bit faster now

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.620 
and I can do it a little bit faster now
because<00:04:04.049> I<00:04:04.080> practice<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:04.890> much<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:06.060> as<00:04:06.299> I<00:04:06.569> said

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
because I practice so much but as I said

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.339 
because I practice so much but as I said
when<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.200> first<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.940> is<00:04:09.090> easier<00:04:09.510> for<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:10.140> lot

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
when I first and it is easier for a lot

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.110 
when I first and it is easier for a lot
of<00:04:10.470> people<00:04:10.739> just<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:11.130> take<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.310> corner<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.819> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
of people just to take the corner of the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.370 
of people just to take the corner of the
brush<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:12.630> do<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.230> bottom<00:04:13.500> lashes<00:04:13.739> I<00:04:15.350> made<00:04:16.350> a

this<00:04:18.720> mascara<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:20.430> know<00:04:20.579> I<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:21.239> was

this mascara and you know I I was
frustrated<00:04:22.109> with<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.710> but<00:04:23.010> i<00:04:23.039> really<00:04:23.520> was

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.590 
intrigued by the brush and had to master
it<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:28.320> know<00:04:28.470> i<00:04:28.830> think<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.610> holds<00:04:29.940> my<00:04:30.270> curl

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.159 
it and you know i think it holds my curl
pretty<00:04:30.990> well<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:35.330> it<00:04:36.330> gives<00:04:36.570> me<00:04:36.690> you<00:04:37.050> know<00:04:37.140> i

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
pretty well and it gives me you know i

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.350 
pretty well and it gives me you know i
can<00:04:37.440> do<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.650> whimsical<00:04:38.430> look<00:04:38.640> almost<00:04:38.940> with

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
can do a whimsical look almost with

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.840 
can do a whimsical look almost with
light<00:04:39.600> and<00:04:39.630> feathery<00:04:40.050> ashes<00:04:40.830> or<00:04:41.340> i<00:04:41.370> can<00:04:41.520> build

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
light and feathery ashes or i can build

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.450 
light and feathery ashes or i can build
it<00:04:41.970> up<00:04:42.090> for<00:04:42.330> a<00:04:42.360> more<00:04:42.600> dramatic<00:04:42.690> look<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.620> i

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
it up for a more dramatic look and i

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.610 
it up for a more dramatic look and i
think<00:04:44.520> that<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.300> know<00:04:45.419> it<00:04:45.900> will<00:04:46.139> take<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:46.380> while

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
think that you know it will take a while

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.600 
think that you know it will take a while
to<00:04:47.010> learn<00:04:47.220> on<00:04:47.550> how<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:47.970> really<00:04:48.419> use<00:04:48.510> it<00:04:49.460> but<00:04:50.460> it

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
to learn on how to really use it but it

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.969 
to learn on how to really use it but it
works<00:04:50.880> well<00:04:51.240> it's<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.750> really<00:04:52.020> interesting

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
works well it's a really interesting

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.330 
works well it's a really interesting
concept<00:04:53.880> because<00:04:54.030> i<00:04:54.510> don't<00:04:54.990> hate<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.350> brush<00:04:55.590> I

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
concept because i don't hate the brush I

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.330 
concept because i don't hate the brush I
actually<00:04:56.760> like<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.770> but<00:04:58.770> if<00:04:58.889> I'm<00:04:59.010> in<00:04:59.130> a<00:04:59.160> hurry

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
actually like it but if I'm in a hurry

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.890 
actually like it but if I'm in a hurry
this<00:04:59.639> is<00:04:59.820> not<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.090> one<00:05:00.210> I'm<00:05:00.330> going<00:05:00.539> for

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
this is not the one I'm going for

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.480 
this is not the one I'm going for
because<00:05:01.080> you<00:05:01.229> know<00:05:01.530> it<00:05:01.680> does<00:05:01.950> take<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.310> little

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
because you know it does take a little

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.230 
because you know it does take a little
while<00:05:02.760> to<00:05:03.060> get<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.300> like<00:05:03.479> painted<00:05:03.930> on<00:05:05.000> but<00:05:06.000> I<00:05:06.030> am

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080
