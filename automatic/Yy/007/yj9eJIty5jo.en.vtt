00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.969
 another of the products that I discovered 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.650
 what I found interesting is the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.169
 water clustered with gardenia extract 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.380
 I receive the doctor in this forum and 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.910
 scientist who brings us this product 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.680
 welcome thank you for being here with al 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.990
 contrary thank you very much to you for 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.179
 give me the opportunity to the contrary to 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.489
 We are honored to make you known 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.089
 all these products with which 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.820
 we count today diabetics and 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:41.460
 the doctor to see the product to me 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.080
 doubt arises how can water and with 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.479
 some treatment some process 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.210
 specific support in the control 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:51.150
 we are talking about insulin levels 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.119
 that are diminished or in a fault 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.330
 total how can they help a person 

00:00:54.119 --> 00:01:01.699
 with diabetes see if I tried 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.699
 give them a biochemical explanation 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.150
 I can tell you 6 a study in china with 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.790
 350 diabetic patients hospitalized for 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.490
 have a good control the result was 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.920
 very simple there I showed you right now 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.050
 name graphics there were patients that 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.650
 increased in two weeks of taking 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.500
 water clustered four times the level of 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.540
 water that they had inside the cells and 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.670
 one of the big problems that has 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.940
 the diabetic and that has never been 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.680
 really handled in the treatment 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.070
 we always go to his clipping without 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.229
 insulin do any of the incretinas 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.649
 which is the newest of the substances 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.560
 they will produce a better consumer 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.440
 of glucose but we always forget 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.229
 that the diabetic patient has less 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.130
 less water inside your cells than a 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:03.310
 agent why the fact that he does not have 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.190
 enough water in his cell alone me 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.110
 they asked for clay one please 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.500
 I invite you to any of you 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.970
 take your car you lower the pressure of 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.970
 the tires to 8 or 10 days 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.600
 so that it works in the cells of a 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.270
 diabetic or an elderly person who 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.760
 is with poor cellular hydration and 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.890
 all proteins work poorly 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.810
 cellular communication alters the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.960
 reproduction of the information of the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.450
 new 277 of all the normal function in 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.490
 the 11 is taken or I come and say ok 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.230
 I need hydration because they are a 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.860
 diabetic patient 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.290
 and how do you take it ok very simple though 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.440
 do not be a diabetic patient either 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.599
 you can take this the gardenia is very 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.849
 studied known in china for 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:03:01.209
 thousands of years and very studied national 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:10.459
 Between gardenias 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:13.250
 that's why it's clear 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.010
 in reality what happens is that the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.510
 gardenia has a substance that prevents 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.220
 that insulin production is inhibited 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.050
 very well this favors the good level 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.050
 as much as possible in a diabetic 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.600
 which is also diminished production 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.490
 of that helps lower cholesterol helps 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.880
 lose weight etcetera etcetera is 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.800
 antioxidant coin but treatment is 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.020
 enroll in a healthy lifestyle 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.500
 with feeding average exercise 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.750
 logically this needs a diet 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.300
 proper as every diabetic go to a 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.800
 treatment that should not be suspended 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.990
 this is very important 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.510
 despite that nothing more to be taken what 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.459
 is the truth and with that they forget about 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.590
 your medications and eating what you 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.570
 have to eat because if it is not a shot 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.820
 of hair and this is that is also not 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.220
 magical does not do it today I do not 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.260
 I know nothing that covers diabetes like that 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.510
 it's already I have it now I have to 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.880
 protect clark and this helps me 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.900
 hydrate well for my body to work 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.380
 much better because it reactivates all the water 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.639
 the water of our body that 70% of the 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.250
 body nothing more 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.340
 that is, nothing else can be seen 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.710
 of our body is water and it is said that 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.630
 Water participates in 99% of the 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.669
 functions of the cell 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.250
 and as an example a cell has 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.169
 about 100 thousand chemical reactions 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.080
 per second now imagine what 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.880
 Nobel water works and if you lack water 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.430
 what's going to happen everything will go wrong 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.110
 that's how it is with this it is as if we remove the 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.940
 water from serious plants die 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.060
 second so easy 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.060
 as you have to take this this comes in 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.120
 a concentrated form yes you have to mix 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.100
 a cap equivalent to 8 milliliters and 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.520
 no cover in case we ask you to 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.520
 measure a lot 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:10.220
 a cap is calculated for each liter 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:13.180
 of water ok and here's how it comes out 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.180
 it does not taste bad 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:21.520
 I think it's very tasty, it also has 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.530
 a special flavor but here you have to 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.840
 use that unit 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.410
 throughout the day as water use not 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.840
 two glasses a day or cashier have enough 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.729
 in mind that the water received is called 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.449
 well by the structure of the molecules 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:40.569
 of water and in scientific terms 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:43.660
 Knolole Gallic we know it is supposed to be water 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:45.789
 liter clusters are six molecules of 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.669
 water together and many as a bunch of 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:51.340
 that's why it's called orange when 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:54.250
 we use metal when we 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.500
 we use water that has salts elevates a lot 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.750
 the temperature anything of that 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.759
 type we break the structure and it breaks 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.490
 Mikado water is ideal for 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.289
 mix this but there is a water in the 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.000
 market that is the only one that gives the 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:11.620
 conditions is pure 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.630
 the ones that have to really have a 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.460
 good control not all have good 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.870
 control the lolita forgiveness here no no 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.870
 I'm talking bad about the other 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.169
 we have to measure the resistance of 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.029
 water but we do not use distilled water that 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.520
 it costs a lot of work in this country for 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:33.460
 mishap they will get or use pure 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.770
 because one is in 3 megabytes and the other in 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.379
 4 and all the others are very high and not 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.990
 They serve are not good for this very well 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:43.809
 then this this product that I have 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.309
 here it is important that I know him what 

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:48.260
 know many of the patients 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:50.420
 how many diabetics are we going to give 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.120
 how many do you want for the week times 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.040
 At least let's say it will be 30 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.010
 attack bottles moor well the 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.960
 I offer you best I feel I love it 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.810
 the idea is what we are going to do all 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.000
 those people who want to have a 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.860
 rationed water bottle what they have 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.710
 what to do is write us 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.330
 we pass your data directly with them 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.320
 and they will be made to come true 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:17.030
 opportunely with pleasure and 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:21.170
 it truly is a pleasure to be able to 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:23.120
 make this little donation because what 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.610
 What we want is for this to be known and 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.620
 especially so that the patient can 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.600
 have a better quality of life than those 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.820
 you do not know what will improve the 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.430
 I invite you to take it because it does not make you 

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.830
 harm to those who do not have diabetes ac 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.660
 help in every way and reactivates the 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.820
 good functioning of the body reaches me 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.410
 I remain with mine many thanks to 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.410
 contrary thank you very much
