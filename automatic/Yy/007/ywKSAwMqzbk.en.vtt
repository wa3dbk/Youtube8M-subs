00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
but actually me and I think most you'll

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.440 
but actually me and I think most you'll
agree<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.640> think<00:02:26.030> that's<00:02:26.150> an<00:02:26.330> upgrade

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
agree I think that's an upgrade

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.020 
agree I think that's an upgrade
