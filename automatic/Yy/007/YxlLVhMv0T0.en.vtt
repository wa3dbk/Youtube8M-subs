can't<00:03:00.750> get<00:03:00.930> 99<00:03:01.200> chemistry<00:03:01.859> out<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.159> team

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
can't get 99 chemistry out this team

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.649 
can't get 99 chemistry out this team
obviously<00:03:02.579> it's<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.180> some<00:03:03.359> of<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.510> players
