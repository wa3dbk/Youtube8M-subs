00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.489
 little trailer that he did not show 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.189
 at the microsoft conference and more 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:23.839

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.849
 gameplay that came up in the conference 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.460
 at the electronic arts conference 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:32.229
 it's been a long time but it's good 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.229
 to see first what is the trailer 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.210
 since the beginning of time the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.780
 plants have protected suburbia of the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.780
 zombies 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.770
 but 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.770
 has not changed 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.850
 welcome to my world 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.050
 or not 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.960
 sometimes 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.960
 life 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.000
 yes 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.000
 Y 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.469
 yes no 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.900
 good position was the trailer for 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.000
 presentation of plants against zombies and 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.190
 carmen wayfarer 2 I really loved it 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.989
 a lot because they show us in truth that 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.610
 There are four types of new plants that 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.170
 they will come out in the new game and four 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.000
 types of zombies and well then now 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.560
 let's continue with what is the 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.420
 gameplay that were in the 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.400
 electronic conference and well let's go 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.470
 start with what is the main attraction 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.209
 and Well let's start with what 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.769
 is the main course here is what this 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.049
 gameplay that they announced in the 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.879
 conference and well let's see it little to 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.739
 little while you can see it I'm going to 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.540
 go commenting little and I'll say 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.000
 the things that they announced in the 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.670
 conference one of the main things 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.709
 is that the game will only be for 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.660
 xbox one and ps temporarily 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.540
 temporarily because in the future the 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.099
 best saga for playstation 4 do not know 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.870
 if you are going to leave for what is the 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.510
 old generation consoles if it's 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.709
 for 360 or for play 3 I think it does 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.720
 to leave but for the moment what 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.660
 announced only for the new 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.930
 generation as I repeat then the game 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.190
 will come out later for the platform 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.790
 play station at the moment will come out 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.349
 for xbox one 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.270
 and they see that they have exclusivity 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.000
 momentarily 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.140
 and another thing that I wanted to tell you is that 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.490
 they also announced that all 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.800
 characters that we had in meats 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.050
 warfare we can not use them 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.570
 garden whatever 2 so everything 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.370
 have in the other game in the 360 ​​what 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.220
 can transfer in the new generation 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.810
 and well here we see here here 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.610
 things changed because because there 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.300
 some operations of gardens and we do not see 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.550
 which is how to protect the grave the factory 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.350
 more than anything instead of being plants we are 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.450
 zombies and we have to defend ourselves from the 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.230
 plants that destroy us the grave I 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.970
 I think rather I do not think so we see what 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.040
 which is the character of the dwarf 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.050
 has a little life has a 75 of 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.340
 life the truth is very low your life is 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.680
 with the doctor but causes harm 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.300
 incredible the truth now they will see it 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.790
 in the gameplay your skills all the 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.190
 thing the truth struck me the dwarf there 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.040
 that know how to use it because it has very 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.840
 low life but great power those are 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.950
 the new plants that we see I do not know that 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.950
 they are like herbs 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.310
 I think they are tender lettuce 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.710
 they elaborate in all good way another 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.419
 which is also something important is 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.449
 that we will finally be able to play the 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.430
 multiplayer on split screen which 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.050
 it was not in cardinal was one in which 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.460
 we could play on life screen but 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.199
 only garden operations not 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.360
 we can put multiplayer that's it 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.220
 to announce that if it's going to be we're going 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.250
 to be able to play multiplayer on screen 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.250
 divided and we will also be able to play 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.310
 what is alone as always another 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.280
 What I have been told is that 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.599
 contents to said clearly that the 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.180
 contents the times are going to be 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:02.599
 free as in his old saga go to 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.090
 be totally free that I loved 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.520
 I really would not like it too 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.340
 they said knox where they will be going 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.050
 to have a cost everything will be free 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.060
 like the old garden golf and well 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.469
 here we see another one of the zombies that is the 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.840
 pirate we saw what is the superhero 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:20.680
 formerly now is the pirate one of 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.500
 his skills that I exploited the whole thing 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.199
 and I really love the gameplay other 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.630
 thing more I can say is that they 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:31.360
 I can repeat more is the only thing 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.340
 specifically announcement of the game 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.590
 the truth struck me very much I liked it 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.090
 much is this way I hope that too 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.560
 is lane operations is what 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.880
 have also changed for this one that is 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.880
 in the two blocks operations of 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.460
 gardens and this new way I would love 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.259
 and more than anything I would also like that 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.560
 there was a campaign type but it's good 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.580
 a lot of asking no but well let's see him 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.410
 here another of his skills that I 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.729
 impact of the dwarf is that you can call 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:01.180
 to your robot and have an amazing life 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:05.050
 400 of life and a year enough to see 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.360
 wow it has a shocking damage otherwise 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.699
 What could I say to you is that as you 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.100
 I say it's going to come out in the spring and I think 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:14.380
 that will come out by March or February as 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.280
 the shelter that came out of these 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.830
 dates as you know 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.930
 for xbox momentarily I do not know if for 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.350
 360 also only the function for 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.630
 what is the xbox wii and pc 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.550
 playstation 4 if announced but 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.050
 If I'm not mistaken they said it was going to be 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.910
 a little longer for playstation 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.280
 Well, let's continue to see the 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.800
 gameplay see the robot has a great 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.500
 damage and here they made graveyard 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.830
 destroyed besides only they raised 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.420
 destroyed 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.340
 here you have to join him because 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.750
 they destroyed things there I do not know what 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.930
 we have to do because they see that in 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.910
 operations said the cemetery and 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.360
 we lost the round here they go destroyed 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.759
 what is 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.080
 what is the grave and we have to 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:00.050
 run away 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.280
 see I do not know how this mode goes 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.280
 game but I really loved it 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.750
 also the plants as I say are four 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.340
 types of plants and four types of 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.900
 zombies announce that they are four but by 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.000
 the moment I see three that is what 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.740
 will feel is the dwarf and the super event 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.860
 of the plants then what is a 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:21.969

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.399
 and also what is 

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:27.159
 corn with submachine gun and what is the 

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:30.039

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:32.049
 that you liked me loved it 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:34.749
 I have the great hopes of the game 

00:07:32.049 --> 00:07:36.849

00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:56.319
 Well, no more need to see a little more 

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:57.519
 gameplay to see how the wave of the 

00:07:56.319 --> 00:08:00.549

 multigames if they have something new the mode 

00:08:00.549 --> 00:08:05.199
 2 new that we saw then they see that it is new 

00:08:02.409 --> 00:08:06.759
 clear but I do not know if they are going to 

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:08.979
 add new game modes or the 

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:10.869
 new ways that were in the carmen or 

00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:12.639
