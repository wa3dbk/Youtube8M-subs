okay<00:00:01.530> so<00:00:01.589> once<00:00:01.860> you've<00:00:01.979> fitted<00:00:02.159> your

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
okay so once you've fitted your

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.770 
okay so once you've fitted your
electronic<00:00:02.909> ignition<00:00:03.090> module<00:00:03.510> into<00:00:03.750> the

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
electronic ignition module into the

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.079 
electronic ignition module into the
distributor<00:00:04.350> you<00:00:05.040> might<00:00:05.220> care<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.520> test<00:00:05.879> it

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
distributor you might care to test it

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.280 
distributor you might care to test it
before<00:00:06.180> you<00:00:06.420> put<00:00:06.569> it<00:00:06.690> in<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.810> car<00:00:07.020> so<00:00:07.200> I'm

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
before you put it in the car so I'm

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.660 
before you put it in the car so I'm
going<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.589> show<00:00:07.770> you<00:00:07.830> how<00:00:08.010> you<00:00:08.069> can<00:00:08.280> just<00:00:08.519> build

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
going to show you how you can just build

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.240 
going to show you how you can just build
a<00:00:08.880> very<00:00:09.030> simple<00:00:09.360> rig<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:10.349> test<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.830> with<00:00:11.190> a

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
a very simple rig to test it with a

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.580 
a very simple rig to test it with a
couple<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.700> spare<00:00:12.080> bits<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.259> pieces<00:00:13.440> you

the positive side of the battery
positive<00:00:41.100> side<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:43.110> need<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.410> connect<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
positive side you need to connect the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.959 
positive side you need to connect the
negative<00:00:45.030> side<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> coil<00:00:46.730> that's<00:00:47.730> going

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
negative side of the coil that's going

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.790 
negative side of the coil that's going
to<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.120> your<00:00:48.239> earth<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.379> need<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.620> earth

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
to be your earth you just need to earth

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.369 
to be your earth you just need to earth
that<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.820> your<00:00:50.940> voice<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.960> I'm<00:00:52.050> just<00:00:52.170> going

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
that on to your voice so I'm just going

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.590 
that on to your voice so I'm just going
to<00:00:52.410> clip<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:56.210> you<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:57.390> need<00:00:57.570> to

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
to clip that on there you then need to

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.220 
to clip that on there you then need to
connect<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.350> HT<00:00:58.949> lead<00:00:59.989> put<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.199> your

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
connect the HT lead put that in your

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.549 
connect the HT lead put that in your
coil<00:01:02.120> then<00:01:03.120> connect<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.960> your<00:01:04.140> spark

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
coil then connect that to your spark

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.719 
coil then connect that to your spark
plug<00:01:06.619> just<00:01:07.619> put<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> voice<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.549> so

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
plug just put on the voice like that so

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.310 
plug just put on the voice like that so
you<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.939> see<00:01:09.090> an<00:01:09.210> awkward<00:01:09.479> spot<00:01:09.689> practiced<00:01:10.200> on

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
you can see an awkward spot practiced on

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.750 
you can see an awkward spot practiced on
there<00:01:10.470> which<00:01:10.560> means<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> spark

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
there which means going to see the spark

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.000 
there which means going to see the spark
better<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.990> can't<00:01:13.200> just<00:01:13.350> use<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> spark

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
better but you can't just use the spark

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.890 
better but you can't just use the spark
plug<00:01:14.840> okay<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:16.170> basically<00:01:17.630> your<00:01:18.630> ignition

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
plug okay that's basically your ignition

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.160 
plug okay that's basically your ignition
circuit<00:01:20.299> you<00:01:21.299> then<00:01:21.479> need<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> connect<00:01:22.049> your

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
circuit you then need to connect your

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.580 
circuit you then need to connect your
distributor<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> coil<00:01:24.229> so<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.350> need<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
distributor to the coil so we need a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.590 
distributor to the coil so we need a
couple<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.979> was<00:01:26.340> I'm<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.479> use

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
couple of was I'm just going to use

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.609 
couple of was I'm just going to use
crocodile<00:01:28.170> clips<00:01:29.090> okay<00:01:32.090> that's<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> positive

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
crocodile clips okay that's the positive

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.010 
crocodile clips okay that's the positive
that's<00:01:34.619> would<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:34.860> your<00:01:35.189> negative<00:01:35.850> side<00:01:37.460> black

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
that's would be your negative side black

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.679 
that's would be your negative side black
positive<00:01:40.020> side<00:01:40.259> red<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:42.240> then<00:01:42.329> all<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.540> need

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
positive side red and then all you need

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.630 
positive side red and then all you need
to<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:42.930> then<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.740> earth<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
to do then is just to earth the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.480 
to do then is just to earth the
distributor<00:01:45.920> we'll<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.100> put<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.310> on

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
distributor we'll just put that on

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.710 
distributor we'll just put that on
somewhere<00:01:49.820> I'll<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.000> connect<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.450> there

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
somewhere I'll just connect that there

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.969 
somewhere I'll just connect that there
like<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:54.600> now<00:01:54.960> hopefully<00:01:55.200> when<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.680> turn

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
like that and now hopefully when I turn

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.700 
like that and now hopefully when I turn
that<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:57.780> should<00:01:58.020> turn<00:01:58.229> I'll<00:01:58.439> point<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
that you should turn I'll point the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.690 
that you should turn I'll point the
spark<00:01:58.950> plug<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.240> see<00:02:00.420> that

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
spark plug so can you see that

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.600 
spark plug so can you see that
now<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> distributor<00:02:03.360> isn't<00:02:04.140> doing<00:02:04.380> that

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
now if the distributor isn't doing that

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.590 
now if the distributor isn't doing that
of<00:02:05.610> course<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.969> could<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.390> there's<00:02:06.540> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
of course it could be that there's a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.210 
of course it could be that there's a
problem<00:02:07.020> or<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.619> have<00:02:07.740> wired<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.129> up

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
problem or that you have wired it up

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.820 
problem or that you have wired it up
correctly<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.569> way<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.590> test

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
correctly so the way to just to test

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.790 
correctly so the way to just to test
that<00:02:11.099> it's<00:02:11.370> just

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
that it's just

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.460 
that it's just
take<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.400> negative<00:02:13.090> side<00:02:13.360> of<00:02:13.780> the

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
take the negative side of the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.990 
take the negative side of the
distillation<00:02:15.070> just<00:02:15.520> disconnect<00:02:15.940> the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
distillation just disconnect the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.660 
distillation just disconnect the
distributor<00:02:16.510> completely<00:02:17.100> take<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.220> negative

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
distributor completely take the negative

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.330 
distributor completely take the negative
side<00:02:18.910> just<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.690> clean<00:02:19.870> orders<00:02:20.250> take<00:02:21.250> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
side just to clean orders take the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.100 
side just to clean orders take the
negative<00:02:21.670> side<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.240> coil<00:02:22.570> I<00:02:22.750> just<00:02:22.930> touch

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
negative side of the coil I just touch

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.800 
negative side of the coil I just touch
that<00:02:23.320> since<00:02:23.530> pipe<00:02:23.740> flow<00:02:24.510> won't<00:02:25.510> be<00:02:25.630> very

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
that since pipe flow won't be very

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.120 
that since pipe flow won't be very
strong<00:02:26.050> spark<00:02:26.380> but<00:02:26.560> if<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.770> can<00:02:26.890> see<00:02:27.010> there

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
strong spark but if you can see there

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.550 
strong spark but if you can see there
every<00:02:27.310> time<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.550> touch<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:27.760> on<00:02:28.060> there<00:02:28.560> it

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
every time I touch that on there it

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.950 
every time I touch that on there it
sparks<00:02:30.160> so<00:02:31.090> basically<00:02:31.390> all<00:02:31.480> we've<00:02:31.630> got<00:02:31.780> is<00:02:31.930> a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
sparks so basically all we've got is a

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.550 
sparks so basically all we've got is a
wire<00:02:32.230> going<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:33.340> coil<00:02:33.900> positive<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.470> the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
wire going to the coil positive to the

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.680 
wire going to the coil positive to the
positive<00:02:35.590> side<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.190> battery<00:02:36.690> negative

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
positive side of the battery negative

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.960 
positive side of the battery negative
side<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.930> battery<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:39.400> our<00:02:39.580> earth<00:02:39.760> on<00:02:39.910> the

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
side of the battery to our earth on the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.710 
side of the battery to our earth on the
sparkplug<00:02:40.480> type<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.800> earth<00:02:42.450> small<00:02:43.450> plug

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
sparkplug type that to earth small plug

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.760 
sparkplug type that to earth small plug
so<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.320> small<00:02:44.920> spark<00:02:46.170> I'm<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.440> going<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.620> put

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
so a small spark I'm just going to put

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.110 
so a small spark I'm just going to put
that<00:02:47.800> back<00:02:47.890> quickly<00:02:48.280> again<00:02:48.610> just<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.910> show<00:02:49.060> you

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
that back quickly again just to show you

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.710 
that back quickly again just to show you
how<00:02:49.270> that<00:02:49.450> works

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
how that works

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.060 
how that works
okay<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:49.960> just<00:02:50.140> connect<00:02:52.740> negative<00:02:53.740> side<00:02:53.950> of

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
okay so just connect negative side of

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.660 
okay so just connect negative side of
the<00:02:54.130> coil<00:02:55.080> black<00:02:56.080> wire<00:02:56.290> distributor<00:02:57.690> red<00:02:58.690> wire

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
the coil black wire distributor red wire

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.910 
the coil black wire distributor red wire
positive<00:03:00.670> size<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:02.320> then<00:03:02.410> we<00:03:02.500> just<00:03:02.650> need<00:03:02.710> to

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
positive size and then we just need to

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.960 
positive size and then we just need to
earth<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:03.490> distributor<00:03:05.460> just<00:03:06.460> put<00:03:06.640> on<00:03:06.760> there

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
earth the distributor just put on there

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.080 
earth the distributor just put on there
somewhere<00:03:07.890> this<00:03:08.890> has<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.160> turning<00:03:09.640> on<00:03:09.730> just<00:03:09.940> a

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
somewhere this has a turning on just a

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.120 
somewhere this has a turning on just a
hand<00:03:10.330> speed<00:03:11.160> here<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.340> direction<00:03:14.040> creates<00:03:15.040> a

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
hand speed here the direction creates a

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.670 
hand speed here the direction creates a
spark<00:03:15.400> so<00:03:15.880> we<00:03:15.970> know<00:03:16.090> that's<00:03:16.270> now<00:03:16.510> working<00:03:16.989> and

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
spark so we know that's now working and

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.680 
spark so we know that's now working and
now<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.070> can<00:03:18.280> going<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.520> proceed<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.480> put

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
now you can going to proceed and put

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.260 
now you can going to proceed and put
that<00:03:19.840> in<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.050> car
