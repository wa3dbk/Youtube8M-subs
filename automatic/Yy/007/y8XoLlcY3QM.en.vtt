00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.240
 greetings s labors and point today we are going to 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.180
 learn to make a fantasy point to 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.590
 that I put 20 points on the needle is 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.619
 multiple of 3 plus 2 you have to repeat 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.750
 from the first to the fourth pass 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.260
 every time so that our 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.190
 drawing 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.790
 the first pass will be this way 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.830
 we make a point of right and we take 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.630
 wander 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.630
 another point of right 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.680
 and we take vague 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.500
 we have to do this until the end 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.500
 of the points 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.610
 we take low 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:02.650
 right point we take low 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:06.430
 we do right point and now it 's 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.790
 a normal right point without catching 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.790
 wander 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.340
 Now we do the following 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.980
 the first point we do the right and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.210
 then we are going to take out the first three 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:24.390
 points together with the vague to fix first 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.140
 point sack the drool 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.690
 second point I take out the vague and third 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.860
 dot took the wander now step 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.690
 the three wool 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.390
 to the needle on the left 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.950
 and now let's take the three together and 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.950
 let's make a point of right 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.490
 You see how I took the three points 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.180
 and now 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.990
 I'm going to weave a point of right but without 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.930
 remove the stitches from the left needle 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.140
 I'm going to take a vague and I'll pass another 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.100
 time 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.810
 taking again the three wool I'm going to 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.810
 knit another right point 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.180
 and if you notice this is the first point 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.250
 what have I done then I have three wool in 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.810
 the needle on the right and now is when 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.510
 I take out the stitches on the needle of the 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.970
 left now we have to do 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.170
 exactly the same thing that we have done with 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.170
 the rest of the points 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.689
 a vague we take it out another vague we take it out 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.510
 and the other vague we took it out and the three 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:42.340
 points that we have taken with the needle 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.340
 we went to the left needle 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.390
 I stretch them to have more space between 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.390
 stockings to catch them 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.050
 and very carefully 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.280
 I take them to make a smooth point 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.620
 we pass the vague and again we do what 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.620
 same 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.680
 and we let them go 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.590
 and now we do the same with the three 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.650
 last points one point two points and 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.290
 three points 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.290
 we pass them to the needle on the left 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.220
 we weave the three points together 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.840
 we make a point of right 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.470
 we passed again and the wool over 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.900
 we make another point of law and what 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.500
 we take out and now the last point that we 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.080
 weaves of right 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.720
 the next pass we have to do 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.230
 each and every one of the points of 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.230
 straight 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.330
 and the next one we have to do another 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.330
 once all the right points 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.560
 Now we would have to start again 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.889
 as the first pass 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.419
 this is how our fantasy point is 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.160
 this is the right and this is the reverse 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:02.960
 either of the two points can 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.960
 serve to do our work 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.470
 I hope you liked it if it's like that 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.690
