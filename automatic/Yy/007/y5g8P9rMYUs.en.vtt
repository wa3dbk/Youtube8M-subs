00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the paddle of the brush and it's kind of

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.840 
the paddle of the brush and it's kind of
hard<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.649> once<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.219> started<00:00:53.640> is

easier so this is the paddle and here's
the<00:00:58.590> rubber<00:00:58.829> base<00:00:59.809> so<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.870> take<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.559> roll<00:01:02.250> of

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
the rubber base so you take a roll of

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.210 
the rubber base so you take a roll of
teeth<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:03.840> simply<00:01:04.199> pull<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.890> from

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
teeth and you just simply pull it from

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.440 
teeth and you just simply pull it from
the<00:01:05.280> base<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:07.170> comes<00:01:07.440> out<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.100> that

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.240 

so<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:12.720> remove<00:01:13.020> how<00:01:13.290> many<00:01:13.560> teeth<00:01:13.950> you
