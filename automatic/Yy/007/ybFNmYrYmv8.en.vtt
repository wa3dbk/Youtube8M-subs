that's honestly one of the dumbest
decisions<00:01:43.619> I've<00:01:43.770> i<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:44.430> compare<00:01:44.850> let's<00:01:45.149> see

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
decisions I've i can compare let's see

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.440 
decisions I've i can compare let's see
what<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.600> compare<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.939> switching<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
what can I compare that to switching the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.690 
what can I compare that to switching the

i usually run straight down the middle I

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.199 
i usually run straight down the middle I
lay<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.340> claim<00:02:44.580> mark<00:02:44.790> because<00:02:44.880> they<00:02:45.060> usually

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
lay that claim mark because they usually

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.570 
lay that claim mark because they usually
almost<00:02:45.510> always<00:02:45.930> go<00:02:46.080> in<00:02:46.230> there<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.560> then<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.190> I

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
almost always go in there and then I I

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.180 
almost always go in there and then I I
set<00:02:48.390> up<00:02:48.540> for<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.110> little<00:02:49.260> bit<00:02:49.410> see<00:02:49.739> if<00:02:49.770> they<00:02:49.980> push
