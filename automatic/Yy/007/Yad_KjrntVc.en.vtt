00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.170
 new possibilities for all humanitas care 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.730
 cancer center thanks to truebeam 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.680
 an extremely equipment 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.960
 innovative that is equipped with a scalpel 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.970
 virtual is particularly suitable 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.770
 brain cancer humanitas cancer 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.660
 center is the first center in Italy 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.520
 have a linear accelerator of 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.500
 latest generation that allows you to 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.830
 treat with sub-millimeter precision 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.230
 brain tumors or robotic couch 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.279
 which can move in six dimensions 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.439
 forward back to top down 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.210
 tilting and tilting gets a 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.340
 ultra precise positioning of the 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.559
 patient for extremely treatments 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.600
 targeted when we have a tumor that 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.570
 it is very close to the optic nerves or to 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.729
 plasma if we don't have a system of 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.769
 sub-millimeter precision we must 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:50.080
 lower the doses then give doses that 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.430
 they could be more ineffective if 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.559
 instead we have a system of 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.229
 correct positioning we can give 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.390
 a dose appropriate to the tumor even when 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.680
 the distance of the critical organ and of 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.839
 very few millimeters 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.400
 not just brain tumors for which 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.229
 very high precision is required 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.670
 not to damage healthy tissues 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.290
 surrounding 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.600
 truebeam results particularly 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.240
 also effective for liver tumors 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.359
 pancreas and prostate this system 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.189
 allows us to be precise even where 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.109
 there is an organ movement for example 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.100
 where is the breath then for the tumors 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:23.350
 of the lung 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.750
 or where there is rectal movement a 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.539
 Prostate level an approach now 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.100
 no longer just neurosurgical but 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.359
 multidisciplinary and combined with everything 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.469
 benefit of patients 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:37.990
 certainly the fact to insert 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.630
 this type of treatment in the field 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.960
 of a group in which the medical oncologist 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.070
 together with the surgeon we are radiotherapist 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.740
 become aware of the disease of 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.219
 patient and treat it jointly a 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.960
 something that generates a benefit e 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.329
 cultural and technical in therapeutic 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.490
 extraordinary when the patient enters 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.359
 within the cancer center comes 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.369
 taken in charge by various figures each 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:06.490
 of which carries one of its own 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.380
 skills and this allows you to 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.810
 choose in relation to the story 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.830
 clinic the best treatment in the 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.380
 best time 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.090
 against bin humanity printed in more towards 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.610
 the future and strengthens the oncological area 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.920
 national reference point for 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.710
 thousands of patients a surgery 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.350
 less and less demoliva of treatments 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.820
 less and less toxic doctors than 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.000
 treatment of various cancers 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.320
 allows us to combine in comparison 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.020
 our patients what is a 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.460
 goal of humanitas sings hear is it 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.010
 that of giving the best care 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.330
 possible with respecting the maximum 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.330
 quality of life of our patients
