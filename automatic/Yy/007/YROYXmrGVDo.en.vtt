and I really wouldn't be making an issue
out<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.520> most<00:00:41.670> important<00:00:42.120> thing

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
out of it and the most important thing

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.880 
out of it and the most important thing
is<00:00:42.300> if<00:00:42.420> she<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.660> doing<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.020> poo<00:00:43.170> into<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.590> nappy
