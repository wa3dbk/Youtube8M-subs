00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
here's another view at the bank of the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.810 
here's another view at the bank of the
copy<00:01:21.050> here<00:01:21.320> now<00:01:21.409> apologize<00:01:21.890> for<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.220> quality

copy here now apologize for the quality

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.880 
copy here now apologize for the quality
of<00:01:23.120> the<00:01:23.240> video<00:01:23.510> sometimes<00:01:24.170> we<00:01:24.380> get<00:01:24.500> a<00:01:24.560> few

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
of the video sometimes we get a few

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.190 
of the video sometimes we get a few
encoding<00:01:25.520> artifacts<00:01:26.000> here<00:01:26.270> that's<00:01:26.840> simply

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
encoding artifacts here that's simply

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.010 
encoding artifacts here that's simply
down<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.650> way<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:27.920> have<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:28.550> capture<00:01:28.880> on<00:01:29.390> the

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
down to the way I have to capture on the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.660 
down to the way I have to capture on the
oculus<00:01:30.290> rift<00:01:30.830> sometimes<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:31.340> comes<00:01:31.460> out

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
oculus rift sometimes it comes out

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.910 
oculus rift sometimes it comes out
really<00:01:32.000> good<00:01:32.240> other<00:01:32.750> times<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.409> not<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:33.710> good

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
really good other times and not so good

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.250 
really good other times and not so good
it<00:01:34.100> really<00:01:34.520> is<00:01:34.729> very<00:01:34.760> much<00:01:35.300> down<00:01:35.510> to<00:01:35.750> lighting

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
it really is very much down to lighting

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.440 
it really is very much down to lighting
issues<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:36.710> this<00:01:37.100> is<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.340> fairly<00:01:37.640> dark<00:01:37.880> area<00:01:38.330> of

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
issues and this is a fairly dark area of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.510 
issues and this is a fairly dark area of
space<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.050> there's<00:01:39.229> bra<00:01:39.800> no<00:01:39.860> means<00:01:40.190> much

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
space and there's bra no means much

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.490 
space and there's bra no means much
light<00:01:40.850> inside<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.870> cockpit<00:01:42.620> here<00:01:43.210> but<00:01:44.210> yet

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
light inside the cockpit here but yet

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.180 
light inside the cockpit here but yet
absolutely<00:01:45.500> nice<00:01:46.130> ship<00:01:46.400> to<00:01:46.729> fly<00:01:46.760> in<00:01:47.270> VR<00:01:47.659> I

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
absolutely nice ship to fly in VR I

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.440 
absolutely nice ship to fly in VR I
don't<00:01:49.190> think<00:01:49.400> it'd<00:01:49.549> be<00:01:49.580> wrong<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.030> say<00:01:50.420> that

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
don't think it'd be wrong to say that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.539 
don't think it'd be wrong to say that
this<00:01:50.930> actually<00:01:51.320> feels<00:01:51.740> like<00:01:52.040> a<00:01:52.070> slightly

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
this actually feels like a slightly

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.210 
this actually feels like a slightly
larger<00:01:53.360> version<00:01:53.990> of<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.110> Eagle<00:01:54.590> when<00:01:54.830> sitting

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
larger version of the Eagle when sitting

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.050 
larger version of the Eagle when sitting
inside<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.760> cockpit<00:01:56.150> here<00:01:57.549> so<00:01:58.549> there<00:01:58.880> we<00:01:59.030> have

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
inside the cockpit here so there we have

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.300 
inside the cockpit here so there we have
it<00:01:59.299> that's<00:01:59.630> another<00:01:59.930> VR<00:02:00.350> video<00:02:00.650> a<00:02:00.740> little<00:02:01.070> bit
