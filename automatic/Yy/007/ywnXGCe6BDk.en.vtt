very easily pulling off two open strings
we'll<00:00:52.300> be<00:00:52.420> using<00:00:52.540> an<00:00:52.780> f-sharp<00:00:53.020> minor<00:00:53.470> cord<00:00:53.860> as

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
we'll be using an f-sharp minor cord as

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.220 
we'll be using an f-sharp minor cord as
well<00:00:54.160> that<00:00:54.340> we<00:00:54.400> already<00:00:54.550> looked<00:00:54.700> at

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
well that we already looked at

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.660 
well that we already looked at
and<00:00:56.320> a<00:00:56.980> major

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
and a major

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.549 
and a major
and<00:00:59.059> of<00:00:59.300> course<00:00:59.480> you<00:00:59.600> can<00:00:59.720> see<00:01:00.140> on<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.350> tab

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
and of course you can see on the tab

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.549 
and of course you can see on the tab
where<00:01:00.890> these<00:01:01.670> are<00:01:01.960> producing<00:01:02.960> other<00:01:03.110> chords

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
where these are producing other chords

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.020 
where these are producing other chords
by<00:01:03.710> adding<00:01:04.010> those<00:01:04.129> drones<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:04.909> we

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
by adding those drones and so we

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.090 
by adding those drones and so we
actually<00:01:05.150> have<00:01:05.449> like<00:01:05.600> an<00:01:05.750> F<00:01:05.930> sharp<00:01:05.960> minor<00:01:06.620> 11

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
actually have like an F sharp minor 11

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.390 
actually have like an F sharp minor 11
and<00:01:07.369> a<00:01:07.670> major<00:01:08.000> 9<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:09.020> on<00:01:09.470> this<00:01:09.619> b<00:01:09.890> chord<00:01:10.250> which

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
and a major 9 and on this b chord which

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.920 
and a major 9 and on this b chord which
is<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.670> v<00:01:10.940> there's<00:01:11.390> kind<00:01:11.570> of<00:01:11.600> an<00:01:11.720> interesting

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
is the v there's kind of an interesting

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.999 
is the v there's kind of an interesting
thing<00:01:12.260> happening<00:01:12.710> on<00:01:12.800> this<00:01:12.950> dominant<00:01:13.760> 5<00:01:14.060> chord

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
thing happening on this dominant 5 chord

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.590 
thing happening on this dominant 5 chord
where<00:01:16.009> this<00:01:16.160> 5th<00:01:16.520> string<00:01:16.729> normally<00:01:17.060> rings<00:01:17.360> as

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
where this 5th string normally rings as

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.270 
where this 5th string normally rings as
an<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.900> it's<00:01:18.140> now<00:01:18.259> ringing<00:01:18.590> as<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.740> be<00:01:19.009> in<00:01:19.160> this

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
an a it's now ringing as a be in this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.490 
an a it's now ringing as a be in this
tuning<00:01:19.670> well<00:01:20.270> that's<00:01:20.420> enabling<00:01:20.930> us<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.200> do<00:01:21.470> a

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
tuning well that's enabling us to do a

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.280 
tuning well that's enabling us to do a
small-scale<00:01:22.340> run<00:01:22.970> while<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:23.840> bass<00:01:24.020> notes

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
small-scale run while the bass notes

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.990 
small-scale run while the bass notes
ringing<00:01:24.500> underneath<00:01:24.920> without<00:01:25.130> having<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.759> do

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
ringing underneath without having to do

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.270 
ringing underneath without having to do
a<00:01:26.030> barre<00:01:26.300> chord<00:01:26.330> or<00:01:26.869> actually<00:01:27.680> fret<00:01:27.920> that<00:01:28.070> bass

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
a barre chord or actually fret that bass

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.340 
a barre chord or actually fret that bass
note

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.569 

so<00:01:32.350> that's<00:01:32.469> able<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:32.829> bring<00:01:32.979> underneath<00:01:33.340> very

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
so that's able to bring underneath very

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.760 
so that's able to bring underneath very
easily

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.640 

we're<00:01:37.770> also<00:01:38.510> playing<00:01:39.510> a<00:01:39.750> c-sharp<00:01:40.530> minor<00:01:41.490> chord

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.100 

and<00:01:45.490> you'll<00:01:46.180> just<00:01:46.240> know<00:01:46.510> you'll<00:01:46.660> notice<00:01:46.870> a<00:01:46.960> lot

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
and you'll just know you'll notice a lot

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.990 
and you'll just know you'll notice a lot
of<00:01:47.140> little<00:01:47.440> embellishments<00:01:48.130> some

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
of little embellishments some

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.640 
of little embellishments some
arpeggiation<00:01:49.690> and<00:01:50.080> hammer-ons<00:01:50.470> and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
arpeggiation and hammer-ons and

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.680 
arpeggiation and hammer-ons and
pull-offs<00:01:50.740> as<00:01:51.130> we<00:01:51.250> go<00:01:51.370> through<00:01:51.550> here<00:01:51.730> so<00:01:52.480> we'll

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
pull-offs as we go through here so we'll

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:19.280 
pull-offs as we go through here so we'll
give<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.870> a<00:01:52.960> try
