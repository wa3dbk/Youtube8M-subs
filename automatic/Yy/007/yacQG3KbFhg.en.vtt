00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
well I figured out an easier way which

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.970 
well I figured out an easier way which
involves<00:00:32.329> not<00:00:32.509> even<00:00:32.689> having<00:00:32.899> to<00:00:33.050> go<00:00:33.710> in<00:00:33.829> the

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
involves not even having to go in the

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:43.510 
involves not even having to go in the
pen

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520

you can actually if you have a and

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.500 
you can actually if you have a and
actually<00:00:46.460> became<00:00:46.670> moon<00:00:46.880> jump<00:00:47.090> for<00:00:47.360> low

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
actually became moon jump for low

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.730 
actually became moon jump for low
tape-record<00:00:48.140> Chi<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:50.290> so<00:00:51.290> you<00:00:51.350> don't<00:00:51.530> need<00:00:51.680> a
