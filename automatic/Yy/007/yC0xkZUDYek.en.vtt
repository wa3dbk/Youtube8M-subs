00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.650
 Apple has it last year 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.020
 imprinted the fingerprint sensor or 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.880
 also touch id works really well 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.070
 but has a few security concerns 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.139
 the whole thing now has samsung with the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.299
 galaxy s 5 also implemented and why that 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.920
 maybe not so good at the moment 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.119
 Contrary to what apple has brought 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.369
 I'll show you now 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.800
 and there we have the good piece 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.260
 Samsung Galaxy S 500 also burst 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.910
 golfball does not really look that way 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.580
 bad and has quite a few 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.109
 very nice features especially 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.480
 I find the fingerprint interesting 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.820
 sensor because it works amazing 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.410
 good if you just got caught here 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.000
 the topic is dashing and you are in 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.219
 the corresponding mode we go now 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.989
 here out of the energy saving mode 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.610
 because we need that for this video 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.840
 Not 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.270
 amazingly, this works 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.000
 Things really good in years 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.780
 predominantly in nine out of ten in eight of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.789
 ten fell and one has one has 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.289
 possibility to save three fingers 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.180
 I'll show you how it looks 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.710
 in the settings you have here 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.310
 all to make the boarding fast 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.990
 attitudes like to have the finance here 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.210
 her the possibility of three fingers in the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.210
 register fingerprint in manager 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.670
 you see is relatively good 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.460
 and here it has to be very short 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.210
 Let's take out all the triangle 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.040
 That's how you start in the smartphone 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.970
 row can now here a fingerprint 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.650
 to save 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.600
 let's take the index finger for that 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.930
 it for the fact that the device is and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.880
 sometimes wants to unlock briefly 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.310
 practically the fingers now I go though 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.960
 no just about it because had twice 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.830
 the fingers already pretty well recognized 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.790
 but I'm going a bit too 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:50.410
 diagonally over but with the side 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:54.400
 so far and here with so far with the 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:57.940
 side and normal again so diagonally with it 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.500
 he really recognizes everything well then you have 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.650
 especially in the middle of everything 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.670
 little very small error rate as a pin 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:11.200
 I give it now 1 2 4 5 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.270
 a normal and that's it if you are now 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.190
 So the phone must of course still the 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.100
 set up screen lock if now 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.320
 unlock the phone volt ranges 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.050
 actually about the home button and 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.989
 finished as I said in eight to nine of 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.830
 ten cases that works pretty well 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.690
 there is still a small trick 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.280
 if you can necessarily do lines 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.720
 want it with all your fingers 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.070
 works for whatever reason 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:42.489
 you can always finger every once 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:47.160
 wipe the middle finger of the 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.160
 rain fingers the little finger 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:55.870
 middle finger and again the little one 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.090
 finger is written that is under 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.100
 fingerprint 2 is now almost my 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.570
 So this complete hand to a memory 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.480
 Fingerpuppen time in the own finger 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.880
 completely and some are larger the 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.420
 here we test the other fingers in there 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:18.030
 there are now times are very small 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:24.850
 finger detected lock again 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:26.049
 ringfinger recognized you see so there 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.690
 By the way, you are the same 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.700
 trick as with the colleagues of apple has 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.200
 that's the same for every footprint 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.420
 several fingers actually use 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.260
 The system recognizes pretty well when and where 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.360
 which finger starts a thing there 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.709
 but it still leaves me a bit because 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.269
 i also know how to keep stefan happy 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.410
 should 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.940
 if you now thumb her 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.919
 goes over so relaxed so yes 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:56.200
 to be predominantly his finger 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:57.730
 smartphone with my thumbs when I do that 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.400
 so oblique make the phone lock 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.660
 and then want to unlock goes as 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.370
 Generally pretty good actually 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.359
 faster space sits other places can 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.299
 I do not say but I have it too 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:12.760
 freshly decorated the problem is that 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.680
 phone has another heavy on 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.859
 another focus but not 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.750
 that does not detract from it so it resonated 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.810
 less often smoke press unlock 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.669
 and all with one hand make it 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.419
 it works but it is not so 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:30.760
 Practically how and unfortunately I have to 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.530
 say like in the competition of apple 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.120
 the guys have it 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.750
 perfected and already with the 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.040
 first with the first generation 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.990
 tacchelli this is this button here 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.050
 Below this is a circle a homebutton 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:49.350
 lifts up once and that's why 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:52.180
 unlocked again press on it 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:57.130
 unlocked and that works correctly 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:59.889
 good forefinger will not press 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.630
 With it shut off ok-power 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.350
 middle finger I do not have now 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.570
 imprinted on spinning this 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.520
 ding recognizes really well when 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.410
 a finger on it is and which 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.849
 finger is wet and, above all, unlocked 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.860
 replaced 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.779
 you would not have this whole thing now 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.629
 all this kladderadatsch this 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:20.039
 other animations other then would be 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.659
 actually faster than at 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.289
 Answer and I like that a bit 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:28.259
 too bad this thing is in september 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:30.449
 Come out in 2013 and be part of it here 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:34.229
 april 2014 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.479
 So the question is what's the point 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:39.889
 but it is not otherwise this eighth 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:43.979
 Compare again was for a cause 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:47.009
 this button is not much bigger he 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.089
 is bigger yes some do not use 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.639
 so can see right now 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:52.649
 this home button is larger though 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.849
 not as wide as this button that 

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:59.369
 Actually, samsung could mean that 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.110
 what you do not get out of the height 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:02.999
 can set the width by the 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.399
 really pushes ladies and then more 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:08.099
 from perceiving more of the structure 

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:10.709
 so why does it have to be this way? 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:13.740
 To put a pity because 

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:14.639
 every time I perform, I think 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.930
 Why can not you do it that way ? 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:19.139
 lock away why do I have to first now 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.969
 after over vision that it works 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.069
 is a very different matter but why 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:25.559
 This is about vision at the moment 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:28.469
 again just a bauble as well 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:30.800
 This heart rate frequency knife though 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:33.090
 that is very different 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.590
 so much for it 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.180
 yes that is a pity if the 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.470
 competition from apple that good 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.750
 you want to get that done with us 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.960
 of course, have just as good and samsung 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.970
 has implemented that with the s5 network but 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.880
 for the time you had from april 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.740
 this is easy until december 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.300
 no perfect implementation is not 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.610
 works as I said in nine out of ten 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.080
 make it but must make the same 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.729
 how the system has prevailed so 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.320
 always from top to bottom with a 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.970
 certain speed over vision 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.210
 this is already possible after the first day 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.840
 completely in it is not an issue 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:08.400
 even if I am not here now 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.610
 agrees so close now but I say 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.430
 but 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.320
 but it is somehow in the moment 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.060
 just a gimmick if you have more 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.680
 Information about the toy here 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.150
 have a look then click here 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.800
 through our playlist that the samsung 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.690
 galaxy s 5 playlist but also gameplay 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.760
 benchmark somewhere also a test 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.830
 hidden unboxing and other 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.710
 used and here you have the only one 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.990
 real alternative to the htc 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.180
 samsung galaxy s 5 and the htc 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.650
 There is also the test available 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.240
 So all the playlists here 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.520
 if you have the device impression 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.780
 wanted to do and otherwise you will find 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.450
 in the description even more 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.280
 information and I also fish now 

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.419
 Incidentally , the game knows thumb after thumb 

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.310
 up and down if you liked it 

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:49.310
 and comments and now and now
