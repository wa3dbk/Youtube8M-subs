00:00:05.974 --> 00:00:08.116
 The reason I started working in the installation of the hurdles 

00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:12.681
 I had a horse with a problem with his feet. 

00:00:12.716 --> 00:00:14.776
 I found it difficult to paint it 

00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:16.536
 The hump that I wanted to ride for him. 

00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:19.320
 Gradually I searched for this training. 

00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:22.824
 It was difficult to accept training because I was a girl, 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.189
 This training was for young people. 

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:29.497
 But after convincing attempts and long training periods gradually entered the field, 

00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:31.986
 This was 30 years ago. 

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:39.142
 Sometimes the work is heavy, especially in winter. 

00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:43.659
 The atmosphere is cold, and there is a stream of air, which is a wasteful work of the body. 

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:49.315
 But a person needs to be careful to do more 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.422
 For just stand up and install hubs, 

00:00:51.457 --> 00:00:54.796
 For example riding, 

00:00:54.831 --> 00:01:00.421
 Exercising in some way, such as swimming, doing something different. 

00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:12.198
 To become blacksmith hooves I think you should 

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:16.845
 Be a lover of horses, and have a long experience with horses. 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.310
 Then the owner must be strong body, good physical condition. 

00:01:21.345 --> 00:01:27.058
 You must also have the ability to plan, 

00:01:27.093 --> 00:01:35.656
 And take responsibility to customers, attendance punctuality, and can take care of papers, 

00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:39.299
 You can do everything related to the work of a company owner. 

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:44.348
 Because in any case you are often ... the majority are the owners of companies. 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.662
 In this profession, you can do ... not just stand up for the hurdles, 

00:01:50.697 --> 00:01:52.368
 There are many ways you can work. 

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:57.945
 You can give lectures at some times as I do, as you can work globally, 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.708
 There are many who have gone around the world with their profession and worked there. 

00:02:01.743 --> 00:02:05.689
 There are also many ways of complementary studies. 

00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:15.566
 The best thing about this profession is that it allows you to work in something you see is very fun 

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.863
 For me it is horses, 

00:02:17.898 --> 00:02:21.439
 Which I think is ... in fact envelopes something in existence.
