so<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.759> think<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.299> horde<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.630> sign<00:02:06.869> you

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
so I think it's a horde of sign you

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.710

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
is basically the inner building tunnel

there's a security camera probably for

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.330 
there's a security camera probably for
the<00:02:19.230> ATM<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.850> that's<00:02:21.030> about<00:02:21.180> it
