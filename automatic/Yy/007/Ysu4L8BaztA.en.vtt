00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
means it's four counts per bar one two

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.229 
means it's four counts per bar one two
three<00:00:52.320> four<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.579> could<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:53.940> symbol

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
three four we could have that symbol

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.670 
three four we could have that symbol
that<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.809> means<00:00:54.989> you're<00:00:55.140> playing<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.469> one

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
chord for the whole bar so we go like

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.560 
chord for the whole bar so we go like
this

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
this

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.000

three okay it means you a play on the
one<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.439> two<00:01:19.650> because<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.400> half<00:01:20.640> which

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
one and two because it's a half which

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.730 
one and two because it's a half which
worth<00:01:21.360> half<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.750> box<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.229> half<00:01:22.409> minute

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
worth half the box it's a half minute

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.310 
worth half the box it's a half minute
and<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.670> three<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.180> four<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.170> was<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
and then the three and four if it was a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.260 
and then the three and four if it was a
quarter<00:01:25.830> note<00:01:25.950> how<00:01:26.400> many<00:01:26.580> quarters<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
quarter note how many quarters make a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.929 
quarter note how many quarters make a
hole<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:28.770> mean<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.579> two

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
hole for so we mean that on one two

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.060 
hole for so we mean that on one two
three<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.509> four<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.960> play<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> chord<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.829> every

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
three and four you play a chord on every

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.450 
three and four you play a chord on every
beat

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
beat

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.160 
beat
so<00:01:32.549> it'd<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.600> two<00:01:34.380> three<00:01:35.100> four

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.960 

so<00:01:39.170> we'll<00:01:39.320> be<00:01:39.409> on<00:01:39.530> every<00:01:39.979> cat<00:01:40.250> there<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.729> last

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
so we'll be on every cat there the last

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.910 
so we'll be on every cat there the last
thing<00:01:41.119> we<00:01:41.210> look<00:01:41.450> at<00:01:41.540> is<00:01:41.720> quavers<00:01:42.350> or<00:01:42.470> eighth

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
thing we look at is quavers or eighth

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.460 
thing we look at is quavers or eighth
notes<00:01:43.310> okay<00:01:43.700> now<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.030> need<00:01:44.210> eight<00:01:44.420> notes<00:01:44.869> in<00:01:45.259> a

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
notes okay now you need eight notes in a

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.010 
notes okay now you need eight notes in a
normal<00:01:45.860> bar<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:46.369> what<00:01:46.520> that<00:01:46.700> means<00:01:47.000> is<00:01:47.450> if<00:01:47.869> your

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
normal bar so what that means is if your

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.830 
normal bar so what that means is if your
foot<00:01:48.259> is<00:01:48.289> counting<00:01:48.770> down<00:01:48.799> its<00:01:49.189> going<00:01:49.399> one<00:01:49.840> two

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
foot is counting down its going one two

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.810 
foot is counting down its going one two
three<00:01:51.829> four<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:54.560> whenever<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.130> say<00:01:55.429> or<00:01:55.729> you

three four and whenever you say or you
hear<00:01:56.119> a<00:01:56.149> number<00:01:56.360> or<00:01:56.720> you<00:01:56.810> hear<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.080> click<00:01:57.350> on<00:01:57.439> the

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
hear a number or you hear a click on the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.350 
hear a number or you hear a click on the
metronome<00:01:57.860> that's<00:01:58.429> when<00:01:58.700> your<00:01:58.820> foot<00:01:59.000> hits<00:01:59.179> the

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
metronome that's when your foot hits the

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.569 
metronome that's when your foot hits the
ground<00:01:59.450> okay<00:02:00.200> when<00:02:00.860> your<00:02:01.009> foot<00:02:01.159> actually

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
ground okay when your foot actually

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.789 
ground okay when your foot actually
comes<00:02:01.909> up<00:02:02.270> that's<00:02:02.869> when<00:02:03.200> you're<00:02:03.350> halfway

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
comes up that's when you're halfway

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.179 
comes up that's when you're halfway
through<00:02:04.130> okay<00:02:04.939> so<00:02:05.450> it's<00:02:05.600> one<00:02:05.899> when<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:06.920> put<00:02:07.100> it

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
through okay so it's one when you put it

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.770 
through okay so it's one when you put it
to<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.340> ground<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.759> then<00:02:07.939> point<00:02:08.300> five<00:02:08.539> when

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
to the ground and then point five when

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.380 
to the ground and then point five when
your<00:02:08.869> foot<00:02:09.019> is<00:02:09.050> up<00:02:09.289> okay<00:02:09.679> one<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.700> okay<00:02:11.330> you

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
your foot is up okay one and okay you

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.539 
your foot is up okay one and okay you
call<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.110> it's<00:02:12.650> halfway<00:02:12.920> through<00:02:13.370> can

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
call it and it's halfway through can

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.410 
call it and it's halfway through can
think<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.850> as<00:02:13.910> 0.5<00:02:14.420> so<00:02:14.750> one<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:16.090> two<00:02:17.090> and

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
think of it as 0.5 so one and two and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.729 
think of it as 0.5 so one and two and
three<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.880> four<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.209> so<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.230> actually<00:02:21.410> want

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
three and four and so you actually want

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.949 
three and four and so you actually want
to<00:02:21.799> strum<00:02:22.250> on<00:02:22.549> all<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.599> you<00:02:23.720> want<00:02:23.870> to

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
to strum on all of that you want to

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.750 
to strum on all of that you want to
strum<00:02:24.170> along<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.650> numbers<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.310> when<00:02:25.640> your

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
strum along the numbers and when your

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.000 
strum along the numbers and when your
foot<00:02:25.910> is<00:02:25.940> halfway<00:02:26.480> up<00:02:26.660> halfway<00:02:27.380> through<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:27.920> it

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
foot is halfway up halfway through so it

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.860 
foot is halfway up halfway through so it
would<00:02:28.160> be<00:02:28.340> one<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.209> two<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.349> three<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:31.069> four

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
fancy you can do an up strum so you can

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:47.430 
fancy you can do an up strum so you can
go<00:02:40.069> one<00:02:40.879> and<00:02:41.870> then<00:02:42.470> on<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.739> end<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:44.140> two

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.710 

so<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.160> chords<00:02:48.460> of<00:02:48.520> our<00:02:48.670> plane<00:02:48.970> guys<00:02:49.210> is<00:02:49.570> that

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
so the chords of our plane guys is that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.110 
so the chords of our plane guys is that
they<00:02:49.840> are<00:02:50.020> linked<00:02:50.500> below<00:02:50.650> okay<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:52.030> C<00:02:52.330> major

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
they are linked below okay is it C major

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.630 
they are linked below okay is it C major
then<00:02:54.330> we're<00:02:54.450> gonna<00:02:54.540> go<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.959> mana

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
then we're gonna go to a mana

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.020 
then we're gonna go to a mana
we're<00:02:57.090> going<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.480> go<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.630> E<00:02:57.900> minor<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:59.700> then<00:02:59.850> G

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
we're going to go to E minor and then G

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.500 
we're going to go to E minor and then G
major<00:03:01.040> okay<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.520> let's<00:03:02.700> get<00:03:02.880> started<00:03:02.940> enough

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
major okay so let's get started enough

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.090 
major okay so let's get started enough
of<00:03:03.600> my<00:03:03.720> talking<00:03:03.990> guys<00:03:04.290> let's<00:03:04.710> start<00:03:04.920> that

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
of my talking guys let's start that

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.590 
of my talking guys let's start that
metronome<00:03:05.520> e<00:03:05.610> gets<00:03:05.790> done<00:03:06.030> it's<00:03:06.270> gonna<00:03:06.330> be<00:03:06.570> a

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
metronome e gets done it's gonna be a

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.930 
metronome e gets done it's gonna be a
slow<00:03:06.930> metronome<00:03:07.470> it's<00:03:07.650> going<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.860> be<00:03:07.920> on<00:03:08.040> 44

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
slow metronome it's going to be on 44

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.880 
slow metronome it's going to be on 44
beats<00:03:09.180> per<00:03:09.360> minute<00:03:09.660> but<00:03:10.050> go<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.290> metronome

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
beats per minute but go to metronome

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.410 
beats per minute but go to metronome
online<00:03:11.520> and<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:11.880> can<00:03:12.000> bump<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.300> up<00:03:12.360> to

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
online and you can bump it up to

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.390 
online and you can bump it up to
whatever<00:03:12.840> speed<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.290> want<00:03:13.500> right<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.130> out

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
whatever speed you want right and out

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.980 
whatever speed you want right and out
yourself<00:03:14.820> have<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> go<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.300> writing<00:03:15.690> your<00:03:15.810> own

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
yourself have a go of writing your own

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.470 
yourself have a go of writing your own
sheet<00:03:16.260> music<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.770> then<00:03:17.280> try<00:03:17.610> it<00:03:17.670> at<00:03:17.880> faster

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
sheet music and then try it at faster

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.510 
sheet music and then try it at faster
tempos<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:19.080> get<00:03:19.230> better<00:03:19.770> your<00:03:20.100> rhythm<00:03:20.370> playing

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
tempos to get better your rhythm playing

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.310 
tempos to get better your rhythm playing
let's<00:03:20.790> get<00:03:20.880> started<00:03:21.180> guys<00:03:21.480> let's<00:03:21.780> just<00:03:21.840> do<00:03:22.020> a<00:03:22.050> 1

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
let's get started guys let's just do a 1

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.320 
let's get started guys let's just do a 1
bar<00:03:22.530> at<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.740> time<00:03:22.950> here's<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.490> metronome<00:03:23.880> then

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
bar at a time here's the metronome then

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.490 
bar at a time here's the metronome then
we'll<00:03:24.510> put<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.810> all<00:03:24.930> together<00:03:25.110> at<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.410> end

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
we'll put it all together at the end

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:37.850 
we'll put it all together at the end
here<00:03:25.800> we<00:03:25.890> go<00:03:26.660> 1<00:03:28.040> 2<00:03:29.040> 3<00:03:30.770> 4<00:03:34.880> 3<00:03:35.880> 4<00:03:36.440> well<00:03:37.440> done<00:03:37.650> so

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
here we go 1 2 3 4 3 4 well done so

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.770 
here we go 1 2 3 4 3 4 well done so
that's<00:03:38.010> AC<00:03:38.310> chord<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.270> it's<00:03:39.510> when<00:03:39.660> they

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
that's AC chord and it's when they

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.410
