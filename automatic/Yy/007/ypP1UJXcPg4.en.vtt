00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.230 
here and we run a Godzilla blow-off out
on<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.270> setup<00:01:42.540> now<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.470> particular<00:01:43.590> truck

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
on this setup now this particular truck

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.990 
on this setup now this particular truck
and<00:01:45.780> transmission<00:01:46.440> issues<00:01:46.740> before<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.820> when

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
and transmission issues before so when

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.320 
and transmission issues before so when
we<00:01:48.090> surpassed<00:01:48.510> 600<00:01:49.050> rear<00:01:49.920> wheel<00:01:50.330> originally

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
we surpassed 600 rear wheel originally

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.910 
we surpassed 600 rear wheel originally
on<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.630> truck

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
on this truck

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.680 
on this truck
we<00:01:53.370> started<00:01:53.640> tearing<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> transmission<00:01:54.570> up

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
we started tearing the transmission up

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.960 
we started tearing the transmission up
so<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.740> sent<00:01:55.950> its<00:01:56.040> paramount<00:01:56.370> performance<00:01:56.850> in

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
so we sent its paramount performance in

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.030 
so we sent its paramount performance in
southern<00:01:57.300> hot<00:01:57.450> rod<00:01:57.690> they<00:01:58.140> got<00:01:58.800> it<00:01:58.890> together

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
southern hot rod they got it together

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.430 
southern hot rod they got it together
for<00:01:59.400> us<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.729> as<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.510> today<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.780> probably<00:02:01.170> got

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
for us and as of today we probably got

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.580 
for us and as of today we probably got
close<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:01.880> 150<00:02:02.880> runs<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.780> dyno<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.200> this

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
close to 150 runs on the dyno with this

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.090 
close to 150 runs on the dyno with this
truck<00:02:05.540> trying<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.630> tear<00:02:06.810> their<00:02:06.990> stuff<00:02:07.260> up<00:02:07.440> and

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
truck trying to tear their stuff up and

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.070 
truck trying to tear their stuff up and
so<00:02:08.340> far<00:02:08.550> everything<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.000> home<00:02:09.179> together<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.720> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
so far everything is home together and I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.240 
so far everything is home together and I
can<00:02:10.229> then<00:02:10.350> them<00:02:10.500> for<00:02:10.619> doing<00:02:10.709> such<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.039> great<00:02:11.070> job

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
can then them for doing such a great job

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.030 
can then them for doing such a great job
for<00:02:11.630> this<00:02:12.630> truck<00:02:12.840> also<00:02:13.140> has<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.380> Ford<00:02:13.680> nine-inch

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
truck and basically if you want to build

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.800 
truck and basically if you want to build
anything<00:02:28.920> over<00:02:30.980> 550<00:02:31.980> rear<00:02:32.190> wheel<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:33.540> need<00:02:33.720> to

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
anything over 550 rear wheel you need to

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.360 
anything over 550 rear wheel you need to
consider<00:02:34.110> especially<00:02:34.350> on<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.770> jeep<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.220> is

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
consider especially on a jeep this is

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.979 
consider especially on a jeep this is
heavy<00:02:35.580> as<00:02:35.730> these<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.510> need<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.720> consider

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
heavy as these you need to consider

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.390 
heavy as these you need to consider
building<00:02:37.410> everything<00:02:37.650> else<00:02:37.890> I'm<00:02:38.040> not<00:02:38.160> telling

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
building everything else I'm not telling

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.350 
building everything else I'm not telling
you<00:02:38.459> where<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.670> spend<00:02:38.970> your<00:02:39.060> money<00:02:39.120> and

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
you where to spend your money and

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.850 
you where to spend your money and
everything<00:02:39.660> but<00:02:39.989> obviously<00:02:40.440> you're<00:02:40.650> going<00:02:40.800> to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
everything but obviously you're going to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.229 
everything but obviously you're going to
spend<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.190> back<00:02:41.340> if<00:02:41.520> you're<00:02:41.670> good<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.880> breaking

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
spend it back if you're good to breaking

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.660 
spend it back if you're good to breaking
that<00:02:42.360> stuff<00:02:42.630> anyway<00:02:42.989> so<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:44.130> biggest<00:02:44.459> key

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
that stuff anyway so the biggest key

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.290 
that stuff anyway so the biggest key
point<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.390> we<00:02:45.870> broke<00:02:46.110> first<00:02:46.470> on<00:02:46.800> this<00:02:47.010> one

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
point that we broke first on this one

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.330 
point that we broke first on this one
was<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.420> transmission<00:02:49.080> we<00:02:50.040> didn't<00:02:50.220> really

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
was the transmission we didn't really

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.590 
was the transmission we didn't really
have<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.549> problem<00:02:50.880> with<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.030> rear<00:02:51.209> end<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:51.540> we

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
have a problem with the rear end but we

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.640 
have a problem with the rear end but we
wanted<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.870> go<00:02:52.019> ahead<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.260> build<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.500> rear

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
wanted to go ahead and build the rear

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.590 
wanted to go ahead and build the rear
end<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.920> way<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.430> know<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.880> where<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.330> wanted

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
end the way you know to where we wanted

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.930
