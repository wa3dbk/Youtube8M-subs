 empty bags are in their pockets 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.900
 in standing children it is hard to go

 forward with ideas and corruptions 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.739
 which then has none 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.750
 on the testament it was written that in 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.119

 the sale of the factory flop 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.070

 more technical word are implants 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.390
 there were friars in Assisi before 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.270
 to go confess they went flagellating 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.280
 to see to convert the choirs of whom 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.550
 he confesses to them in the meantime because 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.470
 today few that go like this 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.280
 kept in all his money of 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.280
 sacristy 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.580

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.720
 rumors of Italian soldiers 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.909
 you can hard not give up 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.580
 the good agent then when he loses 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.390
 patience and the administrator's skin 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.610
 the public and under the scissors of 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.069
 any times the years 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.549
 I for the neck hope that if there is a 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.280
 lawyer said seriously tics for 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:22.040

 we had no advice on Rome but I am 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.980
 contrary everything he seeks 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:37.330
 the intelligence of the accounts because that 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:41.170
 in a dull way to make the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.560
 coin on intelligence man is worth for 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.070
 the intelligence is not the lung for the coin 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.060
 current quote intelligence if there is one 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.060
 I walk
