00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
practice the another intermediate thing

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.420 
practice the another intermediate thing
is<00:01:12.090> doing<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> mid<00:01:12.600> punch<00:01:13.010> same<00:01:14.010> thing<00:01:14.250> as<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
is doing the mid punch same thing as the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:24.410 
is doing the mid punch same thing as the
mid<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.479> cake<00:01:22.610> see<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.729> I'm<00:01:23.790> saying<00:01:24.000> just

practice it those are pretty immediate

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.130 
practice it those are pretty immediate
cancels<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.700> those<00:01:44.700> stem<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.960> when<00:01:46.079> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140

you mean it's free damage for two bars
that<00:04:18.130> you're<00:04:18.280> in<00:04:18.489> most<00:04:18.910> of<00:04:19.030> time<00:04:19.090> if<00:04:19.269> you<00:04:19.299> have

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
that you're in most of time if you have

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.509 
that you're in most of time if you have
two<00:04:19.780> bars<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.290> mean<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.709> mean<00:04:20.859> usually<00:04:21.190> means

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
two bars I mean I mean usually means

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.160 
two bars I mean I mean usually means
you're<00:04:21.609> hitting<00:04:21.820> home<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.150> I<00:04:22.360> mean<00:04:22.510> a<00:04:22.750> sweet

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
you're hitting home and I mean a sweet

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.920 
you're hitting home and I mean a sweet
can<00:04:23.470> be<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.740> difference<00:04:23.860> between<00:04:24.930> winning

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
can be the difference between winning

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.390 
can be the difference between winning
and<00:04:26.170> losing<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:26.650> that's<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.100> thing<00:04:27.220> like

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
and losing and that's the thing like

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.220 
and losing and that's the thing like
missing<00:04:27.730> combos<00:04:28.030> is<00:04:28.180> horrible<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:28.840> that's

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
missing combos is horrible and that's

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.540 
missing combos is horrible and that's
why<00:04:29.380> it's<00:04:29.620> such<00:04:29.740> high-level<00:04:29.950> play<00:04:30.280> they

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
why it's such high-level play they

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.180 
why it's such high-level play they
barely<00:04:30.760> miss<00:04:31.030> it<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.360> if<00:04:31.450> they<00:04:31.510> do<00:04:31.630> miss<00:04:32.050> it

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
barely miss it and if they do miss it

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.380 
barely miss it and if they do miss it
most<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.310> time<00:04:33.490> i<00:04:33.760> would<00:04:33.880> say<00:04:34.000> about<00:04:34.090> least

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
most the time i would say about least

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.580 
most the time i would say about least
seventy-five<00:04:34.690> percent<00:04:34.840> of<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.080> time<00:04:35.200> it<00:04:35.470> will

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
seventy-five percent of the time it will

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.610 
seventy-five percent of the time it will
be<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.740> reason<00:04:35.980> why<00:04:36.100> they'd<00:04:36.340> lose<00:04:36.540> so<00:04:37.620> howls

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620
