okay<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.560> gonna<00:00:01.680> be<00:00:01.890> the<00:00:02.010> BC<00:00:02.340> calculus

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
okay this is gonna be the BC calculus

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.780 
okay this is gonna be the BC calculus
sample<00:00:03.120> questions<00:00:03.449> 11<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:03.899> 12<00:00:04.080> and<00:00:04.790> what

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
sample questions 11 and 12 and what

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.030 
sample questions 11 and 12 and what
question<00:00:06.299> number<00:00:06.600> 11<00:00:07.020> here<00:00:07.200> says<00:00:07.470> it<00:00:07.740> says<00:00:07.919> if

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
question number 11 here says it says if

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.830 
question number 11 here says it says if
you<00:00:08.130> integrate<00:00:08.400> from<00:00:09.120> 4<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.870> infinity<00:00:09.950> of<00:00:10.950> DX

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
you integrate from 4 to infinity of DX

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.910 
you integrate from 4 to infinity of DX
over<00:00:12.840> x<00:00:13.290> squared<00:00:13.530> plus<00:00:13.769> 16<00:00:14.389> what<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.570> get<00:00:15.920> a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
over x squared plus 16 what do you get a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.220 
over x squared plus 16 what do you get a
couple<00:00:17.550> things<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:18.060> remember<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:19.020> first

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
couple things to remember the first

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.019 
couple things to remember the first
thing<00:00:19.470> here<00:00:19.920> simply<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:20.939> an

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
thing here simply is that we have an

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.170 
thing here simply is that we have an
improper<00:00:21.330> integral<00:00:22.699> because<00:00:23.699> our<00:00:23.820> upper

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
improper integral because our upper

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.140 
improper integral because our upper
limit<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.689> integration<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.439> infinity<00:00:26.150> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
limit of integration is infinity the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.460 
limit of integration is infinity the
other<00:00:27.269> thing<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.570> think<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> make<00:00:28.289> use

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
other thing I think we have to make use

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.950 
other thing I think we have to make use
of<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> formula<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.849> arctangent<00:00:30.359> formula

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
of is the formula the arctangent formula

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.410 
of is the formula the arctangent formula
in<00:00:31.080> case<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.410> forgot<00:00:31.710> 1<00:00:32.550> over<00:00:32.790> x<00:00:33.000> squared<00:00:33.149> plus

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
in case you forgot 1 over x squared plus

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.979 
in case you forgot 1 over x squared plus
a<00:00:33.870> squared<00:00:34.350> DX<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:36.090> know<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.540> simply

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
a squared DX we know that that simply

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.830 
a squared DX we know that that simply
equals<00:00:37.469> 1<00:00:37.770> over<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.540> arctangent<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:40.079> X<00:00:41.010> over<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
equals 1 over a arctangent of X over a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.290 
equals 1 over a arctangent of X over a
plus<00:00:42.840> C<00:00:43.489> okay<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.520> we're<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.969> use<00:00:45.149> that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
plus C okay so we're going to use that

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.970 
plus C okay so we're going to use that
formula<00:00:46.219> here<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.550> minute<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.980> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
formula here in just a minute so the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.260 
formula here in just a minute so the
first<00:00:50.160> thing<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:50.850> improper

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
first thing we do with improper

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.779 
first thing we do with improper
integrals<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.800> replace<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.340> infinity

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
integrals is we replace the infinity

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.330 
integrals is we replace the infinity
with<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> t<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.539> take<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> limit<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:55.860> T<00:00:56.070> goes<00:00:56.280> to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
with a t and take the limit as T goes to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.279 
with a t and take the limit as T goes to
infinity<00:00:58.039> from<00:00:59.039> 4<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.520> T<00:00:59.670> DX<00:01:00.270> over<00:01:00.719> x<00:01:00.960> squared

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
infinity from 4 to T DX over x squared

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.429 
infinity from 4 to T DX over x squared
plus<00:01:01.530> 16<00:01:02.270> so<00:01:03.270> when<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.539> integrate<00:01:03.750> using<00:01:04.170> this

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
plus 16 so when we integrate using this

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.890 
plus 16 so when we integrate using this
formula<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.880> still<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.180> our<00:01:06.210> limit<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.689> T

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
formula we still have our limit as T

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.410 
formula we still have our limit as T
goes<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.110> infinity<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.909> number<00:01:09.060> being

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
goes to infinity the number being

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.200 
goes to infinity the number being
squared<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.710> write<00:01:10.890> positive<00:01:11.100> 16<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.939> 4

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
squared we can write positive 16 is 4

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.109 
squared we can write positive 16 is 4
squared<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.900> we'll<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.140> 1<00:01:13.350> over<00:01:13.380> 4<00:01:14.119> arc

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
squared so we'll get 1 over 4 arc

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.010 
squared so we'll get 1 over 4 arc
tangent<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:16.140> x<00:01:16.740> over<00:01:17.130> 4<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.790> now<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.689> simply

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
tangent of x over 4 and now this simply

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.100 
tangent of x over 4 and now this simply
has<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.350> evaluated<00:01:20.250> from<00:01:20.490> 4<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.950> T<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:24.509> when

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
has to be evaluated from 4 to T so when

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.020 
has to be evaluated from 4 to T so when
we<00:01:25.229> plug<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.619> stuff<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.610> limit

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
we plug that stuff in we have the limit

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.660 
we plug that stuff in we have the limit
as<00:01:27.150> T<00:01:27.540> goes<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.810> infinity

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
as T goes to infinity

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.789 
as T goes to infinity
we'll<00:01:30.670> have<00:01:30.850> 1/4<00:01:31.570> arctangent<00:01:32.560> of<00:01:33.130> X<00:01:34.060> over<00:01:34.329> 4

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
we'll have 1/4 arctangent of X over 4

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.289 
we'll have 1/4 arctangent of X over 4
well<00:01:35.799> excuse<00:01:36.130> me<00:01:36.280> will<00:01:36.430> plug<00:01:36.640> RT<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.090> so<00:01:37.210> we'll

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
well excuse me will plug RT and so we'll

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.139 
well excuse me will plug RT and so we'll
get<00:01:37.420> t<00:01:37.659> over<00:01:37.899> 4<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.700> then<00:01:39.729> we<00:01:39.939> have<00:01:40.060> to

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
get t over 4 and then we have to

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.490 
get t over 4 and then we have to
subtract<00:01:40.539> away<00:01:40.720> our<00:01:40.840> lower<00:01:41.049> limit<00:01:41.439> of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
subtract away our lower limit of

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.760 
subtract away our lower limit of
integration<00:01:41.670> 1/4<00:01:42.670> arctangent<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.960> four<00:01:44.530> over

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
integration 1/4 arctangent of four over

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.020 
integration 1/4 arctangent of four over
4<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.869> now<00:01:47.740> we<00:01:47.799> simply<00:01:48.220> have<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.369> compute<00:01:48.850> this

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
4 and now we simply have to compute this

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.560 
4 and now we simply have to compute this
so<00:01:49.689> certainly<00:01:50.679> 4<00:01:51.009> over<00:01:51.220> 4<00:01:51.460> is<00:01:51.640> just<00:01:51.670> 1<00:01:52.179> and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
so certainly 4 over 4 is just 1 and

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.919 
so certainly 4 over 4 is just 1 and
recall<00:01:53.560> that<00:01:53.590> arctangent<00:01:54.490> of<00:01:54.850> 1<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:57.780> let's<00:01:58.780> see

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
recall that arctangent of 1 is let's see

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.179 
recall that arctangent of 1 is let's see
let's<00:01:59.110> write<00:01:59.259> it<00:01:59.350> all<00:01:59.439> out<00:01:59.470> so<00:01:59.770> we<00:01:59.890> have<00:02:00.009> the

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
let's write it all out so we have the

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.910 
let's write it all out so we have the
limit<00:02:00.490> as<00:02:00.549> T<00:02:00.729> goes<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:00.939> infinity

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
limit as T goes to infinity

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.090 
limit as T goes to infinity
1/4<00:02:02.920> arctangent<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:04.030> T<00:02:04.299> over<00:02:04.450> 4<00:02:04.920> then<00:02:05.920> we'll

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
1/4 arctangent of T over 4 then we'll

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.550 
1/4 arctangent of T over 4 then we'll
have<00:02:06.340> minus<00:02:06.479> 1/4<00:02:07.920> remember<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.069> value<00:02:09.519> of

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
have minus 1/4 remember the value of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.740 
have minus 1/4 remember the value of
arctangent<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.830> 1<00:02:11.910> recall<00:02:12.910> that<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.330> equals

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
arctangent of 1 recall that that equals

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.440 
arctangent of 1 recall that that equals
PI<00:02:14.230> over<00:02:14.260> 4<00:02:17.580> all<00:02:18.580> right<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:18.910> now<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.120> just<00:02:19.269> have

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
PI over 4 all right so now we just have

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.449 
PI over 4 all right so now we just have
to<00:02:19.630> keep<00:02:19.840> simplifying<00:02:20.769> down<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.069> little<00:02:21.310> bit

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
to keep simplifying down a little bit

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.270 
to keep simplifying down a little bit
more<00:02:21.670> if<00:02:21.970> you'll<00:02:22.630> recall<00:02:23.019> also<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.830> graph<00:02:24.040> of

more if you'll recall also the graph of
arctangent<00:02:28.019> remember<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.110> graph<00:02:29.319> of

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
arctangent remember the graph of

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.949 
arctangent remember the graph of
arctangent<00:02:30.099> it's<00:02:30.430> kind<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.640> tangent<00:02:31.299> one<00:02:31.660> copy

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
arctangent it's kind of tangent one copy

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.509 
arctangent it's kind of tangent one copy
of<00:02:32.110> tangent<00:02:32.709> that's<00:02:32.890> been<00:02:33.069> flipped<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.489> its

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.330 
of tangent that's been flipped on its
side<00:02:33.750> so<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.840> has<00:02:34.930> asymptotes<00:02:35.530> at<00:02:35.709> positive<00:02:36.190> PI

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
side so it has asymptotes at positive PI

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.460 
side so it has asymptotes at positive PI
over<00:02:36.370> 2<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.680> negative<00:02:38.680> PI<00:02:39.160> over<00:02:39.190> 2<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:41.290> then

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
over 2 and negative PI over 2 and then

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.560 
over 2 and negative PI over 2 and then
it<00:02:41.620> increases<00:02:42.280> as<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.549> move<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.000> left<00:02:43.030> up

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
it increases as you move to the left up

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.960 
it increases as you move to the left up
to<00:02:43.810> PI<00:02:43.989> over<00:02:44.019> 2<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.410> decreases<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.459> think<00:02:45.880> I

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.000 
to PI over 2 and decreases I think I
said<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.630> increases<00:02:47.200> as<00:02:47.350> you<00:02:47.470> move<00:02:47.620> up<00:02:47.769> into

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
said it increases as you move up into

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.309 
said it increases as you move up into
the<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.819> increases<00:02:49.690> as<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.900> move<00:02:50.079> to<00:02:50.200> the

the it increases as you move to the

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.559 
the it increases as you move to the
right<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.100> value<00:02:51.370> PI<00:02:51.519> over<00:02:51.760> 2<00:02:51.910> it

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
right to the value PI over 2 it

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.809 
right to the value PI over 2 it
decreases<00:02:53.319> as<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.470> move<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.859> the<00:02:53.920> left<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.700> the

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
value negative PI over 2 so in this case

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.690 
value negative PI over 2 so in this case
we're<00:02:59.470> taking<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.920> limit<00:03:00.220> as<00:03:00.280> T<00:03:00.489> goes<00:03:00.639> to

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
we're taking the limit as T goes to

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.170 
we're taking the limit as T goes to
infinity<00:03:01.329> so<00:03:02.049> notice<00:03:02.319> as<00:03:02.819> T<00:03:03.819> grows

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
infinity so notice as T grows

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.410 
infinity so notice as T grows

we<00:03:12.100> plug<00:03:12.400> larger<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.060> larger<00:03:13.180> numbers<00:03:13.690> into

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
we plug larger and larger numbers into

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.930 
we plug larger and larger numbers into
our<00:03:13.930> arctangent<00:03:14.530> function<00:03:14.769> we're<00:03:15.670> simply

our arctangent function we're simply

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.250 
our arctangent function we're simply
going<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.180> get<00:03:16.269> closer<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.720> closer<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.170> the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
going to get closer and closer to the

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.849 
going to get closer and closer to the
value<00:03:17.530> PI<00:03:17.769> over<00:03:18.010> 2<00:03:18.389> so<00:03:19.389> this<00:03:19.900> first<00:03:20.200> limit<00:03:20.680> when

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
value PI over 2 so this first limit when

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.490 
value PI over 2 so this first limit when
we<00:03:20.950> calculate<00:03:21.489> it

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
we calculate it

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.080 
we calculate it
we've<00:03:24.500> got<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.770> 1/4<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.730> was<00:03:25.880> there

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
we've got the 1/4 that was there

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.260 
we've got the 1/4 that was there
previously<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:27.730> again<00:03:28.730> we'll<00:03:29.090> get

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
previously and again we'll get

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.690 
previously and again we'll get
arctangent<00:03:29.960> of<00:03:30.290> arbitrarily<00:03:30.890> large<00:03:31.190> numbers

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
arctangent of arbitrarily large numbers

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.700 
arctangent of arbitrarily large numbers
and<00:03:31.820> again<00:03:31.910> that<00:03:32.210> approaches<00:03:32.720> PI<00:03:33.020> over<00:03:33.260> 2<00:03:33.470> and

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
and again that approaches PI over 2 and

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.050 
and again that approaches PI over 2 and
then<00:03:34.400> we<00:03:34.520> have<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:34.730> subtract<00:03:35.180> away<00:03:35.330> PI<00:03:35.810> over<00:03:36.260> 16

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
then we have to subtract away PI over 16

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.060 
then we have to subtract away PI over 16
well<00:03:38.060> we're<00:03:38.660> almost<00:03:38.780> there<00:03:39.080> now<00:03:39.380> notice<00:03:39.950> we

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
well we're almost there now notice we

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.420 
well we're almost there now notice we
get<00:03:40.220> PI<00:03:40.430> over<00:03:40.460> 8<00:03:40.910> which<00:03:41.300> we<00:03:41.480> can<00:03:41.600> write<00:03:41.810> as<00:03:42.190> 2<00:03:43.190> PI

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
get PI over 8 which we can write as 2 PI

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.080 
get PI over 8 which we can write as 2 PI
over<00:03:43.760> 16<00:03:44.090> minus<00:03:44.870> PI<00:03:45.260> over<00:03:45.530> 16<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.970> will

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
over 16 minus PI over 16 and that will

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.310 
over 16 minus PI over 16 and that will
give<00:03:47.240> us<00:03:47.270> our<00:03:47.480> final<00:03:47.780> answer<00:03:48.110> of<00:03:48.380> PI<00:03:49.070> over<00:03:49.340> 16

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
give us our final answer of PI over 16

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.420 
give us our final answer of PI over 16

quantity<00:05:16.580> squared<00:05:17.170> remember<00:05:18.170> that's<00:05:18.290> the

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
quantity squared remember that's the

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.260 
quantity squared remember that's the
same<00:05:18.470> thing<00:05:18.800> as<00:05:18.920> sine<00:05:19.190> squared<00:05:19.640> it<00:05:19.820> means<00:05:20.000> take

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
same thing as sine squared it means take

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.990 
same thing as sine squared it means take
the<00:05:20.300> whole<00:05:20.600> thing<00:05:20.630> and<00:05:20.900> square<00:05:21.680> it<00:05:21.830> well<00:05:22.670> sine

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
the whole thing and square it well sine

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.880 
the whole thing and square it well sine
of<00:05:23.030> PI<00:05:23.300> over<00:05:23.330> four<00:05:23.750> is<00:05:23.780> square<00:05:24.470> root<00:05:24.500> of<00:05:24.680> two

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
of PI over four is square root of two

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.610 
of PI over four is square root of two
over<00:05:24.920> two<00:05:25.600> that's<00:05:26.600> what<00:05:26.810> we<00:05:26.900> have<00:05:27.020> to<00:05:27.170> square

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
over two that's what we have to square

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.040 
over two that's what we have to square
so<00:05:28.220> square<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.270> square<00:05:29.420> root<00:05:29.600> of<00:05:29.660> two<00:05:29.780> you'll

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
so square the square root of two you'll

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.920 
so square the square root of two you'll
get<00:05:30.200> 2<00:05:30.440> over<00:05:30.770> four<00:05:31.330> which<00:05:32.330> is<00:05:32.510> simply<00:05:32.780> going<00:05:32.870> to

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
get 2 over four which is simply going to

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.560 
get 2 over four which is simply going to
be<00:05:32.990> a<00:05:33.050> value<00:05:33.410> of<00:05:33.470> one<00:05:33.680> half<00:05:34.060> so<00:05:35.060> that's<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.390> y

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
be a value of one half so that's the y

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.350 
be a value of one half so that's the y
coordinate<00:05:36.200> in<00:05:36.350> this<00:05:36.470> case<00:05:36.770> will<00:05:37.580> be<00:05:37.700> one<00:05:38.120> half

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
coordinate in this case will be one half

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.480 
coordinate in this case will be one half
and<00:05:39.050> now<00:05:39.230> we<00:05:39.290> just<00:05:39.500> have<00:05:39.680> to<00:05:39.800> find<00:05:40.010> the

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
and now we just have to find the

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.430 
and now we just have to find the
derivative<00:05:40.610> and<00:05:43.270> plug<00:05:44.270> in<00:05:44.510> again<00:05:44.720> PI<00:05:45.170> over

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
derivative and plug in again PI over

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.610 
derivative and plug in again PI over
four<00:05:45.710> so<00:05:46.670> it<00:05:46.790> says<00:05:47.000> the<00:05:47.450> slope<00:05:48.380> of<00:05:48.470> the<00:05:48.590> tangent

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
four so it says the slope of the tangent

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.100 
four so it says the slope of the tangent
line<00:05:49.010> it's<00:05:49.580> going<00:05:49.760> to<00:05:49.820> be<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:50.450> derivative<00:05:50.750> of

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
line it's going to be the derivative of

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.410 
line it's going to be the derivative of
our<00:05:51.230> function<00:05:51.520> again<00:05:52.520> I<00:05:52.550> like<00:05:52.760> to<00:05:52.820> think<00:05:53.150> sine

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
our function again I like to think sine

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.530 
our function again I like to think sine
of<00:05:53.450> sine<00:05:54.230> X<00:05:54.500> as<00:05:54.770> I<00:05:55.310> like<00:05:55.940> to<00:05:56.060> think<00:05:56.240> of<00:05:56.300> sine

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
of sine X as I like to think of sine

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.660 
of sine X as I like to think of sine
squared<00:05:56.570> X<00:05:57.110> the<00:05:57.260> sine<00:05:57.440> of<00:05:57.500> X<00:05:57.770> quantity<00:05:57.980> squared

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
squared X the sine of X quantity squared

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.840 
squared X the sine of X quantity squared
so<00:05:59.320> that<00:06:00.320> to<00:06:00.560> me<00:06:00.740> when<00:06:01.010> I<00:06:01.070> write<00:06:01.550> it<00:06:01.580> that<00:06:01.700> way

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
so that to me when I write it that way

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.030 
so that to me when I write it that way
it<00:06:02.120> reminds<00:06:02.540> me<00:06:02.600> to<00:06:02.690> use<00:06:02.900> the<00:06:03.050> chain<00:06:03.320> rule<00:06:03.350> when

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
it reminds me to use the chain rule when

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.490 
it reminds me to use the chain rule when
I<00:06:04.070> take<00:06:04.280> the<00:06:04.430> derivative<00:06:04.550> so<00:06:05.230> when<00:06:06.230> I<00:06:06.260> take<00:06:06.440> the

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
I take the derivative so when I take the

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.830 
I take the derivative so when I take the
derivative<00:06:06.740> of<00:06:07.340> the<00:06:07.790> y<00:06:08.150> equals<00:06:08.480> sine<00:06:08.780> X

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.490 
yet because that's kind of the slope
generically

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
generically

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.499 
generically
so<00:06:27.500> the<00:06:27.650> slope<00:06:27.919> in<00:06:28.069> this<00:06:28.220> case<00:06:28.460> of<00:06:28.849> the<00:06:29.090> tangent

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509 
so the slope in this case of the tangent

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:31.749 
so the slope in this case of the tangent
line<00:06:29.659> is<00:06:29.900> going<00:06:30.050> to<00:06:30.110> be<00:06:30.199> the<00:06:30.949> derivative<00:06:31.400> again

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 
line is going to be the derivative again

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.570 
line is going to be the derivative again
evaluated<00:06:32.479> at<00:06:32.569> PI<00:06:32.780> over<00:06:33.080> four<00:06:33.319> so<00:06:33.650> we'll<00:06:34.430> get

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
evaluated at PI over four so we'll get

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.540 
evaluated at PI over four so we'll get
two<00:06:34.849> times<00:06:35.090> sine<00:06:35.449> of<00:06:35.479> PI<00:06:35.780> over<00:06:35.810> four<00:06:36.550> times

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
two times sine of PI over four times

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.080 
two times sine of PI over four times
cosine<00:06:38.240> of<00:06:38.270> PI<00:06:38.659> over<00:06:38.930> four<00:06:39.550> again<00:06:40.550> both<00:06:40.789> sine

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
cosine of PI over four again both sine

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.779 
cosine of PI over four again both sine
of<00:06:41.120> PI<00:06:41.419> over<00:06:41.449> four<00:06:41.930> and<00:06:41.960> cosine<00:06:42.590> of<00:06:42.620> PI<00:06:42.919> R<00:06:42.979> for<00:06:43.400> R

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
of PI over four and cosine of PI R for R

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.159 
of PI over four and cosine of PI R for R
the<00:06:44.060> value<00:06:44.090> root<00:06:44.689> two<00:06:44.930> over<00:06:44.960> two

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
the value root two over two

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.570 
the value root two over two
so<00:06:48.169> let's<00:06:48.349> see<00:06:48.469> if<00:06:48.590> we<00:06:48.710> simplify<00:06:49.009> all<00:06:49.340> of<00:06:49.370> this

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
so let's see if we simplify all of this

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.659 
so let's see if we simplify all of this
down<00:06:49.879> a<00:06:50.509> two<00:06:51.139> and<00:06:51.349> A<00:06:51.409> two<00:06:51.590> will<00:06:51.800> cancel<00:06:51.979> notice

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669 
down a two and A two will cancel notice

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.070 
down a two and A two will cancel notice
we<00:06:52.789> get<00:06:52.909> square<00:06:53.180> root<00:06:53.270> of<00:06:53.330> 2<00:06:53.479> times<00:06:53.509> square

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
we get square root of 2 times square

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.070 
we get square root of 2 times square
root<00:06:54.199> of<00:06:54.289> 2<00:06:54.439> which<00:06:54.680> is<00:06:54.740> 2<00:06:54.889> over<00:06:55.219> 2<00:06:55.729> again<00:06:56.240> so<00:06:56.990> it

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
root of 2 which is 2 over 2 again so it

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.209 
root of 2 which is 2 over 2 again so it
looks<00:06:57.229> to<00:06:57.289> me<00:06:57.500> like<00:06:57.530> the<00:06:57.800> slope<00:06:58.039> of<00:06:58.129> the

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:58.219 
looks to me like the slope of the

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:59.950 
looks to me like the slope of the
tangent<00:06:58.250> line<00:06:58.819> is<00:06:59.180> going<00:06:59.270> to<00:06:59.419> be<00:06:59.479> simply<00:06:59.930> equal

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
tangent line is going to be simply equal

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.309 
tangent line is going to be simply equal
to<00:07:00.319> one<00:07:00.590> that<00:07:01.520> is<00:07:01.580> one<00:07:02.030> of<00:07:02.120> their<00:07:02.270> choices<00:07:02.780> so

00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:03.319 
to one that is one of their choices so

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:06.610 
to one that is one of their choices so
that<00:07:03.800> would<00:07:04.219> be<00:07:04.400> what<00:07:04.610> I<00:07:04.639> go<00:07:04.909> with<00:07:05.150> so<00:07:05.629> nothing

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
that would be what I go with so nothing

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.469 
that would be what I go with so nothing
too<00:07:06.740> bad<00:07:06.919> it's<00:07:07.219> just<00:07:07.340> finding<00:07:07.789> again<00:07:08.060> points

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 
too bad it's just finding again points

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:10.300 
too bad it's just finding again points
on<00:07:08.599> the<00:07:08.690> line<00:07:08.900> and<00:07:09.259> using<00:07:09.650> the<00:07:09.740> derivative<00:07:09.979> to

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
on the line and using the derivative to

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.040 
on the line and using the derivative to
find<00:07:10.520> the<00:07:10.729> slope<00:07:11.090> of<00:07:11.240> the<00:07:11.300> tangent<00:07:11.330> line<00:07:11.690> so

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
find the slope of the tangent line so

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.290 
find the slope of the tangent line so
all<00:07:12.259> right<00:07:12.800> feel<00:07:13.340> free<00:07:13.460> to<00:07:13.520> post<00:07:13.729> comments<00:07:14.180> and
