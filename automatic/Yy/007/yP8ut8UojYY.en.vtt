00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hi so our first modification is going to

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.599 
hi so our first modification is going to
be<00:00:03.629> getting<00:00:04.140> these<00:00:04.290> extracts<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.160> fit<00:00:05.339> on<00:00:05.460> the

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
be getting these extracts to fit on the

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.200 
be getting these extracts to fit on the
front<00:00:05.879> as<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.120> can<00:00:06.990> see<00:00:07.440> if<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.760> throw<00:00:09.000> one

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
front as you can see if you throw one

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.990 
front as you can see if you throw one
right<00:00:09.240> directly<00:00:09.929> on<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:11.040> doesn't<00:00:11.429> fit<00:00:11.670> it

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
right directly on it doesn't fit it

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.209 
right directly on it doesn't fit it
sticks<00:00:12.780> out<00:00:12.960> too<00:00:13.139> far<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.860> what<00:00:14.040> we're<00:00:14.130> going

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
sticks out too far so what we're going

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.470 
sticks out too far so what we're going
to<00:00:14.309> have<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.639> do<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.880> we're<00:00:15.030> going<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.210> have<00:00:15.360> to

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
to have to do is we're going to have to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.349 
to have to do is we're going to have to
cut<00:00:15.690> down<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.139> shaft<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.710> order<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.070> fit<00:00:17.359> and

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
cut down this shaft in order to fit and

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.960 
cut down this shaft in order to fit and
in<00:00:18.600> order<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.340> we're<00:00:20.340> going<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.760> throw

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
in order to do that we're going to throw

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.990 
in order to do that we're going to throw
it<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.130> then<00:00:23.130> we're<00:00:23.699> going<00:00:23.880> to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
it on like this and then we're going to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.380 
it on like this and then we're going to
grab<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:27.199> screwdriver<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:29.060> put<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.179> down

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
grab a screwdriver and put it down

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.580 
grab a screwdriver and put it down
through<00:00:30.980> until<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.009> hit<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:33.440> then<00:00:34.440> we're

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
through until we hit and then we're

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.200 
through until we hit and then we're
going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.739> mark<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.340> outside<00:00:35.790> where<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
going to mark on the outside where it

00:00:36.210 --> 00:01:17.580 
going to mark on the outside where it
was<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:36.630> hit<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:38.730> cut<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.180> off

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.260 

once<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.799> excess<00:01:19.250> is<00:01:19.460> cut<00:01:19.700> off<00:01:19.850> you're<00:01:20.119> going

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
once the excess is cut off you're going

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.840 
once the excess is cut off you're going
to<00:01:20.360> need<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.720> grind<00:01:20.960> it<00:01:21.200> smooth<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.189> it<00:01:22.369> fits<00:01:22.640> on

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
to need to grind it smooth so it fits on

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:32.960 
to need to grind it smooth so it fits on
the<00:01:23.030> axle<00:01:23.450> better

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.370 

once<00:01:33.970> you've<00:01:34.180> ground<00:01:34.480> it<00:01:34.660> down<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.140> point

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
once you've ground it down to the point

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.200 
once you've ground it down to the point
it<00:01:35.500> fits<00:01:35.740> correctly<00:01:36.010> you<00:01:36.520> should<00:01:36.760> be<00:01:36.880> able<00:01:37.000> to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
it fits correctly you should be able to

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.540 
it fits correctly you should be able to
put<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.540> factory<00:01:37.990> washers<00:01:38.620> and<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.100> c-clip

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
put the factory washers and the c-clip

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
put the factory washers and the c-clip
back<00:01:39.820> in<00:01:40.060> place<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.600> you're<00:01:41.470> all<00:01:41.650> done

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.010 

there<00:01:52.570> we<00:01:52.659> go

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
there we go

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.859 
there we go
hi<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.250> once<00:01:54.579> I<00:01:54.700> got<00:01:54.909> these<00:01:55.030> on<00:01:55.299> there<00:01:55.509> I<00:01:55.540> found

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
hi so once I got these on there I found

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.240 
hi so once I got these on there I found
that<00:01:56.110> there<00:01:56.229> was<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.409> little<00:01:56.740> bit<00:01:56.890> too<00:01:57.100> much

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
that there was a little bit too much

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.560 
that there was a little bit too much
play<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.619> I<00:02:00.130> went<00:02:00.610> back<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.030> I<00:02:01.119> looked<00:02:01.390> and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
play so I went back and I looked and

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.270 
play so I went back and I looked and
that<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.899> inner<00:02:02.110> diameter<00:02:02.439> on<00:02:03.130> this<00:02:03.700> tire

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
that the inner diameter on this tire

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.770 
that the inner diameter on this tire
shaft<00:02:06.280> is<00:02:06.670> actually<00:02:07.149> a<00:02:07.179> little<00:02:07.420> bit<00:02:07.539> bigger

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
shaft is actually a little bit bigger

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.000 
shaft is actually a little bit bigger
than<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:09.399> regular<00:02:09.819> lawn<00:02:10.090> tractor<00:02:10.630> shaft<00:02:11.010> so

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
than the regular lawn tractor shaft so

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.070 
than the regular lawn tractor shaft so
in<00:02:12.400> order<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.760> compensate<00:02:13.090> for<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.690> what<00:02:14.050> I

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
in order to compensate for that what I

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.050 
in order to compensate for that what I
did<00:02:14.319> was<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.650> found<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.069> piece<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.310> really<00:02:15.700> thin

chair<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.430> few<00:02:18.580> years<00:02:19.000> ago

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
chair a few years ago

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.920 
chair a few years ago
and<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:20.709> cut<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:21.519> down<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.239> was<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.569> length

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
and I cut it down so it was the length

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.370 
and I cut it down so it was the length
that<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.350> shaft<00:02:23.590> went<00:02:23.980> through<00:02:24.310> I<00:02:24.780> cut<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.989> slit

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
that the shaft went through I cut a slit

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.979 
that the shaft went through I cut a slit
out<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.890> side<00:02:27.100> of<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.549> was<00:02:28.180> able<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.510> put

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
out the side of it and was able to put

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.500 
out the side of it and was able to put
it<00:02:29.110> in<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.620> center<00:02:30.010> piece<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.120> now

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
it in the center piece so that now

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.500 
it in the center piece so that now
there's<00:02:32.160> hardly<00:02:33.160> any<00:02:33.430> play<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.269> it

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510
