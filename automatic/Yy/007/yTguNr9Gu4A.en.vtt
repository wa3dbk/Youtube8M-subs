have idea is that soon as you bring that

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.020 
have idea is that soon as you bring that
leg<00:04:06.599> up<00:04:06.930> all<00:04:07.439> of<00:04:07.980> your<00:04:08.129> muscles<00:04:08.519> will<00:04:08.639> size<00:04:08.819> up

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
leg up all of your muscles will size up

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.509 
leg up all of your muscles will size up
you<00:04:09.239> will<00:04:09.389> come<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:09.629> have<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.810> crunch<00:04:10.519> feeling

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519

you will come I have a crunch feeling
and<00:04:11.849> this<00:04:12.239> will<00:04:13.139> actually<00:04:13.319> force<00:04:13.859> up<00:04:14.219> the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
and this will actually force up the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.909 
and this will actually force up the
leader<00:04:14.819> to<00:04:15.120> actually<00:04:15.569> rotate<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.530> opposite

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
leader to actually rotate the opposite

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.879 
leader to actually rotate the opposite
direction<00:04:18.139> so<00:04:19.139> again<00:04:19.410> what<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.680> should<00:04:19.859> look

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
direction so again what that should look

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.770 
direction so again what that should look
like<00:04:20.750> we're<00:04:21.750> in<00:04:21.810> Georgia<00:04:23.389> all<00:04:24.389> right

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
like we're in Georgia all right

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.189 
like we're in Georgia all right
as<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:25.320> come<00:04:25.470> out<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:25.979> it's<00:04:26.610> like<00:04:26.759> free

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
as you come out of it it's like free

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.589 
as you come out of it it's like free
scoop<00:04:28.199> around<00:04:28.909> and<00:04:29.909> that's<00:04:30.150> I<00:04:30.270> help<00:04:30.479> you

rotate<00:04:31.020> me<00:04:31.050> in<00:04:31.289> the<00:04:31.380> direction<00:04:32.000> if<00:04:33.000> you<00:04:33.440> don't

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
rotate me in the direction if you don't

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.719 
rotate me in the direction if you don't
do<00:04:35.610> this<00:04:36.120> is<00:04:36.900> powerful<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:37.979> you<00:04:38.039> kind<00:04:38.550> of<00:04:38.580> do

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
do this is powerful and you kind of do

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.540 
do this is powerful and you kind of do
it<00:04:38.789> a<00:04:38.820> little<00:04:38.940> bit<00:04:39.180> less<00:04:39.539> like<00:04:40.259> this<00:04:40.590> um<00:04:40.979> he's

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
it a little bit less like this um he's

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.879 
it a little bit less like this um he's
not<00:04:41.580> going<00:04:41.880> to<00:04:41.909> have<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.389> urge<00:04:42.570> to<00:04:42.680> spin<00:04:43.680> out

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
not going to have the urge to spin out

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.800 
not going to have the urge to spin out
of<00:04:43.919> this<00:04:44.159> of<00:04:44.340> course<00:04:44.370> it's<00:04:45.000> not<00:04:45.449> going<00:04:45.659> to

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
of this of course it's not going to

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.360 
of this of course it's not going to
force<00:04:46.169> them<00:04:46.320> together<00:04:46.500> directionally<00:04:47.250> as

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
force them together directionally as

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.589 
force them together directionally as
much<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.539> that<00:04:48.720> might<00:04:48.870> look<00:04:49.349> like<00:04:49.409> this<00:04:50.599> go

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
much and so that might look like this go

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:56.240 
much and so that might look like this go
down<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:55.050> it<00:04:55.470> might<00:04:55.740> be<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.949> little<00:04:56.070> bit

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
down and so it might be a little bit

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.980 
down and so it might be a little bit
more<00:04:56.400> relaxed

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
more relaxed

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.089 
more relaxed
okay<00:04:57.990> so<00:04:58.409> just<00:04:58.560> make<00:04:58.680> sure<00:04:58.740> if<00:04:58.889> you<00:04:58.979> really

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
okay so just make sure if you really

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:00.230 
okay so just make sure if you really
want<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.370> forcing<00:04:59.699> in<00:04:59.789> a<00:04:59.820> direction<00:05:00.210> you

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
want to forcing in a direction you

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.570 
want to forcing in a direction you
really
