00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 The famous Hagia Sophia in Istanbul 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.740
 is the best example of one 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.080
 the house of God over the years of the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.150
 time was rededicated again and again 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.690
 Earlier , Irish church will pay one 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.029
 mosque today museum a similar 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.609
 there is currently change in hamburg there 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.029
 becomes a former evangelical church 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.060
 just converted to the mosque what next 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.289
 was eyed with suspicion and discomfort 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.520
 that's what christina hansen tells us 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.950
 the cross will come to an end 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.870
 dismantled when everything is ready when 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.649
 the new neighbors will be moving in 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.809
 not clear yet 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.239
 the construction work is progressing but still 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.219
 was missing only a community money her 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.239
 chairman daniel abt team has become 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.610
 made a lot 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.800
 the former christian kapernaum church 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.629
 to be a jewel once a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.699
 open meeting center of 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:59.070
 religions most mosque projects up 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.239
 now society has split 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.840
 and this project welds the 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.909
 society together 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.979
 Twelve years ago, the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.409
 Protestant church the building to one 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.270
 investor sold since then it stood empty 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.520
 two years ago then took over 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.460
 Islamic community the dilapidated house 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.420
 not only ambiguous feelings at the beginning 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.340
 in the neighborhood 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.080
 in the meantime one knows each other better 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.750
 Again and again there are guided tours 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.460
 I was curious at the construction site 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.689
 a little bit of fear, too 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.509
 a church becomes a mosque 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.119
 but I have to say it as open as that 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.350
 everything was presented here I am 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.790
 actually of the opinion that I 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.990
 next time come back to me 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.180
 to inform more 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.329
 basically, I find that completely notes 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.180
 that from christian churches mosques 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.329
 if the mentioned steps I will 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.590
 So find it important if you are now 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:54.960
 it turns at least one church 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.979
 holy space remains and that is one 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.200
 space in which a further prayed 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.189
 holy and dignified room so now 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.110
 for muslims 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.570
 So far, the faithful of the community 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.130
 here housed an unadorned 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.710
 speedy underground car park 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.660
 no exception but everyday for many 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.240
 Muslim communities are missing everywhere 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.780
 not only in Hamburg at reasonable 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.480
 Praying the politics and the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.090
 public expect muslims from us 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.800
 more transparency and transparency 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.050
 You really can not always go out 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.210
 to bring underground garages 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.100
 we just want to be visible the 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.570
 Protestant parish on the spot 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.550
 supports the new neighbors 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.890
 initial concerns are cleared up 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.970
 possibly not for this new use 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.730
 remain single case 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.010
 because of the predominantly positive 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.740
 echos this development here in hamburg 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.810
 has also set 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.330
 a new thinking within the church 1 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.710
 What happens to ours? 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.160
 buildings if we no longer hold them 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.740
 can 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.420
 instead of a cross will be here by the way 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.760
 not the Islamic crescent in the future 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.740
 the one only community wants everyone 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.330
 therefore, it will appeal to believers 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.380
 a lettering with the arabic 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.380
 give names of god
