moisturizing in sections works really

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.010 
moisturizing in sections works really
good<00:04:01.160> because<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.640> don't<00:04:01.790> abandon<00:04:02.540> any<00:04:02.750> part

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
good because you don't abandon any part

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.750 
good because you don't abandon any part
of<00:04:03.080> your<00:04:03.230> hair<00:04:03.500> like<00:04:03.740> some<00:04:03.980> people<00:04:04.310> ban<00:04:04.610> in

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
of your hair like some people ban in

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.990 
of your hair like some people ban in
their<00:04:04.940> nape<00:04:05.180> some<00:04:05.990> people<00:04:06.340> abandon<00:04:07.340> the

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
their nape some people abandon the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.030 
their nape some people abandon the
middle<00:04:08.300> of<00:04:08.390> their<00:04:08.570> hair<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.230> they'll<00:04:09.830> get

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
middle of their hair and they'll get

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.490 
middle of their hair and they'll get
breakage<00:04:10.520> in<00:04:10.700> those<00:04:10.850> particular<00:04:11.780> areas<00:04:12.290> and

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
breakage in those particular areas and

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.930 
breakage in those particular areas and
they<00:04:12.740> can't<00:04:12.980> figure<00:04:13.220> out<00:04:13.310> why<00:04:13.580> and<00:04:13.850> that's

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
they can't figure out why and that's

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.400 
they can't figure out why and that's
because<00:04:14.300> they're<00:04:14.450> taking<00:04:14.630> their<00:04:14.900> moisturiser

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
because they're taking their moisturiser

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.810 
because they're taking their moisturiser
on<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.590> conditioner<00:04:16.040> and<00:04:16.190> they're<00:04:16.609> just
