00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
that's it very simple and the first

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.690 
that's it very simple and the first
application<00:01:31.079> i'm<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.070> show<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.310> is

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
application i'm going to show you is

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.660 
application i'm going to show you is
called<00:01:32.759> sketch<00:01:33.299> box<00:01:33.570> sketch<00:01:34.560> box<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> free

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
called sketch box sketch box is a free

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.870 
called sketch box sketch box is a free
application<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:37.100> if<00:01:38.100> i<00:01:38.310> minimize<00:01:38.729> this

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
application and if i minimize this

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.880 
application and if i minimize this
window<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.840> pretty<00:01:40.259> much<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> same<00:01:40.710> as

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
window it's pretty much the same as

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.010 
window it's pretty much the same as
stickies<00:01:41.310> when<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> first<00:01:41.850> kind<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.720> look<00:01:42.869> at

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
stickies when you first kind of look at

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.679 
stickies when you first kind of look at
it<00:01:43.170> these<00:01:43.590> floating<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.369> notes<00:01:44.689> but

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
it these floating little notes but

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.030 
it these floating little notes but
there's<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.990> lot<00:01:46.200> more<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.799> do<00:01:47.009> with

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
there's a lot more that you can do with

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.819 
there's a lot more that you can do with
it<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:48.090> if<00:01:48.299> i<00:01:48.390> open<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.780> window<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
it so if i open this window in the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.350 
it so if i open this window in the
preferences<00:01:50.340> by<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.549> way<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.030> make<00:01:51.210> it

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
preferences by the way you can make it

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.719 
preferences by the way you can make it
so<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.720> window<00:01:52.079> won't<00:01:52.320> open<00:01:52.710> when<00:01:53.369> he<00:01:53.399> wants

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
so this window won't open when he wants

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.300 
so this window won't open when he wants
the<00:01:53.820> application<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.780> bugs<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:56.250> you

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the application if that bugs you so you

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.280 
the application if that bugs you so you
can<00:01:56.729> actually<00:01:56.909> separate<00:01:57.600> your<00:01:57.780> sticky<00:01:58.110> notes

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
can actually separate your sticky notes

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.649 
can actually separate your sticky notes
into<00:01:58.619> different<00:01:58.920> categories<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.509> gives

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
into different categories and it gives

camera icon I can actually take a
picture<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.910> takes<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.239> picture<00:02:42.420> of

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
picture of it so it takes a picture of

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.850 
picture of it so it takes a picture of
whatever<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.290> directly<00:02:43.650> behind<00:02:43.860> this<00:02:44.130> do<00:02:45.860> so

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
whatever is directly behind this do so

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.800 
whatever is directly behind this do so
now<00:02:47.010> there's<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.340> little<00:02:47.459> there's<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.600> paint

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
now there's a little there's the paint

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.350 
now there's a little there's the paint
stroke<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.380> it's<00:02:49.680> on<00:02:49.799> top<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.069> a<00:02:50.459> screenshot

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.660 

and<00:02:54.360> that's<00:02:55.319> really<00:02:55.500> all<00:02:55.739> there<00:02:55.769> is<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.310> sketch

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
and that's really all there is to sketch

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.630 
and that's really all there is to sketch
box<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:57.900> really<00:02:58.440> nice<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.680> his<00:02:59.040> preferences

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
so you can change the default size of

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.229 
so you can change the default size of
the<00:03:02.099> sticky<00:03:02.370> if<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:02.640> want<00:03:02.819> them<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.030> be

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
smaller or bigger just like in stickies

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.479 
smaller or bigger just like in stickies

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
know what you can change the default

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.220 
know what you can change the default
font<00:03:16.170> like<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.799> way<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.099> text<00:03:17.430> will<00:03:17.579> look

obviously you can customize the color of
the<00:06:34.360> sticky<00:06:34.720> and<00:06:34.900> the<00:06:34.990> width<00:06:35.169> text<00:06:35.620> looks<00:06:36.960> but

costs<00:06:40.750> money<00:06:41.319> I'm<00:06:41.590> not<00:06:41.740> sure<00:06:41.800> how<00:06:42.430> much<00:06:42.610> I

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139

think<00:06:44.139> it<00:06:44.259> might<00:06:44.440> actually<00:06:44.680> be<00:06:44.949> like<00:06:45.460> twenty

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030

think it might actually be like twenty
dollars<00:06:46.389> which<00:06:46.569> is<00:06:46.600> kind<00:06:47.110> of<00:06:47.169> ridiculous<00:06:47.430> but

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430
