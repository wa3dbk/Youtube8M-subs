00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.660
 there are people there are people if you are here is 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.230
 because you have an operating system of 32 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.389
 bits if that is the case then of kings that 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.339
 basically do the same as the 64's 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.449
 only bits that would install the system 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:19.800
 the 64 bit which means that you go 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.539
 to the same page of java 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.220
 Java 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.890
 dot com 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.109
 the point is the free download of 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.470
 call and follow the steps as any 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.820
 installation and / or the 32nd hub will be installed 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.000
 bits 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.860
 then baixas control panel 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.860
 normally what would come out is category 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.780
 the fact is that he does not believe is easier 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.370
 look for it here then you give icons 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.380
 small or large does not matter 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.380
 little ones and you look for 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.260
 here ya go 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.809
 you give a click 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.750
 since the power of control the panel 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.070
 control key and here where it says 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.780
 View and manage the configuration 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.000
 general to try and you are going to see 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.040
 since you will get a series of codes not 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.190
 lend importance to them the one that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.500
 it's important is this here it's worth it 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.950
 you have a 32-bit operating system 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.930
 means that if you have more than 4 gigabytes 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.049
 you have installed more than the account since 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.810
 It is not efficient to install more than 4 gigabytes 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.390
 in a 32-bit operating system the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.240
 if it is normal that you had 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:39.340
 from 4 to below so if you have 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.479
 4 put instead of 4,096 you put another 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.719
 code that I will put in the description 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.409
 for example I have 8 gigs which 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:51.520
 means that 4 thousand 96 megabytes are the 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:55.630
 half of 8 GB that are 4 GB and one Giga 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.420
 1024 mb are so good and so 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.679
 you can go calculating how much you are going and this 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.780
 it is also a clarification on the other 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.849
 video people were like I did not know 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.090
 really what it was but good a 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:09.280
 little explanation of computing and 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.580
 then you put the code here I by 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.450
 example I have this no 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.850
 but you change it be here what 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.040
 I'll put in big with the cant asia and 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.250
 Well, you're basically giving it to 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.980
 accept accept and the most normal thing is that 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.360
 would give you is that the minecraft would be 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:34.520
 a little faster and you're basically 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.520
 so goodbye very good and even another
