00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.900
 I am a Frank Katy and I changed here to 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.440
 the pacific university for 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.410
 study advertising and it's been a while 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.770
 studying and this is my fourth year of 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.140
 advertising and I'm super happy with the 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.100
 environment with people with school with 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.700
 all 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.200
 and I always loved my career very much and I 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.670
 that I was lucky that very few 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.820
 university students have to point to the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.160
 race to the first 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.720
 for something when I changed university 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.460
 I got into exactly the same race 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.630
 I'm super happy studying advertising 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.470
 I'm in love with my career 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.590
 these points is happening super well and I hope 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.610
 finish doing what I like good 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.040
 He left one of the things that I enjoy the most 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.800
 every time it seems that all the 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.989
 world knows what you do 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.160
 it shows that there is experience behind 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.890
 everything that is done here in the 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.570
 university and try to help you all 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.269
 the possible ways are all like 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.949
 welcoming in general I'm super happy 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.510
 here and I feel much more part of the 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.510
 university than the university 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.430
 as all things are trial and error 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.320
 to learn life 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.350
 I was not wrong in the race maybe but 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.330
 I got the wrong travel university 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.869
 have changed me so I find that 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.640
 it's an excellent decision and I'm super 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.030
 happy and although I do a little bit 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.390
 difficult the s 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.520
 in 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.640
 although they are all superior as 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.260
 the same ones are super demanding and 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.670
 for example yesterday table with 5-4 and the 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.530
 second best to us of the course and it was 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.150
 were three days without sleep to do 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.150
 work and are the best grade the course 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.509
 finish here and even if it's the second 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.640
 opportunity I am much happier than 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.320
 when we start so I'm more than 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.690
 satisfied 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:00.680
