00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 The tag I bring chocolate 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.300
 which is to name certain 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.630
 books according to the categories of 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.599
 chocolate let's start chocolate 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.250
 dark a book with dark themes and not 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.270
 I have read many thematic books 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.470
 dark but what more closely that is 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.519
 in what was discussed the saga of 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.320
 hunters shadows 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.170
 good the trilogy of hunters of 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.880
 shadows and I'll tell you what 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.649
 because I know how to respond but it is 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.579
 white chocolate a book with humor and 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.870
 for that I chose the red pyramid for 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.230
 remind me how to continue in 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.559
 race interact with each other obviously 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.410
 it's very funny because we are brothers and 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.420
 they only see each other twice a year and 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.329
 due to the circumstances that happen to the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.190
 beginning this book 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.039
 they have to spend a lot of time together 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.409
 now on and it's very nice to see 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.670
 how they insult themselves or they insult themselves with 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.200
 affection more or less like that the red pyramid 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.900
 chocolate milk a book with a lot 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.320
 advertising that you would like to read and that is 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.729
 the first way for the fifth wave with that 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.670
 is that he had spent what he read 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.670
 but I have not had the money 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.680
 and then I will leave it too 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.560
 wants because apparently it's going to give a 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.689
 movie I'll have you two to two 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.369
 actors of the main characters 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.810
 so if the fifth to the per requiem if 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.810
 mother- of- pearl chocolate in a book that you 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.479
 it made it feel sticky or syrupy when 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.110
 I read you and this book is number four 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.539
 why but heat this is the most book 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.130
 this is the book that less action has 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.530
 of the whole saga after a little 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.929
 special in human interaction between 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:02.179
 a boy and a teenage girl inau this 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:06.560

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.850
 romance and it was if this book kit kat a
