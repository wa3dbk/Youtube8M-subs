00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
dinner I'm not quite sure why it's being

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.580 
dinner I'm not quite sure why it's being
used<00:02:38.730> because<00:02:39.030> we<00:02:39.450> all<00:02:39.569> know<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:39.900> arsenic<00:02:40.470> is

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
used because we all know that arsenic is

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.070 
used because we all know that arsenic is
toxic<00:02:41.099> and<00:02:41.250> deadly<00:02:41.760> if<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.390> ingest<00:02:42.690> enough<00:02:42.930> of

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.229 
toxic and deadly if you ingest enough of
it<00:02:43.200> that's<00:02:43.980> why<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.160> EU<00:02:44.459> has<00:02:44.489> banned<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.150> use

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
it that's why the EU has banned the use

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.289 
it that's why the EU has banned the use
of<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.720> poultry<00:02:46.260> all<00:02:46.500> together<00:02:47.299> thoroughly

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
disgusted yet I know I am what's worse

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.699 
disgusted yet I know I am what's worse
is<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.019> Food<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.350> Drug<00:02:52.590> Administration

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
is that the Food and Drug Administration

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.340 
is that the Food and Drug Administration
is<00:02:53.370> supposed<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.790> be<00:02:53.880> one<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.239> only<00:02:54.810> groups

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
is supposed to be one of the only groups

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.770 
is supposed to be one of the only groups
that<00:02:55.500> identifies<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.280> harm<00:02:56.610> in<00:02:56.880> these<00:02:57.450> foods

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
that identifies the harm in these foods

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.509 
that identifies the harm in these foods
so<00:02:57.989> they<00:02:58.080> can<00:02:58.260> keep<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.650> as<00:02:58.739> far<00:02:59.069> away<00:02:59.190> from<00:02:59.280> our

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
so they can keep it as far away from our

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.660 
so they can keep it as far away from our
plates<00:02:59.819> as<00:02:59.970> possible<00:03:00.480> oh<00:03:00.739> right<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:02.069> would

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
plates as possible oh right I would

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.400 
plates as possible oh right I would
probably<00:03:02.819> require<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.720> government<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:04.080> cut

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
probably require the government to cut

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.140 
probably require the government to cut
the<00:03:04.530> stream<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:04.980> tens<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.430> millions<00:03:06.030> of

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
the stream of tens of millions of

lobbying dollars that's pumped into

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.190 
lobbying dollars that's pumped into
Congress<00:03:08.130> from<00:03:08.220> chemical<00:03:08.700> corporations<00:03:09.299> but

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
Congress from chemical corporations but

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.320 
Congress from chemical corporations but
surely<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.920> can't<00:03:11.190> be<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.370> hard<00:03:11.790> considering

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
surely it can't be that hard considering

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.150 
surely it can't be that hard considering
how<00:03:12.540> many<00:03:12.599> other<00:03:13.019> countries<00:03:13.530> have<00:03:13.739> already

how many other countries have already

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.550 
how many other countries have already
done<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.660> do<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.690> think<00:03:15.870> it's<00:03:15.989> time<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.260> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
done this do I think it's time that the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.380 
done this do I think it's time that the
FDA<00:03:16.859> start<00:03:17.190> looking<00:03:17.459> out<00:03:17.549> for<00:03:17.790> our<00:03:17.910> health
