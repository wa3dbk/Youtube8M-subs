seem to have something wrong with them
as<00:00:38.699> well<00:00:38.850> my<00:00:39.449> guess<00:00:39.510> would<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.050> they

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
as well my guess would be that they

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.950 
as well my guess would be that they
might<00:00:41.609> have<00:00:41.760> been<00:00:41.789> left<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> garage<00:00:42.480> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
might have been left in the garage and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.509 
might have been left in the garage and
it<00:00:43.410> being<00:00:43.679> a<00:00:43.769> garage<00:00:43.980> there<00:00:44.250> could<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.460> been

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
it being a garage there could have been

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.610 
it being a garage there could have been
supplies<00:00:45.089> that<00:00:45.960> they<00:00:45.989> could<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.440> easily

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
supplies that they could have easily

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.619 
supplies that they could have easily
gotten<00:00:46.980> into<00:00:47.429> knocked<00:00:47.969> over<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.600> of

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
gotten into knocked over a can of

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.599 
gotten into knocked over a can of

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
something that dumped on them and it

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:52.099 
something that dumped on them and it
kind<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.089> soaked<00:00:51.359> into<00:00:51.539> their<00:00:51.839> skins
