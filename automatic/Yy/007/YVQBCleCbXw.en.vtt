00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:12.259
 good good good good good good good good good I 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.289
 I wandered in the small meadow 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.160
 colorful you see it's cute 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.359
 yes that's what this 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.500
 loop to infinity you will be able 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.119
 to do any speech during 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.990
 that you play and especially from the moment 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.430
 where are you going crisis and you are going 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.750
 start doing anything and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.470
 invent words like that and you 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.490
 go see it's going to be awesome 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.500
 come on hi everybody knows atomium 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.140
 and welcome to indymac for the review 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.630
 who accompanies the test of the florise 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.610
 gely as you can see I 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.600
 bounced on freeze on budget lee if 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.160
 you do not know what it is and ben 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.030
 so be careful what is there 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.739
 maybe people among you who do not 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.820
 do not know what geli wholesale 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.920
 it's an English dessert we'll say a 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.750
 kind of back that you heat 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.670
 in which you put a powder and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.809
 then when ben it's a bit like 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.039
 agar agar wholesale when it's okay 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.840
 cool it will make a kind of gel 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.550
 a gel well disgusting a gel to his 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.840
 characteristics you know it's this 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.670
 kind of stuff there that can be shaken like 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.840
 it's like a big moron and who 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.730
 makes succession of movements is c 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.049
 particular and in fact movements 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.600
 that are close enough to what you 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.340
 can see in this game so what's that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.360
 basically speaking it's a game of 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.220
 platform all there is more 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.020
 basic I you the rope you will see 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.490
 that this is not a game that revolutionizes 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.200
 completely the kind of platform 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.090
 and yet and yet it is rather 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.560
 nice actually not already because 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.110
 visually it's pretty cool 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.000
 so to make royal donations do you 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.979
 in simplicity you see that we have 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.960
 here only geometric shapes with 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.820
 degraded prices all to things that one 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.700
 could imagine doing it yourself 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.500
 when we see the image stop 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.520
 well listen I'm sorry but with 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.350
 photoshop you do it can take 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.960
 three minutes except that magic except 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.180
 two florists gel is also his 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.860
 animation its theme and its gameplay 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.270
 finally that is rather well found 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.200
 which is all stupid frankly that's all 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.159
 stupid I think there are plenty of 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.329
 developers when they saw it's his 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.780
 design was waiting why I did not think 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.310
 before 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.170
 but why but why it's not 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.390
 possible it is very inspired games 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.799
 as locoroco or so also then to 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.780
 Tangier I had another jld in mind and 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.009
 I lost them Patapon here it is 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.630
 so all that was said by the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.880
 developer of course sure sure his blog a 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.930
 young inventor nothing and basically there 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.979
 send that visually it's rather 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.240
 cool then to almost a point of view the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.289
 gameplay it is played 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.149
 really like a platform game 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.489
 basic you only have the fact of you 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.620
 move and jump as possibilities 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.030
 and after that actually are the levels that 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.959
 will become more and more complicated 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.700
 with different traps 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.080
 there for example you see that I am 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.030
 in a phase where there are quills and 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.200
 so I have to be careful not to 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.340
 not meet them so wait at this 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.769
 what I'm going to do is we'll do 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.330
 a big jump like that besides you 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.849
 see a game jumps not very high base 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.110
 but actually saw that I bounce well 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.370
 I can bounce like this more and 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.500
 higher a little bit like a 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.340
 in fact, it is more or less 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.739
 so that 's going to be also the 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.150
 we'll say things the thing it's 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.129
 really the thing that will be most 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.390
 asked to handle like that the jumps and 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.620
 manage the wild young because you 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.629
 can also do the same thing on the side 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.250
 walt jump there in fact we will deform 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.300
 the ground to get to the small 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.430
 window is actually I think you 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.660
 have understood in this game grosso modo 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.310
 what to do is go from 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.080
 window in window you will have like that 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.879
 shortcuts and you'll have 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.870
 also little tips then this one 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.430
 I like it for example you go 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.840
 see what I'm going to have to do is 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.629
 wait now I'll be fine 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.280
 ready to pay attention wait to be 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.299
 down and then hop there I can 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.769
 the ones on the right so I'm not sure 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.920
 very first exit but that's it 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.040
 works I assure you I will not go there 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.040
 arrive 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.000
 you will see that I will stay 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.470
 planted there that and see it I could 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.610
 pass underneath so it went from 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.780
 right and limit I want you 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.629
 to say we would almost have thought that 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.060
 would not pass right then so we 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.040
 touch one of the big worries of the game the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.870
 only really big worries a doggie game 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.640
 superphone me I really spent a 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.799
 good time on it good it costs $ 10 I 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.569
 know only for those who are from school 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.400
 of yes it must correspond to the duration 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.600
 of life the price all to bala and and yes 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.829
 you may be a little bit 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.410
 little ticked since we finish the game pretty 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.200
 quickly but what to see too 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.329
 is that suddenly and so you have a 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.010
 defect a single fault is that of the 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.470
 collision does it so it's not seen 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.700
 that much but then you have I can 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.769
 give you the most accurate example 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.970
 it's the one of the zone with the 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.680
 dotted when we will not see it here 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.700
 because it is a little further and in 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.109
 did I have to start over 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.120
 part to tell you about this game but 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.440
 roughly speaking there just at 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.269
 passage we are in a central hall where 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.250
 you have several accessible areas and 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.099
 so here I am going to go accessibility 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.170
 spot that interests me but basically yes 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.459
 here it is 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.660
 the area with the dots is enough 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.040
 particular because you have 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.019
 exactly what kind of platform there 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.350
 except that when you are falling 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.450
 free 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.220
 well you cross the platform 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.340
 as if it had no consistency 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.690
 we will say and I say that it may be 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.250
 thus may have that will perhaps 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.639
 that we will be able to see it finally and 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.070
 if not when you're against so 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.720
 when you do 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.460
 we will say when you are against the 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.510
 wall like when I passed a slip 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.530
 against amiens to be done or to job because 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.000
 that I let myself down but basically 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.200
 here are you touching the walls and well 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.820
 there it recovers a consistency so in 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.510
 big here we drop the thing 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.600
 does not have consistency 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.980
 we slide against and there we have 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.630
 consistency and in fact it's going to give rise 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.670
 to riddles quite complicated but the 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.110
 problem is that everything will play on the 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.460
 collision and that's where the fishing game 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.200
 so it's true it's a little bit 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.150
 a bit of a shame it's a little complicated and 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.500
 it's not necessarily what's more 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.210
 seller when we see the game there by 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.310
 against that it's a part of the game that 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.710
 flows all that concerns like that the 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.570
 very inspired rotation of fez elsewhere 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.860
 know it's again the 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.440
 developer who said I do not invent 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.360
 nothing but here are these phases in fact 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.890
 were inspired by it actually 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.960
 sir jan schnider by the way i did 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.790
 not said a gentleman who made beautiful 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.210
 really good job 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.530
 job 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.900
 so wait where do you need 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.440
 that I go so we reused like that 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.060
 this is the way to turn the scene 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.710
 is actually you like that for 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.480
 each environment a type of riddles 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.280
 particular the gold will not always be the 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.420
 same thing do not worry and of 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.980
 anyway it will become each time 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.930
 more and more hard and it's true that 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.190
 so we do not get bored we do not 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.930
 Bored not good it's a little game 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.210
 it's a big, unpretentious game 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.290
 clearly but on which one can 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.060
 have a good time and especially there you 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.730
 see you hear this music it's 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.160
 still very pretty and in addition to me the 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.810
 stuff that really feasted on me it's gone 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.210
 a little we will read artistic 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.860
 this bias of simplicity but 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.590
 especially all the animation that is done 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.700
 around that actually see the theme of 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.140
 frost is respected but suddenly you have 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.440
 full of animations that will have 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.330
 place 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.890
 lee and ben that's all that is glued
