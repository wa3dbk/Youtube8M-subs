00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
right into it the first one would you

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.050 
right into it the first one would you
rather<00:00:15.330> fart<00:00:15.809> rainbows<00:00:16.049> or<00:00:16.590> burp<00:00:16.920> bubbles<00:00:17.670> I'm

gonna have to go with burping bubbles

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.200

because<00:00:19.980> if<00:00:20.100> I'm<00:00:20.220> farting<00:00:20.550> rainbows<00:00:20.699> like

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
because if I'm farting rainbows like

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.630 
because if I'm farting rainbows like
that's<00:00:21.840> really<00:00:22.230> obvious<00:00:22.380> like<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.279> can't<00:00:23.519> get

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
that's really obvious like you can't get

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.040 
that's really obvious like you can't get
away<00:00:23.850> with<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.240> can't<00:00:24.449> even<00:00:24.630> hide<00:00:24.840> it

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
away with that you can't even hide it

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.849 
away with that you can't even hide it
it's<00:00:25.230> like<00:00:25.439> oh<00:00:25.680> hey<00:00:26.460> there's<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.480> rainbow

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
it's like oh hey there's a rainbow

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.359 
it's like oh hey there's a rainbow
coming<00:00:28.859> out<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:30.170> my<00:00:31.170> butt<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.619> want<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> part

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
coming out of my butt I want a part

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.590 
coming out of my butt I want a part
bubbles<00:00:32.669> that'd<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.059> great

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
bubbles that'd be great

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.150 
bubbles that'd be great
would<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.989> rather<00:00:34.110> have<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> remote<00:00:34.890> that

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
would you rather have a remote that

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.700 
would you rather have a remote that
could<00:00:35.340> rewind<00:00:35.820> or<00:00:36.239> fast-forward<00:00:36.809> time

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
could rewind or fast-forward time

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.670 
could rewind or fast-forward time
probably<00:00:38.690> rewind<00:00:39.690> because<00:00:40.170> if<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.530> can

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
probably rewind because if I can

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.530 
probably rewind because if I can
fast-forward<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.610> time<00:00:41.850> then<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.450> I

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
fast-forward the time then like I

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.450 
fast-forward the time then like I
probably<00:00:42.780> can't<00:00:43.140> go<00:00:43.260> back<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.129> then<00:00:44.309> I'm<00:00:44.430> just

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
probably can't go back and then I'm just

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.580 
probably can't go back and then I'm just
losing<00:00:44.879> time<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.510> would<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> rewind

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
losing time so I would like to rewind

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.959 
losing time so I would like to rewind
