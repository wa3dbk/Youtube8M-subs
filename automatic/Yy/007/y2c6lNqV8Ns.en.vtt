back<00:03:11.300> in<00:03:11.770> that's<00:03:12.770> what<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:12.980> did<00:03:13.250> at<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.460> end<00:03:13.670> and

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
back in that's what I did at the end and

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.770 
back in that's what I did at the end and
the<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:15.350> saw<00:03:15.560> how<00:03:15.770> easily<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:17.120> Rope<00:03:17.360> can<00:03:17.660> be

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
the you saw how easily the Rope can be

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.900 
the you saw how easily the Rope can be
fed<00:03:18.050> out<00:03:18.230> except<00:03:18.830> for<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.130> beginning<00:03:19.490> which

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
fed out except for the beginning which

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.370 
fed out except for the beginning which
it<00:03:20.120> has<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:20.480> locking<00:03:20.900> map

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
it has the locking map

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.640 
it has the locking map
so<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:22.580> think<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:23.480> is<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.840> best<00:03:23.990> rip<00:03:24.260> done<00:03:24.470> on

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
so I think this is the best rip done on

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.910 
so I think this is the best rip done on
YouTube<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.430> swivel<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.800> didn't<00:03:27.800> see

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
YouTube and the swivel so I didn't see

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.600 
YouTube and the swivel so I didn't see
why<00:03:28.070> it<00:03:28.130> isn't<00:03:28.400> but<00:03:28.760> yeah<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:30.470> as<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.130> promised

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
why it isn't but yeah and as I promised

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.270 
why it isn't but yeah and as I promised
