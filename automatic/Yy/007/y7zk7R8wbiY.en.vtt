00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
small curl in it when I'm styling it so

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.520 
small curl in it when I'm styling it so

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
I'm doing this to get a different effect

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.680 
I'm doing this to get a different effect
versus<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.280> pipe<00:02:13.490> cleaners<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.270> didn't<00:02:14.570> want

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
you can take the two ends and you tie it

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.380

people can push it to two but the nicest
high<00:02:54.750> despite<00:02:55.110> center<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:56.060> these<00:02:57.060> curls<00:02:57.420> just

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
high despite center so these curls just

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.610 
high despite center so these curls just
want<00:02:57.810> list<00:02:58.020> is<00:02:58.200> long<00:02:58.410> but<00:03:00.200> they're<00:03:01.200> still<00:03:01.319> cute
