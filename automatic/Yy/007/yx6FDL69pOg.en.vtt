00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.389
 five days late in Spanish in 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.490
 get the first victory of the 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.900
 season but finally it came for 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.990
 alleviate a start of season 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.330
 doubtful of those of sergio gonzález el 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.880
 triumph in a thick match came 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.330
 against the getafe at the powerade stadium 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.720
 in a meeting in which the set of 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.000
 sergio gonzález needed that first 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.769
 triumph to calm tempers like 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.199
 we said after a start of 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.769
 season where I had just added 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.900
 two draws and two losses in four 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.129
 dates of the championship the first great 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.659
 occasion of the meeting was signed by 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.670
 Spanish with this service of saves 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:46.159
 seville and the header from sergio 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.160
 Garcia who managed to divert Vicente 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:51.370
 guaita 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.160
 in the corner kick the extension 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.590
 Alvaro Gonzales finished with this 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.010
 lack of felipe caicedo in the fight with 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.010
 alexis 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.769
 and there it ended 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.509
 the opportunity for espanyol 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.549
 who manages to reject practically 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.020
 on the line is álvaro arroyo that 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.450
 formed on the right side of getafe 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.030
 in absence of valera one of the casualties 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.259
 by injury of the cosmetic box against 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.700
 the best occasion of the whole of Madrid 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.039
 and in the first half was this shot 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.090
 from outside the sarabia area that 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.130
 managed to deflect to corner 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.619
 kiko box the goalkeeper of espanyol 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.929
 we are already in the second half where 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.340
 the getafe started much better but it was the 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:33.950
 Espanyol who would get the goals 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.509
 here he stayed close to víctor sanchez 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.640
 after this sending back lucas 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.640
 vázquez in one action 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.369
 it would occur very similarly in 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.759
 the 0 2 in the 2 to 0 forgiveness for the 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.759
 Spanish 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.540
 the replica of the getafe arrived in this 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.800
 opening play to the left of michel 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.800
 for diego castro 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.580
 again mechel and the shot that 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.750
 forced to intervene once more to kiko 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.990
 box and the getafe played without a pure 9 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.710
 I introduced cosmetics against angel lafita 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.260
 as offensive reference of the set 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.300
 azulón and it would be already in the second part 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.590
 when Abbey appeared on the 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.590
 playing field also samir 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.070
 and this is karim widow who debuted with the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.110
 getafe shirt very inactive in the 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.450
 first part with more presence in the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.970
 second and with this shot as best 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.860
 opportunity to try to open the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.470
 account who would be able to do it would be 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.440
 Sergio Garcia in this play the pass that 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.000
 he puts salva sevilla is luxury and not what 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.490
 He missed Sergio García, who 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.490
 65 put the 1-0 on the scoreboard 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.069
 there we see again 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.219
 the walk 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.609
 of salva sevilla and without letting it fall 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:03.579
 Sergio Garcia scores before the start of 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.739
 guaita the espanyol was looking for the second 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.380
 for greater tranquility of the parish 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.120
 local 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.330
 of head was going up to christian 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.330
 stuani 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.030
 the Uruguayan who was not a starter came out in 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.319
 the second part 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.319
 and it would be the protagonist 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.380
 with the second goal for the Spanish if the 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.740
 I tried to save Sevilla with that shot 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.840
 from the balcony of the departing area 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.220
 deflected 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.220
 to the right of the goal of guaita 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.920
 and it would be in this play 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.560
 in which the second goal of the 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.870
 Spanish receives lucas vázquez sits 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.430
 sergio squire sends to the canvas back no 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.220
 can finish salva sevilla but if 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.990
 does in two times 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.430
 christian stuani Uruguayan goal that already 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.500
 he had scored in front of the third málaga 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.870
 of the season as well as for sergio 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.510
 Garcia 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.690
 and victory for the Spanish was the minute 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.670
 83 match was already very little 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.270
 it was going to be too heavy a slab to 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.490
 the getafe who could not even 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.020
 endanger the triumph of espanyol 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.870
 with a bit that would bring him closer in 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.270
 bookmark at the end in the favorite 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.620
 Spanish exterior 2 getafe 1 first 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.190
