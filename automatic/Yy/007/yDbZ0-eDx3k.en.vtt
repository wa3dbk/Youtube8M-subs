00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:10.110
 Imagine software video tutorial cs3 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:13.280
 number 6 curved cut and dental arch 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.199
 in this tutorial we will explain how 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.230
 work in the curved cut and how 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.329
 position software by default 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.340
 when we activate the curved cut we 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:29.040
 presents an arcade that he calculates 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.810
 normally with few points 67 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.120
 points 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.750
 in any case we recommend 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.449
 always make an arcade of form 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.059
 manual since if the software does not 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.699
 correctly detects the jaw can 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.790
 do not draw it correctly for that 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.970
 we have in the tool section the 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:55.170
 icon manually create an arc so 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.930
 we activate and we can position ourselves in the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.900
 axial axis where more bone width 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.339
 we have normally close to the apices 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.260
 if the patient has his dentition 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.939
 we can move in the 3d view put 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.680
 that has disappeared us now in the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.689
 pseudo panoramic view and cuts 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.960
 transsexuals pushing the button 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.090
 right on the plane axial plane 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.180
 yellow and looking for precisely that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.259
 greater width of bone that defines us the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.049
 shape of the jaw for example here and 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.549
 we will draw normally few points in 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.909
 a core of 9,000 that is a volume 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.680
 focused following the one in my jaw 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.680
 normally then 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.600
 345 points and for large volumes 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.060
 including the stichting always 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.940
 we will draw five points one in the part 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.220
 posterior view jaw 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.610
 that we have of the jaw or 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.960
 maxilar another more or less at the height of 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.080
 canine centrally and symmetrically in the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.390
 On the other hand, we end up with a double click and 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.479
 we can see what the evolution of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 the pseudo panoramic in the marked view 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.630
 with the color red and with the red axis and 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.290
 the trans-axial cuts with the axis of 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.290
 color blue 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.080
 we can adjust these points if we have 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.450
 activated the tool the mode 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.000
 selection we see that we have the ability 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:27.459
 of adjusting those points for example then 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.800
 in order to see that said parabola 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.960
 is adjusted to the 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.000
 really the morphology we see that 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.070
 as we see from the certain points 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.920
 structures are more or less visible by 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.660
 example if we adjust a bit here behind 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.570
 we practically have all the conduit 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.800
 visible tooth we remember that we can 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.050
 to integrate 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.960
 several cuts for example up to 15 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.330
 millimeters to check that all the 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:59.120
 jaw all the bone is found 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.890
 within the area of the in this case 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.580
 7.5 meters ahead towards the area 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.050
 vestibular and 7.5 to the area as well 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.660
 we have our panoramic health 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.370
 reconstructed to which we can adjust 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.150
 brightness and contrasts with the button 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.630
 left 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.760
 we can make it a little darker 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.150
 we can even remember that we have 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.590
 also in this case the reconstruction 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.200
 mp for the maximum intensity projection 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.239
 and in the part of transsexual cuts 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.150
 then we can also divide the screen 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.099
 for example one with three cuts for 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.650
 adjust height and width of these cuts 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.709
 trans axial we have the icon of the 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:44.060
 height in the region of interest in this 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:47.480
 case of the pseudo panoramic we accept and 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.060
 the width is handled in the trans view 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:55.060
 axial can make wider said 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:58.310
 cuts or more narrow and very visually very 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.069
 intuitive to perform moving towards 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.599
 left and right we do not have the option 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.360
 in this case they are separated 2 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.830
 millimeters to see the morphology of the 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.890
 jaw 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.950
 even more so in this case the cut 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.300
 trans axial what can we angular will be very 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.780
 interesting when making the 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.030
 measurements for for example see really 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.310
 how that morphology changes we can 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.710
 angular what in the area where it really goes 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.780
 to be the introduction or can we angular 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.230
 what to check for example how is 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.450
 one of the roots of this prize lar 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:36.550
 is a very useful tool because we 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:39.440
 presents a real cut of the angulation 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.030
 desired is not always a cut in 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.490
 vertical as up to now as the 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.770
 medical cetes programs present us 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.790
 with its slow scan we can always 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:53.420
 return with the slide to position 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:56.090
 original of the axes 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.400
 and with this we have prepared our 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.860
 environment to start taking measurements 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.370
 and in this case the simulation of a 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.370
 implant
