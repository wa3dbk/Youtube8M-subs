 something that happened to me the other day 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.350
 so it would be interesting a match 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:38.820
 as you as experience 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.880
 a few days ago of products 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.750
 the police asked me to stop 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.670
 first because it does not say anything does not happen to me 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.420
 the red light with the stations of 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.760
 in front I throw the lights is wrong 2 and 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.190
 6 red lit me down and from the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.460
 bicycle and they get out of the car 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.980
 police approach they approach me 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.690
 they say they stopped me because they're not 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.430
 allowed to ride a bicycle with 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.890
 real headphones some idioms 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.530
 posts listening to the music and that I 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.479
 they're going to have to give a warning a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.780
 admonition and at first I thought that I 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.430
 they were giving an infraction and I was 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.520
 it made it a bit absurd that we were 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.430
 giving a violation at least 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.190
 I explained that I had no idea that I 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.440
 come to do that and well there are authors 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.470
 they explained that they were not fraction was 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.990
 only one communication was given to a 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.480
 red paper taker 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.210
 ministers 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.640
 and on my residence card and the bonus 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.110
 goes from japan that is to say he is a foreigner and 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.300
 advertising stops you by any 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.320
 they are not going to ask you to show them 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.000
 these documents by law 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.790
 the foreigners who live here must 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.280
 load with us 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.470
 If you are a tourist you have to carry 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.500
 your passport wherever you go 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.140
 because if for some reason they stop you and 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.270
 they ask you to show your passport 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.670
 You can take it to the department of 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.100
 new police three crops do not go 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.620
 to let out they will not let you go until 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.930
 that they can not corroborate what good 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.450
 that you are here legally so good 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.310
 they ask me for my residence card 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.660
 they asked me where I worked and 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.510
 I told them that I worked for this 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.390
 company and that I am also a teacher giving 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.910
 English classes and taking my data the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.600
 residence card and they let me go 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.850
 quietly but good that was my 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.370
 experience with the police my first 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.709
 time 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.560
 and well the only thing I can tell you is 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.860
 that if you come here, try 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.409
 load with those documents because good 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.379
 the police and in the right to stop them 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:52.049
 for any reason and ask them for the 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:55.170
 documents either the card 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.690
 residence to your passport heard from 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.280
 foreigners who stop them without any 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.209
 radiation in a reason simply the 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.780
 parents ask them to show their card 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.400
 residence or your passport to me never me 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.440
 it's happened that I've never been stopped without 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.079
 no reason until today that they stopped me 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.470
 for that reason but good the police is in 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.560
 all his right to do that and prevent him 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.460
 Your ID 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.110
 and well this has been my 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.230
 my experience with the police and I hope 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.670
 that is the last one too and well is it 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.200

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.170
