00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.790
 hello very good that we continue with more 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:05.770
 news to be projected in the 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.509
 next few minutes we will review the changes 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.690
 that the simulator has suffered during 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.639
 the first week of May 2013 we started 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.110
 with a new car and new license does 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.210
 a few months the first one was introduced 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.740
 mercedes benz although without the real name 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.210
 now it already has the denomination and 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.420
 real logos in addition to being included 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.490
 the mercedes benz sls amg gt3 a beast 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.020
 very complicated to control even without the 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.550
 interior made as you can see in this 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.110
 video is the second of the nine 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.910
 vehicles of the German brand that 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.910
 will include the game once it is finished 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.950
 another issue the regulations have given the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.300
 first step the introduction of 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.950
 flags of the moment anecdotally 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.660
 since it does not affect the level of 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.520
 sanctions and does not modify the rules of the 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.870
 career in any way but now if 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.610
 a car goes especially slowly or 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.650
 stands for some time in a 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.270
 point of the circuit when approaching that 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.310
 place will appear the classic flag 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.140
 yellow of course we will see with the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.730
 simulator finished the regulation 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.350
 full of flags that besides being 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.420
 shown in a superimposed form in 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.710
 screen or on the steering wheel of the car will be 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.780
 agitated by the track curators 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.520
 now we can also turn off or start 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.170
 cars we have active buttons 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.760
 for this purpose and it is expected that in 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.740
 This will make the outputs of the 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.150
 careers are manual first 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.680
 we turn on the car 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.680
 later we started the engine 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.500
 when we accelerate we go up on the march 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.670
 finally finally we can record the 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.349
 repetitions of online races 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.019
 included once they have finished 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.150
 when they finish click on save save 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.310
 and will be archived in baires sherlock 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.140
 the career costumes appear 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.090
 data like the car used the duration or 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.500
 the date but as it fails to correct the 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.750
 circuit that appears is not the correct 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.250
 press the one we want we can see 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.930
 as many times as we want from 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.849
 any ideal point of view for 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.139
 montajes this has been all over again 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.000
 We've had a pretty week 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:22.349
 busy we will see what awaits us in 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.349
 the next days until then
