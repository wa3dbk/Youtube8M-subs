00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.309
 especially her face it is she who is 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.769
 our new miss saint joseph 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.450
 it is to vincendo that we went 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.929
 to do a little more acquaintance with the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.420
 young lady 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.699
 I am soon 18 years old 2 months of February 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:30.689
 is already seen on his back since 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:33.600
 soon four years and yes the last 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.399
 year for a first we can say that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.680
 it's a success but how do you live 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.420
 the behind-the-scenes event in the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.790
 backstage where we lived we had to 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.440
 quickly change into or make up at the same 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.809
 same time as one dresses and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.820
 it was a little stressful and low 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.270
 after that we had to go back to 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.399
 the podium 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.110
 we were a little afraid to forget the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.210
 walks forget the pages went well 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.399
 happened a few minutes ago 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.739
 Here's a little bit of fear but 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.030
 otherwise yes 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.649
 the whole family is of course very proud 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.300

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.920

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.340
 winner even that had not won won 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.770

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.840

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.810

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.310

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.170

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.670

 Mom it's true we can not 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.210
 really be objective because we 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.430
 always find 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.229

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.659

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.930
