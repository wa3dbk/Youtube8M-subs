00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.809
 in which I will explain how to build with 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.610
 the automatic the exact operation 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:21.210
 show in the next clips 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:24.390
 this is the final phase he tried to 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.470
 build this car i took it 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.160
 been called to kill the animals 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:35.630
 and had this car what it is is a 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.840
 an automatic hen house look now 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:44.870
 would still be to use see the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:53.010
 eggs here are exact eggs come 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:54.570
 fasten and then look at the eggs not 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.050
 they hurt so much anyway 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.550
 some Puccini survive 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.160
 then in reality it would be to expand this 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.170
 area so you see a little you I have it 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.159
 made this miniature waters 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.549
 to transport the eggs 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.950
 so it's just a chicken coop 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:19.100
 let's see how to build it as I said 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:23.189
 then the pa da will serve right repeaters 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.369
 a hopper and larders then we take 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.799
 also some eggs to try a lever 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.920
 to activate the route but you could 74 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.469
 no matter and then any material goes 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.270
 well also pietro because the chickens with the 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.920
 new update I think new 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.180
 update you are 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.800
 they do n't even seem to jump 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.140
 we do so we do three for you is 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.650
 very small but certainly later 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:56.540
 you can enlarge it then we take 1 2 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:02:02.390
 3 and 4 then we take no I was wrong here 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.190
 and in one obviously we put the leverage ok 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.890
 see where you need to be enough 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.920
 fast but I think you'll make it ok I have 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.780
 made some confusion guys but the 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.720
 path is this then you will have to 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.330
 being able to make the lamp blink 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.690
 in short then under the lamp we will have to 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.740
 put a distributor and next to the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:28.840
 distributor we put one hopper one 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.840
 wrong here that we should do the coil 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.670
 ok then we have to put them like this 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.510
 then the path is almost finished 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.710
 why look now we will put now 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.230
 running is don't look at the aesthetics it is 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.360
 state there is that other one that is flashing 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:03:00.420
 then we have to make enough walls 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:03.030
 tall he knows what steps you look at because 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.710
 practically the chickens the eggs 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.300
 of chicken once they come 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:11.630
 thrown into the air then yes once 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:17.750
 which will be hurled into the air and 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:21.300
 will develop and therefore we must succeed 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:27.740
 to give it as a path now look 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.740
 but first we must succeed 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.220
 here it is so that it comes 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.800
 some eggs here could enter 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.310
 in the hopper anyway now 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:46.730
 let's see how eggs happen 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:49.260
 here they are picked and you see chicks 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.270
 for what I said you need to do it 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:58.550
 quite high the chicks are born then 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:02.850
 if we also made the chicks tall 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.420
 they are born only outside and then just 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.420
 bad luck 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:20.299
 let's put them here and if we ran 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:23.300
 luck where perfect I had this 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:27.110
 luck however you guys got it 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.360
 try give me advice if it works 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.520
 otherwise I don't know I do another one 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.520
 another tutorial and the next
