spaghetti straps for ten dollars it was
originally<00:00:48.120> 35<00:00:48.750> 90<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.710> thought<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
originally 35 90 so I thought that was a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.479 
originally 35 90 so I thought that was a
great<00:00:50.760> deal<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.329> was<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.449> steal<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.949> picked<00:00:53.280> up

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
great deal it was a steal so I picked up

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.410 
great deal it was a steal so I picked up
these<00:00:54.000> black<00:00:54.600> faux<00:00:55.110> leather<00:00:55.610> shorts<00:00:56.610> they

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
these black faux leather shorts they

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.479 
these black faux leather shorts they
probably<00:00:57.719> looked<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.379> big<00:00:58.680> blob<00:01:01.489> it

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
probably looked just like a big blob it

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.160 
probably looked just like a big blob it
just<00:01:02.699> doesn't<00:01:03.059> look<00:01:03.090> appealing<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.930> this

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
just doesn't look appealing like this

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.789 
just doesn't look appealing like this
but<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.530> looks<00:01:04.559> better<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.270> waited<00:01:06.799> two

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
but it looks better on and I waited two

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.410 
but it looks better on and I waited two
weeks<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.430> buy<00:01:08.580> them<00:01:08.880> because<00:01:09.119> they're

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
weeks to buy them because they're

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.230 
weeks to buy them because they're
originally<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.130> $39<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.340> sale<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.000> I'm<00:01:12.060> like

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
originally like $39 on sale and I'm like

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.179 
originally like $39 on sale and I'm like
that's<00:01:12.510> not<00:01:12.960> worth<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.650> then<00:01:13.830> they<00:01:14.070> went

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
that's not worth it and then they went

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.210 
that's not worth it and then they went
down<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.760> 25<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.380> picked<00:01:16.619> them<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.130> I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
down to 25 and I picked them up and I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.640 
down to 25 and I picked them up and I
was<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.520> glad<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.790> did<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.270> 25<00:01:18.780> because<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.320> next

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
was so glad I did at 25 because the next

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.039 
was so glad I did at 25 because the next
week<00:01:19.830> they<00:01:20.009> were<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:20.369> gone<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> size

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
week they were all gone this is a size

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.380 
week they were all gone this is a size
extra<00:01:22.530> small<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.100> was<00:01:23.189> kind<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.520> contemplating

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
extra small I was kind of contemplating

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.030 
extra small I was kind of contemplating
between<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> extra<00:01:25.200> small<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> small

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
between the extra small and the small

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.789 
between the extra small and the small
but<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.330> fits<00:01:27.540> better<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.259> like<00:01:28.500> them

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
but this one fits better I like them

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.010 
but this one fits better I like them
because<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.460> quite<00:01:29.880> long<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.689> they<00:01:30.960> do

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
because they are quite long and they do

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.910 
because they are quite long and they do
have<00:01:31.439> pockets<00:01:32.750> stephanie<00:01:33.750> has<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.380> pair<00:01:34.680> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
have pockets stephanie has a pair of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.340 
have pockets stephanie has a pair of
real<00:01:35.250> leather<00:01:35.579> shorts<00:01:36.030> from<00:01:36.479> H&amp;M<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.229> are

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
last year and I wanted it but it was $89

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.509 
last year and I wanted it but it was $89
and<00:03:11.630> I<00:03:11.989> was<00:03:12.169> not<00:03:12.440> willing<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.889> pay<00:03:13.069> that<00:03:13.310> much

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519
