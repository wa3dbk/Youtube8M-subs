going on for ages and ages just in
different<00:00:23.760> permutations<00:00:24.390> sometimes<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:24.810> get

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
different permutations sometimes we get

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.060 
different permutations sometimes we get
involved<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.350> bit<00:00:25.500> when<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:25.740> think<00:00:25.920> there's

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
involved a bit when we think there's

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.650 
involved a bit when we think there's
money<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.580> when<00:00:26.760> we<00:00:26.880> stand<00:00:27.119> back<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> bit<00:00:27.449> if

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
money in it when we stand back a bit if

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.359 
money in it when we stand back a bit if
we<00:00:27.689> don't<00:00:27.930> think<00:00:28.140> there's<00:00:28.289> money<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.769> okay

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
we don't think there's money in it okay

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.009 
we don't think there's money in it okay
so<00:00:29.429> they<00:00:29.640> said<00:00:29.849> listen<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.630> ongoing

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
so they said listen for the ongoing

what<00:01:06.990> really<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> problem<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.250> an

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
what really is the problem is this is an

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.149 
what really is the problem is this is an
outmoded<00:01:09.030> way<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.930> being<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.470> communicating

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
outmoded way of being and communicating

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.649 
outmoded way of being and communicating
then<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.460> feel<00:01:11.640> inside<00:01:12.000> yourself<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.479> this

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
then you feel inside yourself that this

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.179 
then you feel inside yourself that this
just<00:01:12.900> feels<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.260> lot<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.500> old-fashioned

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
just feels like a lot of old-fashioned

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.010 
just feels like a lot of old-fashioned
nonsense<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:15.060> these<00:01:15.479> systems<00:01:15.840> are

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
nonsense now these systems are

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.960
