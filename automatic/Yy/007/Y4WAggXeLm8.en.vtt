00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.950
 if not 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.200
 OK 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.310
 why 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.560
 because it's worth 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.309
 does not go on the street 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.680
 or very good others here we are here 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.750
 in mini daisy 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.260
 It is a game created by Bohemian 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.770
 interactive I think it's called the company 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.910
 of weapon 2 and 3 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.470
 this game is like to hang out is 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.690
 of a player 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.360
 it's like the standard daisy but where 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.660
 in 8 bits and well let's see the 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.890
 controls that would be these 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.330
 to move us prepare cans ammunition 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.060
 we can get with others 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.890
 survivors 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.329
 in the length of the game that we play 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.329
 this my character 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.500
 and all that the game will leave it in the 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.679
 description is completely free if 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.909
 you want to hang out playing something 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.859
 entertaining I do not know 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.460
 there are not many channels that raise this 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:31.890
 makes what so that people are a 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.810
 little that almost nobody knows 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.790
 let's go around here I think that nothing else I saw 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.360
 a channel in Spanish that was called crowd 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.920
 It's a Spanish 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.520
 let's see what's in here in this car 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.960

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.960

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.960

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.680
 we need food 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.420
 why 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:35.350
 a lot of this 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.350

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.530
 all right 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.470

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.819
 to be more careful 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.050
 and more or less difficult to survive in 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.050
 these things that are left and not 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.560
