00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.599
 on the one hand the numbers show that they 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:18.810
 my goal 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.920
 go hubs of world financial power 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.119
 there are many women we are taking the goal 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.109
 are achieving 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.310
 radiant this goal 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.680
 the so-called globalization 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.780
 s 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.150
 has been an instrument of the paraná deconcentrated of financial power 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.650
 and then the goal of the project to create a world without borders 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.030
 Hannah 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.550
 since it was supposed to the laws of the private market 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.470
 prevailed according to the ideology 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.889
 it's in this world 

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:57.179
 beyond the racism the market laws prevail 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.520
 it's more a decoy 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.480
 that the manipulators of world power 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.200
 is to create a fominha then 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.770
 to make the presentation of the world 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.920
 it means putting the service so much 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.240
 to enslave practically all social classes to subjugate the nations destroyed 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.719
 the bishops of the national states that 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.120
 their instruments of defense 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.470
 for the tip 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.760
 accomplish 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.820
 to tell us so all the Greeks of the year proposes the dup of monopoly 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.510
 without defense the problem 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.420
 to air 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.740
 for citizens the way they 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.560
 national states institution heated 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.079
 withholdings in all countries will all supposed democracies 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.959
 pietermaritzburg taken by the power of money and media controlled by the 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.210
 conservatives 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.210
 then this is a world without borders 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.980
 the inclusion of such reporters without borders and other organizations 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.380
 sponsored by the secret services of the hegemonic powers are making 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.050
 there 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.369
 the demagogy that we have seen on television 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:17.339
 Yesterday even on French tv I saw was the biggest part of my dictionary was 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:18.619
 spared 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.609
 by a manifestation of the bus 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.829
 supporters of human rights in Tibet 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.629
 the ANA 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.840
 precisely because it proposes an organization called reporters without borders that 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.630
 promote the interests of world power 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.639
 but then they started the gun 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:38.839
 disturbs 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:43.679
 alberto moreno a adl the question of your south american state idália moniz 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:47.890
 nothing of the games that they can accept later has only one chance 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.209
 the pope 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.340
 it is a pity that this factor alone in function of this ideology of the government 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.699
 world 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:03:00.800
 of supposedly creating the world without borders but this number 1 of the world 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.260
 it was without frontiers of the imperialists where I could the human values ​​and the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.450
 men and women in the world 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.049
 borderless 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.669
 to happen then this characteristic is 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.479
 the leader 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:22.409
 chemical or society is organized 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.679
 on the national state itself 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.969
 defend the interests of its citizens 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:31.039
 in hand 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:35.689
 the world would need economic and social policies and 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:36.509
 nobody 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:42.629
 I've heard there was a possibility of progress for all rc is the most 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.709
 - held in the current world 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.009
 but insofar as it has been the object 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:51.769
 garad organization 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.769
 she's the type that was imposed 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:59.579
 so the potentates that money that have made a hand proliferation 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.849
 brutal financial assets 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.939
 they cheated on air 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.300
 the number practically created 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.140
 created by me addressed electronics on computers that I do not have 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.610
 hundreds of trillion 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.689
 of dollars in interest 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.019
 nor an active minute 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.120
 on time 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.969
 false basis without an economic reality without basis so nothing to give 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:27.300
 of support 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.300
 with something that serves the lives of people 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:34.080
 at the same time 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.080
 at the same time 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.340
 this globalization 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.340
 this number is one-third of predators 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.779
 he makes him 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:48.779
 their own rights 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.909
 social 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:56.919
 is a winner the hour reduced in all parts of the world pps went to germany 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.199
 this was the line 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.309
 wrong 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:03.029
 of ideology in power 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:09.369
 right and dominated Pepe since the 80s here in Brazil corresponded the call 

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:10.759
 lost decade 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.900
 at least 80 and 90 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.279
 until recently 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:16.630
 prevailing 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.890
 and citing even harming even the workers of developed countries 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.420
 in schools with three and maximum income locations ie 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.860
 the transnationals 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.850
 I'm a little not 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.680
 it seems to us 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.529
 rolled the production 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:36.519
 the period where there are dishes and restoring to its Colombian bases 

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:38.360
 for ten 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.879
 more benefits plus subsidies minus taxes 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:46.249
 but the exploitation of the labor force, which increases the number of people who defend 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:48.199
 humans supposedly 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:49.089
 in another 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:53.479
 human rights along with the rights of minorities 

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:57.760
 just as an excuse to shoot 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.210
 even bigger 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.319
 advantage 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.579
 for its promulgation and no one taking power 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.839
 then this is the characteristic 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:07.599
 of this globalization
