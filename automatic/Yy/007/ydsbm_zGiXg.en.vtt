00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.379
 friends welcome to this new one 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.050
 appointment with nash 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.779
 another novelty for this 2015 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.520
 queever the queever is not just a 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.759
 meat holder but also an accessory holder 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.740
 in fact now we will see in detail 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:30.199
 as a compound this very useful 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.960
 accessory for your sessions 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.150
 I would say first of all that the 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.449
 queever can be used both for 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.120
 12 foot dog that 13 feet is a 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.489
 container where you can insert 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.410
 all your smaller accessories e 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.760
 bigger than you usually use 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.489
 in your sessions 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.680
 another feature to describe that 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.370
 gives you the opportunity from time to time 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.710
 to be able to take the minimum with you 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.930
 indispensable precisely because there are a 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.000
 lots of pockets 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.800
 ok all perfectly padded that 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.720
 can be filled either with 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.030
 more granik and smaller accessories 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.280
 I would leave from the bag of protection of the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.610
 cane tips a padded bag 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.450
 which can be said applied to 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.369
 queever as you see is divided and is 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.689
 also an excellent bag to hold 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.030
 other accessories 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.939
 in case you have something 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.520
 quite easy to carry it 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.070
 closes with a slide and becomes here 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.590
 just an all-in-one transport bag 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.450
 therefore extremely padded cordura 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.939
 useful also shockproof then we take apart part 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.549
 for this queever part and we see that 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.610
 in the front I applied the 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:50.689
 my landing net with the landing net but 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.549
 in this case I also used a 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.770
 very useful and very accessory 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.810
 important 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.939
 this is a small accessory but a lot 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.880
 especially useful when you need to store 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.259
 your wet net and after the over 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.780
 fishing session 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.000
 this is also a small accessory 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.100
 you can safely transport with 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.890
 your queever then we have these two 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.250
 in fact I would make a lot of talk 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.440
 particular on the on the structure 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.720
 own particularly robust of 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.680
 this leads to cannes 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.870
 because the straps the companies can 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.180
 serve to close the and various 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.370
 accessories you want to transport are 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.020
 very resistant and can be 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.080
 adjusted according to size 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.240
 of the object that you will go to say 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.760
 insert inside the private room then 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.020
 we have two large ones in the front 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.220
 pockets 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.150
 in the biggest pocket is this one here 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.880
 a hinge opens with this hinge 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.150
 very durable so despite everything 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.459
 the whole is also very durable 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.120
 queever because made of cordura 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.940
 tearproof so it is an accessory that 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.190
 will surely last you over time as 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.230
 see inside the first pocket 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.070
 the bigger one and I positioned i 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.010
 my pickets are three pegs 3 more 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.680
 3 shorter long with my r3 and the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.260
 launch boiler but inside this one 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.450
 bag you can put the umbrella you can 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.470
 put a small pod you can put 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.519
 any accessory you may need 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:38.209
 during your fishing session 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:41.060
 in the lower part we have another pocket 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.540
 also this one characterized by a 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.320
 very padded finish with a 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.900
 very strong zipper and even here it is 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.239
 a pocket suitable for any type of 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:58.600
 bus bar accessory also with i 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:00.470
 markers mount a bag at the bottom 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.680
 this is the bag where you can 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.380
 naturally place the umbrella 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.150
 or even the maintenance bag 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.160
 of the fish that we will see later 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:15.320
 the here ve turning you can see it clearly 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.340
 that here are three canes but in queever 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.890
 you can carry up to 5 rods with the 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.800
 sheath in my sessions I often use 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.570
 indeed almost always the individual sheaths for 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.880
 the reeds, however, I am always in the 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.650
 condition of having to bring along a 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.599
 lot of other bags 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.669
 I have lots of other accessories to be able to 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:36.470
 bring pegs and various things 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.340
 in this case with the real one I have 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.350
 solved all 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.180
 because my three canes are 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.610
 perfectly housed inside the 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.850
 queever to space for two more why 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.010
 can carry up to 5 rods as you see i 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.590
 sheaths are practically all 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.910
 can be perfectly connected to each other and 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:59.030
 within the here for are held 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:02.169
 I agree very strongly from these large straps 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:05.620
 very resistant and threading here ve 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:08.979
 large large rod holder for accessories 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:12.080
 larger pocket for pegs or pot 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:16.250
 smaller pocket for mounted wood bars 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.760
 operated small accessories front bag 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:23.740
 for housing or maintenance bags 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:28.580
 umbrellas for landing 5 compartments to be able to 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.840
 five of them are mounted in their sheaths 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.560
 canes 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.630
 I would say an exceptional accessory I would say a 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.300
 very useful accessory especially for 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.610
 when you need to take you 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.070

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.889
