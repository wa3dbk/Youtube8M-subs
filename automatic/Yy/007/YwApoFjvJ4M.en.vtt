creative controller my biggest complaint

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.120 
creative controller my biggest complaint
is<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.240> you<00:02:22.360> can't<00:02:22.600> get<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:23.020> for<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.830> Atari

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
is that you can't get this for the Atari

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.510 
is that you can't get this for the Atari
2600<00:02:24.819> yet<00:02:25.560> hopefully<00:02:26.560> they'll<00:02:26.740> release<00:02:27.310> one

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
2600 yet hopefully they'll release one

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.949 
2600 yet hopefully they'll release one
for<00:02:27.700> Guitar<00:02:28.000> Hero<00:02:28.270> 4<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:32.040> guess<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.959> doesn't

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
for Guitar Hero 4 I guess that doesn't

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.540 
for Guitar Hero 4 I guess that doesn't
sound<00:02:35.440> like<00:02:35.620> much<00:02:35.860> when<00:02:35.980> there's<00:02:36.160> not<00:02:36.310> any

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
sound like much when there's not any

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.479 
sound like much when there's not any
music<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.360> actual<00:02:37.780> game<00:02:38.110> but<00:02:39.040> you'll<00:02:39.220> find

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
music on the actual game but you'll find

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.370 
music on the actual game but you'll find
this<00:02:39.610> controller<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.239> be<00:02:40.270> very<00:02:40.569> well<00:02:40.840> made<00:02:41.080> and

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
this controller to be very well made and

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.500 
this controller to be very well made and
this<00:02:41.470> should<00:02:41.650> last<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.130> for<00:02:42.180> quite<00:02:43.180> some<00:02:43.480> time

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
this should last you for quite some time

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.490 
this should last you for quite some time
with<00:02:44.020> some<00:02:44.200> heavy<00:02:44.410> rocking<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.190> Guitar<00:02:45.610> Hero<00:02:45.910> I

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
with some heavy rocking on Guitar Hero I

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.949 
with some heavy rocking on Guitar Hero I
particularly<00:02:47.500> like<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.360> strumming<00:02:49.360> button

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
particularly like this strumming button

particularly like this strumming button
I<00:02:49.989> think<00:02:50.260> it's<00:02:50.410> very<00:02:50.530> responsive<00:02:50.980> very<00:02:51.670> well

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
I think it's very responsive very well

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.630 
I think it's very responsive very well
made<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.269> I<00:02:52.300> like<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.630> Guitar<00:02:52.959> Hero<00:02:53.200> guitar

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640

with the NES controller it works
surprisingly<00:04:05.380> well<00:04:05.920> let's<00:04:06.310> take<00:04:06.459> a<00:04:06.489> look<00:04:06.700> at

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
surprisingly well let's take a look at

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.599 
surprisingly well let's take a look at
the<00:04:06.910> other<00:04:07.060> buttons<00:04:07.890> these<00:04:08.890> buttons<00:04:09.280> will<00:04:09.459> go

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
the other buttons these buttons will go

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.240 
the other buttons these buttons will go
with<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.910> Atari<00:04:10.269> 2600<00:04:11.049> joystick<00:04:11.380> which<00:04:12.040> works

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
with the Atari 2600 joystick which works

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.099 
with the Atari 2600 joystick which works
well<00:04:12.459> because<00:04:12.640> this<00:04:12.970> is<00:04:13.120> rubberized<00:04:13.450> up<00:04:13.870> here

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
well because this is rubberized up here

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.469 
well because this is rubberized up here
and<00:04:14.260> it's<00:04:14.709> a<00:04:14.980> nice<00:04:15.280> grip<00:04:15.760> onto<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.329> guitar

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
and it's a nice grip onto the guitar

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.289 
and it's a nice grip onto the guitar
hero<00:04:17.250> buttons<00:04:18.250> on<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.519> top<00:04:18.669> let's<00:04:19.060> take<00:04:19.239> a

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
hero buttons on the top let's take a

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.320 
hero buttons on the top let's take a
look<00:04:19.479> at<00:04:19.570> that

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
look at that

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.130 
look at that
ok<00:04:22.330> rocking<00:04:22.780> out

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
ok rocking out

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.200 
ok rocking out
definitely<00:04:23.650> Rocking<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.610> only<00:04:24.789> problem<00:04:25.180> is

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
definitely Rocking the only problem is

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.400 
definitely Rocking the only problem is
when<00:04:25.360> you<00:04:25.479> have<00:04:25.510> to<00:04:25.750> hit<00:04:25.900> more<00:04:26.110> than<00:04:26.140> one

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
when you have to hit more than one

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.110 
when you have to hit more than one
button<00:04:26.740> at<00:04:26.830> once<00:04:27.039> and<00:04:27.400> we'll<00:04:27.669> solve<00:04:27.909> that

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
button at once and we'll solve that

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.830 
button at once and we'll solve that
problem<00:04:28.659> by<00:04:29.470> going<00:04:29.919> with<00:04:30.099> an<00:04:30.340> Atari<00:04:30.760> 7800

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
problem by going with an Atari 7800

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.770 
problem by going with an Atari 7800
controller<00:04:32.110> over<00:04:32.949> here<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.540> here<00:04:34.540> we<00:04:34.630> have

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
controller over here and here we have

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.060 
controller over here and here we have
the<00:04:34.900> red<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:35.080> blue<00:04:35.350> always<00:04:35.830> a<00:04:35.860> tough

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
the red and blue always a tough

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.980 
the red and blue always a tough
combination<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:39.570> all<00:04:40.570> right<00:04:40.720> well<00:04:40.900> maybe

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
combination and all right well maybe

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:50.520 
combination and all right well maybe
this<00:04:41.229> just<00:04:41.500> works<00:04:41.770> okay<00:04:42.130> in<00:04:42.220> theory<00:04:49.169> it<00:04:50.169> wasn't

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
this just works okay in theory it wasn't

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.620 
this just works okay in theory it wasn't
so<00:04:50.740> long<00:04:50.770> ago<00:04:51.010> that<00:04:51.550> it<00:04:51.669> was<00:04:51.760> difficult<00:04:52.060> as<00:04:52.600> a
