00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:08.620

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:16.390

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:20.169
 fools have no cure to kill me you can 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.439

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:27.070
 that is fast do not start what I 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:30.999
 I will end in peace with yourself 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.969
 that way there will be things that never get boring 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:37.449
 there are mistakes that you can not commit two 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:40.300
 Sometimes I will not die without honor it 's time to 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:43.000
 stop running alone I decide my 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:48.720
 destiny a sword 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.720
 a purpose is not yet time to die 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.590
 but 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:07.510
 by the sword above all things 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.570
 except the good see 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.570
 ah 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.080
 I do not know how to drink 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:27.790
 there are only three certainties in life the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:30.690
 honor death and hangover ha ha ha ha 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.690
 ha ha ha 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:40.280
 [Laughs] 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.799
 [Music] 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.799
 to a sword is bad company when the 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.560
 path is so long the honor left me 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:52.340
 a long time ago no one has been 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.549
 promised tomorrow the wind continues but 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.550
 take care of your back this sword does not 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.009
 makes lighter virtue is nothing but 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.740
 a luxury the road to ruin is more 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.979
 short of what you think only the free ones 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.850
 guilt can sleep justice 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.670
 what a nice word is one step beyond 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.489
 from the past a vagabond is not always 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.580
 lost alone I'm looking for a way home 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.310
 I could never stay in one place 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.890
 I will follow this path to the end on 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.459
 honor is in the heart not in the name 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.800
 I will not forget who this story is yet 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.180
 has not finished the sole purpose 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.360
 of the leaf is to fall and to die is the part 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.360
 easy 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.680
 with doing to follow its long flow 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.680
 face the wind 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.810
 there is only death 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.590
 yours or mine if you came to kill me 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.659
 I hope you brought your friends 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.659
 I have a bad habit of killing people 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:17.180
 and I can not leave it to the story and 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.840
 gatun soria that everything much 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.390
 I had never heard of that and I 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.109
 I do not like that kind of food 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:31.760
 like your sword boots weighs you more 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:33.709
 river your sword or your past all the 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.560
 world faces its judgment 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:41.450
 biden you can not run away from yourself 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.130
 I've already tried spirit broken sword 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:49.540
 broken 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.540
 three quick hits awaits this technique 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.650
 another windblade who taught you 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:59.389
 that comes back to your shadows 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:04.629
 Ninja ninjas hate those guys that cute 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:04.629
