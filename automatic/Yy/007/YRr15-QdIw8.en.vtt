00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:22.400
 and good cool, which is a race 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.400
 of an invisible 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.420
 being these two points static 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.719
 because of people ahead it's fine 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.010
 we keep going it's the same network 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.600

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.520

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.320

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.550
 laps are two back to see if 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.550
 we got going through why 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.730
 we did not have it there it's perfect for 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.100

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.150
 puntito and second I go second is lame 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.440
 because he taught me that there was the trick 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.440
 also look 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:27.590
 you have to take it down here there is a 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:31.890

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.929
 I am going to fall badly there is for boys 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:41.630
 let's see if it 's the next one which ride 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:41.630
 because how are you doing please sir 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.390
 the new blue and white center 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.780
 It's like rice 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.640
 of morality 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.640
 with the eye 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.509
 impeccable and I also touched the wall that 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.190
 it is believed that touching it to be more 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.190
 easy to catch which he reiterated 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.160
 we arrived the fruit markets of 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.420
 guys we have to go before mister nito 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.050
 Hopefully it's sticking to what he has 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.050
 past I do not know we're going fast 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.790
 and there it is 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.099
 My mother spends the first time 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.790
 he passed it to the first one too 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.819
 male, nothing gave me the road 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.890
 amazing to get off the road with 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.260
 style, since he was native to inge 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.780
 same as me uncle and do not see flipas like 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.159
 which Mr. Nito is nor all the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.159
 illicit professional 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.820
 because there is a fairly easy but it is that 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.790
 can choke if you're a little 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.380
 nervous I think it has gone well 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.380
 who just finished the race 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.340
 but good is already 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.180
 well nothing 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.530
 that we are not going to win obviously is 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.810
 literally impossible because we're going 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.030
 seconds but good the case here we go 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.680
 so leave the face very cool explained 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.680
 but it has happened to me like the first
