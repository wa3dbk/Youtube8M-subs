side we have some rare cool yellow in
here<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.570> place<00:01:25.140> an<00:01:25.320> order<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.680> brick<00:01:25.860> link

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
here I just place an order on brick link

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.700 
here I just place an order on brick link
for<00:01:26.280> more<00:01:26.430> cool<00:01:26.670> yellow<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.299> all<00:01:27.840> four<00:01:28.409> of

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
for more cool yellow so all four of

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.340 
for more cool yellow so all four of
these<00:01:29.280> patterns<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.390> require<00:01:30.780> cool<00:01:31.170> yellow

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
these patterns that require cool yellow

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.450 
these patterns that require cool yellow
will<00:01:31.650> be<00:01:31.770> outfitted<00:01:32.119> in<00:01:33.119> due<00:01:33.420> time<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.460> pretty

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
will be outfitted in due time and pretty

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.520 
will be outfitted in due time and pretty
much<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.900> you<00:01:36.900> could<00:01:37.079> see<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.350> there's

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
much that you could see that there's

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.280 
much that you could see that there's
bagging<00:01:37.979> here<00:01:38.220> which<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.780> explained<00:01:40.200> by

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
bagging here which that is explained by

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.060 
bagging here which that is explained by
the<00:01:40.439> level<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.310> dust<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.909> could<00:01:42.899> go<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the level of dust that could go in and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.710 
the level of dust that could go in and
during<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> construction<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:45.210> I'm<00:01:45.450> trying

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
during the construction that I'm trying

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.410 
during the construction that I'm trying
to<00:01:45.840> keep<00:01:46.020> off<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.500> tower<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.420> eventually

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
to keep off of the tower so eventually

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.280 
to keep off of the tower so eventually
these<00:01:48.780> bags<00:01:49.350> will<00:01:49.590> go<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:51.329> element<00:01:51.990> tiles

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
these bags will go and the element tiles

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.310 
these bags will go and the element tiles
will<00:01:52.409> gradually<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:53.130> added<00:01:53.430> in

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
will gradually be added in

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.750 
will gradually be added in

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
placement of these tiles sorry yeah

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.790 
placement of these tiles sorry yeah
there<00:02:22.959> are<00:02:23.080> tiles<00:02:23.260> are<00:02:23.470> modified<00:02:23.860> tiles<00:02:24.130> and

still has pretty much about a lot of
them<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.280> go<00:02:33.630> but<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:34.870> haven't<00:02:35.320> really<00:02:35.709> taken<00:02:36.100> a

those tiles for those modified tiles and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.809 
those tiles for those modified tiles and
will<00:02:41.230> do<00:02:41.380> promptly<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.130> see<00:02:42.280> what<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.519> can<00:02:42.670> add

wondering<00:02:51.220> with<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.400> curved<00:02:51.670> design<00:02:51.700> how<00:02:52.269> I'm

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
wondering with the curved design how I'm

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.820 
wondering with the curved design how I'm
gonna<00:02:52.480> cap<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.780> off<00:02:53.080> without<00:02:53.350> it

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
gonna cap it off without it

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.790 
gonna cap it off without it
leaving<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:54.819> much<00:02:54.970> open<00:02:55.360> space<00:02:55.660> there<00:02:56.530> was<00:02:56.769> a

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
leaving so much open space there was a

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.550 
leaving so much open space there was a

Starfighter for three by twelve wings in
dark<00:03:02.860> gray<00:03:03.100> were<00:03:03.670> used<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.269> cap<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:05.019> pretty

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
dark gray were used to cap to pretty

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.000 
dark gray were used to cap to pretty
much<00:03:05.410> cap<00:03:06.370> off<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.730> space<00:03:07.030> with<00:03:07.360> minimum

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
much cap off the space with minimum

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.620 
much cap off the space with minimum
openings<00:03:09.010> in<00:03:09.250> fact<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.850> openings<00:03:10.269> are<00:03:10.420> less

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
openings in fact the openings are less

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.270 
openings in fact the openings are less
than<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:12.190> curt<00:03:12.400> then<00:03:12.670> pretty<00:03:13.390> much<00:03:13.570> this

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
than the the curt then pretty much this

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.280 
than the the curt then pretty much this
opening<00:03:15.280> here<00:03:15.850> it's<00:03:16.090> it's<00:03:16.570> less<00:03:16.810> noticeable

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
opening here it's it's less noticeable

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.259 
opening here it's it's less noticeable
than<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.890> so<00:03:18.280> that's<00:03:18.910> what's<00:03:19.120> actually

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
than that so that's what's actually

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.949 
than that so that's what's actually
pretty<00:03:19.660> amazing<00:03:19.840> about<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.350> geometry<00:03:20.950> of<00:03:20.980> it

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
pretty amazing about the geometry of it

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.150 
pretty amazing about the geometry of it
just<00:03:22.959> like<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.200> real<00:03:23.320> deal<00:03:23.380> there's<00:03:23.890> like<00:03:24.070> a

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
just like the real deal there's like a

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.849 
just like the real deal there's like a
little<00:03:24.400> bit<00:03:24.519> of<00:03:24.549> glass<00:03:24.880> on<00:03:25.630> top<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.290> steel

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
little bit of glass on top of the steel

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.060 
little bit of glass on top of the steel
on<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.900> end<00:03:28.900> of<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.230> middle<00:03:29.739> of<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:29.920> building

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
on the end of the middle of the building

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.000 
on the end of the middle of the building
I<00:03:30.400> don't<00:03:31.209> know<00:03:31.420> what<00:03:31.570> how<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.260> describe<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:32.859> as

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
I don't know what how to describe it as

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.940 
I don't know what how to describe it as
and<00:03:33.280> there<00:03:34.180> are<00:03:34.239> little<00:03:34.450> white<00:03:35.140> deeds<00:03:35.500> I<00:03:35.650> think

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
and there are little white deeds I think

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.229 
and there are little white deeds I think
these<00:03:36.040> are<00:03:36.100> lights<00:03:36.459> but<00:03:36.730> I'm<00:03:36.790> not<00:03:36.940> exactly

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
these are lights but I'm not exactly

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.220 
these are lights but I'm not exactly
sure<00:03:37.390> that<00:03:37.840> fit<00:03:38.170> up<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.500> top<00:03:39.010> of<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:40.079> top<00:03:41.079> of

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
sure that fit up the top of the top of

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.410 
sure that fit up the top of the top of
the<00:03:41.290> middle<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:42.310> building<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.209> glass

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
the middle of the building the glass

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.300 
the middle of the building the glass
walls<00:03:46.380> somebody<00:03:47.380> was<00:03:47.590> very<00:03:47.680> gracious<00:03:48.100> to

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
walls somebody was very gracious to

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.280 
walls somebody was very gracious to
pretty<00:03:48.670> much<00:03:48.820> take<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.150> shot<00:03:49.450> from<00:03:49.600> Sky<00:03:49.959> Point

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
pretty much take a shot from Sky Point

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.080 
pretty much take a shot from Sky Point
and<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.470> found<00:03:50.769> it<00:03:50.890> on<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.070> Internet<00:03:51.459> and<00:03:51.700> his

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
and I found it on the Internet and his

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.680 
and I found it on the Internet and his
shot<00:03:52.329> was<00:03:52.359> great<00:03:52.989> reference<00:03:53.500> for<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.850> very

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
shot was great reference for the very

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.640 
shot was great reference for the very
complicated<00:03:57.209> window<00:03:58.209> arrangement<00:03:58.720> here<00:03:58.930> it's

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
complicated window arrangement here it's

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.800 
complicated window arrangement here it's
notice<00:04:00.070> that<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:00.640> eventually<00:04:01.209> goes<00:04:01.630> up

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
notice that it it eventually goes up

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.199 
notice that it it eventually goes up
from<00:04:01.989> one<00:04:02.170> cube<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.709> 2<00:04:02.890> cubes<00:04:03.400> pretty<00:04:03.730> much<00:04:03.909> and

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
from one cube to 2 cubes pretty much and

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:04.680 
from one cube to 2 cubes pretty much and
then<00:04:04.330> it

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
then it

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.210 
then it
comes<00:04:04.870> three<00:04:05.260> right<00:04:05.470> here<00:04:05.710> and<00:04:05.920> then<00:04:06.010> we<00:04:06.100> have

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.260 
comes three right here and then we have
the<00:04:06.340> top<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:08.800> air<00:04:08.980> conditioning<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:09.730> FAA

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
the top the air conditioning and FAA

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.940 
the top the air conditioning and FAA
lights<00:04:10.870> are<00:04:11.260> pretty<00:04:11.620> much<00:04:11.860> simple<00:04:12.400> but<00:04:13.950> sadly

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
lights are pretty much simple but sadly

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.530 
lights are pretty much simple but sadly
the<00:04:15.220> reference<00:04:15.670> that<00:04:15.760> was<00:04:15.970> available<00:04:16.390> for

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
the reference that was available for

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.180 
the reference that was available for
this<00:04:16.630> was<00:04:16.870> Google<00:04:17.230> Maps<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:17.799> believe<00:04:18.010> the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
this was Google Maps and I believe the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.130 
this was Google Maps and I believe the
units<00:04:18.549> are<00:04:18.670> more<00:04:18.820> square<00:04:19.209> but<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:19.840> way<00:04:19.959> they

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
units are more square but the way they

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.960 
units are more square but the way they
cast<00:04:20.350> a<00:04:20.500> shadow<00:04:20.530> on<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:20.980> way<00:04:21.130> they<00:04:21.340> look<00:04:21.730> from

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
cast a shadow on the way they look from

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.890 
cast a shadow on the way they look from
above<00:04:22.920> make<00:04:23.920> them<00:04:24.160> look<00:04:24.340> more<00:04:24.400> circular<00:04:25.360> so<00:04:25.660> I

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
above make them look more circular so I

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.930 
above make them look more circular so I
just<00:04:26.410> decided<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.830> use<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.130> 1<00:04:27.490> by<00:04:27.610> 1<00:04:27.790> round

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
just decided to use the 1 by 1 round

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.960 
just decided to use the 1 by 1 round
tiles<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.660> antennas<00:04:29.590> to<00:04:30.550> pretty<00:04:30.790> much

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
tiles and antennas to pretty much

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.640 
tiles and antennas to pretty much
capture<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:31.600> detail<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.260> there's<00:04:32.440> of<00:04:32.620> course

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
capture the detail and there's of course

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.290 
capture the detail and there's of course
an<00:04:33.100> antenna<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:33.580> think<00:04:33.730> there's<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:33.940> second

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
an antenna I think there's a second

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.520 
an antenna I think there's a second
antenna<00:04:34.540> and<00:04:34.750> that<00:04:34.840> will<00:04:34.960> be<00:04:35.050> added<00:04:35.170> to<00:04:35.410> that

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
antenna and that will be added to that

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.880 
antenna and that will be added to that
second<00:04:35.980> Jumper<00:04:36.340> in<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.520> near<00:04:36.760> future<00:04:37.000> a

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.080 

completed<00:04:41.890> building<00:04:42.250> means<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.670> progress

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
completed building means the progress

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.600 
completed building means the progress
bar<00:04:43.360> is<00:04:43.630> no<00:04:43.960> longer<00:04:44.200> needed<00:04:44.530> so<00:04:44.890> bye-bye

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.770 

that's<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.760> first<00:04:49.000> time<00:04:49.180> we're<00:04:49.330> now<00:04:49.420> able<00:04:49.600> to

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
that's the first time we're now able to

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.870 
that's the first time we're now able to
see<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.050> building<00:04:50.230> without<00:04:50.500> a<00:04:50.860> ruler<00:04:51.640> that

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
see the building without a ruler that

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.730 
see the building without a ruler that
measures<00:04:52.180> up<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:52.780> progress<00:04:52.990> because<00:04:53.530> there's

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
measures up the progress because there's

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.040 
measures up the progress because there's
no<00:04:53.860> need<00:04:54.040> for<00:04:54.070> it<00:04:54.430> anymore

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
no need for it anymore

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.990 
no need for it anymore
so<00:04:56.050> promptly<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:56.770> parts<00:04:57.400> will<00:04:57.520> be<00:04:57.550> sorted

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
so promptly the parts will be sorted

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.580 
so promptly the parts will be sorted
into<00:04:58.150> their<00:04:58.390> respective<00:04:58.540> colors<00:04:59.230> and<00:04:59.440> now<00:04:59.530> the

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
into their respective colors and now the

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.010 
into their respective colors and now the
building<00:05:00.070> can<00:05:00.280> be<00:05:00.510> enjoyed<00:05:01.510> by<00:05:01.720> everyone
