doesn't<00:00:38.780> do<00:00:38.900> it<00:00:40.210> but<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.330> other<00:00:41.449> ones<00:00:41.690> are

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
doesn't do it but the other ones are

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.649 
doesn't do it but the other ones are
there<00:00:42.350> you<00:00:42.470> go<00:00:43.809> check<00:00:44.809> this<00:00:44.989> up<00:00:46.300> this<00:00:47.300> game

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
there you go check this up this game

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:54.460 
there you go check this up this game
requires<00:00:51.010> 4.31<00:00:52.010> firmware<00:00:53.019> do<00:00:54.019> you<00:00:54.140> want<00:00:54.350> to

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
requires 4.31 firmware do you want to

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.579 
requires 4.31 firmware do you want to
change<00:00:54.680> it<00:00:54.830> to<00:00:54.979> your<00:00:55.100> current<00:00:56.440> 4.3<00:00:57.440> L<00:00:57.559> version

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
change it to your current 4.3 L version

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.460 
change it to your current 4.3 L version
this<00:01:00.589> operation<00:01:01.309> will<00:01:01.460> fix

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
this operation will fix

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.740 
this operation will fix
that<00:01:03.620> are<00:01:03.830> numerous<00:01:04.489> times

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.770 

so<00:01:09.290> that's<00:01:09.440> a<00:01:09.530> pretty<00:01:09.710> cool<00:01:09.920> option<00:01:10.430> it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
so that's a pretty cool option it

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.260 
so that's a pretty cool option it
basically<00:01:11.780> resets<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:13.010> required<00:01:13.610> firmware

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
basically resets the required firmware

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.930 
basically resets the required firmware

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
for the game which you chose if it

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.140 
for the game which you chose if it
requires<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.480> later<00:01:18.140> firmware<00:01:18.460> than<00:01:19.460> what<00:01:20.000> you

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
requires a later firmware than what you

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.660 
requires a later firmware than what you
currently<00:01:20.300> have<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:20.990> in<00:01:21.080> this<00:01:21.200> case<00:01:21.490> if<00:01:22.490> I

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
currently have so in this case if I

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.290 
currently have so in this case if I
choose<00:01:22.880> no<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.720> game<00:01:23.900> will<00:01:24.410> not<00:01:24.880> be<00:01:25.880> playable

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
choose no the game will not be playable

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.210 
choose no the game will not be playable
it's<00:01:26.900> gonna<00:01:27.110> basically<00:01:28.300> tell<00:01:29.300> me<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:29.630> install

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
it's gonna basically tell me to install

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.910 
it's gonna basically tell me to install
4.31<00:01:31.450> but<00:01:32.450> in<00:01:32.570> this<00:01:32.660> case<00:01:32.900> I'm<00:01:33.560> gonna<00:01:33.710> select

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
4.31 but in this case I'm gonna select

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.540 
4.31 but in this case I'm gonna select
yes<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:36.400> it's<00:01:37.400> gonna<00:01:37.610> reset<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:39.560> eboot<00:01:40.220> file

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
yes and it's gonna reset the eboot file

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:48.070 
yes and it's gonna reset the eboot file
in<00:01:40.790> there<00:01:43.150> so<00:01:44.150> it'll<00:01:44.330> play<00:01:44.660> under<00:01:45.020> 4.30<00:01:47.080> so

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
in there so it'll play under 4.30 so

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.230 
in there so it'll play under 4.30 so
that's<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.380> pretty<00:01:48.530> cool<00:01:48.800> feature<00:01:49.070> that<00:01:49.520> Dean
