00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.939
 hi all what I bring this now a 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:08.280
 small performance test at 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.980
 microprocessor of the latest unboxing in 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.519
 the 8150 fx 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:19.050
 let's play the filtres boat with all 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.550
 the graphics in ultra 1920 x 1080 and 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.570
 good to see what you see how it 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.960
 unwrap and here you have it 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.110
 the quality of the game is exceptional I'll 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.980
 to lower a bit the quality of the game 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:37.309
 but of the video to not take more in the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.900
 life in raising prices by seeing what 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.360
 we are interested right now we are in the 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.920
 map operation meters 64 players as 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.470
 the server gentleman and if he was not 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.990
 full we will not miss a couple of slots 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.800
 and he has a lot of credit right now 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:55.090
 but we have about 45 or 60 fps is 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.090
 maintained without problems 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.970
 here we get a little more in the 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.890
 scrubbed a lot but here and well 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.250
 explosions shot now nothing of everything 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.610
 45 to 60 fps without any kind of 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.130
 problem 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.650
 we get here between the smoke and demand 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.060
 Y 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.400
 you do not notice power drops here and 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.180
 like that on the same map we left 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:32.710
 outside and we noticed a drop of 20 fps 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:34.420
 we go 2030 from 60 to 30 or from 45 to 35 5 that 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.960
 we are seeing right now from 30 to 35 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.670
 fps is ok but in the video now when 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.730
 I finished exporting and I'll look at it 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.720
 more calm but good playing not 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.659
 note any difference of 35 to 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.130
 60 fps 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.590
 for those who are interested in 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.740
 buying a computer like mine is very 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.899
 very expensive here teaches a little 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.630
 the components are worth we have about 16 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.469
 formula 46 the processor 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.060
 the md we also have a heatsink 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.470
 because soon we will overclock and 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.700
 we will make another video of the toilet 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.920
 row to see if it has increased the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.950
 performance and others in this case with 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.989
 some waste 12 tubes that keeps us 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.840
 microprocessor at about 30 to 40 degrees 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:24.780
 according to we leave them without problem the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.519
 graph is a m of measured radius 78 70 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.560
 how they changed it in the guarantees 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.349
 any processor procure it another 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.390
 story that enervates the movie 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.310
 does not pull much of graphics more than 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.890
 water processor will see if I take the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.599
 formula 1 2012 that I really want to 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.310
 try it and I make another video with him and 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.590
 we also see how the 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.690
 graphic and good here you have the computer 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.170
 is mounted on a tower have the 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.050
 cooler master the 922 with an SSD 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.450
 Corsican power supply and 850 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.270
 watts latex for whatever they are 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.770
 interested simply this project 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.160
 here we changed the map we started in 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.650
 the caspian border a lot more 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.319
 vegetation but good here we have a 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.090
 granada a clayburgh I think there was and 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.300
 you see let's go the explosion without problem no 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.890
 follows it moving perfectly to 30 and 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:23.060
 35 fps and sorry but reiterated playing no 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.190
 it shows nothing there are no slumps and with nothing 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.730
 of reduces to 30 its price without problem 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.890
 we got on the plane okay and now yes 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.239
 we are going to put 60 fps already maintained 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.890
 that rather now he only has to 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.440
 load heaven I do not know what to look for 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.600
 down as now 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.600
 and still you do not notice 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.670
 and we got off the plane 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.580
 and here we have loaded the entire map more 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.380
 or less now also 30 35 fps in these 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.960
 large maps and so downloading everything we 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.720
 goes up more but good does not go down that either 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.840
 that is also important 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.290
 how can viver 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.489
 one moves well and little more than you have 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.920
 an f-18 that goes through 37 that goes through 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.230
 here the left and a little less 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.530
 will in the end I hope that I have 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.199
 liked and soon also videos with 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.620
 the same computer if it changes I'll warn 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:23.579
 one leg and nothing see you soon 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.579
 see you later
