like<00:02:40.630> end<00:02:40.870> up<00:02:41.019> discarding<00:02:41.590> most<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:41.950> them

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
like end up discarding most of them

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.729

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.080 
anyway so and I just had Lance I was
happy<00:02:44.980> if<00:02:45.130> they<00:02:45.280> allowed<00:02:45.489> every<00:02:45.790> turn

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.770 

the<00:02:48.209> draw<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.610> boarded<00:02:50.610> out<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:52.670> think<00:02:53.690> for<00:02:54.690> the

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
the draw I boarded out I think for the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.600 
the draw I boarded out I think for the
second<00:02:55.110> game<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.380> boarded<00:02:55.650> out<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.830> shock<00:02:56.310> a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
second game I boarded out a shock a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.089 
second game I boarded out a shock a
slash<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.300> land<00:02:57.540> for<00:02:57.930> two<00:02:58.200> martyrs<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.010> I

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
slash and a land for two martyrs and I

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.960 
slash and a land for two martyrs and I
needed<00:02:59.400> six<00:02:59.610> time<00:02:59.760> on<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.060> draw<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:01.640> on<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
needed six time on the draw and on the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.500 
needed six time on the draw and on the
play

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
play

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.750 
play
I<00:03:03.540> bought<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.530> Wheel<00:03:04.769> of<00:03:04.890> Fate<00:03:05.130> on<00:03:05.550> top

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
I bought it in the Wheel of Fate on top

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.430 
I bought it in the Wheel of Fate on top
of<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.090> because<00:03:06.450> they're<00:03:06.780> really<00:03:06.989> way

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
of that because they're really way

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.500 
of that because they're really way
better<00:03:07.650> on<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.950> play<00:03:08.160> thing<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.030> boarded<00:03:09.360> out

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
better on the play thing I boarded out

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.530 
better on the play thing I boarded out
two<00:03:09.930> shocks<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.500> SOS<00:03:10.860> boarded<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.090> lands

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
two shocks and SOS boarded in the lands

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.490 
two shocks and SOS boarded in the lands
and<00:03:12.690> forged<00:03:13.140> in<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.319> to<00:03:13.590> illustrate<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.810> yeah

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
and forged in the to illustrate so yeah

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.310 
and forged in the to illustrate so yeah
that<00:03:16.769> was<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.099> strategy
