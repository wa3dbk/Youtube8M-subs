00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.259
 unstoppable a page so a page 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.150

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.749
 you are on the download page 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.980
 so we 'll wait for these movies loaded 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.980
 because otherwise it can be pretty pretty 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:05.390
 ah yes hurry please good 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.850

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.610
 tell him -9 still hop we're rebellious 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.950
 have the crazy challenges we stop the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.050
 loading the page because we 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.479
 that's how I was triggered easy 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.540
 so you download this little file 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.310
 which is so the game maker crash and 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.750
 I see we have two minutes left 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.189
 of expectations that's why I decided 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.229

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.570
