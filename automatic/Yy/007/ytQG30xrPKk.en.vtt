00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello very good everyone here says a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.040
 new video 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.280
 this time I have a cliche clichÃ© tutorial 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.920
 whatever you want to call it 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.250
 and it's how to get money let's say 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.750
 quick simple and it's very easy it's worth and 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.220
 good first thing first you have 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.529
 what to do is take any car from the 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.619
 street exactly I have taken this 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.809
 because it's the most expensive car 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.579
 You can sell and take out helga carry 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:31.340
 you go if I'm not wrong there and what 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.780
 I'm reading good this time I had it 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.800
 I have searched for good but I'm going to 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.010
 explain first what you have to do 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.320
 first you are going to lose now that 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.989
 you are here and well, the price that 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.140
 It puts me more because I have a tube but good 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.050
 you do not have to sell you do not give to x you give 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.809
 to be and you give left and just 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.899
 playstation store and a long time very 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.749
 fast very fast to the x that is to say then 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.289
 what you do is let's say sell it go to 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:02.780
 playstation store but is let's say a bus 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.850
 that does not finish selling worth not what 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.770
 sells but you are almost money but 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.370
 do not sell the car is more the car 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.300
 It will always be yours and if I recommend you 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.370
 keep it in your garage because that's how 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.500
 and you can always do the tube with this 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.860
 You can search for it, you can make 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.290
 everything against more what is more plus the 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.120
 you sell and good as you are seeing this 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.520
 it happens a little to fast camera but 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.310
 good what you are going to get then it is 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.500
 down to do it a second time and 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.170
 How are you listening? 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.440
 second time third quarter and this time 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.350
 this let's say I do it four times 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.470
 but let's say that the most normal thing is 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.960
 do it twice the third or fourth 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.420
 or the one that even leaves you 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.860
 the most normal thing is that I kick you out but 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.680
 good 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.830
 and let's say you do not lose anything they throw you 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.930
 the workshop only and well then you keep 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.750
 with the car then you can come to the end 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.110
 time again I think it's a day 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.750
 of the gta speaker base game 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.759
 night a day and night depends on the 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.830
 what time do you do it then what can you do 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.380
 again or not and good until here the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.730
 tutorial vale I leave you all the times 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.340
 I could do it although I already told you that 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.040
 they're not always 43 or they're all going 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.690
 varying and good to take advantage of fast 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.820
 because it goes down in the patch that we're going to 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.520
 take it out soon so they take it away who knows 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.470
 but I'll leave you here with all the 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.020
 explanations I hope you liked it 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.620
 that the truth costs a lot a lot 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.320
 money getting the things to get 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.110
 the money let's say and I guess this 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.670
 guardianship is perfect perfect because well 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.860
 you will earn a lot of money and you can do 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.390
 many things although another thing that you 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.090
 I recommend is to make many races 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.440
 because you get a lot of money you get 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.450
 a lot of experience 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.250
 and the truth, I think it's the best 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.500
 game mode to do and forget about 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.940
 missions seriously you will not have alone 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.160
 the pension money though 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.290
 get 9000 because by earned race 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.490
 it depends who you are are several 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.080
 let's say from 2500 to 7000 and nothing for 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.260
 enjoy then I think it 's a lot 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.500
 better and above you can compete with the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.440
 cars that Tunisia had let's say you 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.550
 let me play the map that I recommend most 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.140
 is the 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.000
 that of the planes let's say it's in the 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.620
 airport and good as you have seen 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.900
 I had finished doing the trick and I 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.690
 I found a little bit that gave me so much 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.850
 that was already say that they had 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.280
 bet to be killed and what 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.890
 I took advantage and I killed him I tried to kill him 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.840
 but he did not get it so nothing I do 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.520
 I leave here give you favorite likes 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.520
 subscribe and goodbye
