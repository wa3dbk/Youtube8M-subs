and I wanted to give her something that
would<00:01:43.890> I'd<00:01:44.040> see<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:44.880> show<00:01:45.360> his

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
would I'd see you know show his

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.410 
would I'd see you know show his
character<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.680> he's<00:01:47.549> kind<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> guys<00:01:48.210> from

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
character and he's kind of the guys from

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.950 
character and he's kind of the guys from
the<00:01:48.570> Bronx<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.350> figured<00:01:49.759> baseball<00:01:50.759> bat<00:01:50.909> baby

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.639 

this<00:01:54.960> was<00:01:55.170> off<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.939> this<00:01:56.939> range<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.719> don't<00:01:58.469> know

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
this was off of this range I don't know

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.280 
this was off of this range I don't know
who<00:01:59.189> as<00:01:59.579> only<00:01:59.909> got<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.090> towels<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.110> actually

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
who as only got the towels so I actually

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.770 
who as only got the towels so I actually
think<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.680> was<00:02:01.860> with<00:02:02.070> him<00:02:02.610> maybe<00:02:02.880> I'm<00:02:03.360> not<00:02:03.540> sure

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
think it was with him maybe I'm not sure

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.620 
think it was with him maybe I'm not sure
but<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.619> never<00:02:05.430> got<00:02:05.610> whoops<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.060> never<00:02:06.509> got

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
but you never got whoops I never got

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.330 
but you never got whoops I never got
Casey<00:02:06.869> Jones<00:02:07.140> or<00:02:07.290> anything<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.039> I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
Casey Jones or anything like that so I

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.369 
Casey Jones or anything like that so I
don't<00:02:08.849> know<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.179> got<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> baseball<00:02:09.899> bat<00:02:10.110> I

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
don't know I got a baseball bat I

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.619 
don't know I got a baseball bat I
figured<00:02:10.830> it'd<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.220> perfect<00:02:11.430> for<00:02:11.760> him<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.390> he

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
figured it'd be perfect for him and he

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.610 
figured it'd be perfect for him and he
holds<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:13.020> really

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
holds it really

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.380 
holds it really
really<00:02:13.799> well<00:02:17.540> get<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.810> there<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.360> figured

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
really well get in there so I figured

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.570 
really well get in there so I figured
that<00:02:21.720> would<00:02:22.260> be<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:22.799> really<00:02:23.159> nice<00:02:23.250> thing

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
that would be a really really nice thing

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.110 
that would be a really really nice thing
to<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.269> you<00:02:24.480> know<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:25.099> think<00:02:26.099> it'd<00:02:26.250> look<00:02:26.400> great

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
to have you know I think it'd look great

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.800 
to have you know I think it'd look great

was<00:03:13.560> originally<00:03:13.980> thinking<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.640> putting<00:03:14.790> them

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
was originally thinking of putting them

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.030 
was originally thinking of putting them
on<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> front<00:03:15.300> here<00:03:15.600> but<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.620> same<00:03:16.800> reason<00:03:17.010> I

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
on the front here but the same reason I

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.650 
on the front here but the same reason I
didn't<00:03:17.280> do<00:03:17.370> Leo<00:03:17.580> blades<00:03:17.970> when<00:03:18.300> you<00:03:18.450> put

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
didn't do Leo blades when you put

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.390 
didn't do Leo blades when you put
anything<00:03:18.959> on<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.260> side<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.470> these<00:03:19.650> guys<00:03:19.890> their

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
anything on the side of these guys their

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.610 
anything on the side of these guys their
arms<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.760> stick<00:03:20.940> out<00:03:21.090> like<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.420> much<00:03:21.620> it's

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
arms to stick out like that much it's

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.860 
arms to stick out like that much it's
just<00:03:22.800> not<00:03:22.920> practical<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:24.420> kept<00:03:24.569> them<00:03:24.690> on<00:03:24.810> the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
just not practical so I kept them on the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.699 
just not practical so I kept them on the
back<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.860> really<00:03:26.850> like<00:03:27.030> his<00:03:27.569> green<00:03:27.900> he<00:03:28.590> was

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
back I really like his green he was

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.199 
back I really like his green he was
actually<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.040> last<00:03:29.220> green<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:29.580> found<00:03:29.819> I<00:03:29.940> wanted

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
actually the last green I found I wanted

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.199 
actually the last green I found I wanted
a<00:03:30.330> nice<00:03:30.480> dark<00:03:30.900> dark<00:03:31.500> green<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.130> in<00:03:32.940> my<00:03:33.030> local

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
a nice dark dark green and in my local

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.120 
a nice dark dark green and in my local
hobby<00:03:33.450> shop<00:03:33.569> had<00:03:33.989> she<00:03:34.140> had<00:03:34.350> this<00:03:34.530> paint<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.069> I

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
hobby shop had she had this paint and I

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.090 
hobby shop had she had this paint and I
just<00:03:35.310> think<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.519> came<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.730> really<00:03:36.600> nice<00:03:37.100> in

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
just think it came a really nice in

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.559 
just think it came a really nice in
quite<00:03:38.310> a<00:03:38.340> few<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.580> series<00:03:38.880> he's<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> darkest

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
quite a few the series he's a darkest

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.440 
quite a few the series he's a darkest
skin<00:03:40.110> kind<00:03:40.350> of<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.650> colors<00:03:40.950> maybe<00:03:41.700> personally

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
skin kind of the colors maybe personally

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.289 
skin kind of the colors maybe personally
as<00:03:42.569> well<00:03:42.600> actually<00:03:42.900> but<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:44.000> think<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:45.120> color

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
as well actually but I think this color

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.470 
as well actually but I think this color
came<00:03:45.569> over<00:03:45.980> really<00:03:46.980> really<00:03:47.430> nice<00:03:47.760> I'm<00:03:48.090> very
