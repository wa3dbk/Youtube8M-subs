00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
set why's he stopped and it's because he

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.850

called<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> tongue<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.540> Benny<00:00:34.350> was<00:00:34.559> trying

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
called the tongue and Benny was trying

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.979 
called the tongue and Benny was trying
to<00:00:34.920> get<00:00:34.980> into<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.399> boom<00:00:35.730> shot<00:00:36.180> him<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.809> think

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
to get into it boom shot him and I think

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.930 
to get into it boom shot him and I think
the<00:00:37.170> time<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:37.590> afford<00:00:37.829> some<00:00:38.430> gameplay<00:00:38.790> for

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the time can afford some gameplay for

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.549 
the time can afford some gameplay for
this<00:00:39.030> cuz<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.239> don't<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.540> haven't<00:00:39.930> worked<00:00:40.230> but

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
this cuz I don't I haven't worked but

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.260 
this cuz I don't I haven't worked but
I'm<00:00:41.129> guessing<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.579> not<00:00:41.610> really<00:00:41.879> any<00:00:42.059> game

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
I'm guessing it's not really any game

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
I'm guessing it's not really any game
play<00:00:42.510> out<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:43.079> them<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.860> YouTube

the<00:01:24.780> town<00:01:24.990> unfortunately<00:01:25.830> i<00:01:25.860> descended<00:01:26.369> it

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the town unfortunately i descended it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.990 
the town unfortunately i descended it
more<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.790> an<00:01:27.259> offline<00:01:28.259> thing<00:01:28.590> because<00:01:29.070> even

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
more of an offline thing because even

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.310 
more of an offline thing because even
though<00:01:30.090> i<00:01:30.119> got<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.420> online<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.900> nicked<00:01:31.110> off

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
though i got it online and nicked off

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.100 
though i got it online and nicked off
someone<00:01:31.770> there<00:01:32.759> was<00:01:32.880> no<00:01:33.000> one<00:01:33.150> about<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.630> it's

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
someone there was no one about and it's

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.840 
someone there was no one about and it's
kind<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.470> awkward<00:01:34.740> because<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.280> think<00:01:35.490> all

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
kind of awkward because you think all

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.539 
kind of awkward because you think all
let's<00:01:36.150> use<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> tank<00:01:36.630> online<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:38.369> just

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
let's use the tank online and it just

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.399 
let's use the tank online and it just
turns<00:01:38.790> out<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.750> can't<00:01:39.990> really<00:01:40.140> kill

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
turns out to be you can't really kill

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.719 
turns out to be you can't really kill
anyone<00:01:40.680> with<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> obviously<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.610> get

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
anyone with it obviously if you can get

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.580 
anyone with it obviously if you can get
to<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> money<00:01:42.180> come<00:01:42.659> across<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.259> my<00:01:43.350> bum

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
to the money come across this on my bum

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.289 
to the money come across this on my bum
you<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:43.890> kill<00:01:44.040> him<00:01:44.130> shot<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:44.640> one<00:01:44.790> shot<00:01:45.060> dead

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
you can kill him shot but one shot dead

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.319 
you can kill him shot but one shot dead
but<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.460> takes<00:01:47.610> too<00:01:47.820> long<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.030> get<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
but it just takes too long to get to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.060 
but it just takes too long to get to
people<00:01:48.570> say<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:49.049> yeah<00:01:49.140> i'm<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:49.530> someone<00:01:49.890> now

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
people say like yeah i'm at someone now

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.100 
people say like yeah i'm at someone now
by<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.610> time<00:01:50.850> i<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.479> location<00:01:51.720> i'll

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
by the time i get to that location i'll

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.840 
by the time i get to that location i'll
be<00:01:52.229> miles<00:01:52.470> away<00:01:52.680> because<00:01:52.979> they're<00:01:53.640> much

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
be miles away because they're much

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.819 
be miles away because they're much
faster<00:01:54.000> cars<00:01:54.390> having<00:01:54.750> some<00:01:54.930> slow<00:01:55.140> tongue<00:01:55.409> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
faster cars having some slow tongue and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.920 
faster cars having some slow tongue and
yeah<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.939> that's<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> way<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.479> now<00:01:57.750> I'm

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
yeah so that's the way it is now I'm

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.800 
yeah so that's the way it is now I'm
level<00:01:58.380> 51<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.340> I'm<00:01:59.700> not<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> lot<00:02:00.240> too<00:02:00.329> tanky<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.750> do

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
level 51 so I'm not a lot too tanky I do

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.630 
level 51 so I'm not a lot too tanky I do
have<00:02:00.960> seven<00:02:01.290> million<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> chance

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
have seven million so with the chance

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.580 
have seven million so with the chance
that<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.939> could<00:02:03.000> actually<00:02:03.299> despite<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> tag<00:02:04.409> I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
that I could actually despite a tag I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.870 
that I could actually despite a tag I
would<00:02:04.710> definitely<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:05.070> done<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.490> i<00:02:05.670> have

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
