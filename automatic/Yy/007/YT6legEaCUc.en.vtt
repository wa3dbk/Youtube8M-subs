00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
feeling about this course before you

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.170

went<00:00:42.870> into<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.649> course<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.160> felt<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.670> I

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
went into the course I felt like I

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
but I thought it suited that particular

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.470 
but I thought it suited that particular
horse<00:00:52.170> because<00:00:52.710> he<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.640> stay<00:00:53.910> really<00:00:54.239> tight

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
horse because he can stay really tight

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.200 
horse because he can stay really tight
and<00:00:54.899> make<00:00:55.079> those<00:00:55.410> maneuvers<00:00:56.010> seem<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:57.180> know

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and make those maneuvers seem you know

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.569 
and make those maneuvers seem you know
pretty<00:00:57.510> effortless<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.920> transitions<00:00:59.460> were

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
pretty effortless the transitions were

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.990 
pretty effortless the transitions were
tight<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.210> he's<00:01:00.359> good<00:01:00.570> at<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:02.160> was<00:01:02.850> I

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
