00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.990
 that for xavi voice welcome to 365 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.779
 bboying everyday we start with the 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.640
 217 freestyle trainings and 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.290
 football what I was trying this day 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.450
 is to do football that I do not normally do 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.000
 for the opposite direction but about 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.919
 all doing odd football links is 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.450
 say a football that normally does not 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.800
 would link with one then try 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.360
 link it to see how it is also 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.890
 I was looking in the camera were 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.450
 well some football because many times 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.579
 you think they look good then you see them 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.020
 in the camera and you do not like it then 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.650
 I was reinforcing wrists and ankles 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.480
 also day 218 in a week I had a 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.550
 football competition so I was 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.470
 preparing a set since he had a set of 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.910
 everything but football only but in the 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.370
 soccer competitions there is one thing 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.380
 strange and is that the flows do not serve you 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.180
 they do not count as football and that to me 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.430
 It limits a lot because I practice a lot 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.500
 the flows but good is a challenge more than 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.780
 you have to overcome in the end I was correcting 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.009
 and correcting the set and that's how the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.110
 truth is that this football to get entangled 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.180
 one leg to the other clip me and here this 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.920
 height change too and this that 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.270
 It looks like it has an American but it happened 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.070
 the leg inside is also very 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.569
 cool and finally find a good way 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.260
 to get out of this football and this is the 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:21.440
 sexy show but last 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.270
 already 219 now I'm sure I have 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.590
 Tendinitis in the wrists until that 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.450
 moment I thought they were just 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.340
 open so from that day on I 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.170
 put ice three times a day and for 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.820
 course he did not support the dolls in the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.650
 floor but it is that neither with fingers 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.000
 because there are times that it unbalances you if 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.320
 you end up putting the whole hand 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.780
 here you get some glass to take out 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.240
 ideas here since it is that it was like a 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.880
 crane 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.310
 and then slowly trying to see what 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.130
 I could get to do without hands trying 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.600
 yes yes the tangles with the feet thanks to 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.280
 do some soccer without hands there 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.750
 got to understand the supports that do not 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.280
 they had just been clean at the time of 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.899
 do that football and I also had to 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.880
 eat my head to invent ideas 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.590
 originals from where it was 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.360
 quite limited so I started using 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.130
 the head because if I do not touch the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.170
 back is not really fluid the truth 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.460
 is that I felt quite orthopedic more 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.440
 that nothing that with the hands seemed that 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.330
 I was dancing the sardana later 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.819
 I was also trying the sad but 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.170
 it was quite difficult and the baby love with 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.450
 the head that unbalances you is a 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.239
 heap all the time then it occurred to me 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.400
 I also use the ass I tried to do the 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.580
 Crab set but it was not very good 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.580
 idea 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.000
 day 220 I still had the competition 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.380
 but the set that he had made me no longer 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.720
 It served because he could not put his hands 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.820
 so I started to make a set without the 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.470
 hands plus strange things that were going 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.610
 leaving because of course at the time of 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.600
 nailing the music needed a 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.040
 movement that was good for it already 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.570
 221 this day only at the time of heating 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.160
 and do a bit of freestyle I've already 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.320
 account that the juices had 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.450
 improved a lot and I had the 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.030
 easier ideas and I still did not forget 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.160
 of those who had already practiced clear 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.970
 here came an evolution of the entanglement 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.010
 the one that made me cool 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.270
 and the set I had football without hands 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.270
 I was already starting to get out pretty 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.850
 something 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.660
 Even so, I still did not get away from the 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.270
 everything here I had this idea from a 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.030
 stretch I look like a sumo wrestler 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.980
 day 222 this day I came to the 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.600
 inspiration and I invented myself in new flow 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.340
 so clapping while putting the feet 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.570
 on the floor I'm realizing that in 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.250
 a lot of my movements always 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.620
 I give palms I think it's something that goes 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.490
 with me clapping always and here 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.490
 making music 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.840
 and of course we must not forget the being 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.840
 I had already done 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.129
 yes 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.620
 I had already left whole but there was 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.819
 fails in the end what rage here 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.960
 learning it for the other sense 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.080
 as well 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.520
 day 223 had not fallen in that the coi 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.210
 drop can be practiced without hands 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.220
 so I was giving him cane and 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.690
 getting head butts one of the things 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.280
 I learned from control that I did not notice 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.230
 that it was like that is that when you're in the 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.580
 back first step one leg and then 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.920
 the other to put you back in the lead 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.510
 and I spent both at the same time doing 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.940
 that did not leave my feet against 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.430
 soil and I could control it more to do it 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.960
 softer and can do it more times the 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.460
 control was one of those payments that I got 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.110
 I resisted I had not dedicated much 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.610
 time to practice it here I'm trying 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.050
 other ideas to see what I could do with 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.550
 the control to put it in a set the 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.230
 movement of the crane made it 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.730
 superman and here following the music is 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.320
 I was the pot and I threw myself on my back and 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.880
 so I thought if I put the shoulder 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.350
 well, much better when you do 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.420
 crazy freestyle following the music 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.800
 It's cool because it's that you get a 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.960
 lots of ideas that you would not think of 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.060
 in life if you will think about it and for 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.140
 finish stretching until the next video 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.140
 to take care and boix
