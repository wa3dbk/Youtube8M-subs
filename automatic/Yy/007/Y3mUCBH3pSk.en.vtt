00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.850
 I study translation because I already 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.880
 always 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.920
 what wanted to do with languages ​​and had 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.610
 then the possibility of course that 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.369
 study teachings 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.080
 but of course you have to do it too 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.710
 be made for a teacher's office 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.090
 study and then become a teacher and 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.300
 English or Romance Studies was for me 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.160
 synonymous no option because there synonymous for 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.910
 in my opinion too much literature 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.180
 were with me and then I have 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.970
 I ask and am on the 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.690
 study translate and interpret 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.010
 especially because of mine 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.290
 sister started that too 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.580
 study in front of me and I found that very much 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.620
 interesting also what you tell me about it 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.100
 and then I have myself 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.100
 simply advertised 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.510
 exactly for the study course I have 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.860
 me only in the last school year 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.780
 So decided in the thirteenth 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.260
 class 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.740
 that was relatively late but yes i did 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.270
 me then i believe in two months ago 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.040
 I have the application deadline then 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.490
 decided me there to 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.490
 apply 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.360
 in my opinion one must as 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.650
 you have to bring with you prerequisites 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.040
 on the one hand the foreign languages ​​speaks well 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.510
 but also that in the native language 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.060
 yes already has a gift or one 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.680
 talent that you can express yourself well 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.290
 that for example, sayings 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.680
 knows or that you are good about the 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.800
 Politics informs the current policy 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.110
 is and yes you have to be versatile 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.330
 be interested in different 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.770
 There are areas in the translation and 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.050
 so many areas you interpret 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.880
 can make 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.490
 and yes, there is law, for example 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.800
 economy but also technology and there 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.700
 you should already be in an area 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.700
 want to know 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.760
 my first impression of my studies was 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.520
 consistently good 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.110
 the teachers are all very nice and 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.010
 Even if you have problems you can 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.050
 those who go and ask questions 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.610
 maybe even a dumb one 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.840
 but they occur as a help 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.970
 also like to continue and the individual 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.890
 Lectures are all very interesting 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.950
 even the seminars will be very good 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.110
 designed and I find the study course 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.390
 very good here in Leipzig 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.150
 which I would not have expected 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.270
 on the one hand also certain 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.730
 educational events 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.030
 we have the fourth semester to 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.080
 for example, a module that is called 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.310
 nonverbal short and terminology teaching 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.910
 and there we have one for example 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.400
 All semester long about mechanical engineering 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.710
 you do not expect that and you do not expect that 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.550
 as a language student or as a translation 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:05.400
 student that one over there too 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.770
 technology and for example technical 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.060
 drawings must know and 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.130
 there must also write a test 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.520
 I did not expect that, but it is 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.520
 also very interesting 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.430
 What I particularly like about studying here 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.849
 Leipzig is the big one 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.290
 university quite a lot here 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.340
 studying people and one with a 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.480
 Students of other disciplines in 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.989
 can contact 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.209
 especially here on the campus and 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.879
 yes the city is just super nice one 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.060
 has great parks and cultural offer 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:46.640
 is very versatile and is for everyone 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.590
 actually what is so far in the matter 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.349
 Leipzig as a place of study already very beautiful 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.860
 but the university leipzig is also 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.780
 very good especially because our the 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.880
 leipzig school that translate and 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.880
 it is also very well recognized 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.840
 typical false expectations and 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.540
 I do not think I can do it 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.260
 give it up if you think about it 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.459
 informs about the study itself 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.500
 maybe it's like that one 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.239
 or another thinks when he is with the 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.970
 study is done that he maybe 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:24.979
 only literature will translate or only 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.990
 technical texts but that is not 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.760
 so you really have to be in all 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.520
 areas can be competent as well 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.650
 have one or two subject areas 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.349
 in which one is specialized but one 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.880
 should already be open and also in 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.489
 other areas have some knowledge 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.569
 respectively 

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:48.360
 my advice for the new students would be 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:50.219
 on the one hand also on the 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.979
 prepare for the fitness test very very well 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.839
 that is very important and through the 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.369
 Input test you can already see which one 

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:58.099
 requirements also for the students 

00:04:56.369 --> 00:05:00.569
 be put 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.979
 what you need to know about which 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.619
 knowledge you have to have 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.919
 you always have to speak the language 

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:10.169
 keep learning and working hard 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.869
 Practice practicing is very important 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.749
 us so that you can always speak the language 

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:17.249
 perfecting can master perfectly 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:19.349
 you can not speak that language 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:21.749
 logically that can not be done 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.279
 no human but you should as well as 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:25.490
 possible to really speak the language 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:28.020
 can 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.379
 what I want to do after graduation 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.599
 which is relatively open yet because the 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:36.089
 although very specific and 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.349
 but very handy is available after 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:38.279
 actually many possibilities 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.969
 open 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:44.879
 You can either work at the start or 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:47.069
 at international organizations man 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:50.240
 For example , you can go to the eu if you like 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:53.219
 then you join the master 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.659
 can work one by one 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:57.719
 Translation or interpreting office 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:59.430
 open up and what I specifically do 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:03.209
 First of all, I want to be the master in 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:06.919
 conference interpreter and then I know 

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:06.919
 I will not see that yet
