00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.830
 good afternoon dear friends if you logged in 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.680
 watching this channel 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.740
 video means you are interested in the question 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.439
 business in the village I want to immediately say that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.900
 going through a lot of ways to make money in the village 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.380
 we came to the conclusion that earn yourself 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.570
 can be provided that you love the land and 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.949
 ready to invest a lot of strength to get 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.960
 return in the form of moral and material 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:41.519
 rewards and so this channel was 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.580
 created for people who want 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:47.280
 make money working on the land we 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.100
 have chosen a spice growing business 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.769
 herbs but easier to say dill parsley 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.409
 bow feather and so on well and actually 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.739
 development of this business will be dedicated 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:01.710
 this channel starting with the fact that business is 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.220
 will be a family that is, I am with my wife and son 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.619
 by the way who created this channel once 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.409
 there is a business you need to give it a name 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.310
 we decided to call it for solidity and 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:18.150
 the farmer plus company does it all on 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.540
 plot of the garden means the dimensions here 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.250
 it's about a hectare well for a start 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.440
 we plowed the ground for spring sowing 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.500
 cooked seeds 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.210
 Partially made podzimniy sowing 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.610
 did a little bit early 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.810
 Dill started already vylazit I later lay out 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.750
 This video and had to buy agro 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.090
 film and cover it in the hope that for 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.220
 winter he will not be gone 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.740
 In principle, in Ukraine we have such winters 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.550
 rather mild climate 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.790
 so there is a chance that in the spring we already 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.090
 there will be 1 early green 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.070
 but when the cold started I started 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.930
 the creation of the site on which decided 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.800
 try to translate in parallel 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.989
 the idea of ​​creating an online garden principle 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.330
 Italians started this four years ago 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.780
 introduce well and in advance 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.730
 to stuff a fleece to a bath our goods I 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.379
 comments then give a reference to this 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.620
 see all site understand what it is about 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.349
 by the way saver 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.040
 This video will be the first home 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.140
 page of the site but this is not an advertisement of the site 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.110
 just now there is no camera new year kids 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.760
 taken for filming on a New Year tree 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.409
 so I had to do it so far on 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.730
 channel generally will be posted videos 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.530
 about the stages of formation of our business 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.140
 emerging issues about what we 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.780
 did wrong what we did 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.049
 good as they say 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.390
 all the results achieved by the way in 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.459
 time creating the site I ran into 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.859
 the problem of a small amount of specific 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.120
 information on the direction of this business 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:10.959
 that is, rabbits from articles actually so 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:15.549
 a lot on but for the most part they 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:17.799
 repeated and a lot of incompetent 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.760
 information or in general water pour and 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.829
 it's not clear why they shot why they wrote here 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.379
 I decided in parallel with the development of our 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:29.109
 businesses to lead this channel for those to whom 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.389
 it will be interesting maybe something i 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:35.230
 help my example so as not to stuff 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:38.730
 bumps themselves can someone tell me 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.069
 something so subscribe to the channel and 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.379
 wait as they say rollers from the scene 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:50.190
 of events 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:50.190
