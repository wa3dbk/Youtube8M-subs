00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
this is where we're going to take

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:30.660 
this is where we're going to take
everything<00:01:29.709> off<00:01:29.889> we're<00:01:30.159> going<00:01:30.279> to<00:01:30.340> go<00:01:30.459> to<00:01:30.520> the

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
everything off we're going to go to the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.300 
everything off we're going to go to the
effect<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:32.259> we're<00:01:32.829> going<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:32.979> start<00:01:33.159> off<00:01:33.249> with

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
effect and we're going to start off with

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.779 
effect and we're going to start off with
ambient<00:01:33.959> inclusion<00:01:34.959> and<00:01:35.249> for<00:01:36.249> the<00:01:36.310> maximum

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
ambient inclusion and for the maximum

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.909 
ambient inclusion and for the maximum
maximum<00:01:37.240> ray<00:01:37.749> length<00:01:38.020> we're<00:01:38.229> going<00:01:38.349> to<00:01:38.409> boost

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:38.919 
maximum ray length we're going to boost

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:42.899 
maximum ray length we're going to boost
that<00:01:39.130> up<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.549> 300<00:01:40.889> that<00:01:41.889> ambient<00:01:42.459> occlusion

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
that up to 300 that ambient occlusion

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.940 
that up to 300 that ambient occlusion
gives<00:01:43.329> it<00:01:43.479> a<00:01:43.590> crap<00:01:44.590> ton<00:01:44.619> of<00:01:46.319> shadows<00:01:47.319> like<00:01:47.679> deep

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
gives it a crap ton of shadows like deep

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.370 
gives it a crap ton of shadows like deep
shadows<00:01:48.429> and<00:01:48.719> we're<00:01:49.719> going<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:49.899> go<00:01:49.989> to<00:01:50.020> effect

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
shadows and we're going to go to effect

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.469 
shadows and we're going to go to effect
again<00:01:50.679> and<00:01:50.919> select<00:01:51.549> global<00:01:52.149> illumination

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
again and select global illumination

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.959 
again and select global illumination
this<00:01:53.049> is<00:01:53.169> where<00:01:53.349> the<00:01:54.069> reflection<00:01:54.639> comes<00:01:54.789> into

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
this is where the reflection comes into

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.659 
this is where the reflection comes into
play<00:01:55.319> we're<00:01:56.319> going<00:01:56.439> to<00:01:56.499> change<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:57.009> GI<00:01:57.279> mode

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:57.669 
play we're going to change the GI mode

00:01:57.669 --> 00:02:02.969 
play we're going to change the GI mode
to<00:01:58.169> ir<00:01:59.169> +<00:01:59.469> q<00:01:59.829> MC<00:02:00.359> still<00:02:01.359> image<00:02:01.719> like<00:02:02.499> that<00:02:02.709> and

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
to ir + q MC still image like that and

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.739 
to ir + q MC still image like that and
then<00:02:03.549> we're<00:02:03.700> going<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.849> go<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:04.029> the<00:02:04.209> e<00:02:04.239> radiance

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
we can make this bigger kinda so it kind

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.870 
we can make this bigger kinda so it kind
of<00:02:49.540> fills<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.930> area<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.320> little<00:02:50.470> bit<00:02:50.880> not

of fills the area a little bit not
humongous<00:02:52.570> but<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:52.960> know<00:02:53.080> decent-sized<00:02:53.620> kind

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
humongous but you know decent-sized kind

humongous but you know decent-sized kind
of<00:02:53.950> like<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.060> covers<00:02:55.210> your<00:02:55.450> object

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
of like that so it covers your object

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.440 
of like that so it covers your object
that<00:02:56.110> you're<00:02:56.200> trying<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.530> make<00:02:56.860> reflect<00:02:57.450> have

that you're trying to make reflect have

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.000 
that you're trying to make reflect have
the<00:02:58.570> reflection<00:02:58.960> on<00:02:59.080> you're<00:02:59.560> going<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.710> rise

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
the reflection on you're going to rise

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.190 
the reflection on you're going to rise
this<00:03:00.400> above<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.600> doesn't<00:03:01.870> matter<00:03:01.930> really

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
this above it it doesn't matter really

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.110 
this above it it doesn't matter really
how<00:03:02.350> high<00:03:02.620> guess<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.100> were<00:03:03.520> however<00:03:03.670> high<00:03:04.060> you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
how high guess it were however high you

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.680 
how high guess it were however high you
like<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:06.070> like<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:07.000> about<00:03:07.270> there<00:03:07.450> and

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
like it and I like it about there and

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.030 
like it and I like it about there and
what<00:03:08.410> we're<00:03:08.530> going<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.710> do<00:03:08.800> we're<00:03:08.860> going<00:03:08.980> to

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
what we're going to do we're going to

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.440 
what we're going to do we're going to
make<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.190> new<00:03:09.310> texture<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.180> we're<00:03:10.270> going<00:03:10.330> to

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
make a new texture so we're going to

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.240 
make a new texture so we're going to
double<00:03:10.660> click<00:03:10.690> in<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.990> texture<00:03:11.410> materials<00:03:12.100> I

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
double click in the texture materials I

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.400 
double click in the texture materials I
mean<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.660> we're<00:03:13.660> going<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.810> open<00:03:13.960> that<00:03:14.200> up<00:03:14.380> and

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
mean and we're going to open that up and

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.800 
mean and we're going to open that up and
we're<00:03:15.310> going<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.460> make<00:03:15.580> this<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:16.030> color<00:03:16.480> white

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
we're going to make this the color white

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.110 
we're going to make this the color white
and<00:03:17.170> we're<00:03:17.530> going<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.710> add<00:03:17.830> a<00:03:17.860> luminance<00:03:18.430> we're

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
and we're going to add a luminance we're

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.510 
and we're going to add a luminance we're
going<00:03:19.240> to<00:03:19.300> just<00:03:19.810> leave<00:03:19.990> how<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.520> should

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
going to just leave how it is should

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.460 
going to just leave how it is should
already<00:03:21.880> be<00:03:22.030> set<00:03:22.180> at<00:03:22.300> white<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.810> we're<00:03:23.350> going

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
already be set at white and we're going

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.449 
already be set at white and we're going
to<00:03:23.500> drag<00:03:23.830> that<00:03:24.010> onto<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:26.380> plane<00:03:26.739> like

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
to drag that onto the the plane like

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.460 
to drag that onto the the plane like
that<00:03:27.489> so<00:03:27.910> it<00:03:28.000> should<00:03:28.150> be<00:03:28.180> white<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.720> then

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
that so it should be white and then

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.810 
that so it should be white and then
we're<00:03:29.739> going<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:29.890> come<00:03:30.070> over<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.550> plane

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
we're going to come over to the plane

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.000 
we're going to come over to the plane
over<00:03:31.150> here<00:03:31.300> right<00:03:31.540> click<00:03:31.690> on<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:31.959> go<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.620> cinema

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
see something that says seen by camera

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.720 
see something that says seen by camera
should<00:03:40.209> be<00:03:40.330> checked<00:03:40.680> uncheck<00:03:41.680> that<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:42.100> what

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
should be checked uncheck that and what

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.040 
should be checked uncheck that and what
that's<00:03:42.910> going<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.150> do<00:03:43.330> is<00:03:43.540> when<00:03:43.720> we<00:03:43.840> render

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
that's going to do is when we render

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.420 
that's going to do is when we render
this<00:03:44.320> out<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.920> will<00:03:45.580> it<00:03:46.330> won't<00:03:46.630> be<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.890> won't<00:03:48.190> be

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.729 
you guys what it looks like if it's
checked<00:03:52.150> it'll<00:03:52.420> it'll<00:03:52.690> be<00:03:52.900> visible<00:03:53.320> as<00:03:53.500> you

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
checked it'll it'll be visible as you

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.140 
checked it'll it'll be visible as you
can<00:03:53.860> see<00:03:54.010> right<00:03:55.800> whatever<00:03:56.800> yeah<00:03:57.730> it'll<00:03:57.970> be

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
can see right whatever yeah it'll be

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.460 
can see right whatever yeah it'll be
visible<00:03:59.400> as<00:04:00.400> fail<00:04:00.790> it'll<00:04:01.600> be<00:04:01.690> visible<00:04:02.110> just

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
visible as fail it'll be visible just

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.920 
visible as fail it'll be visible just
uncheck<00:04:02.739> it<00:04:03.250> because<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.580> will<00:04:03.730> happen<00:04:03.940> if<00:04:04.239> you

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
uncheck it because it will happen if you

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.380 
uncheck it because it will happen if you
don't<00:04:05.050> uncheck<00:04:05.380> it<00:04:06.060> always<00:04:07.060> do<00:04:07.180> that<00:04:07.209> when

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
don't uncheck it always do that when

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.479 
don't uncheck it always do that when
you're<00:04:07.660> doing<00:04:08.260> this<00:04:08.380> kind<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:08.739> reflection

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
you're doing this kind of reflection

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.340 
you're doing this kind of reflection
style<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.300> then<00:04:10.750> we're<00:04:10.840> going<00:04:10.930> to<00:04:10.989> copy<00:04:11.230> that

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
style and then we're going to copy that

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.880 
style and then we're going to copy that
plane<00:04:11.650> by<00:04:12.610> hitting<00:04:12.880> control<00:04:13.330> C<00:04:13.840> control<00:04:13.870> V<00:04:14.410> and

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
plane by hitting control C control V and

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.860 
plane by hitting control C control V and
then<00:04:15.489> we<00:04:15.670> are<00:04:15.760> going<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:16.090> drag<00:04:16.390> it<00:04:16.419> underneath

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
then we are going to drag it underneath

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.180 
then we are going to drag it underneath
the<00:04:17.049> object<00:04:17.650> that<00:04:17.739> we're<00:04:17.890> making<00:04:17.980> a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
the object that we're making a

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.009 
the object that we're making a
reflection<00:04:18.640> on<00:04:18.730> just<00:04:19.390> like<00:04:19.510> that<00:04:19.690> so<00:04:19.900> it's

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
reflection on just like that so it's

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.440 
reflection on just like that so it's
kind<00:04:20.140> of<00:04:20.169> like<00:04:20.290> a<00:04:20.350> mini<00:04:20.709> studio<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.580> the<00:04:22.180> thing

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
kind of like a mini studio and the thing

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.390 
kind of like a mini studio and the thing
working<00:04:23.260> with<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.470> reflection<00:04:23.950> on<00:04:24.040> should<00:04:24.280> be

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
working with the reflection on should be

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.730 
working with the reflection on should be
in<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.580> middle<00:04:24.729> of<00:04:24.850> them<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.680> now<00:04:26.680> we're

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
in the middle of them and now we're

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.960 
in the middle of them and now we're
going<00:04:26.979> to<00:04:27.070> do<00:04:27.160> we<00:04:27.340> are<00:04:27.370> going<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.760> make<00:04:27.940> a

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
going to do we are going to make a

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.600 
going to do we are going to make a
texture<00:04:28.660> for<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.500> object<00:04:30.130> so

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
texture for the object so

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.700 
texture for the object so
text<00:04:30.909> or<00:04:31.000> whatever<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:31.419> we're<00:04:32.409> just<00:04:32.560> going<00:04:32.680> to

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
text or whatever and we're just going to

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.559 
text or whatever and we're just going to
make<00:04:33.129> a<00:04:33.189> new<00:04:33.370> material<00:04:33.580> double<00:04:34.240> click<00:04:34.389> it<00:04:34.509> open

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569 
make a new material double click it open

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:36.929 
make a new material double click it open
up<00:04:34.919> make<00:04:35.919> it<00:04:36.039> whatever<00:04:36.189> color<00:04:36.550> I'm<00:04:36.759> going<00:04:36.789> to

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:36.939 
up make it whatever color I'm going to

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:40.740 
up make it whatever color I'm going to
make<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.150> like<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.590> dark<00:04:38.590> orange<00:04:39.490> red<00:04:39.849> color

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
make it like a dark orange red color

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.619 
make it like a dark orange red color
like<00:04:41.199> that<00:04:41.610> we<00:04:42.610> don't<00:04:42.729> need<00:04:42.939> luminance<00:04:43.479> on

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:43.629 
like that we don't need luminance on

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:44.850 
like that we don't need luminance on
this<00:04:43.780> we're<00:04:43.900> going<00:04:43.990> to<00:04:44.050> make<00:04:44.139> a<00:04:44.199> reflection

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
this we're going to make a reflection

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.830 
this we're going to make a reflection
though<00:04:45.039> change<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.819> change<00:04:46.539> the

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
though change that to change the

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.629 
though change that to change the
brightness<00:04:47.349> of<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.740> reflection<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.460> about

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
brightness of the reflection to about

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.719 
brightness of the reflection to about
Tom<00:04:48.879> for<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.270> texture<00:04:49.780> we're<00:04:50.110> going<00:04:50.229> to

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
Tom for the texture we're going to

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.589 
Tom for the texture we're going to
select<00:04:51.729> furnell<00:04:53.129> not<00:04:54.129> Fresnel<00:04:54.789> but<00:04:55.090> Fred<00:04:55.449> L

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
select furnell not Fresnel but Fred L

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.839 
select furnell not Fresnel but Fred L
and<00:04:55.840> I'm<00:04:56.500> going<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.680> change<00:04:56.919> the<00:04:57.159> mix<00:04:57.400> strength

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
and I'm going to change the mix strength

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.719 
and I'm going to change the mix strength
to<00:04:58.150> seventy<00:04:58.780> percent<00:04:59.129> the<00:05:00.129> blurring<00:05:00.370> the

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
to seventy percent the blurring the

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.529 
to seventy percent the blurring the
blurriness<00:05:01.569> 25<00:05:02.439> percent<00:05:02.819> just<00:05:03.819> like<00:05:03.939> that<00:05:04.150> end

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
blurriness 25 percent just like that end

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.080 
blurriness 25 percent just like that end
for<00:05:05.529> the<00:05:05.620> specular<00:05:06.159> I'm<00:05:06.310> going<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.520> boost<00:05:06.819> up

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
for the specular I'm going to boost up

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.450 
for the specular I'm going to boost up
the<00:05:07.120> width<00:05:07.569> of<00:05:07.779> that<00:05:08.460> 290<00:05:09.840> boost<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:11.460> height

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
the width of that 290 boost the height

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.339 
the width of that 290 boost the height
up<00:05:12.669> to<00:05:12.699> 80<00:05:14.009> boosts<00:05:15.360> subtract<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.629> fall<00:05:17.020> off<00:05:17.169> to

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
up to 80 boosts subtract the fall off to

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.360 
up to 80 boosts subtract the fall off to
tour<00:05:17.590> negative<00:05:18.069> twenty<00:05:18.400> percent<00:05:18.699> and<00:05:19.029> the<00:05:20.370> the

tour negative twenty percent and the the
inner<00:05:21.550> width<00:05:21.879> to<00:05:22.650> two<00:05:23.650> percent<00:05:23.909> looks<00:05:24.909> nice

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
inner width to two percent looks nice

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.420 
inner width to two percent looks nice
and<00:05:25.560> though<00:05:26.560> we're<00:05:26.680> just<00:05:26.800> going<00:05:26.919> to<00:05:26.949> drag<00:05:27.189> out

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
and though we're just going to drag out

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.679 
and though we're just going to drag out
on<00:05:27.550> our<00:05:27.669> object<00:05:28.060> you<00:05:28.180> guys<00:05:28.330> might<00:05:28.539> already

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:28.689 
on our object you guys might already

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.140 
on our object you guys might already
have<00:05:28.810> a<00:05:29.199> material<00:05:29.529> on<00:05:29.919> your<00:05:30.069> object<00:05:30.430> but<00:05:31.029> it's

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
have a material on your object but it's

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.420 
have a material on your object but it's
your<00:05:31.210> choice<00:05:31.300> and<00:05:31.719> now<00:05:32.529> if<00:05:32.740> we<00:05:32.770> render<00:05:33.310> this

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
your choice and now if we render this

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.869 
your choice and now if we render this
out<00:05:33.900> if<00:05:34.900> we're<00:05:35.050> under<00:05:35.289> this<00:05:35.440> out<00:05:35.650> it<00:05:36.370> does

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
out if we're under this out it does

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.969 
out if we're under this out it does
render<00:05:37.509> differently<00:05:38.080> just<00:05:38.229> because<00:05:38.560> of<00:05:38.949> the

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
render differently just because of the

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.670 
render differently just because of the
global<00:05:39.759> illumination<00:05:39.930> but<00:05:40.930> as<00:05:41.080> you<00:05:41.259> can<00:05:41.379> see

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
global illumination but as you can see

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.909 
global illumination but as you can see
we<00:05:41.830> have<00:05:42.009> a<00:05:42.039> really<00:05:42.639> neat<00:05:43.419> and<00:05:44.020> like<00:05:44.500> a<00:05:44.529> really

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
we have a really neat and like a really

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.519 
we have a really neat and like a really
awesome<00:05:45.190> looking<00:05:45.669> reflection<00:05:46.300> going<00:05:47.080> on<00:05:47.229> in

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:47.529 
awesome looking reflection going on in

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.029 
awesome looking reflection going on in
this<00:05:48.190> image<00:05:48.639> and<00:05:49.029> the<00:05:49.839> reflections<00:05:50.379> are<00:05:50.589> kind

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
this image and the reflections are kind

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.719 
this image and the reflections are kind
of<00:05:51.219> a<00:05:51.250> I<00:05:51.699> don't<00:05:52.449> know<00:05:52.569> what<00:05:52.719> you'd<00:05:52.810> say<00:05:53.050> sharp

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
of a I don't know what you'd say sharp

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.070 
of a I don't know what you'd say sharp
you<00:05:54.729> can<00:05:54.879> see<00:05:55.089> them<00:05:55.210> very<00:05:55.419> well<00:05:55.479> like<00:05:55.930> the

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
you can see them very well like the

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.079 
you can see them very well like the
edges<00:05:56.469> of<00:05:56.620> it<00:05:56.710> and<00:05:56.949> if<00:05:57.490> you<00:05:57.610> want<00:05:57.789> to<00:05:57.879> change

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:58.089 
edges of it and if you want to change

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:00.089 
edges of it and if you want to change
that<00:05:58.300> it's<00:05:58.930> kind<00:05:59.169> of<00:05:59.259> just<00:05:59.409> reflecting<00:05:59.979> off

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
that it's kind of just reflecting off

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:02.730 
that it's kind of just reflecting off
the<00:06:00.129> plane<00:06:00.659> so<00:06:01.659> if<00:06:01.839> you<00:06:01.930> made<00:06:02.080> the<00:06:02.229> plane<00:06:02.469> a<00:06:02.500> lot

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
the plane so if you made the plane a lot

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.360 
the plane so if you made the plane a lot
bigger<00:06:03.389> if<00:06:04.389> you<00:06:04.509> made<00:06:04.659> the<00:06:04.750> plane<00:06:04.930> like

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
bigger if you made the plane like

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.909 
bigger if you made the plane like
humongous<00:06:07.469> like<00:06:08.469> this<00:06:09.960> bustos<00:06:10.960> up<00:06:11.110> to<00:06:11.229> 9,000

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
humongous like this bustos up to 9,000

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.990 
humongous like this bustos up to 9,000
it<00:06:12.039> just<00:06:12.279> stretch<00:06:13.060> it<00:06:13.089> it<00:06:14.020> out<00:06:14.199> a<00:06:14.229> bunch<00:06:14.529> and<00:06:15.000> do

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
it just stretch it it out a bunch and do

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.939 
it just stretch it it out a bunch and do
the<00:06:16.089> same<00:06:16.240> for<00:06:16.419> the<00:06:16.509> bottom<00:06:16.539> one<00:06:16.930> change<00:06:17.770> the

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
the same for the bottom one change the

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:22.980 
the same for the bottom one change the
width<00:06:18.099> of<00:06:18.189> that<00:06:18.310> to<00:06:18.490> 9,000<00:06:19.180> and<00:06:21.659> hide<00:06:22.659> up<00:06:22.810> to

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
width of that to 9,000 and hide up to

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.740 
width of that to 9,000 and hide up to
9,000<00:06:23.669> whoops<00:06:24.669> is<00:06:25.659> alright<00:06:26.189> yeah<00:06:27.189> alright<00:06:27.750> and

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
9,000 whoops is alright yeah alright and

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.540 
9,000 whoops is alright yeah alright and
then<00:06:29.110> now<00:06:29.500> if<00:06:29.710> we<00:06:30.000> if<00:06:31.000> we<00:06:31.060> do<00:06:31.240> this<00:06:31.419> I<00:06:32.550> think

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
then now if we if we do this I think

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.839 
then now if we if we do this I think
it'll<00:06:33.729> different<00:06:34.469> I'll<00:06:35.469> see<00:06:35.650> you

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
it'll different I'll see you

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:37.820 
it'll different I'll see you
happens<00:06:36.089> because<00:06:37.020> see<00:06:37.319> now<00:06:37.469> it's<00:06:37.589> going<00:06:37.679> to<00:06:37.740> be

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
happens because see now it's going to be

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.439 
happens because see now it's going to be
like<00:06:37.919> all<00:06:38.129> white<00:06:38.339> because<00:06:38.669> it's<00:06:38.879> reflecting

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 
like all white because it's reflecting

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:40.969 
like all white because it's reflecting
off<00:06:39.599> of<00:06:39.629> those<00:06:39.899> planes<00:06:40.259> that<00:06:40.439> we<00:06:40.589> have<00:06:40.740> so

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
off of those planes that we have so

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:42.859 
off of those planes that we have so
however<00:06:41.129> big<00:06:41.429> your<00:06:41.550> plane<00:06:41.819> is<00:06:41.849> the<00:06:42.509> bigger<00:06:42.719> the

00:06:42.859 --> 00:06:42.869 
however big your plane is the bigger the

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.659 
however big your plane is the bigger the
reflection<00:06:43.379> it's<00:06:43.679> all<00:06:43.830> based<00:06:44.099> off<00:06:44.309> of<00:06:44.369> your

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
reflection it's all based off of your

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.959 
reflection it's all based off of your
off<00:06:44.969> of<00:06:45.360> your<00:06:45.449> plane<00:06:45.809> really<00:06:46.759> I'm<00:06:47.759> going<00:06:47.909> to

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:47.969 
off of your plane really I'm going to

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:50.119 
off of your plane really I'm going to
pause<00:06:48.179> it<00:06:48.209> wait<00:06:48.449> for<00:06:48.479> this<00:06:48.659> to<00:06:48.719> render<00:06:49.199> out<00:06:49.349> no

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:50.129 
pause it wait for this to render out no

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:52.129 
pause it wait for this to render out no
it's<00:06:50.669> going<00:06:50.939> hang<00:06:51.240> on<00:06:51.360> I<00:06:51.539> was<00:06:51.749> positive<00:06:51.959> for

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
it's going hang on I was positive for

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:53.419 
it's going hang on I was positive for
you<00:06:52.289> guys<00:06:52.409> so<00:06:52.589> it<00:06:52.679> doesn't<00:06:52.979> waste<00:06:53.129> video

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:53.429 
you guys so it doesn't waste video

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:55.579 
you guys so it doesn't waste video
timing<00:06:53.759> so<00:06:54.689> as<00:06:54.809> you<00:06:54.929> can<00:06:55.020> see<00:06:55.199> we<00:06:55.289> have<00:06:55.319> a<00:06:55.409> like

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:55.589 
timing so as you can see we have a like

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:57.079 
timing so as you can see we have a like
a<00:06:55.619> completely<00:06:56.129> different<00:06:56.249> kind<00:06:56.999> of

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:57.089 
a completely different kind of

00:06:57.089 --> 00:06:59.359 
a completely different kind of
reflection<00:06:57.479> now<00:06:57.719> it's<00:06:57.869> like<00:06:57.990> like<00:06:58.679> a<00:06:58.709> weird

00:06:59.359 --> 00:06:59.369 
reflection now it's like like a weird

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:01.760 
reflection now it's like like a weird
reflection<00:07:00.029> so<00:07:00.300> it's<00:07:00.839> all<00:07:01.020> based<00:07:01.289> off<00:07:01.469> of<00:07:01.529> your

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
reflection so it's all based off of your

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.429 
reflection so it's all based off of your
planes<00:07:02.159> how<00:07:02.399> big<00:07:02.639> they<00:07:02.819> are<00:07:02.849> how<00:07:03.229> far<00:07:04.229> they<00:07:04.409> are

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:04.439 
planes how big they are how far they are

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.589 
planes how big they are how far they are
and<00:07:04.860> you<00:07:05.339> know<00:07:05.369> the<00:07:05.939> smaller<00:07:06.240> they<00:07:06.449> are<00:07:06.479> the

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:06.599 
and you know the smaller they are the

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:08.749 
and you know the smaller they are the
smaller<00:07:06.959> the<00:07:07.259> reflection<00:07:07.740> will<00:07:07.860> be<00:07:07.979> I<00:07:08.189> like<00:07:08.669> to

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 
smaller the reflection will be I like to

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:10.219 
smaller the reflection will be I like to
have<00:07:08.909> them<00:07:09.029> about<00:07:09.179> medium<00:07:09.539> size<00:07:09.749> it<00:07:09.990> makes<00:07:10.019> it

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229 
have them about medium size it makes it

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:14.299 
have them about medium size it makes it
look<00:07:10.289> really<00:07:10.469> nice<00:07:10.849> and<00:07:13.069> yeah<00:07:14.069> guys<00:07:14.249> that

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:14.309 
look really nice and yeah guys that

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.549 
look really nice and yeah guys that
