00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.810
 and 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.570
 Hello 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.239
 to people who see me and who enjoy 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.699
 my videos x of this series already had 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:27.039
 already announced that they will deal with the 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:33.400
 generations of consoles and all that and and 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:35.530
 who know all that let's start the first 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.839
 generation had several consoles 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.670
 sears of the game pong better known as 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.589
 atari by the cole cotel star and the 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.570
 magnavox odyssey that was the first 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.610
 console to be taken to the market 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.790
 all these consoles were 2 bytes and 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.689
 they were present since the years 1972 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.879
 to 1977 let's start talking about the magnavox 

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:56.830
 odyssey is the first console of the 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.199
 history is nicknamed the father of 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.949
 homemade video games the magnavox odyssey 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.839
 came out in May 1972 his tablet game 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.330
 pong was so good that the console sold 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.460
 100,000 copies was sold only in 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.170
 the magnavox stores saying 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.270
 in addition to the customers of the odyssey 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.790
 I would work only on television 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.729
 his brand a lie that contributed to the 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.520
 number of units sold x of their 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.649
 games are all sports brought 28 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.250
 games that is all sports that are 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.160
 can 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.290
 among those games are football 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.480
 volleyball and ping pong that was the game 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.880
 most characteristic of the console had 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.430
 different add-ons for example the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.450
 gun used cartridges and was worth 200 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.880
 dollars the unit 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.550
 this was all the information on this 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.979
 console surely had more things but 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.560
 I did not live at that time so how am I going 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.260
 to know that we continue with the console 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.300
 atari this was called the atari pong this 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.580
 console did not have cartridges or anything 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.710
 that only brought a game which was 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.200
 called pong imitating the tablet pong of 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.420
 the previous console this console was 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.490
 bought by the sears company there 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.920
 comes his name be this the game pong 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.720
 good and from this console I have nothing 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.880
 more to say but that was the most 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.890
 representative of the generation and not 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.160
 only of that generation but the most 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.810
 representative of all videogames 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.940
 let's continue with the cabbage ecotel be this 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.280
 console also only brought the pong game 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.350
 plagiarizing athar and that led him to have 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.110
 many fights with the rival company 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.450
 although this console was cheaper than 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.090
 the caricom and that produced very good 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.760
 sales this console also had several 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.950
 which are the following being 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.870
 classic deluxe room being 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.180
 ranger who brought games with 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.849
 alpha sar gun of the star king in 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.129
 athlete star telstar combat that 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.650
 he brought four analogs of the star color 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.750
 throne of star marksman telstar galaxy 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.030
 of the star gemini from the arcade star that 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.860
 he brought cartridges in my opinion this 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.019
 console was the worst of the generation 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.660
 although he brought several models and was more 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.489
 cheap than the others since we saw everything 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.620
 this we can assure who won the 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.400
 generation the winner of this 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.739
 generations 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.959
 undoubtedly the magnavox odyssey won the 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.879
 first generation simply for being 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.980
 the first videoconsole wins that more 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.230
 innovative that that apart from being the 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.599
 console that more units sold reached 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.700
 to sell 100 thousand units and stays with 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.220
 the first place the second place is 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.379
 for the atari with which he sold 55 thousand 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.659
 units and the col ecotel star I do not know 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.430
 how many units did you sell but I do not think 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.319
 have sold more than to tie and put well 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.180
 that stays with the third place if not 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.879
 so please correct me in 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.129
 comments that was all for this first 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.889
