where they go

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.850 
where they go
obviously<00:04:34.660> it's<00:04:34.810> moving<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.170> expect<00:04:35.560> the

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
obviously it's moving to expect the

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.550 
obviously it's moving to expect the
health<00:04:36.340> of<00:04:36.520> your<00:04:36.610> vehicle<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.540> standoff

all this I really can't you like charge
off<00:05:52.329> it<00:05:52.569> doesn't<00:05:52.809> really<00:05:52.899> matter<00:05:53.199> how<00:05:53.409> long

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:53.709 
off it doesn't really matter how long

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:55.889 
off it doesn't really matter how long
you're<00:05:54.009> charging<00:05:54.489> up<00:05:54.610> actually<00:05:55.149> because<00:05:55.839> you

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:55.899 
you're charging up actually because you

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:57.869 
you're charging up actually because you
always<00:05:56.050> get<00:05:56.259> the<00:05:56.379> same<00:05:56.589> height<00:05:57.279> which<00:05:57.699> isn't

00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:57.879 
always get the same height which isn't

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:03.509 
always get the same height which isn't
necessarily<00:05:58.300> bad<00:05:58.629> day<00:06:01.739> how<00:06:02.739> we<00:06:02.800> doing<00:06:03.249> it's<00:06:03.369> uh

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:03.519 
necessarily bad day how we doing it's uh

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:05.309 
necessarily bad day how we doing it's uh
my<00:06:03.579> first<00:06:03.789> try

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:05.319 
my first try

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:08.379 
my first try
so<00:06:06.319> I<00:06:06.350> can<00:06:06.620> produce<00:06:07.130> grenades<00:06:07.910> I<00:06:08.090> don't<00:06:08.240> really

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
so I can produce grenades I don't really

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.900 
so I can produce grenades I don't really
think<00:06:08.449> it's<00:06:08.690> much<00:06:08.870> slower<00:06:09.110> than<00:06:09.440> the<00:06:09.910> other

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
think it's much slower than the other

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.879 
think it's much slower than the other
vehicle<00:06:11.360> was<00:06:11.479> probably<00:06:11.750> actually<00:06:12.259> faster<00:06:12.860> to

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
vehicle was probably actually faster to

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.749 
vehicle was probably actually faster to
the<00:06:13.069> desert<00:06:13.550> did<00:06:13.910> a<00:06:13.940> tough<00:06:14.180> puppy<00:06:15.669> but<00:06:16.669> I'm

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 
the desert did a tough puppy but I'm

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:18.189 
the desert did a tough puppy but I'm
