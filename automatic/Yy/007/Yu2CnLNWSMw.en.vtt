it and we can wait too lat and downloads

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.630 
it and we can wait too lat and downloads
and<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.380> install<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.770> it'll<00:01:44.460> take<00:01:44.610> a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and then we can install it it'll take a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.760 
and then we can install it it'll take a
couple<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:45.030> seconds<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.540> but<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.560> is

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
couple of seconds and but this is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.639 
couple of seconds and but this is
necessary<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:48.119> your<00:01:48.240> server<00:01:48.689> or<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.290> will<00:01:49.470> not

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
necessary for your server or it will not

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.539 
necessary for your server or it will not
work<00:01:49.710> without<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:52.140> hopefully<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:53.280> will

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
work without it so hopefully it will

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.940 
work without it so hopefully it will
hurry<00:01:53.790> up<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.060> bit<00:01:54.210> there<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.630> go<00:01:54.750> right<00:01:54.960> going

we're gonna just call us and server

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.400 
we're gonna just call us and server
tutorial<00:02:32.500> like<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:35.690> downloaded<00:02:36.230> a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
tutorial like this and you downloaded a

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.130 
tutorial like this and you downloaded a
craft<00:02:36.800> buckets<00:02:37.190> file<00:02:37.910> first<00:02:38.570> download<00:02:38.930> you

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
craft buckets file first download you

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.410 
craft buckets file first download you
downloaded<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.860> have<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:40.700> drag<00:02:40.910> this<00:02:41.090> into

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
downloaded and have to drag this into

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.060 
downloaded and have to drag this into
the<00:02:41.780> folder<00:02:42.170> like<00:02:42.350> that<00:02:42.560> now<00:02:42.830> let's<00:02:42.980> just

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
the folder like that now let's just

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.400 
the folder like that now let's just
minimize<00:02:43.250> this<00:02:43.460> and<00:02:44.420> open<00:02:44.780> up<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.930> bullet<00:02:45.260> and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
minimize this and open up the bullet and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.650 
minimize this and open up the bullet and
there<00:02:46.130> we<00:02:46.220> go<00:02:46.340> now<00:02:46.490> we<00:02:46.610> want<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.910> rename<00:02:47.420> this

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
and so it's just called craft bucket

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.950 
and so it's just called craft bucket

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
server on 2 gigabytes and so you want to

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.880 
server on 2 gigabytes and so you want to
put<00:03:39.519> qo4<00:03:40.519> 8<00:03:40.850> now<00:03:41.510> my<00:03:41.780> friends<00:03:42.080> say<00:03:42.230> that<00:03:42.260> it

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
put qo4 8 now my friends say that it

put qo4 8 now my friends say that it
runs<00:03:43.220> really<00:03:43.430> smoothly<00:03:43.820> and<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:45.500> works<00:03:45.680> fine

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
runs really smoothly and it works fine

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.540 
runs really smoothly and it works fine
so<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.280> keep<00:03:46.489> my<00:03:46.670> server<00:03:47.180> on<00:03:47.269> 2<00:03:47.510> gigabytes<00:03:47.930> and

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
so I keep my server on 2 gigabytes and

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.970 
so I keep my server on 2 gigabytes and
my<00:03:49.550> computer<00:03:49.910> seems<00:03:50.150> right<00:03:50.420> with<00:03:50.540> that<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:50.980> so

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
my computer seems right with that and so

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.240 
my computer seems right with that and so
yes<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:52.340> can<00:03:52.670> mess<00:03:52.820> around<00:03:52.850> with<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:53.150> and

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
yes you can mess around with that and

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.030 
yes you can mess around with that and
yeah<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:55.489> when<00:03:55.640> once<00:03:56.030> you've<00:03:56.150> done<00:03:56.269> that

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
yeah so when once you've done that

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.910 
yeah so when once you've done that

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
can see that it will generate all these

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.920 
can see that it will generate all these
files<00:04:28.640> and<00:04:28.880> folders<00:04:29.210> in<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.810> background

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
files and folders in the background

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.200 
files and folders in the background
it's<00:04:32.199> like<00:04:32.349> just<00:04:32.530> wait<00:04:32.770> till<00:04:33.099> it<00:04:33.520> finishes<00:04:33.940> it

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
it's like just wait till it finishes it

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.180 
it's like just wait till it finishes it
should<00:04:34.389> say<00:04:34.569> dawn<00:04:34.840> at<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.169> bottom<00:04:35.500> but<00:04:36.039> it's

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
should say dawn at the bottom but it's

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.369 
should say dawn at the bottom but it's
all<00:04:36.340> done<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:38.250> mom<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:39.789> I<00:04:40.539> think<00:04:40.960> that's

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
all done and mom and I think that's

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:42.600 
all done and mom and I think that's
basically<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:42.069> we<00:04:42.159> just<00:04:42.310> need<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.490> go<00:04:42.580> through

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
basically it we just need to go through

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.770 
basically it we just need to go through
the<00:04:43.419> properties<00:04:44.319> and<00:04:45.180> yeah<00:04:46.180> right<00:04:46.449> so<00:04:46.599> now

would<00:05:25.990> work

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
would work

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.619 
would work
a<00:05:26.889> small<00:05:27.490> monsters<00:05:27.909> and<00:05:28.030> all<00:05:28.090> that<00:05:28.270> so<00:05:28.479> once

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:28.629 
a small monsters and all that so once

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.860 
a small monsters and all that so once
you're<00:05:28.750> done<00:05:28.780> with<00:05:28.960> that<00:05:29.289> hit<00:05:29.740> save<00:05:29.949> and<00:05:30.870> close

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870
