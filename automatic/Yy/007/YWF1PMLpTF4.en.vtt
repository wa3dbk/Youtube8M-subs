00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.730
 Yes No 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.050
 no 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.280
 no 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:20.130
 as stage guys will be alone are here a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.920
 present this new video that i 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.840
 boys is a shrub arbid but who has one 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.400
 score to give quite particular 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.170
 first of all because it consists of 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.669
 players you recommended me as 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.439
 on the facebook page and then 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.460
 secondly true it will present in 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.710
 a bit different 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.720
 in fact this team I don't have 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.270
 still used or better I used 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.370
 sometimes some symbol of this 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.230
 team but all is the complex I have not 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.640
 still used because it's me 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.670
 always said based on ha 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.030
 spent of climate trying out business lines 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.100
 of matches and then go away diano 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.690
 of reviews at the end of the video and therefore has 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.579
 said but we must try also in 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.559
 this way anyway I wanted to present 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.719
 remember the past they had said 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.219
 interested in buying fifa kg and then 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.290
 I just wanted to say that this is the fifth 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.390
 fourth video face of a day is 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.060
 really rather be really tired 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.990
 however technically speaking it is the last one 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.420
 of the day 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.700
 and the two sexes in the end is more important 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.260
 it is known, however, then it must start 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.600
 immediately present you a moment a team 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.220
 then it matters we use tim howard but 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.110
 abi months I really have kids or not 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.790
 crisis ship to buy all this 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.170
 team or not we say all the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.759
 versions of use of this team 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.009
 you can take back the same players 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.960
 but obviously rules may not have to 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.240
 only in form or even not 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.719
 normal so let's start right away 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.159
 use or hard paid the beauty of 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.110
 325,000 rights as two defenders 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.880
 central use of sting and brooks 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.740
 brooks boys was also from the versions 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.170
 less should only now 9 credits 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.640
 sony of whom however looked like a beast 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.869
 in fact as soon as he could take the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.430
 I'll take it because I want to try it 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.200
 absolutely as a left-back 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.049
 use tell me as right back 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.850
 pekarik explains hedgehogs paid only 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.219
 550 instead of eni and use in 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.810
 form and paid 57,000 credits as 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.369
 central offensive midfielder throws 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.009
 down on one side the magical 5 st 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.759
 rodriguez paying the bennet of 260 thousand 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.320
 credits 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.330
 oh well don't take away how many for 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.039
 gorman use in almost all stable 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.470
 then like other civic use of 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.570
 hebrew de bruyn international 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.790
 he didn't try it he inspires me a 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.680
 slaughter because five peter stars 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.810
 the four stars maturity are not seen 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.580
 every day as two cdc use 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.560
 on the mature side from the other bund le 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.210
 English two acts are there or plans 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.340
 integrated the novices because I don't know if you have 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.810
 I never said it, though, as soon as it was bought back 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.940
 because if you remember some time ago 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.370
 I had a bookseller in the club that second 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.410
 me a player paid lives wandered 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.320
 think of a 89 so think about it 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.640
 strong and instead to say not there 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.920
 we find we find the mancio as the pa 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.020
 which now as I am preferring to the di 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.500
 barbie in 19 games made 10 goals and 5 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.880
 assists 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.770
 but first he used it in a form 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.140
 different because in fact I am not there 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.060
 presenting a 3 5 2 pro does not 3 3 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.520
 because they want to change 4 2 2 2 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.380
 2 2 globetreads however I had found myself 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.780
 very well said master boys al 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.450
 I'd say go for the first two 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.980
 the kids play today a number la 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.380
 team our opponent and then it 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.930
 I forgot to tell me what I think it is 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.300
 one of them is one of the best guides for 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.620
 which I really liked then I wanted 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.570
 thank because precisely I did it 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.489
 also on your advice I then have 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.269
 put together a bit of everything but if I have to 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.310
 to be honest 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.200
 in my opinion it was worth among the many i 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.700
 credits and give one of mine is a beast 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:30.209
 with is one of my best hybrids right away 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.550
 of anis rodriguez advances in the face 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.120
 valette two there is a turnip and that one brings 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.200
 already ahead in the second minute of 10 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.590
 come on and all bullshit and air the braves 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.900
 for sick but the pa enters the area 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.680
 coutinho book viva ibra ibra e 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.810
 cholesterol at 0 to the tenth minute 4 in 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.980
 home and team boys as much as me 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:00.660
 like mammamia among danilo zlatan 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.500
 ibrahimovic with skills goes on ii 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.400
 discard all 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.850
 zlatan will go and put her where she is but 4 a 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.489
 0 gentlemen I never would have thought of who 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:15.650
 this team was so strong 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:18.900
 my mom at eighteenth already 3 to 0 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.400
 according to today's challengers 43 of the league 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.020
 but I would say 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.169
 to destroy even this rodriguez has 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.820
 still for mara for madrid instead no i 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:37.080
 several do not do it boom 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:41.940

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.620
 a beast 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.810
 obviously the players that I am 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.910

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.280

 also trade that always has good 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.850

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.360
