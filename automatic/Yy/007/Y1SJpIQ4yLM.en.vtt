00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.050
 let's do the demonstration for all 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.830
 our friends who ask us how 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:15.480
 is the connection of two bulbs with a 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.970
 double switch one for each 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.700
 for this we are going to support 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.290
 in a connection diagram 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.290
 the connection circuit that I have here 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.330
 we are going to remove the bulbs from the objects 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.170
 here I have two sockets of different 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.230
 model but they fulfill the same function in 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.610
 reality 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.520
 in the circuit tells us 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.430
 than from the 220 volt source that 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.250
 is the neutral line the line of 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.830
 neutral connect to the two sockets 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.230
 how can we see it or from here what 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.600
 let's connect to the first socket and of 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.690
 there we will connect it to the second sun 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.750
 then let's make that connection 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.680
 we take from the source we take it to 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.970
 first socket in this way 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.970
 follow these steps 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.070
 let's connect it first pass it 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.070
 on this side 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.609
 let's connect 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.570
 and this we will have the first line 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.799
 connected to the neutral line now 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.409
 also tells us that from the line of the 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.659
 220 volt power supply the 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.880
 line of the phase the line of the base is 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.770
 go connected to the switch that 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.899
 would make this switch 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.799
 lakabe that we are seeing today we are going to 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.149
 connect it with another cable we bring it from 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.420
 the fountain 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.940
 we make this connection from the source 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.430
 we connect it here 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.380
 and also tells us that this same 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.470
 point we take it to the other 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.890
 switch or from here to here and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.030
 then let's make that little bridge 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.030
 with this other cable 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.030
 we connect it like this 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.500
 we adjust 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.500
 and now on the other side 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.540
 very well we already have that part the phase 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.040
 iii already entered the switch now 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.280
 tells us that the first point of the first 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.240
 switch here comes out towards the first 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.240
 socket 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.920
 in this way 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.700
 the first switch we take to the 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.020
 first socket will be the 1st switch what 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.720
 we take to the first socket 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.720
 we connect in this way 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.260
 we already have it there connected 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.630
 now he tells us that the second 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.740
 switch connects to the second socket 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.490
 I mean 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.490
 in this way 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.209
 there 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.610
 then let's make that connection 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.900
 we are going to take it here too 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.469
 do not 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.140
 to try to connect it 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.800
 very well 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.500
 we have it ready follow the steps 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.450
 get lost remember we're 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.810
 using twin cable only to 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.810
 the demonstration 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:45.670
 in a real field installation 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.670
 the twin cable should no longer be used 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.949
 let's see if everything is working 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.949
 correctly 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.569
 let's put the spotlights 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.660
 let's check if this is true 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.060
 there we have it, let's put the source 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.760
 feeding 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.569
 here we really have to use a 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.369
 thermal key but I do not have it 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.660
 you have to do it very carefully in 

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:24.790
 reality 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.590
 remember that we are working with the 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.590
 220 volt line as you can see 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.740
 the spotlights have turned on 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.310
 because you can see 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.470
 that the circuits the instructors are 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.260
 keys were operated by closing 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.980
 circuit yes us now 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.910
 we press is going to pay the first focus 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.650
 same with the second focus 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.750
 we are opening the circuit is being 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.990
 opening the circuit we can do with 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:06:01.510
 the second focus first 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:04.190
 and now with the first turn on and turn off 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:07.160
 or turn on at the same time 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.740
 turn them off at the same time 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.710
 It also depends as you already 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.650
 they can use but that's the way 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:19.750
 connection of two bulbs with its switch 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.750
 double thanks
