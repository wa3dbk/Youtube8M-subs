am a sucker for revenge in general and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.380 
am a sucker for revenge in general and
especially<00:01:19.830> at<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> collegiate<00:01:20.850> level<00:01:20.880> I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
especially at the collegiate level I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.359 
especially at the collegiate level I
think<00:01:21.840> Oregon<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.280> know

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
think Oregon is just going to you know

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.120 
think Oregon is just going to you know
go<00:01:23.580> out<00:01:23.610> there<00:01:24.000> grid<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
go out there grid it out and get the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.859 
go out there grid it out and get the
winds<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.729> I'll<00:01:27.119> take<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.450> three<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> half

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
winds so I'll take the three and a half

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.840 
winds so I'll take the three and a half
points<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:28.560> i<00:01:28.590> also<00:01:28.740> think<00:01:28.890> Oregon's<00:01:29.490> worth<00:01:29.700> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
points but i also think Oregon's worth a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.450 
points but i also think Oregon's worth a
look<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.659> money<00:01:30.840> line<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.829> go<00:01:31.950> into<00:01:32.070> boise

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
look on the money line to go into boise

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.160 
look on the money line to go into boise
state<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.820> win<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.000> one<00:01:33.210> out<00:01:33.329> right<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.780> know

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
state and win this one out right I know

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.810 
state and win this one out right I know
you're<00:01:34.409> thinking<00:01:34.439> about<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.070> Boise<00:01:35.520> State

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
you're thinking about the Boise State

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.300 
you're thinking about the Boise State
home<00:01:36.630> advantage<00:01:37.049> which<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.159> know<00:01:38.220> very

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
home advantage which is you know very

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.100 
home advantage which is you know very
incredible<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.570> go<00:01:39.689> back<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:39.900> look

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
incredible but if you go back and look

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.980 
incredible but if you go back and look
at<00:01:40.229> those<00:01:40.350> games<00:01:40.820> they<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:42.119> consistently

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
at those games they have consistently

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.600 
at those games they have consistently
played<00:01:43.320> against<00:01:43.680> teams<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.430> been

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.960 
30 and a half sticking with the revenge
angle<00:02:02.110> I<00:02:02.170> like<00:02:02.380> Illinois<00:02:02.770> minus<00:02:03.490> six<00:02:03.759> and<00:02:03.939> a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970

half<00:02:04.259> facing<00:02:05.259> Missouri<00:02:05.619> last<00:02:06.490> year<00:02:06.759> of<00:02:06.909> course

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
half facing Missouri last year of course

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.850 
half facing Missouri last year of course
this<00:02:07.630> was<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.840> great<00:02:08.080> game<00:02:08.319> to<00:02:08.500> start<00:02:08.679> the

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
this was a great game to start the

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.220 
this was a great game to start the
season<00:02:09.090> Illinois<00:02:10.090> went<00:02:10.360> into<00:02:10.569> Missouri<00:02:10.929> and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
season Illinois went into Missouri and

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.770 
season Illinois went into Missouri and
was<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.160> good<00:02:12.819> game<00:02:13.000> right<00:02:13.239> to<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.480> end<00:02:13.599> but

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
was a good game right to the end but

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.170 
was a good game right to the end but
Missouri<00:02:14.080> ended<00:02:14.380> up<00:02:14.470> coming<00:02:14.650> out<00:02:14.830> on<00:02:14.950> top<00:02:15.180> now

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
Missouri ended up coming out on top now

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.150 
Missouri ended up coming out on top now
it's<00:02:16.390> in<00:02:16.540> Illinois<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.200> Missouri<00:02:17.800> is

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
it's in Illinois and Missouri is

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.790 
it's in Illinois and Missouri is
breaking<00:02:18.580> in<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.819> new<00:02:18.849> quarterback<00:02:19.470> which<00:02:20.470> is

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
breaking in a new quarterback which is

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.990 
breaking in a new quarterback which is
going<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.099> be<00:02:21.190> very<00:02:21.340> difficult<00:02:21.670> in<00:02:21.940> the

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
going to be very difficult in the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.750 
going to be very difficult in the
hostile<00:02:22.390> environment<00:02:22.500> such<00:02:23.500> as<00:02:23.530> Illinois<00:02:24.220> and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
hostile environment such as Illinois and

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.210 
hostile environment such as Illinois and
Illinois<00:02:25.440> really<00:02:26.440> looks<00:02:26.620> poised<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.069> have<00:02:27.190> a

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
Illinois really looks poised to have a

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.280 
Illinois really looks poised to have a
strong<00:02:27.549> year<00:02:27.910> here<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.360> think<00:02:28.810> Missouri<00:02:29.140> is

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
strong year here I think Missouri is

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.870 
strong year here I think Missouri is
going<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.650> pretty<00:02:30.100> decent<00:02:30.459> eater<00:02:30.610> too

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
going to have a pretty decent eater too

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.340 
going to have a pretty decent eater too
but<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.239> don't<00:02:31.420> think<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:31.930> will<00:02:32.049> be<00:02:32.170> their

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
but I don't think this will be their

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.690 
but I don't think this will be their
week<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.680> think<00:02:32.920> Illinois<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.250> going<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.549> go<00:02:33.640> out

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
got a personal vendetta against these

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.080 
got a personal vendetta against these
guys<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:17.280> more<00:03:18.280> importantly<00:03:18.640> than<00:03:18.730> just<00:03:19.000> the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
guys and more importantly than just the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.819 
guys and more importantly than just the
revenge<00:03:19.390> angle<00:03:19.840> you<00:03:19.989> look<00:03:20.019> at<00:03:20.260> Maryland<00:03:20.709> and

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
revenge angle you look at Maryland and

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.890 
revenge angle you look at Maryland and
they're<00:03:21.090> rebuilding<00:03:22.090> heavily<00:03:22.720> on<00:03:22.810> the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
they're rebuilding heavily on the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.569 
they're rebuilding heavily on the
defensive<00:03:23.350> line<00:03:23.410> they<00:03:23.980> also<00:03:24.160> have<00:03:24.400> some

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
defensive line they also have some

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.220 
defensive line they also have some
question<00:03:24.940> marks<00:03:24.970> on<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.329> offensive<00:03:25.810> line<00:03:25.840> I

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
question marks on the offensive line I

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.890 
question marks on the offensive line I
think<00:03:26.709> Cal<00:03:27.220> is<00:03:27.250> going<00:03:27.519> to<00:03:27.609> win<00:03:27.760> both<00:03:28.450> battles

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
think Cal is going to win both battles

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.830 
think Cal is going to win both battles
at<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.170> line<00:03:29.350> by<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.220> substantial<00:03:30.519> margin<00:03:31.000> and

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
at the line by a substantial margin and

UAB is going to win this one by double

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.980 
UAB is going to win this one by double
digits<00:04:29.680> so<00:04:30.389> once<00:04:31.389> again<00:04:31.509> I'll<00:04:31.720> give<00:04:31.870> up<00:04:31.960> the

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
digits so once again I'll give up the

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.370 
digits so once again I'll give up the
five<00:04:32.289> and<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.500> half<00:04:32.530> points<00:04:33.070> and<00:04:33.690> Penn<00:04:34.690> State<00:04:35.110> is

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
five and a half points and Penn State is

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.760 
five and a half points and Penn State is
hosting<00:04:35.889> Akron<00:04:36.430> Penn<00:04:37.360> State's<00:04:37.690> minus<00:04:38.110> 26<00:04:38.530> and

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
hosting Akron Penn State's minus 26 and

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.320 
hosting Akron Penn State's minus 26 and
a<00:04:38.800> half<00:04:38.949> here<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.669> I<00:04:39.970> think<00:04:40.210> they<00:04:40.300> just

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
a half here and I think they just

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.629 
a half here and I think they just
completely<00:04:40.810> outclassed<00:04:41.139> Akron<00:04:41.979> yes<00:04:42.460> they

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
completely outclassed Akron yes they

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.659 
completely outclassed Akron yes they
lost<00:04:42.910> a<00:04:43.210> lot<00:04:43.599> of<00:04:43.630> starters<00:04:44.139> but<00:04:44.800> Penn<00:04:45.400> State's

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
lost a lot of starters but Penn State's

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.010 
lost a lot of starters but Penn State's
going<00:04:45.849> to<00:04:45.910> be<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:46.030> powerhouse<00:04:46.360> again<00:04:46.810> this<00:04:46.960> year

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
going to be a powerhouse again this year

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.680 
going to be a powerhouse again this year
and<00:04:47.500> they<00:04:47.710> don't<00:04:47.830> really<00:04:48.039> show<00:04:48.660> too<00:04:49.660> much

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
and they don't really show too much

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.050 
and they don't really show too much
signs<00:04:50.199> of<00:04:50.560> pumping<00:04:50.979> the<00:04:51.070> brakes<00:04:51.340> when<00:04:51.699> they

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
signs of pumping the brakes when they

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.820 
signs of pumping the brakes when they
play<00:04:52.270> a<00:04:52.300> team<00:04:52.539> like<00:04:52.750> this<00:04:53.050> they're<00:04:53.320> not<00:04:53.710> afraid

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
play a team like this they're not afraid

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.680 
play a team like this they're not afraid
to<00:04:54.070> just<00:04:54.370> keep<00:04:54.580> on<00:04:54.759> pouring<00:04:55.060> on<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.330> points

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
to just keep on pouring on the points

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.930 
to just keep on pouring on the points
and<00:04:56.139> I<00:04:56.199> think<00:04:56.440> Penn<00:04:56.620> State<00:04:56.889> gets<00:04:57.160> into<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.490> 40s

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
and I think Penn State gets into the 40s

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.180 
and I think Penn State gets into the 40s
and<00:04:58.090> this<00:04:58.930> defense<00:04:59.380> can<00:04:59.740> you<00:04:59.830> know<00:04:59.919> completely

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
and this defense can you know completely

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.850 
and this defense can you know completely
shuts<00:05:00.669> down<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.090> zips<00:05:01.389> so<00:05:01.720> I<00:05:01.960> like<00:05:02.380> Penn<00:05:02.590> State

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
shuts down the zips so I like Penn State

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.560 
shuts down the zips so I like Penn State
win<00:05:03.070> this<00:05:03.190> game<00:05:03.340> by<00:05:03.520> four<00:05:03.820> touchdowns<00:05:04.330> and

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
win this game by four touchdowns and

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.850

I've<00:05:26.030> studied<00:05:26.270> both<00:05:26.539> of<00:05:26.689> these<00:05:26.750> teams<00:05:26.990> quite<00:05:27.349> a

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:27.379 
I've studied both of these teams quite a

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:29.499 
I've studied both of these teams quite a
bit<00:05:27.680> and<00:05:27.860> while<00:05:28.430> I<00:05:28.460> do<00:05:28.580> expect<00:05:28.879> Washington

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
bit and while I do expect Washington

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.450 
bit and while I do expect Washington
State<00:05:29.750> to<00:05:29.780> be<00:05:29.960> better<00:05:30.229> they're<00:05:31.129> not<00:05:31.280> going<00:05:31.400> to

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
State to be better they're not going to

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.610

be<00:05:31.610> a<00:05:31.939> whole<00:05:32.270> lot<00:05:32.539> better<00:05:32.569> especially<00:05:33.020> not

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
be a whole lot better especially not

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.679 
be a whole lot better especially not
overnight<00:05:34.009> in<00:05:34.430> game<00:05:34.669> 1<00:05:34.969> and<00:05:35.240> I<00:05:35.539> actually

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:35.689 
overnight in game 1 and I actually

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:37.450 
overnight in game 1 and I actually
expect<00:05:36.199> Stanford<00:05:36.680> be<00:05:36.830> better<00:05:37.039> than<00:05:37.219> they<00:05:37.400> were

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
expect Stanford be better than they were

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.610 
expect Stanford be better than they were
last<00:05:37.580> year<00:05:38.060> I<00:05:38.090> think<00:05:38.389> this<00:05:38.479> is<00:05:38.659> a<00:05:38.689> sleeper<00:05:39.439> team

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
last year I think this is a sleeper team

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.260 
last year I think this is a sleeper team
to<00:05:39.800> do<00:05:39.949> some<00:05:40.129> damage<00:05:40.310> in<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:40.639> pac-10<00:05:41.060> this

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
to do some damage in the pac-10 this

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.330 
to do some damage in the pac-10 this
year<00:05:41.479> and<00:05:41.599> i'll<00:05:41.689> probably<00:05:42.259> be<00:05:42.529> revisiting

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
year and i'll probably be revisiting

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.219 
year and i'll probably be revisiting
them<00:05:43.430> a<00:05:43.460> couple<00:05:43.669> times<00:05:43.789> this<00:05:44.120> year<00:05:44.360> but<00:05:44.599> this

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
them a couple times this year but this

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.890 
them a couple times this year but this
spread<00:05:45.620> is<00:05:45.650> way<00:05:46.219> off<00:05:46.460> i<00:05:46.759> don't<00:05:46.789> think<00:05:47.659> Stanford

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
spread is way off i don't think Stanford

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.559 
spread is way off i don't think Stanford
is<00:05:48.169> going<00:05:48.319> to<00:05:48.379> win<00:05:48.560> by<00:05:48.710> 58<00:05:49.279> again<00:05:49.729> but<00:05:50.449> I<00:05:50.479> do

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
is going to win by 58 again but I do

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.200 
is going to win by 58 again but I do
think<00:05:50.900> they<00:05:51.080> win<00:05:51.229> this<00:05:51.349> one<00:05:51.560> very<00:05:51.800> easily<00:05:52.219> by

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
think they win this one very easily by

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.929 
think they win this one very easily by
five<00:05:53.539> or<00:05:53.689> six<00:05:53.900> touchdowns<00:05:54.439> and<00:05:54.710> i<00:05:55.310> genuinely

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:55.939 
five or six touchdowns and i genuinely

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.850 
five or six touchdowns and i genuinely
be<00:05:56.360> spread<00:05:56.659> Washington<00:05:57.319> State<00:05:57.560> to<00:05:57.590> make<00:05:57.830> a

game<00:05:58.099> of<00:05:58.129> this<00:05:58.370> I<00:05:58.520> think<00:05:58.580> Toby<00:05:59.029> Gerhart<00:05:59.449> will

00:05:59.559 --> 00:05:59.569 
game of this I think Toby Gerhart will

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.209

have<00:05:59.689> another<00:06:00.139> field<00:06:00.469> day<00:06:00.680> like<00:06:00.889> you<00:06:01.009> did<00:06:01.189> last

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:01.219 
have another field day like you did last

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:03.999 
have another field day like you did last

this team to overnight have an
overpowering<00:06:42.589> offense<00:06:43.129> I<00:06:43.400> think<00:06:44.210> it's<00:06:44.330> going

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
overpowering offense I think it's going

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.320 
overpowering offense I think it's going
to<00:06:44.509> be<00:06:44.659> a<00:06:44.979> learning<00:06:45.979> curve<00:06:46.279> for<00:06:46.339> this<00:06:46.610> team<00:06:46.849> but

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
to be a learning curve for this team but

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.209 
to be a learning curve for this team but
on<00:06:47.360> defense<00:06:47.900> this<00:06:48.080> team<00:06:48.289> is<00:06:48.469> stacked<00:06:48.830> they've

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:49.219 
on defense this team is stacked they've

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:51.010 
on defense this team is stacked they've
got<00:06:49.460> one<00:06:49.849> of<00:06:49.969> the<00:06:50.029> best<00:06:50.060> defenses<00:06:50.810> in<00:06:50.839> the

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
got one of the best defenses in the

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.829 
got one of the best defenses in the
pac-10<00:06:51.529> conference<00:06:51.849> and<00:06:52.849> I<00:06:53.300> don't<00:06:53.539> think<00:06:53.689> San

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:53.839 
pac-10 conference and I don't think San

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:55.089 
pac-10 conference and I don't think San
Diego<00:06:54.139> State's<00:06:54.379> going<00:06:54.589> to<00:06:54.650> be<00:06:54.710> able<00:06:54.800> to<00:06:54.949> do<00:06:55.069> a

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099 
Diego State's going to be able to do a

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:57.100 
Diego State's going to be able to do a
whole<00:06:55.339> lot<00:06:55.370> against<00:06:55.729> this<00:06:55.879> defense<00:06:56.360> so<00:06:56.659> I'm

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
whole lot against this defense so I'm

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.600 
whole lot against this defense so I'm
kind<00:06:57.409> of<00:06:57.469> expecting<00:06:57.949> a<00:06:58.009> low<00:06:58.159> scoring<00:06:58.490> game

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
kind of expecting a low scoring game

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.709 
kind of expecting a low scoring game
here<00:06:59.120> like<00:06:59.360> a<00:06:59.469> 24<00:07:00.469> 23<00:07:00.979> type<00:07:01.669> of<00:07:01.849> game<00:07:02.000> in<00:07:02.150> UCLA's

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:02.719 
here like a 24 23 type of game in UCLA's

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:04.929 
here like a 24 23 type of game in UCLA's
favor<00:07:03.050> so<00:07:03.409> an<00:07:03.680> over/under<00:07:04.129> 51<00:07:04.639> and<00:07:04.729> a<00:07:04.789> half

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:04.939 
favor so an over/under 51 and a half

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:07.019 
favor so an over/under 51 and a half
seems<00:07:05.360> awfully<00:07:05.990> high<00:07:06.139> to<00:07:06.199> me<00:07:06.439> I<00:07:06.469> don't<00:07:06.680> think

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:07.029 
seems awfully high to me I don't think

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:09.640 
seems awfully high to me I don't think
UCLA's<00:07:08.029> offense<00:07:08.539> or<00:07:08.810> San<00:07:09.020> Diego<00:07:09.050> State's

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
UCLA's offense or San Diego State's

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.950 
UCLA's offense or San Diego State's
offense<00:07:10.129> it's<00:07:10.729> going<00:07:10.849> to<00:07:10.879> result<00:07:11.150> in

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
offense it's going to result in

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.040 
offense it's going to result in
that<00:07:12.590> many<00:07:12.770> points<00:07:13.220> so<00:07:13.569> that's<00:07:14.569> it<00:07:14.780> for<00:07:14.810> me

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 
that many points so that's it for me

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.719
