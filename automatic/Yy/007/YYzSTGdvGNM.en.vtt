this<00:04:17.789> image<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.299> can<00:04:18.359> see<00:04:18.709> this<00:04:19.709> is<00:04:20.039> a<00:04:20.099> image

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
this image you can see this is a image

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.680 
this image you can see this is a image
of<00:04:21.030> what<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.430> calcium<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.520> magnesium<00:04:24.240> ions

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
of what the calcium of magnesium ions

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.320 
of what the calcium of magnesium ions
look<00:04:25.050> like<00:04:25.289> prior<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.710> treatment<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.940> can<00:04:27.090> see

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
look like prior to treatment you can see

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.659 
look like prior to treatment you can see
that<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.110> pluses<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.650> minuses<00:04:29.130> are<00:04:29.340> somewhat

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
that the pluses and minuses are somewhat

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.670 
that the pluses and minuses are somewhat

disorganized and you know from

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.560 
disorganized and you know from
elementary<00:04:32.130> school<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.639> when<00:04:32.789> you<00:04:32.910> take<00:04:33.060> a

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
elementary school that when you take a

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.080 
elementary school that when you take a
negative<00:04:34.110> pole<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:34.740> you<00:04:35.160> push<00:04:35.490> it<00:04:35.520> towards<00:04:35.970> a

positive pole they're going to attract

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.330 
positive pole they're going to attract
and<00:04:38.280> want<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.550> form<00:04:38.970> hard<00:04:39.479> water<00:04:39.720> scale<00:04:40.340> this

positive<00:04:54.630> poles<00:04:54.900> and<00:04:55.169> you<00:04:55.229> push<00:04:55.440> them

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
positive poles and you push them

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.339 
positive poles and you push them

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
of this water here that we looked at

you<00:05:42.520> can<00:05:42.699> see<00:05:42.909> I'll<00:05:43.120> just<00:05:43.180> take<00:05:43.599> my<00:05:43.629> finger<00:05:44.169> and

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
you can see I'll just take my finger and

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.129 
you can see I'll just take my finger and
wipe<00:05:45.430> it<00:05:45.610> along<00:05:45.909> the<00:05:46.060> surface<00:05:46.300> and<00:05:46.689> it<00:05:47.110> really

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
wipe it along the surface and it really

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.709 
wipe it along the surface and it really
is<00:05:47.560> just<00:05:47.860> a<00:05:48.310> very<00:05:48.669> thin<00:05:49.030> just<00:05:49.180> a<00:05:49.330> couple<00:05:49.539> of
