insecurity and utilization equipment I'm

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.030 
insecurity and utilization equipment I'm
going<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.330> use<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.750> snitch<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.590> pierce<00:01:38.979> a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
going to use the snitch to pierce a

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.969 
going to use the snitch to pierce a
starting<00:01:39.640> hole<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:40.510> could<00:01:40.690> use<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:40.960> drill<00:01:41.500> or

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
starting hole you could use a drill or

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.510 
starting hole you could use a drill or
screwdriver<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.500> then<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.530> want<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:44.979> make<00:01:45.190> a

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
screwdriver and then I want to make a

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.040 
screwdriver and then I want to make a
relief<00:01:46.510> cut<00:01:47.190> so<00:01:48.190> that<00:01:48.550> it'll<00:01:49.270> be<00:01:49.450> easier<00:01:49.479> to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
relief cut so that it'll be easier to

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.969 
relief cut so that it'll be easier to
make<00:01:50.229> an<00:01:50.380> accurate<00:01:50.770> cut<00:01:51.250> on<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.450> line

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
make an accurate cut on the line

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.010 
make an accurate cut on the line
actually<00:01:53.979> it's<00:01:54.340> best<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.820> make<00:01:55.060> this<00:01:55.420> hole

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
actually it's best to make this hole

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.960 
actually it's best to make this hole
just<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.470> little<00:01:56.680> bit<00:01:56.800> small<00:01:57.160> cuz<00:01:57.550> I'm<00:01:57.670> cut

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
just a little bit small cuz I'm cut

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.359 
just a little bit small cuz I'm cut
inside<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.479> line<00:01:58.660> and<00:01:59.110> then<00:02:00.010> you<00:02:00.130> can<00:02:00.160> always

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
inside the line and then you can always

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.690 
inside the line and then you can always
cut<00:02:00.700> out<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:00.880> little<00:02:01.150> bit<00:02:01.270> more<00:02:01.540> later<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:03.550> make

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
cut out a little bit more later to make

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.490 
cut out a little bit more later to make
it<00:02:03.850> fit<00:02:04.119> it's<00:02:04.450> better<00:02:04.660> than<00:02:04.840> having<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.259> too

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
it fit it's better than having a too

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.370 
it fit it's better than having a too
large<00:02:06.179> then<00:02:07.830> insert<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.280> outlet<00:02:09.789> in<00:02:10.380> about

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
large then insert the outlet in about

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.760 
large then insert the outlet in about
half<00:02:11.680> way<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:13.860> square<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.070> up<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:16.590> Mark<00:02:17.590> it

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
half way and square it up and Mark it

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.920 
half way and square it up and Mark it
around<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.820> outside

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.759 

then<00:02:26.859> we're<00:02:27.859> going<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.040> trim<00:02:28.310> off<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.700> excess

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
then we're going to trim off the excess

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.059 
then we're going to trim off the excess
we're<00:02:30.769> going<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.010> cut<00:02:31.250> outside<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.150> line<00:02:33.069> to

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
we're going to cut outside the line to

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:41.220 
we're going to cut outside the line to
leave<00:02:34.430> enough<00:02:35.329> material<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:37.310> make<00:02:37.489> taps<00:02:40.000> then

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
leave enough material to make taps then

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:51.180 
leave enough material to make taps then
make<00:02:42.230> cuts<00:02:42.879> into<00:02:43.879> the<00:02:44.359> line<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.980> make<00:02:46.639> the<00:02:46.700> taps
