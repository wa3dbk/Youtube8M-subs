00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.320

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.470
 barbie we can can we can already 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:28.170
 we have many pets and I join then 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.170
 we have liza is already affiliated 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.110
 I always want one that is mine very well 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.879
 thought of a golden hamster or maybe 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.360
 one of these nice and clean pets 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.360
 virtual dolphins represents 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.390
 where did you get dolphins and who 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.490
 installed the aquarium you like such a barbie 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.440
 time I can improve it even more and put 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.670
 a recipe and a forest of seaweed wait 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.340
 I can fix it 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.200
 in the aquarium is fine but chelsea 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.260
 we can not stay with three dolphins 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.490
 look at his eyes and tell me you can refuse 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.490
 and now 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.540
 were 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:17.050
 maybe accidentally connect the 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.470
 aquarium to the pipeline of the mansion or the 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.470
 neighborhood 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.060
 we must follow his trail 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.270
 it must be a bigger artifact 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.310
 here 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.310
 and if I carry my sponge 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.660
 it sounds like it hurt that 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.660
 it was not a dolphin that was raquel 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.890
 or something 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:11.039
 the web there is something with the dolphins have 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.650
 lifeless eyes black eyes like eyes 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.040
 doll and then those black eyes are put 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.040
 blank as and then they are heard screaming 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.040
 terribly 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.500

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.800
 of good bottle if you come back give us a 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.800
 scream 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.739
 he ate all my special tuna sushi 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:37.300
 but for me and for the girls that 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.300

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.500
 that's just we need to bring them from 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.500
 return to the aquarium 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.440
 and maybe you want to think better about the 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.440
 dolphins 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.530
 it was very ripe for you to leave them 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.120
 return to the ocean thanks skippers and 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.040
 who discovered a way to connect 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.340
 the aquarium to the ocean so they can 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.260
 come back when they really want what 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.260
 and we believe that 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.080
 people 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.250
 i 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.010
 now spray a bit of brightness 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.930
 two 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:46.739
 and a touch of brightness and I'll be ready to 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.739
 the red carpet 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.540
 my skateboard will look amazing 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.020
 no no 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.480
 there must be some mistake we can not 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.970
 to be dull is not a mistake worth 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.830
 it went dull now let's listen to a 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.020
 comment from a distinguished member of 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.690
 the bruguera I beg all my fans 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.970
 stay calm during the crisis and 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.000
 I'm sure we'll be back 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.320
 clamorous and bright very soon 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.510
 vanguard and not even the shortage of 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.160
 shine alters you good always I have to be 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.950
 optimistic 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.220
 is cheating I am a total disaster 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.560
 I came as soon as possible and brought the kit 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.120
 barbie desolate disposable tissues 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.110
 comfort cupcakes and one shoulder 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.110
 virile in which to cry 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.430
 this is like the shortage of gel for the 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.890
 hair a few years ago was the 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:53.970
 tragic haha do not worry I'll do 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.320
 charge of what feeds a false shine 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.000
 at the laboratory 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.640
 that in our concerns 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.640
 they finished what he called the shine 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.590
 maybe you too much glue suffered 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.360
 his failure calmly get the 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.370

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.810

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.630
 i 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.510
 he removes it in order the last and precious 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.380
 piece of authentic shine now smells 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.380
 to find more 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.090
 It had some light fruit notes with a 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:44.400
 rice touch final bright vision 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.400
 I need shine if you have 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.940
 it's useless there's no substitute for the 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.820
 Shine looks pretty the doll dress and 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.460
