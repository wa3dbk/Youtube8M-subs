can<00:02:01.670> kind<00:02:01.820> of<00:02:01.939> tell<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:02.509> again<00:02:03.290> what<00:02:03.680> they<00:02:03.799> do

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
can kind of tell and again what they do

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.499 
can kind of tell and again what they do
with<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.130> Penasco<00:02:04.640> kit<00:02:04.850> that's<00:02:05.030> cool<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.360> it's

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
with the Penasco kit that's cool is it's

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.109 
with the Penasco kit that's cool is it's
a<00:02:05.600> 2<00:02:05.780> port<00:02:06.100> fits<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.310> 2<00:02:07.460> port<00:02:07.700> crankcase

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
a 2 port fits to the 2 port crankcase

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.609 
a 2 port fits to the 2 port crankcase
but<00:02:08.360> they<00:02:08.479> actually<00:02:08.659> add<00:02:08.989> a<00:02:09.019> third<00:02:09.349> port

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
but they actually add a third port

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.589 
but they actually add a third port
within<00:02:09.799> the<00:02:10.009> piston<00:02:10.429> which<00:02:10.970> is<00:02:11.150> really<00:02:11.450> what

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
within the piston which is really what

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.250 
within the piston which is really what
kind<00:02:11.810> of<00:02:11.870> helps

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
kind of helps

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.360 
kind of helps
is<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.409> performance<00:02:12.920> on<00:02:13.040> this<00:02:13.220> one

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
is the performance on this one

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.399 
is the performance on this one
significantly<00:02:14.030> they<00:02:14.569> used<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.900> similar<00:02:15.260> style

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409 
significantly they used a similar style

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.649 
significantly they used a similar style
of<00:02:15.590> top-end<00:02:15.769> on<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.129> Vespa<00:02:16.400> et3<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.450> was<00:02:17.540> the

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
of top-end on the Vespa et3 that was the

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.360 
of top-end on the Vespa et3 that was the
ep-3<00:02:17.900> stood<00:02:18.290> for<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.739> is<00:02:18.799> the<00:02:18.890> small<00:02:19.159> frame

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
ep-3 stood for that is the small frame

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.039 
ep-3 stood for that is the small frame
that<00:02:19.549> had<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.790> third<00:02:20.000> transfer<00:02:20.510> port<00:02:20.780> and

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
that had the third transfer port and

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.140 
that had the third transfer port and
that<00:02:21.079> third<00:02:21.500> transfer<00:02:21.950> port<00:02:22.189> aligns<00:02:22.819> on<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
that third transfer port aligns on the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.030 
that third transfer port aligns on the
inside<00:02:23.540> here<00:02:23.959> which<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.439> can<00:02:24.560> kind<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.829> see

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
inside here which you can kind of see

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.610 
inside here which you can kind of see
where<00:02:26.000> as<00:02:26.120> in<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.329> old<00:02:26.480> two-port<00:02:26.930> cylinders

where as in the old two-port cylinders

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.319 
where as in the old two-port cylinders
they<00:02:28.069> don't<00:02:28.250> have<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.060> other<00:02:29.180> thing

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
they don't have that and the other thing

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.880 
they don't have that and the other thing
you'll<00:02:29.480> notice<00:02:29.690> since<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:30.379> got<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.620> upside

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
you'll notice since we got it upside

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.610 
you'll notice since we got it upside
down<00:02:31.099> is<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.519> general<00:02:32.000> same<00:02:32.780> size<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.530> the

of<00:02:35.629> the<00:02:35.720> crankcase<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.769> don't<00:02:36.920> really<00:02:37.040> need

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
of the crankcase you don't really need

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.069

Penasco but you notice internally within
the<00:02:48.980> cylinder<00:02:49.340> wall<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:50.239> size<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.840> fact

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
the cylinder wall the size of the fact

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.479 
the cylinder wall the size of the fact
that<00:02:51.200> they<00:02:51.349> kind<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.590> add<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:51.769> like<00:02:52.190> kind<00:02:52.340> of

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
boost port there to increase the porting

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.809 
boost port there to increase the porting
on<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:54.799> thing<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.159> then<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.340> course<00:02:55.609> at<00:02:55.760> the

on this thing and then of course at the
very<00:02:56.000> bottom<00:02:56.209> if<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.019> can<00:02:57.230> see<00:02:57.409> it<00:02:57.560> on<00:02:57.709> the

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
very bottom if you can see it on the

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.830 
very bottom if you can see it on the
camera<00:02:58.250> there<00:02:58.549> but<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.790> can<00:02:58.909> kind<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.150> see<00:02:59.389> the

camera there but you can kind of see the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.690 
camera there but you can kind of see the
third<00:03:00.109> transfer<00:03:00.650> port<00:03:00.920> that's<00:03:01.220> on<00:03:01.400> the

third transfer port that's on the
Penasco<00:03:02.480> cylinder<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.019> fact<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.290> it's

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
Penasco cylinder and the fact that it's

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.180 
Penasco cylinder and the fact that it's
not<00:03:03.799> on<00:03:04.129> the<00:03:04.609> old<00:03:04.760> junky<00:03:05.209> 125<00:03:05.840> or<00:03:06.170> 150<00:03:06.650> cylinder

there's<00:03:16.010> 125<00:03:16.699> CC<00:03:17.000> ones<00:03:17.389> with<00:03:17.989> kind<00:03:18.230> of<00:03:18.319> the

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:18.699 
there's 125 CC ones with kind of the

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.250 
there's 125 CC ones with kind of the
larger<00:03:19.699> flange<00:03:20.030> here<00:03:20.359> for<00:03:20.569> the<00:03:20.660> smaller<00:03:20.930> bore

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
larger flange here for the smaller bore

larger flange here for the smaller bore
there's<00:03:21.739> 150<00:03:22.280> CC<00:03:22.730> ones<00:03:22.940> as<00:03:23.120> well<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:23.599> then

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
there's 150 CC ones as well and then

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.530 
there's 150 CC ones as well and then
there's<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.440> dome<00:03:25.370> there's<00:03:26.000> like<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.269> domed

right and then some of the later ones

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.080 
right and then some of the later ones
actually<00:03:33.949> didn't<00:03:34.220> have<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.579> lip<00:03:34.760> that<00:03:34.940> was

very much like a stock exhaust one final
exhaust<00:05:31.880> you<00:05:31.970> can<00:05:32.090> actually<00:05:32.210> you<00:05:32.389> can

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
exhaust you can actually you can

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.510 
exhaust you can actually you can
actually<00:05:32.570> use<00:05:32.840> the<00:05:32.960> super<00:05:33.320> exhaust<00:05:33.740> which<00:05:34.370> are

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
actually use the super exhaust which are

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.100 
actually use the super exhaust which are
effectively<00:05:35.000> about<00:05:35.120> the<00:05:35.270> same<00:05:35.479> as<00:05:35.630> a<00:05:35.660> sprint

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
effectively about the same as a sprint

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.050 
effectively about the same as a sprint
those<00:05:36.530> are<00:05:36.650> a<00:05:36.680> good<00:05:36.830> option<00:05:36.979> for<00:05:37.190> a<00:05:37.729> bike

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
those are a good option for a bike

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.400 
those are a good option for a bike
that's<00:05:38.270> still<00:05:38.479> running<00:05:38.600> to<00:05:38.780> eight<00:05:38.900> inch<00:05:39.110> tires

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
that's still running to eight inch tires

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.260 
that's still running to eight inch tires
just<00:05:40.160> because<00:05:40.490> of<00:05:40.639> the<00:05:40.729> way<00:05:40.820> that<00:05:41.000> they<00:05:41.120> kind

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
just because of the way that they kind

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.790 
just because of the way that they kind
of<00:05:41.389> hang<00:05:41.570> from<00:05:41.780> the<00:05:41.900> swingarm<00:05:42.229> and<00:05:42.380> stuff<00:05:42.650> what

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
of hang from the swingarm and stuff what

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.680 
of hang from the swingarm and stuff what
not<00:05:43.010> but<00:05:43.160> the<00:05:43.280> super<00:05:43.639> exhausts<00:05:44.120> have<00:05:44.539> that

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
not but the super exhausts have that

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.090 
not but the super exhausts have that
longer<00:05:44.900> header<00:05:45.200> so<00:05:45.380> anything<00:05:45.650> you<00:05:45.770> can<00:05:45.889> do<00:05:46.010> to

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
longer header so anything you can do to

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.190 
longer header so anything you can do to
get<00:05:46.220> away<00:05:46.310> from<00:05:46.460> that<00:05:46.789> early<00:05:47.419> exhaust<00:05:47.840> it<00:05:48.110> was

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
get away from that early exhaust it was

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.550

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
actually pretty difficult to get

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.490 
actually pretty difficult to get
nowadays<00:06:27.220> and<00:06:27.610> a<00:06:28.240> 20<00:06:28.540> millimeter<00:06:28.750> carb<00:06:29.230> and

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
nowadays and a 20 millimeter carb and

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.780 
nowadays and a 20 millimeter carb and
it's<00:06:29.680> been<00:06:30.330> jetted<00:06:31.330> and<00:06:31.570> time<00:06:31.810> you<00:06:32.800> know<00:06:32.890> you

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
it's been jetted and time you know you

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.400 
it's been jetted and time you know you
know<00:06:33.880> pretty<00:06:34.090> good<00:06:34.180> and<00:06:34.600> on<00:06:34.750> the<00:06:34.900> dyno<00:06:35.110> and<00:06:35.260> I

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
know pretty good and on the dyno and I

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.010 
know pretty good and on the dyno and I
think<00:06:35.650> it<00:06:35.740> makes<00:06:35.950> two<00:06:36.790> horsepower<00:06:37.090> shy<00:06:37.540> of<00:06:37.750> a<00:06:37.840> P

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
think it makes two horsepower shy of a P

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.620 
think it makes two horsepower shy of a P
200<00:06:38.470> so<00:06:39.190> it's<00:06:39.340> pretty<00:06:39.640> fast<00:06:39.880> is<00:06:40.090> almost<00:06:40.420> as
