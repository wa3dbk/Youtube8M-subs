trying to reconcile that with a
superhero<00:01:06.060> origin<00:01:06.750> story<00:01:07.130> was<00:01:08.130> very

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
superhero origin story was very

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.070

difficult<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.210> took<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> bulk<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.990> our

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
difficult and it took the bulk of our

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.190 
difficult and it took the bulk of our
time<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:11.340> directors<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.030> mean<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.390> worked<00:01:13.049> out

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
time as directors I mean we worked out

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.330 
time as directors I mean we worked out
and<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.409> worked<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:13.860> worked<00:01:14.040> out<00:01:14.159> until

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
and we worked at it we worked out until

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.640 
and we worked at it we worked out until
we<00:01:14.369> finally<00:01:14.729> found<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.270> baymax<00:01:15.840> himself<00:01:16.500> is

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
we finally found that baymax himself is

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.380 
we finally found that baymax himself is
the<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.130> character<00:01:17.490> baymax<00:01:17.820> was<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> link

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the the character baymax was the link

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.420 
the the character baymax was the link
that<00:01:18.630> link<00:01:19.110> those<00:01:19.290> two<00:01:19.320> stories<00:01:19.799> together<00:01:19.979> but

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that link those two stories together but

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.960 
that link those two stories together but
in<00:01:21.299> our<00:01:21.570> 20<00:01:21.869> year<00:01:21.900> history<00:01:22.460> at<00:01:23.460> Disney<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.820> think

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
in our 20 year history at Disney I think

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.460 
in our 20 year history at Disney I think
this<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.119> our<00:01:24.299> most<00:01:24.479> challenging<00:01:24.659> film<00:01:25.140> but

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
this is our most challenging film but

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.190 
this is our most challenging film but
you<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:27.420> makes<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> sweeter

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you know I it makes it all the sweeter

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.960 
you know I it makes it all the sweeter
when<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.710> kind<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:28.979> stuff<00:01:29.159> happens<00:01:29.490> yeah

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
when this kind of stuff happens yeah

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.730 
when this kind of stuff happens yeah
we've<00:01:30.360> all<00:01:30.509> been<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> Disney<00:01:31.140> each<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.380> us<00:01:31.470> for

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
we've all been a Disney each of us for

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.850 
we've all been a Disney each of us for
about<00:01:31.920> 20<00:01:32.280> years<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.960> every<00:01:33.960> movie<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.320> hard

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
about 20 years and every movie is hard

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.109 
about 20 years and every movie is hard
and<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.340> they're<00:01:35.460> hard<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.700> their<00:01:35.790> own<00:01:35.909> way

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and but they're hard in their own way

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.730 
and but they're hard in their own way
and<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.840> think<00:01:37.049> you're<00:01:37.200> getting<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> heart

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
and I think you're getting to the heart

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.170 
and I think you're getting to the heart
of<00:01:37.890> what<00:01:38.040> was<00:01:38.189> uniquely<00:01:38.610> difficult<00:01:39.060> about

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
of what was uniquely difficult about

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.760 
of what was uniquely difficult about
this<00:01:39.360> one<00:01:39.600> which<00:01:40.140> was<00:01:40.350> taking<00:01:40.619> all<00:01:40.680> these

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
this one which was taking all these
