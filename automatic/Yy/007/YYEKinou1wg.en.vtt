00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.690
 10 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.710
 Do not hesitate, it's free 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.420
 but in fact it really looks like computer which one could have consulted 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.469
 small month 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.999
 to know a species of demix science fiction very star trac 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.859
 I will ask a question to the channel who will find me the answer 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.380
 the airlock and the funds that have been requested to the number of three that are 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.269
 very nice hilale latic search google here in this fight against the 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.539
 quite standard search engine 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.519
 so we'll be able to directly process here the keyboard of the device to make 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.569
 a search 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.080
 % but also micro fragility 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.960
 and so I will talk and make a request to the tablet that will find me 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.680
 the research paper 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.210
 so it's pretty simple 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.920
 i'm going to launch the mic app and i'm going to ask for a digital book hours 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.230
 the pub 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.230
 emc little because asked 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.090
 the master and daisy ibooks 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.140
 here is a search 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.210
 we have sought precisely indicated here another ibooks theory 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.890
 we do a search google and there I come across he gratifies me who 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.890
 proposed to be daisy 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.119
 and here I can say online by the line line the swimmer ride 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.710
 all chapters this rage to access 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.520
 directly your content is not quite what I was looking for months 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.760
 to bring the sales page ap 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.980
 and here I quote them to download another pub 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.590
 so we can not say that I see them the end the foie gras and the master and 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.380
 daisy an excellent book 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.380
 e and i can download in english then right now 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.200
 started loading the download by here why 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.670
 his week 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.880
 in place the trips download them 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.750
 to kill to go elsewhere 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.450
 and so I could have dealt with it every morning in the long run anyway 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.320
 here 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.640
 and that I will be able to read with as an application that delivered that the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.620
 machine 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.110
 if it's the lights and 2 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.350
 right here 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.960
 and there are a lot of applications that serve that so that's the master and 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.100
 daisy we click and we have our digital book that will appear 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:12.599
 e we will be able to accommodate quite as standard while 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.739
 algeria a strong backlight 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:16.729
 ok she 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.949
 their square like this will be prettier 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:23.150
 I have a strong backlight corona a writing that is really very 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:25.339
 require that one can really advise someone who has 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.869
 reading problems if we go into portrait mode it's already very visible 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.689
 if we go into landscape mode is still written a little to the biggest and and 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.739
 it was more simple first name for vision problems for mo de 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.009
 rom and job widely this month 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:42.559
 for 100 m in portrait mode it's really very nice percent then 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.949
 lime four crossroads for the camera 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:48.839
 they have gone down a little bit, it's very simple, we're going in the most literal sense 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:50.419
 dropped to a minimum 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.299
 there it will be much less 10 for you for the camera per concert will be 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.299
 really% very little tiring 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:01.339
 m there you surely have a weird type of impression on the screen 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:04.429
 when entering real it's really something that is that really comes 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.469
 very visible very pleasant and especially little tiring for the eyes 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.499
 so to go deep just for you 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.059
 but here's ronald decided to read a book 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:17.149
 we did the search for peace a romantic that are available recedes 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.649
 of entry for this use the round and not thing in French 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:24.309
 % and it's very nice to read that's what these trophies are a 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:26.239
 little page gadget that turns 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.809
 but it works really very well 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.819
 that's not really a big plus 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.019
 I downloaded rapinoe a lot of titles 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.019
 practice and a lot of things visible it's true and it's the case 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.879
 a lot of stuff you can find very easily 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.499
 quickly face to face and is well formatted it's clean et cetera so it's 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:49.339
 really very very nice to use new shot of cookers 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:50.469
 worried about the market
