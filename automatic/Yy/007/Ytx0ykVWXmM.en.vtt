00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi how about friends from panama and 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.240
 Latin America 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.069
 this time we will know some series 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.099
 cases where the mentioned 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.710
 discovery of possible monsters this in 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.039
 different parts of america however 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.109
 Not everything that looks like my name is oyster 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.070
 castro and this is paranormal reality 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.070
 we start 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.090
 Y 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.320
 now normal 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.410
 in September of the year 2009 in panama 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.270
 released a strange news about 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.250
 the finding of a mysterious corpse 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.910
 this in the blue hill area 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.040
 teenagers reported the 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:17.010
 discovery of a creature with a 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.010
 apparently extraterrestrial physiognomy 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.510
 the news became the center of 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.600
 attention of the media 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.250
 both national and foreign 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.100
 awakening the doubt between scientists and 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.690
 cryptozoology experts which 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.690
 they tried to identify the body 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.680
 according to the version of the young the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.620
 strange to be appeared before them 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.050
 moving between some stones generating 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.600
 some shock and astonishment because of his 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.820
 mysterious appearance so 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.390
 they started to stone him until he provoked 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.390
 his death 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.170
 then they would throw it into the water they would take the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.150
 photograph taking a guide in the place 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.640
 this photograph is the only evidence of 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.070
 his incredible story however was 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.740
 compared to others belonging to a 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.530
 lazy looking to identify it as a 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.170
 animal of these and discard the idea of 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.569
 be extraterrestrial 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.030
 the analysis tells us that effectively 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.220
 it was a lazy endemic to the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.800
 area which was in a state of 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.660
 decomposition and therefore the hair is 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.360
 had fallen since he had been in 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.010
 constant contact with water in 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.170
 Comparison photographs we can 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.300
 clearly distinguish the claws of 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.800
 supposedly extraterrestrial which are 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.800
 identical to those of a lazy 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.769
 the next comparison is with the 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.760
 image of a fetus of these animals the 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.470
 which present the same 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.250
 characteristics that the creature 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.250
 found 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.380
 finally we make a composition 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.020
 adding hair what it gives us as 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.020
 result the aforementioned lazy bear 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.950
 therefore what was found in hill 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.819
 panama blue was not about any 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.819
 alien 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.230
 a similar case occurred in a village 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.670
 Canadian in 2010 where the 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.530
 inhabitants of that place were left 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.480
 perplexed by the appearance of a 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.090
 strange creature on the shore of a lake 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.010
 region of 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.379
 the animal had an elongated body and 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.209
 covered with brown hair other than 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.670
 the feet and the face where it was 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.190
 completely hairless and white 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.709
 the creature was discovered by two 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.930
 nurses walking their dog 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.660
 the painting kicked the corpse and took it out of the 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.180
 lake for the strangeness of the creature 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.989
 they decided to take some pictures and 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.989
 retire from the place 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.550
 the images circulated through the network 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.370
 looking for some explanation 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.930
 identification of the species to what in 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.630
 Internet was compared to what 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.340
 It could be a chupacabra but 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.370
 again we would be facing a bad 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.980
 interpretation what it seems would be a 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.900
 monster could be an animal in the area 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.900
 in this case a nutrient 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.150
 here we see the comparison of the muzzle of the 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:36.210
 animal fur morphology and 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:38.819
 limbs the animal is found 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.740
 peeling on the face and limbs by 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:44.099
 the decomposition state and the 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.500
 constant contact with water without a doubt 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.780
 it was just an otter leaving 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.159
 one side the fantastic idea of a 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.159
 Monster in Ontario 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.020
 on July 29 of the year 2008 was given to 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.840
 know the image of a creature 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.090
 strange with sturdy body limbs 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.520
 unknown and what would seem to be what 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.490
 most remarkable a kind of beak like the 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.580
 from the birds to this unknown animal it 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.960
 he gave it the name of the montauk monster 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.060
 since it was found on the shores of 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.919
 montauk new york ' 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.440
 the image went viral waking up 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.540
 the most unsuspected theories since 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.460
 it was a chupacabra until 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.430
 it was kind of manipulated in some 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.740
 American lab after going out to 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.870
 the light new photographs was determined 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.470
 that that was not a strange being nor 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.570
 monstrous or extraterrestrial but that is 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.330
 was about the remains of a mammal the 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.310
 which was in a state of decomposition 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.770
 the theory pointed out that it was about 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.409
 a canine in this case a raccoon 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.139
 as we see it in the image 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.629
 and the strange peak would only be a 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.879
 exposed bone of this animal to which 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:59.159
 again by contact with water and 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:01.950
 the state of decomposition had 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:05.040
 lost his coat 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.400
 therefore it would not be any 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.400
 mouse 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.890
 the monsters found turned out to be 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.260
 animals of the area in a state of 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.510
 decomposition however the 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.060
 cryptozoology will continue in the search for 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.310
 the animals are together my name is 11 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.950
 castro and this actually paranormal 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:34.170
 follow us on facebook twitter and youtube 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.170
 thank you very much until next time 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.040
 Cuernavaca
