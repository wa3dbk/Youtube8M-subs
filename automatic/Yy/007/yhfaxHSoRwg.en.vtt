00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.930
 what you don't see that often and maybe 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.840

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.820
 little look maybe support and i understand 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.740
 also what you mean by that 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.810
 support you can go through it can 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.630
 more often you have to put 18 kills in the jar 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.220
 beads and then you already have an idea that 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.600
 nothing is wrong with your mouth 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.040
 to so many things in 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.000
 game and that makes sense but it makes 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.649
 all not out 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.979
