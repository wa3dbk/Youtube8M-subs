00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
first stitch and we slip it purl wise so

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.260 
first stitch and we slip it purl wise so
that<00:02:17.740> we<00:02:17.860> maintain<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.430> way<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.880> stitch<00:02:19.090> is

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
that we maintain the way the stitch is

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.780 
that we maintain the way the stitch is
mounted<00:02:19.720> on<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.990> needle<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.530> then<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.490> says

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
mounted on the needle and then it says

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.380 
mounted on the needle and then it says
