to<00:00:15.120> use<00:00:15.240> two<00:00:16.109> types<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.529> insulation<00:00:17.119> one<00:00:18.119> being

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
to use two types of insulation one being

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.939 
to use two types of insulation one being
that<00:00:19.279> 550<00:00:20.279> fill<00:00:20.520> down<00:00:20.820> that's<00:00:21.650> coated<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:22.920> a
