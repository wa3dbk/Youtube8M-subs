what<00:00:23.580> you're<00:00:23.760> going<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.480> flip<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.930> over

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
what you're going to do is flip it over

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.519 
what you're going to do is flip it over
fold<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.699> tip<00:00:27.260> to<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.470> end<00:00:30.050> so<00:00:31.050> once<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.410> do

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
fold this tip to this end so once you do

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.389 
fold this tip to this end so once you do
that<00:00:31.560> crease<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.340> really<00:00:33.059> good<00:00:34.070> do<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> same

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
that crease it really good do the same

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.850 
that crease it really good do the same
thing<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> other<00:00:36.030> side<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:37.380> reason<00:00:37.710> why

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
thing for the other side the reason why

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.500 
thing for the other side the reason why
the<00:00:37.920> creases<00:00:38.430> already<00:00:38.760> there's<00:00:38.969> because<00:00:39.360> I've

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the creases already there's because I've

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.040 
the creases already there's because I've
cremate<00:00:39.930> them<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:41.480> then<00:00:42.480> now<00:00:42.660> when<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.899> have

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
cremate them and then now when you have

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.650 
cremate them and then now when you have
an<00:00:43.200> X<00:00:43.379> shape<00:00:43.940> what<00:00:44.940> you're<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.480> is

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
an X shape what you're going to do is

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.369 
an X shape what you're going to do is
they<00:00:46.370> push<00:00:47.370> these<00:00:47.670> sides<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.930> squeeze<00:00:49.230> it

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
they push these sides in and squeeze it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.790 
they push these sides in and squeeze it
like<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:52.850> just<00:00:53.850> flatten<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.480> out<00:00:54.600> now<00:00:55.500> pull

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
like that just flatten it out now pull

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:06.859 
like that just flatten it out now pull
this<00:00:55.949> flap<00:00:56.280> up<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:56.969> end<00:01:05.720> repeat<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
this flap up to this end repeat the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.820 
this flap up to this end repeat the
process

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830

once<00:01:12.460> you<00:01:12.640> have<00:01:12.790> this<00:01:13.000> do<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.390> same<00:01:13.600> thing<00:01:13.840> for

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
once you have this do the same thing for

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:23.010 
once you have this do the same thing for
the<00:01:14.050> other<00:01:14.140> end<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:22.360> what<00:01:22.570> you're<00:01:22.690> going<00:01:22.900> to
