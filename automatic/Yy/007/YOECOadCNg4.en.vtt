the details of the trick to getting the

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.540 
the details of the trick to getting the
golf<00:00:14.849> ball<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.330> top<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> tee<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.550> golf

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
golf ball on top of the tee in the golf

ball<00:00:17.789> water<00:00:18.270> globe<00:00:18.570> trick<00:00:19.369> so<00:00:20.369> I'm<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.670> to

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
ball water globe trick so I'm going to

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.910 
ball water globe trick so I'm going to
zoom<00:00:20.760> out<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.210> hopefully<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.779> can<00:00:22.380> keep<00:00:22.710> this

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
zoom out and hopefully I can keep this

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.859 
zoom out and hopefully I can keep this
on<00:00:23.100> camera<00:00:26.779> unlike<00:00:27.779> last<00:00:28.050> time<00:00:28.849> now<00:00:29.869> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
on camera unlike last time now the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.110 
on camera unlike last time now the
reason<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.920> keep<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.399> ball<00:00:32.610> centered

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
reason that I keep the ball centered

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.510 
reason that I keep the ball centered
directly<00:00:33.239> behind<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.989> tee<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.430> can

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
directly behind the tee is so that I can

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.000 
directly behind the tee is so that I can
slowly<00:00:35.969> take<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.329> globe<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.020> tip<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.980> back

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
slowly take the globe and tip it back

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.630 
slowly take the globe and tip it back
like<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.239> keeping<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> water<00:00:40.500> without<00:00:41.250> moving

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
like so keeping the water without moving

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.030 
like so keeping the water without moving
all<00:00:42.090> right<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.079> ball<00:00:43.290> remains<00:00:43.680> at<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
all right and the ball remains at the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.950 
all right and the ball remains at the
top<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.579> globe<00:00:44.820> just<00:00:44.850> balancing<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
top of the globe just balancing on the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.220 
top of the globe just balancing on the
edge<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> tee<00:00:46.620> at<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:48.059> point<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:49.050> take

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
edge of the tee at this point I can take

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.979 
edge of the tee at this point I can take
the<00:00:49.379> globe<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.670> flip<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.149> forward<00:00:51.449> rotate

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
the globe and and flip it forward rotate

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.279 
the globe and and flip it forward rotate
it<00:00:52.110> forward<00:00:52.320> rapidly<00:00:53.629> just<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> tee

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
it forward rapidly just to get the tee

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.889 
it forward rapidly just to get the tee
underneath<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.070> ball<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:57.120> water<00:00:57.329> should

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
underneath the ball and the water should

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.310 
underneath the ball and the water should
remain<00:00:58.170> fairly<00:00:58.590> steady<00:00:59.010> inside<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.940> globe<00:01:00.320> so

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
remain fairly steady inside the globe so

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.740 
remain fairly steady inside the globe so
if<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.920> go<00:01:03.650> like<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:08.270> I<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.299> want<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
if I just go like so and I just want the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.719 
if I just go like so and I just want the
ball<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:09.990> roll<00:01:10.470> up<00:01:10.740> over<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> edge<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> tee

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
ball to roll up over the edge of the tee

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.070 
ball to roll up over the edge of the tee
I<00:01:11.760> don't<00:01:12.030> want<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> bounce<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:12.930> want

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
I don't want it to bounce you just want

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.450 
I don't want it to bounce you just want
it<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.200> roll<00:01:13.439> over<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.770> edge<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.070> come<00:01:14.250> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
it to roll over the edge and come to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:28.170 
it to roll over the edge and come to
rest<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> flat<00:01:15.810> surface<00:01:22.909> just<00:01:23.909> like<00:01:24.090> that

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.390 

so<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.450> ball<00:01:29.659> rolls<00:01:29.960> very<00:01:30.260> slowly<00:01:30.650> over<00:01:31.369> the

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
so the ball rolls very slowly over the

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.550 
so the ball rolls very slowly over the
edge<00:01:31.580> of<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.150> tea<00:01:32.330> without<00:01:32.600> bouncing<00:01:33.290> and

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
edge of the tea without bouncing and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.310 
edge of the tea without bouncing and
when<00:01:34.040> I<00:01:34.070> flip<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.490> globe<00:01:34.670> forward<00:01:35.090> rapidly

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
when I flip the globe forward rapidly

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.649 
when I flip the globe forward rapidly
the<00:01:36.320> water<00:01:36.560> just<00:01:37.190> pushes<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.820> gloop<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.240> the

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
the water just pushes the gloop the the

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.290 
the water just pushes the gloop the the
ball<00:01:38.900> up<00:01:39.200> on<00:01:39.710> top<00:01:39.950> of<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.190> tee<00:01:40.400> as<00:01:40.580> I<00:01:40.909> rotate

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
ball up on top of the tee as I rotate

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.719 
ball up on top of the tee as I rotate
the<00:01:41.479> tee<00:01:41.690> underneath<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.680> ball<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.130> comes<00:01:43.550> to

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
the tee underneath the ball and comes to

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:52.030 
the tee underneath the ball and comes to
arrest<00:01:44.090> ever<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:44.990> gently<00:01:50.680> so<00:01:51.680> that's<00:01:51.860> the

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
arrest ever so gently so that's the

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.580 
arrest ever so gently so that's the
trick<00:01:52.250> have<00:01:52.970> fun<00:01:53.240> with<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:53.600> be<00:01:54.350> sure<00:01:54.560> to

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
trick have fun with it and be sure to

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.070 
trick have fun with it and be sure to
annoy<00:01:55.009> your<00:01:55.159> friends<00:01:55.570> zero<00:01:56.570> fossil<00:01:56.930> fuel
