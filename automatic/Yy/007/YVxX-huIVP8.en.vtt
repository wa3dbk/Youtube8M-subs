the budget on the path to balance we

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.090 
the budget on the path to balance we
have<00:00:18.150> saved<00:00:18.420> offense<00:00:18.780> so<00:00:19.470> where<00:00:19.650> are<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.920> right

now I think the sequester is going to

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.290 
now I think the sequester is going to
happen<00:00:22.320> because<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.250> 1.2<00:00:23.820> trillion<00:00:24.060> dollars

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
happen because that 1.2 trillion dollars

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.150 
happen because that 1.2 trillion dollars
in<00:00:24.420> spending<00:00:24.510> cuts<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:25.080> can't<00:00:25.290> lose<00:00:25.800> those

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
in spending cuts we can't lose those

in spending cuts we can't lose those
spending<00:00:26.520> cuts<00:00:26.700> that<00:00:26.760> was<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.030> paper<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
spending cuts that was the paper the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
last debt ceiling increase we think

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.830 
last debt ceiling increase we think
these<00:00:29.130> are<00:00:29.310> questions<00:00:29.430> will<00:00:29.820> happen<00:00:30.210> because
