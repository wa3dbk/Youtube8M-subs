 TV shows these houses survived only 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.540
 because they are not made of brick 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.060
 dismantle nothing here 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.340
 stairwells and those pilfered years 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.380
 fifteen years ago when the city was dismantled

 Russia but there was no money to move 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.030
 going to work here the glands were even 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.220
 little now all povybili 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.799

 there is such a megapolis there

 vineyards mind and what we can not 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.380
 Is it possible to have something here ? 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.360
 the latter gave youth so many steppes 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.400
 this is a terrible doctor now a writer and

 journalist evgeny china in the seventies 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.209
 quite often been in chaga the wrong times

 military town remembers with a special 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.850
 warm cozy and unhurried says 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.160
 Chagan became a kind of impetus to 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.810
 the creation of the Nevada Semipalatinsk movement 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.700
 late eighties during one of 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.680
 gas wave underground test 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.090
 covered and giants in the city sharply 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.460
 jumped radiation background 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.200
 but 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.120
 the deceased officers then began to beat 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.940
 the alarm was supposedly safe 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.550
 is it safe or not i don't know on 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.250
 in fact, it is unlikely to absolutely 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.180
 safe but pilots naturally 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.970
 worried rightly 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.670
 because not only were they there but 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.739
 were all their wives and children a word 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.569
 documented this fact is not confirmed about 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.400
 the town itself is practically nothing 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.709
 no archives left in the local 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.379
 Local History Museum Kurchatov City 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.970
 and and here is chagan city it was closed 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.099
 closed cities were therefore 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.360
 information on these cities 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.849
 of these cities or rather not at all 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.430
 spread over the landfill therefore on 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.410
 present day 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.070
 and 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.800
 the materials of our museum are materials for exactly 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.930
 in these cities 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.150
 not available here on the abandoned 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.230
 Chagan airfield and still come across old 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.260
 military documents 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:27.110
 Here is some kind of encryption for 89 year and schedule 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.480
 flight for 72 airfield long-range aviation 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.880

 located 79 bomber 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.820
 air division 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.020
 its balance was about 100 characters 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.230
 cold war 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.000
 missile carriers that 95 from here they committed 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.550
 departures to the far north and Kamchatka 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.920
 guarded the distant frontiers of the Soviet Union 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.350
 Chagan military airfield even had 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.490
 to today's standards unprecedented 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.370
 runway length 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.740
 4 kilometers here are lined with concrete 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.410
 plates 1 meter thick 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.270
 maintains space loads in essence 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.480
 here even the legendary could land 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.950
 storm and now around not a soul airfield and 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.950
 the band itself went into neglect 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.170
 valentine sajina seems to be used to 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.120
 this chaos and hopelessness 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.350
 says the worst time survived 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.690
 now there are goats 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.770
 the garden grandchildren go to school at the station that 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.990
 a few kilometers away 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.180
 then for flour occasionally drive the city 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.760
 it's a shame just the local authorities about them 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.580
 Akim doesn’t remember us at all 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.610
 cares came and asked grandmother what 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:36.360
 there you beginner can go cheaper at 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:39.510
 What would the gerund 6100 be on coals? 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.790
 take if a three tons take me i am 29 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.660
 receive supplement 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:47.520
 it doesn't ecologically give me everything 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:52.440
 gets ecology and I am not logged in 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:55.470
 ecology is still some kind of 95 ice 98 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.930
 paid only ecology and everything seemed 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.510
 we were not patras you were not sniffing too 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.610
 bullshit do you think 9 hapless houses 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.170
 private sector chagan and administratively 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.300
 refers to the station of the same name 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.250
 there are two schools nearby 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.170
 small shop and mail is true 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.180
 rural akim assures that the former Chagan 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:16.230
 he helps regularly and even more than once 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.630
 offered to relocate from arranged there 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:22.380
 offer work moving apartments 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:25.050
 submitted this question was raised 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.610
 Now specialty program if they 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.080
 I like this one not enough 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.699
 you can 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.470
 other prospects for residents of Chagan and not 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:34.090
 rebuild destroyed houses local 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.860
 power cannot land administered 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.479
 Ministry of Defense as an airfield 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.970
 which is partially already rented out 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:41.800
 no one entrepreneur is true according to 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.599
 local akims are already negotiating with 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.120
 Russia and possibly neighbors take 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:48.129
 take off runway can then learn 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.789
 Ghanaians appear at least a small chance to 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:50.830
 rebirth 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:52.930
 their ghost town residents of the military 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.120
 the town of Chagan scattered around the former 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.099
 Soviet Union, but despite this they 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.560
 try to come here almost every 

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:01.569
 year and remember the old days somewhat 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.849
 years ago a monument was erected here on 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:06.490
 it is written part of our hearts 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:08.979
 will stay here forever che messengers of different 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.500
 times and countries and the years of the city 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:12.669
