00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.790
 hi there is a car, there is an iphone 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.849
 with a new app called and your 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:25.509
 Now let's see how this word works. 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.579
 Hack is an abbreviation for head display 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.439
 came from aviation and denotes 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.930
 display important navigation 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.170
 windshield information 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.120
 first load the route it takes 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.670
 just a few seconds and the internet 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.750
 only needed at this time further 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.809
 gps works 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.210
 the route is ready now presses the had button 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.399
 watch image has become a mirror 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.800
 nothing is clear but we will see 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.530
 reflection can simply be put on 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.309
 the panel but it is better to use silicone 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:05.950
 ordinary silicone mat for iphone 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:07.990
 all you can go all we see here it is 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.340
 picture right in front of me now 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.340
 mid summer 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.720
 eight in the evening and at dusk 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.640
 the image is not very clear yet but 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.400
 already awesome what it is because 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.930
 only windshield only iphone 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.380
 no accessories 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.550
 even there is no film and at the same time I can already see 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.010
 its speed 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.730
 i see what turn before i see it 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.070
 steepness 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.890
 and even the distance to it I see where 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.110
 will turn the roads I see how cool 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.080
 she will do it if especially dangerous 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.450
 the place then the image will turn red and 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.060
 All this can be customized if 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.220
 imagine such an invisible eye which 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.690
 I give it all my own who he is 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.119
 can fly at hood level 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.700
 then I see that directly 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.790
 before me happens dear and he 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.619
 can fly somewhere ahead too 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.570
 how far do i set up and then i 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.640
 I'll know what's waiting for me already 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.979
 next turn for example and so 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:09.649
 gives me more time to react than 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.050
 it becomes darker the brighter it becomes 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.470
 The image is generally x your working 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.560
 twilight at night in the rain in the fog 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.989
 it turns out that the greater the need 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.360
 in it the better it works like this 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.380
 interesting thing here is a specific situation 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.110
 sign 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.970
 every driver is very difficult at night 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.130
 overtake and run into the car 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.300
 especially if it's a truck and you don't know 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.220
 can overtake 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.890
 or not suddenly there is a turn on you 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.740
 will leave a nice little car and 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.370
 Now I know for sure what is in front of me 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.970
 straight 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:50.840
 I mean safely turn on the blinker to go 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:53.720
 on overtaking and calm it I finish exactly 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.540
 I knew that in front of me a safe area 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.280
 with serious differences in heights 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.280
 the application also shows 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.000
 the application is definitely working for me 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.280
 so far noted the main disadvantage that 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.450
 download the way for free 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.610
 the stock can only be for iphone or here 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.650
 ipad but in the future the app should 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.650
 appear and versions for android 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.680
 but traveling is much more convenient than road 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.870
 empty and with this helper yet 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.150
 the sensations of riding blind are more comfortable and 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.310
 Safer is such a superpower 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.430
 appears at the driver like an owl 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.310
 which hunt at night and on the icon 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.860
 and two shows a night owl is excellent 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.860
 visibility with or without chassis
