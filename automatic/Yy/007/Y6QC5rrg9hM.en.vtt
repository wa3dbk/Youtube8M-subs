00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
it really works I was shocked because I

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.410 
it really works I was shocked because I
used<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.400> couple<00:02:46.430> times<00:02:46.850> I<00:02:47.060> wasn't<00:02:47.239> really

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
used it a couple times I wasn't really

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.210 
used it a couple times I wasn't really
in<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:47.630> Sun<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:47.870> much<00:02:48.200> but<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.650> still<00:02:48.980> thought

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
in the Sun that much but I still thought

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.410 
in the Sun that much but I still thought
it<00:02:49.280> would<00:02:49.459> kind<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.700> change<00:02:49.880> my<00:02:50.000> hair<00:02:50.120> color<00:02:50.150> a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
it would kind of change my hair color a

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.120 
it would kind of change my hair color a
little<00:02:50.569> just<00:02:51.170> from<00:02:51.290> being<00:02:51.410> outside<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.980> know

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
little just from being outside you know

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.400 
little just from being outside you know
but<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:53.420> did<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:53.900> much<00:02:54.019> more<00:02:54.200> when<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.380> was

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
but it did so much more when I was

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.090 
but it did so much more when I was
standing<00:02:54.709> outside<00:02:55.180> yeah<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.650> changed<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.859> and

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
standing outside yeah it changed it and

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.099 
standing outside yeah it changed it and
like<00:02:58.549> I<00:02:58.640> said<00:02:58.850> keep<00:02:59.209> looking<00:02:59.570> at<00:02:59.690> these<00:02:59.840> rings

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
like I said keep looking at these rings

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.199 
like I said keep looking at these rings
because<00:03:00.290> they<00:03:01.130> are<00:03:01.340> matching<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.760> color<00:03:02.000> of

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209
