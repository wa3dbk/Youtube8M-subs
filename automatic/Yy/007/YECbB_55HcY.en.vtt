 Similar properties although many

 consider the machine to be purple as 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.740
 the grass with the most amount of 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.530
 properties on the restoration of

 incredibly immune system 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.950
 effective and with very few 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.560

 flu pains and many infections this 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.940
 behavior was then copied by the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.429
 immigrants and the reputation of 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.400
 Echinacea and its properties spread 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.740
 all over the continent is currently

 used to treat the symptoms

 properties of echinacea and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.040
 common cold one of the properties 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.350
 of the purple echinacea that has been 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.660
 highly exploited is its effectiveness 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.810
 to relieve cold symptoms 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.640
 common several scientific studies have 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.070
 demonstrated that the use of echinacea 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.560
 It can make us feel better 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.790
 Cold symptoms much more 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.430
 Quick 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.200
 a study of 95 people with 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.690
 first symptoms of colds flu 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.670
 showed that the participants who 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.730
 they took several cups of echinacea tea 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.250
 for five days they began to feel 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.340
 much better before the participants 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.960
 who had tea without echinacea this is 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.390
 because the properties of the 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.250
 Echinacea are highly effective over 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.680
 respiratory infections and 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.980
 bronchial as well as other 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.200
 Oral infections sore throat 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.209
 cetera the properties of echinacea and 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.690
 the immune system a great 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.340
 amount of scientific research 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.370
 mainly driven in germany and 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.739
 other European countries have confirmed that 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.900
 purple echinacea has properties 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.200
 that raise the natural defenses of 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.610
 body against infections 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.299
 stimulating and helping the system 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.470
 immunological works mainly 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.079
 stimulating the activity of the cells 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.299
 ty macrophages that are the first 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.690
 line of defense of the human body the 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.040
 purple echinacea is also rich in 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.049
 polysaccharides that help protect 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.079
 cells of possible invasions of 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.629
 bacteria and virus is and has properties 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.120
 antibacterial and anti fungicides 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.340
 which makes it a plant extremely 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.590
 versatile contraindications some 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.829
 people may present reactions 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.299
 allergic to echinacea if you notice any 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:20.160
 itchy eyes fluid nose 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.949
 throat itching or some other type of 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.590
 allergy symptom discontinues the use of 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.580
 echinacea echinacea should be 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.220
 avoided by 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.889
 people who have been diagnosed with 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.810
 some autoimmune disease due to its 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.360
 system enhancing effect 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.180
 immune take large amounts of 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.879
 Echinacea is not recommended, not because 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.460
 plant is toxic but because it can be 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.830
 counterproductive high doses are 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.259
 only used to mobilize the 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.719
 immune system to fight the 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:56.719
 early stages of an infection and its 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:56.719
 Use should be reduced after 24 hours
