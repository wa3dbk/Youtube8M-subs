00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.910 
first because you know like you have a
lot<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.850> gunk<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.299> there<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.680> see

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
lot of gunk on there so as you can see

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.010 
lot of gunk on there so as you can see
it<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.250> kind<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.490> really<00:01:44.820> rubs<00:01:45.060> out<00:01:45.270> well<00:01:45.689> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
it just kind of really rubs out well and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.139 
it just kind of really rubs out well and
if<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.560> gel<00:01:46.950> liner<00:01:47.189> or<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> lot<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.970> mascara

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
if I have gel liner or a lot of mascara

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.969 
if I have gel liner or a lot of mascara
on<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.750> day<00:01:48.930> then<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.380> kind<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.649> leave<00:01:49.829> it

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
on that day then I just kind of leave it

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:58.389 
on that day then I just kind of leave it
on<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:51.509> let<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.259> soak<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:55.070> as<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.430> see<00:01:56.700> i

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
on and let it soak up as you can see i

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.719 
on and let it soak up as you can see i
make<00:01:59.399> up<00:01:59.670> that<00:02:00.600> comes<00:02:00.899> off<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.729> and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
make up that comes off like that and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.609 
make up that comes off like that and
then<00:02:03.000> what<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.149> do<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:03.719> kind<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.960> flip

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
it's the same method you go against your

skin<00:04:46.190> texture<00:04:46.840> you<00:04:47.840> make<00:04:48.050> circular<00:04:48.410> motions

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.980 

oh<00:04:57.500> I<00:04:57.980> just<00:04:58.190> thought<00:04:58.850> that<00:04:58.910> of<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.360> shower<00:04:59.570> and

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
oh I just thought that of the shower and

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.040 
oh I just thought that of the shower and
my<00:05:00.200> number<00:05:00.470> one<00:05:00.650> rule<00:05:00.980> is<00:05:01.360> put<00:05:02.360> moisturizer<00:05:02.600> on

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
my number one rule is put moisturizer on

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.990 
my number one rule is put moisturizer on
immediately<00:05:03.890> after<00:05:04.370> I<00:05:04.400> jump<00:05:04.670> out<00:05:04.790> of<00:05:04.850> the

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
immediately after I jump out of the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.180 
immediately after I jump out of the
shower<00:05:05.210> I<00:05:05.540> don't<00:05:05.960> cut<00:05:06.110> my<00:05:06.290> face<00:05:06.500> dry<00:05:06.920> because

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
shower I don't cut my face dry because

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.710 
shower I don't cut my face dry because
it<00:05:07.490> kind<00:05:07.640> of<00:05:07.670> defeats<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.030> whole<00:05:08.180> purpose<00:05:08.450> of

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
it kind of defeats the whole purpose of

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.630 
it kind of defeats the whole purpose of
moisturizing<00:05:09.290> if<00:05:09.920> you're<00:05:10.100> trying<00:05:10.250> to<00:05:10.340> retain

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
moisturizing if you're trying to retain

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.970 
moisturizing if you're trying to retain
moisture<00:05:10.880> you<00:05:11.390> would<00:05:12.080> want<00:05:12.380> a<00:05:12.590> little<00:05:12.770> bit<00:05:12.920> of

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
moisture you would want a little bit of

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.950 
moisture you would want a little bit of
moisture<00:05:13.220> left<00:05:13.670> instead<00:05:14.060> of<00:05:14.120> completely

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
moisture left instead of completely

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.830 
moisture left instead of completely
drying<00:05:15.530> it<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:16.010> then<00:05:16.160> apply<00:05:16.490> moisturizer<00:05:17.090> so

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
drying it and then apply moisturizer so

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.810 
drying it and then apply moisturizer so
