00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.769
 I play my date of Real Madrid 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.170
 I'm from Madrid, send me the boat 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.509
 when the laptop with which he recorded 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.279
 many you will know others not toshiba good 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.610
 It's pretty good but I can not 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.189
 complain me back ground and we started with 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.169
 the setup that teaches me are the game 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.460
 you wanted to just put it on twitter 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.980
 the truth realize all those who 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.930
 you follow by twitter and all who see 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.760
 my videos lately this special what 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.530
 I do more than anything because I've had 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.660
 many but many visits these 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.390
 last four days five days has 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.309
 happy more than 2000 more than a thousand 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.019
 you can not see it but we 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.539
 we know how social play all these 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:50.480
 things but I've had enough and that 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:53.600
 better to thank him that way by teaching my setup 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.750
 this is my brother chris the vehicle 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.739
 Hello, you left and everything came out 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.690
 let's do 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.540
 good I started what I'm going to erase this 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.270
 computer with which he recorded my bed a 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.830
 stuffed animal and top bunk and is that not 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.780
 Please miss when I was a kid 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.540
 one painted at home with time 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.440
 good story first thing the black box 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.780
 the xbox I have it like that because the cable goes 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.110
 to the router here the cable that goes best 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.690
 that I am a grandson in connection player and a 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.640
 beach connection as I say it and good 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.350
 from the plug I have a lot if this one 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.159
 it will be taught because there is a lot behind 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.859
 how much cable 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.740
 a tele superatec 20 inches I think that 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.539
 that is to say that before he played one of 50 and the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.490
 true that the change is quite noticeable 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.670
 because it takes three or two days in 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.200
 get used to the build 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.869
 get used to forgive me or four days 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.090
 but hey there is the xbox tele that we 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.659
 missing please and something fundamental to 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.799
 make a youtube a captive hd pvr 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.299
 the homepage page goes pretty well what 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.789
 only drawback that I should plug 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.979
 there I must put there a small one 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.920
 mess because I'm missing a table as you can 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.989
 see but I found out that out there other 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.599
 captors do not necessarily need 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.640
 be plugged in know if he asked me 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.880
 machinima 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.620
 in Munich but hey certainly not me 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.200
 I'll stay with that one because there's everything 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.240
 all my life and it goes pretty well and I do not 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.400
 I will begin to buy another lot of people I 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.370
 says eric you have scoop because it jumps yes 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.990
 you shoot at the same time I do not have is that 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.990
 has pallets is the command that comes with 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.270
 xbox for people who say if you have is 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.400
 cool piece I discover I always say no 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.080
 q I have is not as what you can see a 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.459
 I control the xbox the charger that I 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.880
 I bought and nothing else this is the battery of 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.100
 television helmets 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.650
 this is the micro even words for 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.810
 talk to my colleagues on xbox because 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.570
 the cable cited that it is connected from the remote 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.790
 here the helmets have been broken but the 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.250
 micro helmets and worth goes pretty 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.260
 well I use it to comment because it 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.140
 much better than the integrated that of 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.700
 shit and what you see here from heat the 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.250
 last save three people who do not 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.350
 know this I got it from vision 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.480
 limited from model to poster in percent and 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.910
 some euros and it's going pretty good 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.750
 Wireless helmets has for xbox not 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.190
 I know if you can 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.690
 you do not see xbox play 3 and pc or mac and go 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.240
 by bluetooth the truth without cable 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.220
 pretty good and I think they were 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.230
 pretty good I do not recommend it the truth 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.710
 but I do not know if there will be but I go enough 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.660
 in many listening methods and well there 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.150

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.129
