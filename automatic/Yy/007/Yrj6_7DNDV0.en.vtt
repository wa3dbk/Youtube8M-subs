00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
this car very simple job to do it took

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.120 
this car very simple job to do it took
me<00:03:11.540> about<00:03:11.720> 30<00:03:11.959> minutes<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:12.620> that's<00:03:12.680> because<00:03:12.920> I

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
me about 30 minutes and that's because I

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.800 
me about 30 minutes and that's because I
had<00:03:13.250> never<00:03:13.370> taken<00:03:13.670> this<00:03:13.940> radio<00:03:14.269> out<00:03:14.450> before

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
had never taken this radio out before

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.810 
had never taken this radio out before
and<00:03:15.110> I<00:03:15.170> didn't<00:03:15.440> know<00:03:15.620> how<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.340> do<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.640> wiring

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
and I didn't know how to do the wiring

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.360 
and I didn't know how to do the wiring
correctly<00:03:17.450> but<00:03:17.630> once<00:03:17.989> you<00:03:18.110> figure<00:03:18.380> it<00:03:18.470> out<00:03:18.560> if

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
correctly but once you figure it out if

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.440 
correctly but once you figure it out if
I<00:03:19.459> were<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.610> do<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:19.760> again<00:03:19.970> it'd<00:03:20.090> probably<00:03:20.299> take

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
I were to do it again it'd probably take

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.720 
I were to do it again it'd probably take
me<00:03:20.750> 10<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.140> 15<00:03:21.500> minutes<00:03:21.709> it's<00:03:22.100> such<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.430> simple

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
me 10 to 15 minutes it's such a simple

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.229 
me 10 to 15 minutes it's such a simple
job<00:03:23.110> um<00:03:25.269> really<00:03:26.269> that's<00:03:26.450> it<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:27.320> car<00:03:27.530> now<00:03:27.769> has

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
job um really that's it the car now has

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:35.789
