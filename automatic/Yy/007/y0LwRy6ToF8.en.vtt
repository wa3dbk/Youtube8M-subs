you guys my thoughts on it say I'm
pretty<00:02:10.330> much<00:02:10.390> thinking<00:02:10.479> it's<00:02:11.260> gonna<00:02:11.379> be<00:02:11.590> a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
pretty much thinking it's gonna be a

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.190 
pretty much thinking it's gonna be a
really<00:02:11.739> good<00:02:11.950> game<00:02:12.099> of<00:02:13.090> course<00:02:13.599> every<00:02:13.989> game

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
really good game of course every game

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.170 
really good game of course every game
always<00:02:14.470> come<00:02:14.890> one<00:02:15.220> game<00:02:15.430> first<00:02:15.730> comes<00:02:16.000> out

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
always come one game first comes out

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.640 
always come one game first comes out
they<00:02:16.540> always<00:02:16.780> have<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.959> little<00:02:17.050> bit<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.319> flaws

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
they always have a little bit of flaws

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.830 
they always have a little bit of flaws
and<00:02:17.950> stuff<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.519> I'm<00:02:19.000> guessing<00:02:19.390> they're<00:02:19.780> gonna

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
and stuff so I'm guessing they're gonna

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.229 
and stuff so I'm guessing they're gonna
have<00:02:20.170> movie<00:02:20.560> couple<00:02:20.920> glitches<00:02:21.069> found<00:02:21.879> within
