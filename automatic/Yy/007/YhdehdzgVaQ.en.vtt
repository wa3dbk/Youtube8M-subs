hacking and emulator websites now anyone

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.600 
hacking and emulator websites now anyone
who<00:04:21.110> wants<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.560> code<00:04:21.799> for<00:04:21.950> all<00:04:22.130> karuna<00:04:22.550> of

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
who wants the code for all karuna of

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.010 
who wants the code for all karuna of
time<00:04:22.850> pretty<00:04:23.450> much<00:04:23.600> hazard<00:04:25.690> something<00:04:26.690> also

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
time pretty much hazard something also

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.570 
time pretty much hazard something also
worth<00:04:27.170> mentioning<00:04:27.200> is<00:04:27.740> that<00:04:27.800> if<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.340> play

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
worth mentioning is that if you play

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.820 
worth mentioning is that if you play
ocarina<00:04:28.820> of<00:04:29.150> time<00:04:29.240> with<00:04:29.540> the<00:04:29.630> DD<00:04:30.050> below<00:04:30.650> the

ocarina of time with the DD below the
n64<00:04:31.370> you<00:04:32.270> will<00:04:32.420> say<00:04:32.690> would<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:33.080> like<00:04:33.440> to<00:04:33.650> play

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
n64 you will say would you like to play

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.580 
n64 you will say would you like to play
a<00:04:34.100> result<00:04:34.520> but<00:04:34.670> if<00:04:34.850> you<00:04:35.360> select<00:04:35.780> yes<00:04:36.080> it<00:04:36.380> will

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
a result but if you select yes it will

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.800 
a result but if you select yes it will
say<00:04:36.800> please<00:04:37.400> insert<00:04:37.790> your<00:04:38.060> result<00:04:38.420> a<00:04:38.540> disc

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
say please insert your result a disc

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.800 
say please insert your result a disc
there's<00:04:39.770> also<00:04:40.100> a<00:04:40.280> gameshark<00:04:40.910> code<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:41.420> allow

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
there's also a gameshark code that allow

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.950 
there's also a gameshark code that allow
that<00:04:41.870> an<00:04:42.260> icon<00:04:42.800> that<00:04:43.100> says<00:04:43.220> disc<00:04:44.210> next<00:04:44.810> to<00:04:44.870> the

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
that an icon that says disc next to the

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.200 
that an icon that says disc next to the
profile<00:04:45.440> it<00:04:46.160> would<00:04:46.280> probably<00:04:46.520> be<00:04:46.790> like<00:04:47.000> that

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
profile it would probably be like that

00:04:47.210 --> 00:05:03.170 
profile it would probably be like that
if<00:04:47.390> you're<00:04:47.540> a<00:04:47.570> plank<00:04:47.930> or<00:04:48.170> Zelda

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.239 

so<00:05:04.180> that's<00:05:04.389> where<00:05:04.659> is<00:05:04.809> el<00:05:05.020> de<00:05:05.199> it<00:05:05.619> sucks<00:05:06.039> on<00:05:06.219> the

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:06.249 
so that's where is el de it sucks on the
