what's the debt that they tell you so
they<00:02:45.430> tell<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.300> United<00:02:46.930> States<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.260> 15

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
they tell you the United States is 15

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.170 
they tell you the United States is 15
trillion<00:02:48.130> dollars<00:02:48.400> in<00:02:48.580> debt<00:02:48.730> but<00:02:48.910> when<00:02:49.060> it

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
trillion dollars in debt but when it

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.060 
trillion dollars in debt but when it
were<00:02:49.360> actually<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.990> United<00:02:50.260> States<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.560> 100

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
were actually the United States is 100

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.980 
were actually the United States is 100
billion<00:02:51.430> trillion<00:02:52.330> dollars<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:52.900> debt<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.990> and

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
billion trillion dollars in debt and and

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.620 
billion trillion dollars in debt and and
that's<00:02:56.170> gap<00:02:56.530> accountant<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:57.490> some<00:02:57.850> senses<00:02:58.420> you

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
that's gap accountant in some senses you

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.530 
that's gap accountant in some senses you
could<00:02:58.780> say<00:02:58.960> well<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.890> know<00:02:59.920> okay<00:03:00.880> well<00:03:01.120> they

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
could say well you know okay well they

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.010 
could say well you know okay well they
don't<00:03:01.960> need<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.290> pay<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.560> right<00:03:03.130> now<00:03:03.370> so

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
don't need to pay that right now so

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.200 
don't need to pay that right now so
that's<00:03:05.020> that<00:03:05.710> that<00:03:06.190> debt<00:03:06.430> doesn't<00:03:06.640> count<00:03:06.880> all

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
that's that that debt doesn't count all

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.780 
that's that that debt doesn't count all
right<00:03:07.360> so<00:03:07.690> there's<00:03:08.020> over<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.010> over<00:03:09.490> and<00:03:09.700> above

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
right so there's over and over and above

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.580 
right so there's over and over and above
dead<00:03:10.300> doesn't<00:03:10.900> count<00:03:11.020> because<00:03:11.230> they<00:03:11.440> don't

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
dead doesn't count because they don't

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.410 
dead doesn't count because they don't
have<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.740> pay<00:03:11.890> right<00:03:12.130> now<00:03:12.250> all<00:03:12.970> right<00:03:13.210> fine

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
have to pay right now all right fine

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.000 
have to pay right now all right fine
whatever<00:03:13.900> right<00:03:14.560> um<00:03:14.830> but<00:03:16.650> take<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.680> look<00:03:17.770> at

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
whatever right um but take a look at

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.010 
whatever right um but take a look at
this<00:03:18.160> take<00:03:18.520> a<00:03:18.880> look<00:03:19.120> at<00:03:19.180> this<00:03:19.300> right<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:19.930> this

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
this take a look at this right and this

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.110 
this take a look at this right and this
is<00:03:20.140> under<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.890> same<00:03:21.130> thing<00:03:21.490> where<00:03:21.700> they<00:03:21.940> don't

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
is under the same thing where they don't

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.940 
is under the same thing where they don't
have<00:03:22.270> to<00:03:22.390> pay<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.690> right<00:03:22.720> now<00:03:23.050> kind<00:03:23.890> of

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
have to pay it right now kind of

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:31.890 
have to pay it right now kind of
scenario<00:03:24.250> ah<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:30.430> motha<00:03:30.880> my<00:03:31.060> they<00:03:31.690> when

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
scenario ah so the motha my they when

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.000 
scenario ah so the motha my they when
they<00:03:32.140> calculate<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:34.650> surplus<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:35.890> they

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
they calculate the surplus that they

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.130 
they calculate the surplus that they
keep<00:03:36.220> saying<00:03:36.520> that<00:03:37.210> exists<00:03:37.600> rate<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.050> you

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
keep saying that exists rate and you

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.900 
keep saying that exists rate and you
know<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.440> government's<00:03:38.890> favorite<00:03:39.340> thing<00:03:39.700> if

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
know the government's favorite thing if

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.490 
know the government's favorite thing if
you<00:03:40.030> don't<00:03:40.210> like<00:03:40.360> the<00:03:40.510> numbers<00:03:41.020> change<00:03:41.320> them

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
you don't like the numbers change them

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.800 
you don't like the numbers change them
they<00:03:42.400> change<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.820> rules<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.240> then<00:03:43.390> they<00:03:43.540> said

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
they change the rules and then they said

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.590 
they change the rules and then they said
that<00:03:44.050> you<00:03:44.200> know<00:03:44.350> let's<00:03:44.920> calculate<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.600> the

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
that you know let's calculate the the

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.990 
that you know let's calculate the the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
coins and medals equals silver surplus

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.250 
coins and medals equals silver surplus
or<00:03:56.470> deficit<00:03:57.090> now<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.810> might<00:03:58.960> have<00:03:59.080> missed

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
or deficit now you might have missed

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.560 
or deficit now you might have missed
that<00:04:00.570> but<00:04:01.570> now<00:04:01.990> you<00:04:02.170> just<00:04:02.440> zero<00:04:02.950> in<00:04:03.190> on<00:04:03.310> it

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
that but now you just zero in on it

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.400 
that but now you just zero in on it
coins<00:04:04.570> &amp;<00:04:05.280> metals<00:04:06.280> are<00:04:06.750> minus<00:04:07.750> from<00:04:08.260> the

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
oh noes but the real issue is that this
