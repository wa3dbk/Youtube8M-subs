mind-boggling yeah I think this is where
the<00:01:50.180> future<00:01:50.329> is<00:01:50.570> at<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:50.990> is<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.590> result<00:01:52.490> of

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
the future is at this is the result of

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.179 
the future is at this is the result of
years<00:01:52.939> of<00:01:53.119> research<00:01:53.680> in<00:01:54.680> regenerative

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
years of research in regenerative

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.510 
years of research in regenerative
medicine<00:01:56.140> themselves<00:01:57.140> cloning<00:01:57.649> it<00:01:57.860> this<00:01:58.280> is

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
medicine themselves cloning it this is

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.539 
medicine themselves cloning it this is
really<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:59.149> first<00:02:00.140> generation<00:02:00.890> of<00:02:01.039> products

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
really the first generation of products

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.219 
really the first generation of products
to<00:02:01.969> actually<00:02:02.890> make<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:03.920> into<00:02:04.189> practical<00:02:04.820> usage

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
to actually make it into practical usage

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.630 
to actually make it into practical usage
okay<00:02:06.229> what<00:02:06.469> exactly<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:07.189> Maitre<00:02:08.000> stem<00:02:09.460> how<00:02:10.460> is

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
okay what exactly is Maitre stem how is

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.150 
okay what exactly is Maitre stem how is
it<00:02:10.759> made<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.270> what<00:02:11.420> does<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.630> do<00:02:11.840> it's<00:02:12.650> derived

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
it made and what does it do it's derived

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.800 
it made and what does it do it's derived
from<00:02:13.460> urinary<00:02:14.330> bladder<00:02:14.480> matrix<00:02:15.440> from<00:02:15.800> pigs

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
from urinary bladder matrix from pigs

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.140 
from urinary bladder matrix from pigs
now

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
now

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.619 
now
it's<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.360> very<00:02:19.689> specific<00:02:21.359> anatomical<00:02:22.359> layer

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
it's a very specific anatomical layer

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.780 
it's a very specific anatomical layer
that<00:02:23.620> has<00:02:25.170> basement<00:02:26.170> membrane<00:02:26.739> proteins<00:02:27.489> as

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790

there's an injury in the body it can

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.869 
there's an injury in the body it can
follow<00:02:45.700> one<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.239> two<00:02:46.420> pathways<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:47.319> can

follow one of two pathways that can
follow<00:02:48.879> a<00:02:49.060> regenerative<00:02:49.659> pathway<00:02:50.470> which

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
follow a regenerative pathway which

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.970 
follow a regenerative pathway which
doesn't<00:02:51.579> happen<00:02:51.760> very<00:02:51.939> often<00:02:52.299> or<00:02:52.870> more<00:02:53.709> likely

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
doesn't happen very often or more likely

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.190 
doesn't happen very often or more likely
it<00:02:54.250> can<00:02:54.430> follow<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.879> scar<00:02:55.299> pathway<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.019> body

it can follow a scar pathway the body

just fills in a defect with scar tissues
I<00:03:00.310> think<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.790> like<00:03:01.000> spackle

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
I think that like spackle

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.879 
I think that like spackle
well<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:02.680> material<00:03:03.450> stimulates<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.889> normal

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
well this material stimulates the normal

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.339 
well this material stimulates the normal
regenerative<00:03:06.549> pathway<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.150> occur

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
regenerative pathway to occur

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.800 
regenerative pathway to occur
the<00:03:08.680> body's<00:03:09.040> stem<00:03:09.459> cells<00:03:09.819> are<00:03:10.120> recruited<00:03:10.780> to

the body's stem cells are recruited to

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.729 
the body's stem cells are recruited to
come<00:03:11.439> in<00:03:11.889> to<00:03:12.189> the<00:03:12.430> area<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.819> injury<00:03:13.000> and

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
come in to the area of injury and

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.129 
come in to the area of injury and
actually<00:03:14.760> regenerate<00:03:15.760> what<00:03:16.720> used<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.079> be

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
actually regenerate what used to be

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.830 
actually regenerate what used to be
their<00:03:17.470> normal<00:03:18.129> tissue<00:03:18.540> that's<00:03:19.540> that's

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
their normal tissue that's that's

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.599 
their normal tissue that's that's
unbelievable<00:03:20.530> like<00:03:20.829> ah<00:03:20.950> like<00:03:21.069> I<00:03:21.250> said<00:03:21.489> it

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
unbelievable like ah like I said it

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.430 
unbelievable like ah like I said it
sounds<00:03:22.030> like<00:03:22.150> science<00:03:22.359> fiction<00:03:22.569> so<00:03:23.049> are<00:03:23.290> you

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
sounds like science fiction so are you

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.180 
sounds like science fiction so are you
saying<00:03:23.799> that<00:03:24.040> using<00:03:24.879> this<00:03:25.329> powder<00:03:25.959> using<00:03:26.829> this

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
saying that using this powder using this

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.699 
saying that using this powder using this
product<00:03:27.959> could<00:03:28.979> possibly<00:03:29.979> make<00:03:31.440> any<00:03:32.440> type<00:03:32.680> of

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
product could possibly make any type of

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.250 
product could possibly make any type of
surgery<00:03:33.190> scarless<00:03:33.760> well<00:03:34.510> it<00:03:34.690> has<00:03:35.049> the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
surgery scarless well it has the

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.890 
surgery scarless well it has the
potential<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:36.099> I<00:03:36.400> prefer<00:03:37.090> at<00:03:37.269> this<00:03:37.449> point<00:03:37.750> to

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
potential I I prefer at this point to

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.379 
potential I I prefer at this point to
use<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.229> word<00:03:38.440> reduce<00:03:38.979> scarring<00:03:39.400> okay<00:03:40.060> that's

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
use the word reduce scarring okay that's

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:40.830 
use the word reduce scarring okay that's
fair<00:03:40.569> enough

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
fair enough

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.890 
fair enough
yeah<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:41.859> I<00:03:41.919> can<00:03:42.129> describe<00:03:42.729> in<00:03:43.479> a<00:03:43.599> little<00:03:43.810> bit

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
yeah and I can describe in a little bit

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.479 
yeah and I can describe in a little bit
more<00:03:44.079> detail<00:03:44.500> what<00:03:44.620> my<00:03:44.769> experience<00:03:45.280> has<00:03:45.459> been

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
more detail what my experience has been

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.750 
more detail what my experience has been
so<00:03:45.760> far<00:03:46.120> but<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:46.900> prefer<00:03:47.590> not<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:49.500> raise<00:03:50.500> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
so far but I prefer not to raise the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.819 
so far but I prefer not to raise the
expectations<00:03:51.760> that<00:03:52.019> that<00:03:53.019> when<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.379> use<00:03:53.620> this

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
expectations that that when you use this

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.629 
expectations that that when you use this
there<00:03:54.069> will<00:03:54.129> be<00:03:54.190> no<00:03:54.340> scarring<00:03:54.849> I<00:03:55.120> think
