00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
I'm not playing that you know it's

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.770 
I'm not playing that you know it's
difficult<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.519> coach<00:04:07.730> will<00:04:07.880> call<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:08.239> so<00:04:08.540> I

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
difficult the coach will call you so I

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.539 
difficult the coach will call you so I
would<00:04:09.110> say<00:04:09.260> it's<00:04:09.799> not<00:04:09.920> for<00:04:10.130> me

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
would say it's not for me

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.020 
would say it's not for me
but<00:04:11.150> I<00:04:11.480> would<00:04:11.750> say<00:04:11.900> from<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.230> coach<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:13.030> didn't

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
but I would say from the coach I didn't

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:26.120 
but I would say from the coach I didn't
get<00:04:14.209> playing<00:04:14.420> time<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:15.280> that's<00:04:16.280> why
