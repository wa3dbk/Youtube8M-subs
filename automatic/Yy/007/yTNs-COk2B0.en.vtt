00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.279
 good morning today we are going to do one thing 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.540
 very simple 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.730
 you will see now we have introduced 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.830
 in hake heads in the fish market and 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.160
 they ask me how to make these heads 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.470
 good for very simple one way 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.199
 Hake heads with a little potato 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:48.970
 a little bit of onion the oil the salt 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:51.640
 and then as I usually say if you have 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.520
 fish broth that you make some day 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.010
 Well, you see it freezes and even so in 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.980
 these cubes and then we'll throw 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.350
 this little bit that we have to not then a 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.800
 little bit of white wine worth 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.640
 well then we put the casserole on 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.940
 little oil in the pan and we will throw 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.360
 finite finite potato and onion 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.020
 finite and the short and we will put support 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.330
 this looks at the finite potatoes and the 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.090
 onions also cut into strips 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.579
 because this has to be pressed a lot 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.030
 and once it's poached, it's 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:34.359
 when we will put the heads on or 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.200
 be that this will take a long time to settle down 15 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.200
 easy minutes 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.190
 Well, you have already supported the onion and 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.360
 the potato a little bit and now we proceed to 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.360
 put the heads 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.899
 we will expose the heads here 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.890
 Y 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.500
 You see, I'm going to put my ice cubes 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.360
 fish that had frozen you that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.000
 you do not have then you throw a little wine 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.770
 white for each one this has to be a 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.009
 a little while until it's done 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.009
 [Applause] 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.660
 we cover 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.370
 we cover the casserole and this is good 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.560
 you will see but this in 15 minutes 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.950
 or so it is 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.020
 and they will be richer potatoes 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.530
 the head is very very tasty 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.530
 eat up 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.480
 well then we raise the cover to see 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.049
 how is it and look at what looks richer 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.590
 has then we already turned them off and 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.650
 we place 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:59.980
 you will see that this beautiful salsita the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.980
 potatoes look what looks richer 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.900
 and is that the heads like a lot 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.920
 people suck 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.590
 it takes a lot out of it 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.590
 the potato that good 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.489
 we skipped another piece 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.330
 do not break me 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.870
 okay 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.870
 the other half of the head 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.700
 maybe it is not nice but you see and 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.700
 is 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.730
 Nothing very simple and a way of 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.739
 eat hake heads 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.739
 good good to lick your fingers
