him<00:00:36.390> as<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.540> camper<00:00:36.930> right<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.290> would<00:00:37.469> be<00:00:37.590> like

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
him as a camper right this would be like

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.299 
him as a camper right this would be like
the<00:00:37.770> exact<00:00:38.930> you<00:00:39.930> know<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.950> would<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the exact you know this would be the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.280 
the exact you know this would be the
definition<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.090> camber<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.960> saw<00:00:43.140> that

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
definition of a camber but I saw that

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.720 
definition of a camber but I saw that
guy<00:00:43.350> was<00:00:43.620> running<00:00:43.770> light<00:00:44.070> weight<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.520> think

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
guy was running light weight and I think

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.610 
guy was running light weight and I think
what<00:00:44.879> he<00:00:45.000> actually<00:00:45.210> did<00:00:45.539> instead<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.230> camping

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
what he actually did instead of camping

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.709 
what he actually did instead of camping
it<00:00:47.250> was<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.640> really<00:00:47.820> good<00:00:47.940> opening<00:00:48.510> route

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
it was just a really good opening route

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.080 
it was just a really good opening route
one<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> might<00:00:49.289> take<00:00:49.559> note<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.309> future<00:00:50.969> games

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
one I might take note of in future games

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.270 
one I might take note of in future games
because<00:00:51.660> he's<00:00:51.780> not<00:00:51.899> there<00:00:52.110> now<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.590> he<00:00:53.129> ran

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
because he's not there now and he ran

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
think that Howcast last night was one of

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.059 
think that Howcast last night was one of
the<00:02:15.629> better<00:02:15.750> podcasts<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.410> we've<00:02:16.620> had<00:02:16.769> for<00:02:16.830> a

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
the better podcasts that we've had for a

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.360 
the better podcasts that we've had for a
while<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:19.319> stream<00:02:19.590> was<00:02:19.739> really<00:02:20.010> active

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
while and the stream was really active

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.430 
while and the stream was really active
and<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:20.730> did<00:02:20.879> an<00:02:20.970> extra<00:02:21.300> long<00:02:21.450> post<00:02:21.840> podcast

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.229 
show I think altogether we were on the
live<00:02:25.500> stream<00:02:25.530> for<00:02:26.010> probably<00:02:26.280> six<00:02:26.489> hours<00:02:26.910> or<00:02:27.060> so

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.080 
the render before I went to bed on a
long<00:02:34.890> show<00:02:35.099> like<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.370> one<00:02:35.549> it<00:02:35.819> can<00:02:35.940> take

long show like that one it can take

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.940 
long show like that one it can take
about<00:02:36.299> nine<00:02:36.569> hours<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.170> when<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.470> woke<00:02:37.650> up<00:02:37.799> this

about nine hours and when I woke up this
