 would 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.309
 two combis two diesel engines but with 5 different approaches 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.309
 Volvo v70 meets the SC Pick Szeged 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.610
 outwardly, the differences show up while the Volvo leaves 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.320
 Elegantly she looks into the world is the front of the seat aggressively binder 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.040
 in the area led over the sideline to the back also shows here 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.670
 sporty orientation of the x7 compared to the classic combination of up to 70 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.030
 but enough externalities we start with the Volvo its second time 4 liters 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.350
 Diesel engine provides 175 hp and meets the euro 4 exhaust standard 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.870
 in the equipment line we drove Summum hardly leaves 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.870
 Wishes open 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.119
 The package is rounded off by extensive safety technology such as a 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.260
 dead angle Warema 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.930
 and a lane departure assistant No of the extra costs 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.860
 the Volvo is very soft 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.619
 by that I mean the suspension the steering and the seats the "It was very comfortable 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.400
 But they do not offer a good lateral support combination with the automatic transmission 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.670
 What we have in our test car makes all of the v70 a super 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.920
 Langstreckenfahrzeug but determines no KurvenrÃ¤uber completely different when 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.710
 Seat here is the driving just as you imagine a Spaniard 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.770
 very spirited allegedly lie agile the steering is very direct very 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.459
 precise 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.950
 When turning in you have the feeling that the rear axle is always a bit

 Lichtlein points as a soloist 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.620
 These are 14 o'clock it is based on the predecessor model of the Audi A4 the technique 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:50.259
 is accordingly not only her but solid 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:54.849
 443 hp diesel engine is a bit weak in the lower rpm range 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.899
 Chest and has a getting used to 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:57.979
 responsiveness 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.539
 When approaching it is easy to work it off 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:04.419
 However, once you drive, it does not reveal any weaknesses, moreover, it fulfills marriage 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.419
 the euro 5 exhaust standard 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:22.139
 although the good 30 d is less has accelerated the xc90 organ newcomer 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.389
 three seconds faster from zero to one hundred km / h than the v70 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.729
 and it consumes a good liter less than the Volvo which, however 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.629
 due to the automatic transmission is located 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.530
 a change in the EU laws, there is nothing wrong with everything 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.969
 very high quality we have pleasant materials 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.279
 it's a bit sporty too, here with these rough edges around 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:45.339
 the rounds 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:49.009
 Air outlets so that's pretty chic 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.510
 also in the case sees itself is very dignified we have very appealing 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.409
 A beautiful beautiful is simple elegant interior design and all the materials 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.409
 Buttons are where you suspect them 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:11.609

 Pool at the Seat is four or 42 liters 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.819
 one moving box less 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:31.439
 If you work out the seats, the Volvo includes a whopping 1000 600 that has only 1000 354 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.439
 Liters here, too, that he must stay out of the box again

 in the interior continues what started outside the Volvo bottom right in the 

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:49.129
 Image radiates living room atmosphere balanced there are sporty too 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:06.779
 which of the two is now the better choice 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:10.589
 with the comfortable Volvo you can comfortably longer distances 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:14.969
 you do not have to do without anything and you glide through it 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:17.259
 Landscape like in a litter 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.670
 For that you pay in the version we drive at least 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.400
 for ten thousand 800 euros in Germany more than you have them 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.999
 is subject in the end but the Exeo form 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:37.889
 who with his southern temperament are adrenaline in 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.289
 the height is driving 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.960
 you wake up all the details against each other 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.009
 so there is in the end if Prof KNA 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.009
 a winner 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:56.319
 the performance becomes relatively little 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.699
 that's the big strength of the Exeo, but that's because of it 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.069
 based on the old Audi a4 and not much had to be redeveloped only 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.509
 that designers have the Spanish overworked all the same 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.029
 successful car 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:13.619
 for those who need to travel longer distances and 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:17.719
 want to arrive as relaxed as possible for Nied is before 70 even if he 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:20.589
 more expensive is the better choice 

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:24.599
 St is often dependent on what you expect from your car anyway
