00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.979 
have to get surgery to fix it and I
really<00:03:56.310> don't<00:03:56.430> want<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:56.609> to<00:03:56.700> happen<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:57.000> it's

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
really don't want that to happen so it's

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.690 
really don't want that to happen so it's
not<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.230> it's<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.709> painful<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.370> mean<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.609> is

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
not that it's that painful I mean it is

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.160 
not that it's that painful I mean it is
kind<00:03:59.819> of<00:04:00.060> but<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.239> have<00:04:00.359> a<00:04:00.420> pretty<00:04:00.569> high<00:04:00.690> pain

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
kind of but I have a pretty high pain

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.650 
kind of but I have a pretty high pain
tolerance<00:04:01.700> Chin's<00:04:02.700> kind<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.150> get<00:04:03.299> a<00:04:03.329> new<00:04:03.510> one

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
tolerance Chin's kind of get a new one

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.920 
tolerance Chin's kind of get a new one
and<00:04:04.549> so<00:04:05.549> I<00:04:05.579> can<00:04:05.790> probably<00:04:06.090> practice<00:04:06.420> on<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.690> but

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
and so I can probably practice on it but

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.270 
and so I can probably practice on it but
it<00:04:07.200> would<00:04:07.319> be<00:04:07.350> really<00:04:07.530> bad<00:04:07.709> because<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.160> would

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
it would be really bad because it would

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.680 
it would be really bad because it would
just<00:04:08.400> be<00:04:08.579> completely<00:04:08.730> counterproductive<00:04:09.299> and

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
just be completely counterproductive and

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.539 
just be completely counterproductive and
plus<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.959> won't<00:04:10.139> have<00:04:10.230> my<00:04:10.260> body<00:04:10.470> ready<00:04:10.829> to

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.520 
plus I won't have my body ready to
compete<00:04:12.000> at<00:04:12.150> Worlds<00:04:12.480> I'm<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:12.989> compete<00:04:13.319> once
