00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.339
 today is how these measures to the channel and they 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.830
 I bring the looks that they asked me in the 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.890
 last video that I made this is about 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.740
 that I would stay as close as possible 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.890
 and good if you want to know how is this 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.720
 body 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.600
 ok girls we're going to start first 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.380
 what he did was use a pre-base that 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.789
 I used 20 repairing pot of mac 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.140
 and now he can not do is he's going to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.580
 use a combination of these two 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.010
 shades 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.099
 then to use this theme that 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.300
 Sunflower flame in the other duel as it is 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.400
 the shield to use these men that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.400
 let's be campaign and we will mix 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.350
 Now what are we going to do is illuminate the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.960
 bone of the segego use these man 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.030
 I slept also called cream number 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.650
 31 what you are going to do is take it as a 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.240
 skewers and thick to apply the 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.660
 shade and we're going to apply it on the bone 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.660
 of the eyebrows 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.900
 Now what are we going to use? 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.729
 a black pencil eyeliner and I'm going to 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.049
 use this which is the line of 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.600
 and I'm going to use this one because it 's pretty 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.700
 creamy but I do not recommend using 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.100
 this on the water line because I 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.990
 I feel that it runs very fast but this 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.640
 I have the manolite and I go back to 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.740
 remove me they want where then the 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.509
 important then I will use this 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.509
 what is called scott eyeliner 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.800
 what we are going to do is that we are going to 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.630
 draw a line between the first fold 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.870
 of the eye we are going to do as a small 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.870
 see external and the first fold of the eye 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.030
 and on the inside of the magnet for 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.450
 trace is also the first sheet the 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.450
 umbrella 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.640
 Now what we are going to do is use 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.530
 a flat brush for shadows and 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.569
 let's blur a bit that linear 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.569
 black and we apply in the model 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.860
 the next step will be to use a 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.360
 small brush to blur and I'll 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.970
 use the same shadow they use 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.930
 eyebrows that also that to me and it's 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.280
 this tone for clear eyebrows 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.050
 then taking this color what is going to 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.820
 do is look a little of it left me the 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.150
 black commented not that we apply in the 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.150
 basin 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.810
 now with the best 8 with which 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.780
 we blur the black eyeliner I'll 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.680
 use in the same astromelia duo or 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.109
 use this color called tobacco 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.170
 and you eat it after remarking about where 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:09.160
 I put 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.160
 black eyeliner 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.099
 Now what we 're going to do is we're going 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.870
 to use our black eyeliner other 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.670
 time I for this step I recommend them 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.470
 use another eyeliner that does not run 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.640
 as much as this one but right now 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.260
 got none then I'm going to 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.780
 use this but you know they have 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.810
 than to use one that has more duration 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.409
 or that is pro of water but an oral like 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.520
 of ceres that in the corner what I'm going 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.120
 do you like 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.240
 from linear 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.600
 just the tip 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.920
 about the shadow that we already had applied 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.920
 just like the center 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.560
 and with the same eyeliner what we 're going to 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.790
 do is we're going to light the line 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.319
 of water by 12 up 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.090
 now let's use a type brush 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.760
 down with the same shadow tobacco 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.750
 balmis and let's blur the part of 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.750
 down lines eyelashes 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.650
 first let's take a shadow on 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.780
 this cream was revealed and I'm going to take this 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.949
 which is like bronze if it does not have 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.810
 to be real in because I know that this 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.940

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.820

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.470
