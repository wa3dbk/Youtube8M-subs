00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.300
 Welcome to cakes recipe today 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.370
 we have a new recipe we are going to make 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.820
 liquid candy that is what I am 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.840
 showing now it's candy that is the 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.620
 same that is bought in the supermarket 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.640
 that comes in the container to add to 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.380
 Desserts and ice cream and others 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.260
 super rich super easy to make has 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.140
 there is a small complication but let's go 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.970
 to clarify everything later here 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.490
 we have the ingredients that good that 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.800
 they're going to go to the link that I'm going to leave in the 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:39.679
 website but it's easy it's a part of 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.219
 water and two sugar yes yes that matters 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:45.979
 the utensil that uses a cup the 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.520
 half of water once of sugar there with 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:51.350
 this is going to be able to make this candy 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.750
 so let's start or not be 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.290
 first a dry caramel that I have already 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:01.610
 showed how it is always done 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.790
 put in the pot or the pan or what 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.850
 have to do it 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.130
 a little bit of sugar, we're just going to 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.200
 wait for it to melt because the sugar 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.630
 melts are crystals that melt 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.840
 as if they were metal is a foundry of 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.390
 metal is the same the soca then the 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.420
 sugar action to start melting and 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.210
 We are going to form a dry caramel if it is 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.430
 without water it will not be from syrup 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.700
 because there are two ways to make them one with 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.330
 syrup and another is like that dry and second 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.280
 We are going to boil water, which is what 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.640
 that we are going to use to make it liquid 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.890
 candy and I'm going to do it in this 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.390
 pan needs to have mango because 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.950
 they will see that later when I add 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.540
 let's make the candy we're going to 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.300
 add boiled water 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.520
 and it is imperative that you have this handle 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.530
 so that the hand is far away like this 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.340
 we add the water and not because it's going to 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.869
 splash is apt to be like that 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.890
 and it is little dangerous it is so yes or yes 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:12.000
 make it add water from far 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.780
 I can if you have a pot with 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.239
 longer handle still you are for 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.210
 add the water to the candy so that it 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.740
 make liquid well 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.130
 well let's continue doing the 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.770
 candy like I have already shown they are going to 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.710
 see a poster that will take you to 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.350
 I already made candy but good 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.660
 I'm showing back how it's done to 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.150
 measure that sugar is going to 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.850
 melting we're going to be adding from to 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.490
 little bit more beauty the way it is 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.530
 it's a candy and it does not burn when 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.840
 started already 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.980
 there is a melting down because there was a 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.650
 I'm going to light the water 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.890
 dependent on water and the stove where 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.520
 is the water to boil the water 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.130
 you have to boil yes and how is this little 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.600
 amount that I did here that's why I put it 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.600
 there but if you want to put it from the 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.270
 principle all good 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.120
 to a greater amount of water that you add 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.030
 to sugar more liquid caramel then 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.620
 you can add the amount that 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.110
 just want to be more 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.620
 liquid or less so let's go to 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.380
 keep adding the sugar so 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.050
 finish making this candy 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.230
 always on the edges because it's the 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.110
 first part where it melts and how it is 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.870
 a candy that is split only from 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.700
 sugar can be as it is so well what 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.190
 what am I doing can you move with 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.930
 a wooden spatula obviously because 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.930
 any other burns 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.989
 they can move and they can stir it 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.410
 like the strips in the face if you want it 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.750
 to make from a syrup is to say 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.630
 water and sugar this is never done because 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.690
 if they get to move the candy when 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.450
 water and sugar match what happens 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.940
 is that it crystallizes because there are 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.980
 two means to be the sugar and is the 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.750
 water and changes the physics of the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.220
 preparation that is super fun 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.950
 talk about civics when you want to be 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.370
 making a recipe with the one who does not 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.290
 wants 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.520
 you do not want to know about chemistry and physics 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:32.030
 when everyone wants all the 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.030
 world 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:44.460
 of sugar can only be done well with 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.290
 the with the spatula to move and if not already 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.410
 We have ready is give it to me I turned off 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.479
 now the fire because as it is 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.639
 this pan these pots have triple 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.350
 fund continues cooking in the case of 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.699
 you have the common ones do not turn it off 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.190
 until you finish doing well the 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.500
 liquid candy here we have the water that 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.930
 is already boiled has to be here 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.330
 boiled well that candy up to 190 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.250
 degrees and the water is doing but they are 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.889
 almost 100 degrees difference between one 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.880
 and another and here to do not listen 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.310
 but they do 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.100
 so the farther away they are at hand 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.850
 I insist better is going to be this is 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:24.220
 obviously obviously I do not advise it 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.860
 so that no child can do it 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.540
 teenagers and pre-teens 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.900
 teenager no one if someone who is 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.720
 large that is next to the kitchen or 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.810
 but looking towards the children because this 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.490
 it's quite dangerous there if they have 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.580
 fear good what they have left to go to 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.010
 buy on markets the product 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.250
 determined but as you can see is re easy it is 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.440
 live two minutes that you are very very 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.940
 fast very easy and here to good what 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.110
 I'm going to a this one 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.110
 to this bowl 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.699
 nice and good and it was ready there was 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.729
 still hot from the candy and then 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:08.789
 it is left to cool it lasts approximately 15 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:12.569
 days capped in refrigerator good to have it and 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:15.869
 it remains if you see that consistency of liquid 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:17.639
 that's how it is and I'm going to put the 

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:21.310
 finger to see that it is already 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:23.950
 room temperature and nothing remains 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.600
 so good it is so liquid you the 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.090
 this candy 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.070
 and it is used for plans for 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.050
 bases of the plans are used for the 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.700
 decorations of all the desserts is the 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:39.980
 typical candy that comes in the 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:41.780
 little bottle that was decorated I hope that you 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.580
 have liked the recipe as always 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.030
 I invite you to my website recipe 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.220
