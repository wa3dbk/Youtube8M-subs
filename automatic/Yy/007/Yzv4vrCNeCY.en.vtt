00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.410
 yum cookers 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.900
 very good to everyone today I bring you another 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.200
 chicken chicken recipe to climb and 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.869
 is going to get on the uvis this and 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.849
 you know my accents and my languages are not 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.920
 very good the line that takes me out of the 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.079
 manga with things I had at home 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.410
 a long time ago and the truth that was left 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:36.809
 very good so let's start with the 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:39.970
 simple let's cut the stems of 8 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.600
 Green asparagus is worth a little bit of 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.550
 oil in a pan we are going to saute them 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.070
 that are a little crispy and a 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.910
 little bit so good as you are seeing in 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.969
 the images 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.269
 There is no great secret without cleaning it 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:59.350
 skip the pan we will add four 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.910
 slices of ham but a ham 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.160
 decent 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.140
 We will pass them through the pan if you 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.200
 be a little bit we add again 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.950
 oil without cleaning the pan and let's 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.840
 mark four boneless chicken thighs 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.290
 mark I want that that means that 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.540
 nothing we are going to 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.580
 toast a little on the outside but without 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.380
 come to do inside then 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.780
 We put it in a container suitable for 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.600
 oven as you are seeing here we put 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.740
 the slices of ham on top 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.870
 well-distributed asparagus and cheese 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.070
 grated and in this case chosen the typical 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.270
 sachet that comes in four cheeses 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.010
 different 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.550
 now let's prepare the uvis I've 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.410
 prepared with the thermomix ale 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.930
 cut an onion a leek and two 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.690
 garlic cloves let's say you would have 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.390
 a bechamel with these ingredients in 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.070
 this light case since the uvis carries 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.600
 also milk cream but I in this 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.850
 case you have not added milk cream 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.710

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.560

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.780
 over here so you have access 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.700
 it's just that bechamel before 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.850
 make the bechamel to make the sofrito with 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.890
 the onion and the leek and the garlic and in 4d 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.270
 that is all poached to make the bechamel 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.580
 we cover everything above we go back to 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.000
 toss grated cheese again 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.130
 and if you want is a very good option and 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.340
 add pieces of blue cheese or 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.980
 roquefort we put it in the oven with the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.349

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:38.069
 about 10 minutes and then with the green 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.670
 It is worth to make the chicken and 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.090
