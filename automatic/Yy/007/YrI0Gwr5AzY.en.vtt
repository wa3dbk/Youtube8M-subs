 good guys attending the request of 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.560
 some of you I will create this 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.560
 video in which I will explain how 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.000
 install apk files in bluestacks if 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.650
 someone does not know what blue stacks is 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.270
 clarified that it is a program that 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.090
 allows to run the operating system 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.260
 Android on a desktop 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.449
 being able in this mode to execute 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.400
 applications and android games in 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.600
 monitors infinitely larger than 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.059
 the typical screens of the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.100
 mobile devices if you want to know 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.140
 more about bluestacks you can visit the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.470
 previous video of which you have the link 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.600
 down here well let's start there are 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.019
 three different ways to install 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.290
 sapica files bluestacks each and every 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.239
 one of them very simple well we 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.729
 we come to bluestacks as you see I have 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.409
 here open in window mode and here 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.500
 I have a folder with several files 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:05.019
 apk that as you can see if we have made a 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.270
 correct installation of bluestacks we 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.220
 must appear with the logo of 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.950
 bluestacks if we click on any of 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.659
 they see what he tells us is a 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.929
 bluestacks file 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.359
 cage file or what bluestacks already what 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:22.020
 recognizes as a file itself 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:26.429
 ok let's double click on 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.429
 on the pk where is my water 2 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.710
 and as you see the apk begins to install 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.960
 directly employment stacks well so we 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.430
 we come to the bluestacks desk and 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.620
 let's see if it is installed 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.970
 correctly it should be in the 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.970
 where is my water 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.250
 well here we have it is like water 2 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.030
 let's press it 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.030
 here 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.480
 and as you can see the videogame has installed 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.480
 correctly 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.860
 okay now let's see the second way 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.990
 that we have to install freckles in 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.490
 our bluestacks imagine that what 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.100
 you want to do is download directly 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.110
 from the web browser to your 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.800
 bluestacks well let's see how 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.120
 download and how to install those sticking 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.770
 As you can see I have installed several 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.830
 web browsers among them I have 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.680
 firefox I have google chrome I have opera 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.270
 however these give me some 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.760
 compatibility problems with the 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.190
 emulator bluestacks so my installed 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.080
 nanning and navigator that you can 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.460
 find perfectly looking for it here 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.960
 in applications 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.319
 this browser has not given me any 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.560
 problem 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.719
 we will also need to install the manager 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.150
 of astro files that would be the 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.980
 equivalent to the windows explorer 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.650
 in windows that we will use it for 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.359
 find the apk that we are going to download 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.090
 within our operating system 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.579
 bluestacks android I'm going to 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.700
 start let's go to the browser and in the 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:16.519
 browser you could go into google and 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.310
 look for free freckles but I 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:22.450
 directly I'm going to dropbox and 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.150
 that I have a pk saved there 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.140
 simply clicked to download foam 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.510
 from moxi apply 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:36.920
 and the download starts on the desktop 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.549
 here as you see is put boxing 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.549
 it is downloading 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.220
 well once we have downloaded by 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.720
 one in box and apk we have to see in 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.790
 where it has been saved to be able 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.200
 install it good here we see that 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.240
 directly tells us to complete the 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.160
 action through the installation program 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.990
 of package but well still we are going to 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.130
 see where it was saved before 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.710
 install it 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.260
 and we're going to come to the manager 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.540
 astro files and as you see here we 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.580
 appear different folders that are the 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.070
 folders that our system has created 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.540
 operative android bluestacks here 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.910
 below we also see that you can 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.489
 synchronize with box google drive dropbox 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.010
 facebook sky drive as you can see astro is a 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.050
 file manager very very very powerful and 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.570
 maybe in some video later on you 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.810
 teach how to fully exploit all 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.920
 virtues of this file manager well 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.780
 but as now simply what 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.420
 we want to do is look for where we have been 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.720
 downloaded our apk as we come 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.550
 to sd card and in the downloads folder 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.530
 we press and see that we have it 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.660
 downloaded here is boxing fighting there 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.580
 several because during the recording of 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.740
 this tutorial I had to repeat 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.510
 several actions several times yes and good 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.130
 we have downloaded several well 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.990
 we click on one and we turn to 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.610
 open the installation package will 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.890
 we give the program package installation 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.400
 you want to install the application because it's going to 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.639
 be yes 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.100
 we installed it finalized and now we 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:10.120
 we come to the desk and we're going to look 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.770
 spoon box and here we have it with a 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.009
 chocolate that someone bring me a piece 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.009
 of paper 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.380
 expose box and well I'm going to 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.380
 select is public 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.520
 to 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.020
 Market Stall 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.470
 and well that's it, we've already seen two 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.540
 ways we have to install freckles 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.190
 in our bluestacks we could see a 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.990
 third but then you will know the same 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.550
 that I therefore here we are going to leave 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.590
 If you liked the video do not forget 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.540
 press the little hand up to help us 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.730
 keep growing without anything else we'll see 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.090
 in future videos a greeting until the 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.090
 next
