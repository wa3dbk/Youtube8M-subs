00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.300
 Hello everyone 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.890
 Compuware 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.159
 I would like to elucidate what has come into play 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:11.509
 I am translated as a translator at U.S. 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.439
 A little 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.439
 Now it's in the middle of the day but I announced the nuclear power plant 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.289
 Will be alive 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.460
 The aim is 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.150
 It is the last moment 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.130
 I don't like that 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.130
 I don't want to kill you 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.600
 I'm Seoul Master 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.810
 I also want a mac version 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.810
 It is a patch because it is all 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.070
 The fishing ground is strong, isn't it? 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.940
 You can expect a little bit of ecs brake and it's amazing 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.110
 But how is it 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.110
 ono 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.630
 That's a cleaner meaning 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.630
 Which one was popular 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.360
 It is safe because the oil price has risen 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.540
 I think it would be cool if it is sold 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.170
 This time I opened it but it is different 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.930
 To 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.930
 I would like to make a minor contract this time 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.100
 On the other hand, Shapa can not say 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 The antennas are looking at them by themselves 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.450
 It looks beautiful that the former Japan was bad 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.280
 It is good for people 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.100
 I do not know 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.100
 I have a lawmaker 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.100
 Ultra 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.730
 Horses were popular and perfect, though 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.260
 It is called the capital Trigonia 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
 It is a tough place 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.630
 A genius with 4 packs left 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.809
 The heart of the sun is not included for 6 days 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.839
 Because I feel twice as overwhelmed 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:19.979
 Accredited to be a little 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:23.969
 It's only natural if that hit 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.739
 I can not do it 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.379
 This pack is 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.409
 While interacting with the player breakthrough 10,000 cards 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.959
 Conspiracy cookware sister river blurry I think individuals were good 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.409
 Splash 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.249
 Illness 3 too 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.249
 Immigration ship to the location and hall 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.579

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.579
 See you again 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.399
 There was movement over the mountain- 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.729
 I think it is attack of the Chuokai 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.659
 In reversal of the school 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.099
 Younger brother 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.219
 If you see health guidance 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:17.219
 Please pray for me please 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.379

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.069
 Saitama 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.069
 I wonder if you write as you are 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.709
 I'm thinking of new storage this time 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:47.379
 I secure a frame in the inside and do my best well 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.379
 Funakoshi Miki 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:56.139
 Thank you for watching this time 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.709
 Isn't it wrong to open the rice next? 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.099
