00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
when I was growing up and they used to

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.500 
when I was growing up and they used to
have<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> Eagle<00:00:31.679> Claw<00:00:32.120> hooks<00:00:33.120> everything

packet have had for years I never really

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.700 
packet have had for years I never really
liked<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.260> thought<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
liked them I thought that the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.860 
liked them I thought that the
craftsmanship<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.690> wasn't<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
craftsmanship on them wasn't the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.240 
craftsmanship on them wasn't the
greatest<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.530> was<00:00:40.620> probably<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:41.100> good

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
greatest and it was probably just good

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.420 
greatest and it was probably just good
for<00:00:41.489> catching<00:00:41.640> bream<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> pond<00:00:43.250> but<00:00:44.250> now

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
for catching bream in a pond but now

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.670 
for catching bream in a pond but now
since<00:00:44.489> Ivo<00:00:45.180> got<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.510> little<00:00:45.750> bit<00:00:45.840> more<00:00:46.020> educated

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680
