00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 there are solutions friend indicator is with great 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.679
 satisfaction that we are presenting 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.360
 through this video 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:19.080
 the course of the head the time that we 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.109
 we had the great expectation there 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.390
 developing this last year by its 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.630
 actions of some friends and friends. 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.269
 requests from associations coming 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.820
 Now the completion of all training 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.610
 on-going practical and theoretical training 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.100
 with your head having a very 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.390
 discussed head not one for sure 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.730
 within the process of grinding 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.360
 the product that generates the most 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.890
 results and also creates difficulties in 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 the process of building the engine that we 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.360
 now we can close the process and 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.430
 will be applied the first class of the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.879
 action of this video so that we 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.129
 we can convey to you and 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:09.630
 identifier entrepreneur owner 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.390
 that typifies what we are not 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.270
 by applying to his official his 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.330
 manager or the person you trust 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.040
 will be created with this training that 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.680
 different from other trainings 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.409
 standardization and training 1 and close 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.979
 with the theoretical test and a practical test 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.590
 to which the person must return to 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.170
 within the company with the certificate of 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.630
 that she actually operated the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.540
 that she really got to learn 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.400
 what was put and not so 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.920
 only with those of the other trainings 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.049
 with training management training 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.810
 of process paths 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.180
 so I would like to explain 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.009
 quickly what is the content that will 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.659
 be applied in this course so that you 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.549
 can easily identify the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.420
 right person 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.770
 for me it's taking course first 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.700
 we'll work on technology 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.509
 materials 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.870
 Ok, so dodo, the leaf here. 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.750
 technology 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.630
 and if inside the aluminum iron, and everything 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.640
 which is composed of the head after the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.310
 keep the team's critical points 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.490
 action of the head critics think we 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.030
 we have such as for example full with 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:27.090
 a head that works with ceramics 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.070
 or works with sugar cane is 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.660
 as do dozens of other processes 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.880
 who have difficulty now works 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.080
 get the vote anyway everything will be 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.940
 treated in training 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.670
 then we want to give as the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.500
 practical application fault diagnosis 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.260
 the diagnosis of which was lucky this 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.700
 test trinca internamiento rules that 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.030
 need to use a network need 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.130
 training and displacement test 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.320
 measures both the lower face one 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.470
 superior as alignment with city 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.660
 informing them that they have no operations 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.320
 machining all operations 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.720
 is in practice and in what says the 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.880
 fixation of the head a full organs 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.700
 central banks of a single headquarters provider 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.190
 High machining rotation or 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.440
 pilot all that now the machining of 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.989
 head in all scopes because it has 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.630
 indicators that suddenly appear in the 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.730
 your company you have a milling machine of 7 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.580
 one brand a plant of another brand 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.340
 and a mark back from another mark 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.260
 and each has its adjustment form 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.100
 the form of the connection of the 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.410
 equipment 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.680
 so the goal is to only get to 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.980
 this end of work to perfection the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.760
 Customer ends up paying us later. 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.480
 have to be power warranty 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.580
 motor 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.370
 regarding head will not all 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.630
 subjects that imply the power of the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.410
 engine in motorcycle test by executions 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:58.530
 during the collective of the head 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:01.320
 then we will have adjustment of the machines 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.100
 the details for each 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.080
 margin 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.610
 If you send your message by hand 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.370
 for us too 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.680
 the brands you have are her brand 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.870
 especially her picture we can 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.519
 during training adjust and give 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.180
 Examples not be in the park 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.889
 machines 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.350
 this course is applied within the grinding 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.330
 gold standardize at our open time a 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.940
 large collection of machines and we are 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.949
 also placing a further six machines 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.210
 of head so that we have a 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.889
 diversity too large 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.220
 machines in manual operation for those who 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.870
 The head operates normally but is 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.610
 important to bring your machine 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.290
 suddenly has a detail not only by itself 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.740
 training to train your child. 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.389
 person and then devices 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.610
 high machining procedures 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.070
 how to apply some operations 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.289
 in high rotation like this one said to be by 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.410
 a series of situations and finally a 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.030
 proof that will really give the validity 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.830
 the understanding that this person sees 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.160
 to return to your company the investment 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.139
 in vain do not choose the right person she 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.330
 passing a test and the trend is that 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.300
 it actually passes the test comes in 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.199
 the front company that was spent to 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.389
 develop 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:13.060
 would like to leave the position of our 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.310
 site 14 point with br 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.960
 ours and mail are coming back fucking and 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.729
 any questions through the site do not 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.669
 You can obtain the 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.110
 very careful training filling 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.280
 with our chat with any 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.680
 doubt it 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.130
 we are available thank one 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.130
 hug
