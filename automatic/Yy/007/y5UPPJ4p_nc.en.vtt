00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.930 
in Brazil and do you feel that soccer
has<00:05:36.590> the<00:05:37.590> stature<00:05:37.830> of<00:05:38.010> it<00:05:38.160> has<00:05:38.280> gained<00:05:38.550> since

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
has the stature of it has gained since

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.520 
has the stature of it has gained since
then<00:05:39.210> in<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.390> last<00:05:39.570> 40<00:05:39.900> years<00:05:39.930> or<00:05:40.200> so

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
then in the last 40 years or so

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.740 
then in the last 40 years or so
um<00:05:40.770> I<00:05:41.190> think<00:05:41.580> definitely<00:05:41.850> in<00:05:42.150> the<00:05:42.240> last<00:05:42.450> 10

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
um I think definitely in the last 10

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.240 
um I think definitely in the last 10
years<00:05:42.780> because<00:05:43.200> I<00:05:43.350> think<00:05:43.410> the<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:44.070> league

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
years because I think the the league

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.770 
years because I think the the league
back<00:05:44.520> then<00:05:44.730> you<00:05:44.940> know<00:05:45.060> it<00:05:45.210> was<00:05:45.300> great<00:05:45.480> there

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
back then you know it was great there

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.690 
back then you know it was great there
was<00:05:45.870> one<00:05:46.050> team<00:05:46.350> with<00:05:46.560> all<00:05:46.710> these<00:05:46.860> stars<00:05:47.160> in<00:05:47.490> you

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
was one team with all these stars in you

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.080 
was one team with all these stars in you
know<00:05:47.820> like<00:05:48.060> Pele<00:05:48.390> and<00:05:48.510> players<00:05:49.230> like<00:05:49.320> that<00:05:49.650> and

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
know like Pele and players like that and

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.880 
know like Pele and players like that and
but<00:05:51.090> I<00:05:51.300> think<00:05:51.510> now<00:05:51.720> the<00:05:52.230> league<00:05:52.440> is<00:05:52.680> more

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
but I think now the league is more

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.980 
but I think now the league is more
stable<00:05:53.400> you<00:05:53.670> know<00:05:53.790> the<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.390> game<00:05:54.600> is<00:05:54.780> more

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
stable you know the the game is more

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.200 
stable you know the the game is more
stable<00:05:55.500> and<00:05:55.620> it's<00:05:56.160> not<00:05:56.430> as<00:05:56.550> popular<00:05:57.000> as

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
stable and it's not as popular as

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.930 
stable and it's not as popular as
obviously<00:05:57.750> many<00:05:58.440> other<00:05:58.620> sports<00:05:58.860> in<00:05:59.160> in<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.670> US

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
obviously many other sports in in the US

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.970
