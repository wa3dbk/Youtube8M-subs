00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.999
 hello we will introduce you today 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.800
 the new software version of the coyote 

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:10.570
 so we will start by installing the 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.810
 produced on its loving support and one 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.810
 alight 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.930
 we see here message to the security that 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.250
 appears as every startup so 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.770
 then the product will look for the 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.400
 real-time information as well as 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.400
 gps information 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.430
 so here we see that the 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.980
 gps information is real time are 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.989
 necessarily displayed we do not roll so 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.030
 the vehicle is currently 0 km 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.530
 time and we are on a car park so we 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.620
 does not have any cadors for the moment around 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.300
 of self and another novelty the 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.909
 reappearance of trusted stars 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.409
 trust Monday users for the 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.839
 to consult is very simple we go in 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.309
 the english menu but a fake and then 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.780
 one sees its index 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.670
 trust in second line 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.440
 we see here that the user at a 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.699
 star currently on three we see 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.900
 here on the rolling screen all of 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.150
 news 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.730
 we see the current speed of the vehicle 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.030
 we see the speed limit the road on 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.530
 which one rolls so the a86 here we see 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.690
 that we currently have in forecast mode 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.670
 we have a vision on 30 km of events 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.930
 that can happen on the part 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.920
 right of the screen and on the part 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.660
 left we find all 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.640
 coyote information as well as the 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.190
 speed limit the type of road 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.960
 so the a13 names we have the speed 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.840
 of the vehicle we are currently driving at 85 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.790
 km hour if we want to return to mode 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.930
 rolling standard just drag the 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.710
 finger like these to the right 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.880
 if we want to go to the mode 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.540
 predictions just slide your finger 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.950
 to the left like this 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.290
 we can at any time declare an area to 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.750
 risk in our direction by pressing 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:51.130
 this button 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.280
 So here we have it nil or in the sense 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.280
 opposite 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.710
 So here there is no one in 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.229
 attention danger zone on 2 km 1 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.740
 limited to 70 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.330
 km hour 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.150
 so here we see the double alert that 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.340
 so a warning plugs in 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.600
 level 2 during this zone alert 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.020
 danger that is currently present 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.240
 to be able to access this double 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.620
 alert just press the tab 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.750
 that's it and so we actually see 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.550
 this secondary alert appear in 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.680
 full screen slowdown it can 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.850
 of course return to the alert 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.890
 main the first alert zone of 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.130
 danger by pressing directly on 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.130
 tab 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.390
 watch this 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.580
 we enter here in a risk zone or 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.650
 with a length of 500 meters since 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.960
 is agglomeration risk areas 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.970
 has already been confirmed 15 times as it is 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.420
 see here and there behind confirmation 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.560
 back to four minutes now 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.310
 confirm alerts 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.310
 Yes 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.970
 thanks to voice recognition 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.180
 we enter here into a disturbance that 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.410
 so is a narrowed pavement 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.030
 probably related to work that has 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.710
 already been confirmed so by nineteen 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.340
 people and the last confirmation 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.600
 goes back to a minute we see 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.380
 actually here we have a 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.380
 shrinkage of pavements 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.260
 and at the end of the letter confirms the 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.260
 presence of the nerthe 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.299
 we see here that we arrive in a cork 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.010
 so the product goes into stopper mode 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.519
 we have different information that 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.010
 appears 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.639
 we have the duration until the end of the cap 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.900
 and the distance to the end of the cork 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.310
 so is the progress bar that is going 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.700
 follow all the progress to the 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.700
 end of Game 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.480
 we also see that the limitation of 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.669
 speed has changed since the panel one 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.599
 has risen to 70 on the insertion path to 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:15.069
 110 on the highway still two 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.859
 minutes to go until the end of 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.820
 cap and about 500 meters we see 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.889
 that actually it starts to 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.599
 clear and that's when come in mode 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.990
 classic rolling because the cork is 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.990
 completed
