00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.020 
see what happened in my case well we
have<00:01:54.469> the<00:01:54.619> Roku<00:01:54.979> stick<00:01:55.189> and<00:01:55.369> an<00:01:55.429> HDMI<00:01:55.789> port

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
have the Roku stick and an HDMI port

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.109 
have the Roku stick and an HDMI port
right<00:01:56.450> up<00:01:56.600> here<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.049> as<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:57.710> can<00:01:57.829> see<00:01:58.119> it's

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
right up here and as you can see it's

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.289 
right up here and as you can see it's
raised<00:02:00.159> because<00:02:01.159> it<00:02:01.280> doesn't<00:02:01.609> fit<00:02:01.789> perfectly

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
raised because it doesn't fit perfectly

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.230 
raised because it doesn't fit perfectly
into<00:02:03.109> this<00:02:03.289> space<00:02:03.679> that<00:02:03.709> they<00:02:04.609> gave<00:02:04.850> me<00:02:04.999> on<00:02:05.090> my

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
into this space that they gave me on my

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.130 
into this space that they gave me on my
TV<00:02:05.840> for<00:02:06.139> the<00:02:06.380> HDMI<00:02:06.920> port<00:02:06.999> luckily<00:02:07.999> it<00:02:08.240> does<00:02:08.840> fit

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
TV for the HDMI port luckily it does fit

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.910 
TV for the HDMI port luckily it does fit
but<00:02:09.709> it<00:02:09.950> stresses<00:02:10.399> out<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.850> port<00:02:11.120> here<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.990> as

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
but it stresses out the port here and as

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.890 
but it stresses out the port here and as
you<00:02:13.040> can<00:02:13.160> see<00:02:13.340> it's<00:02:13.490> raised<00:02:13.790> from<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.540> back<00:02:14.750> of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
you can see it's raised from the back of

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.380 
you can see it's raised from the back of
the<00:02:14.990> TV<00:02:15.170> it's<00:02:15.500> not<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:16.250> know<00:02:16.370> directly<00:02:17.240> in

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
the TV it's not you know directly in

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.300 
the TV it's not you know directly in
it's<00:02:17.630> actually<00:02:17.990> a<00:02:18.020> tan

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
it's actually a tan

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.040 
it's actually a tan
angle<00:02:18.610> into<00:02:18.849> that<00:02:19.000> port<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:19.510> it's<00:02:19.660> stressing

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
angle into that port so it's stressing

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.510 
angle into that port so it's stressing
the<00:02:20.140> port<00:02:20.380> on<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.709> motherboard<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.370> the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
the port on the motherboard of the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.190 
the port on the motherboard of the
television<00:02:21.819> stressing<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.630> port<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:23.050> the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
television stressing the port on the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.650 
television stressing the port on the
Roku<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:24.250> actually<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.730> also<00:02:25.030> stressing<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
Roku it actually is also stressing the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.080 
Roku it actually is also stressing the
port<00:02:25.959> on<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.349> power<00:02:26.590> connector<00:02:27.010> here<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.580> the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
port on the power connector here and the

port on the power connector here and the
cable<00:02:28.450> at<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.720> end<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.500> all<00:02:29.739> around<00:02:30.069> bad<00:02:30.940> this

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
cable at the end so all around bad this

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.300 
cable at the end so all around bad this
is<00:02:31.840> something<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.319> wanted<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.739> fix<00:02:33.010> and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
is something that I wanted to fix and

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.390 
is something that I wanted to fix and
when<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.670> saw<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:34.709> Roku<00:02:35.709> was<00:02:35.890> giving<00:02:36.160> away<00:02:36.370> a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
when I saw that Roku was giving away a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.850 
when I saw that Roku was giving away a
free<00:02:36.670> HDMI<00:02:37.360> extension<00:02:37.720> cable<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.319> understood

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
free HDMI extension cable I understood

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.470 
free HDMI extension cable I understood
why<00:02:39.099> because<00:02:39.550> I<00:02:39.580> was<00:02:39.790> having<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.180> problem

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
why because I was having this problem

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.780 
why because I was having this problem
and<00:02:40.840> here's<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.260> damage<00:02:41.620> cost<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.160> my<00:02:42.310> case<00:02:42.580> as

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
and here's the damage cost of my case as

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.420 
and here's the damage cost of my case as
you<00:02:42.910> can<00:02:43.090> see<00:02:43.269> I<00:02:43.450> have<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.989> Roku<00:02:44.200> stick<00:02:44.440> with

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
you can see I have the Roku stick with

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.750 
you can see I have the Roku stick with
the<00:02:46.050> HDMI<00:02:47.050> connector<00:02:47.650> on<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.099> it's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
the HDMI connector on it and it's

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.070 
the HDMI connector on it and it's
supposed<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.239> be<00:02:49.360> coming<00:02:49.630> straight<00:02:49.870> out<00:02:49.930> of

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
supposed to be coming straight out of

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.660 
supposed to be coming straight out of
the<00:02:50.200> Roku<00:02:50.560> stick<00:02:50.769> it's<00:02:50.950> not<00:02:51.100> supposed<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.459> have

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
the Roku stick it's not supposed to have

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.300 
the Roku stick it's not supposed to have
an<00:02:51.790> upward<00:02:52.239> angle<00:02:52.660> as<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.170> does<00:02:53.350> here<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.830> was

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
an upward angle as it does here I was

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.880 
an upward angle as it does here I was
able<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.670> gently<00:02:55.330> bend<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.840> back<00:02:56.080> but<00:02:56.380> I<00:02:56.410> really

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
able to gently bend it back but I really

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.979 
able to gently bend it back but I really
didn't<00:02:57.130> feel<00:02:57.250> good<00:02:57.549> doing<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:58.060> because<00:02:58.450> the

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
didn't feel good doing that because the

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.720 
didn't feel good doing that because the
more<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.290> bend<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.650> connector<00:03:00.100> or<00:03:00.250> any<00:03:00.400> part

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
more you bend the connector or any part

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.970 
more you bend the connector or any part
of<00:03:00.819> an<00:03:00.910> electronic<00:03:01.480> component<00:03:02.200> more<00:03:02.620> likely

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
of an electronic component more likely

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.410 
of an electronic component more likely
it<00:03:03.069> is<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.400> snap<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.940> is<00:03:04.090> after<00:03:04.480> all<00:03:04.510> metal<00:03:06.420> so

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
it is to snap it is after all metal so

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.300 
it is to snap it is after all metal so
here's<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.900> solution<00:03:08.410> after<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.799> got<00:03:09.099> the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
here's the solution after I got the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.949 
here's the solution after I got the
extension<00:03:09.640> cable<00:03:09.910> installed<00:03:10.450> well<00:03:10.720> as<00:03:10.840> you

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
extension cable installed well as you

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.509 
extension cable installed well as you
can<00:03:11.049> see<00:03:11.110> there's<00:03:11.470> no<00:03:11.620> longer<00:03:12.010> any<00:03:12.130> stress

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
can see there's no longer any stress

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.770 
can see there's no longer any stress
here<00:03:12.730> because<00:03:12.910> that<00:03:13.060> connectors<00:03:13.540> going

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
here because that connectors going

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.690 
here because that connectors going
straight<00:03:14.140> into<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.470> motherboard<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:15.130> the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
straight into the motherboard and the

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.309 
straight into the motherboard and the
connector<00:03:16.150> is<00:03:16.269> not<00:03:16.450> being<00:03:16.690> stressed<00:03:16.959> at<00:03:17.140> all

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
connector is not being stressed at all

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.800 
connector is not being stressed at all
in<00:03:17.530> any<00:03:17.680> way<00:03:17.769> then<00:03:18.549> of<00:03:18.849> course<00:03:19.090> it's<00:03:19.299> flexible

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
in any way then of course it's flexible

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.809 
in any way then of course it's flexible
so<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:20.019> bends<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.590> here<00:03:21.220> we<00:03:21.340> have<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.640> Roku

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
so it bends and here we have the Roku

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.720 
so it bends and here we have the Roku
going<00:03:22.299> straight<00:03:22.780> into<00:03:22.959> that<00:03:23.489> without<00:03:24.489> any

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
going straight into that without any

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.729 
going straight into that without any
stress<00:03:25.150> on<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.450> connector<00:03:25.840> at<00:03:25.959> all<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.410> will

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
stress on the connector at all it will

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.069 
stress on the connector at all it will
not<00:03:26.980> Bend<00:03:27.250> there<00:03:27.459> again<00:03:27.820> unless<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.600> apply<00:03:28.870> some

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
not Bend there again unless I apply some

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.720 
not Bend there again unless I apply some
sort<00:03:29.230> of<00:03:29.380> pressure<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.859> it<00:03:29.980> but<00:03:30.130> you<00:03:30.609> know

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
sort of pressure to it but you know

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.430 
sort of pressure to it but you know
what's<00:03:31.269> being<00:03:31.480> applied<00:03:31.810> there<00:03:32.079> it's<00:03:32.230> perfect

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
what's being applied there it's perfect

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.729 
what's being applied there it's perfect
so<00:03:32.829> in<00:03:33.130> my<00:03:33.459> case<00:03:33.700> this<00:03:34.000> takes<00:03:34.750> all<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.350> tension

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
so in my case this takes all the tension

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.590 
so in my case this takes all the tension
off<00:03:35.859> that<00:03:36.100> port<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.670> actually<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.480> know

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
off that port and actually you know

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.150 
off that port and actually you know
makes<00:03:37.840> me<00:03:37.989> feel<00:03:38.140> better<00:03:38.380> about<00:03:38.530> it<00:03:38.680> not<00:03:38.950> being

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
makes me feel better about it not being

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160 
makes me feel better about it not being
bent<00:03:39.489> again<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.000> again<00:03:40.660> on<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.930> power

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
bent again and again on the power

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.170 
bent again and again on the power
connector<00:03:41.560> there's<00:03:42.130> no<00:03:42.310> stress<00:03:42.670> on<00:03:42.819> it<00:03:42.880> it's

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
connector there's no stress on it it's

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.330 
connector there's no stress on it it's
going<00:03:43.450> straight<00:03:43.569> into<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.170> stick<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:44.890> the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
going straight into the stick and the

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.370 
going straight into the stick and the
cables<00:03:45.760> hanging<00:03:45.970> free<00:03:46.359> here<00:03:46.660> so<00:03:47.079> there's<00:03:47.319> no

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
cables hanging free here so there's no

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.220 
cables hanging free here so there's no
stress<00:03:47.799> on<00:03:47.950> it<00:03:48.190> either<00:03:48.459> another<00:03:49.450> bonus<00:03:49.720> for<00:03:50.079> me

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
stress on it either another bonus for me

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.039 
stress on it either another bonus for me
was<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.950> seemed<00:03:51.549> to<00:03:51.670> me<00:03:51.880> or<00:03:52.150> not<00:03:52.660> seemed<00:03:52.930> I
