the<00:04:54.100> subject<00:04:54.520> she<00:04:54.700> had<00:04:54.910> I<00:04:55.150> found<00:04:55.450> Grace<00:04:55.870> Lee

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080

Boggs<00:04:56.260> to<00:04:56.530> be<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.740> most<00:04:56.860> fascinating<00:04:57.090> when<00:04:58.090> it

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
Boggs to be the most fascinating when it

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.300 
Boggs to be the most fascinating when it
was<00:04:58.330> shown<00:04:58.540> in<00:04:59.110> a<00:04:59.320> relationship<00:04:59.860> to<00:05:00.190> the

was shown in a relationship to the

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.730 
was shown in a relationship to the
filmmaker<00:05:00.700> Grace<00:05:01.090> Lee<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:01.570> think<00:05:02.290> for<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.530> most

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
filmmaker Grace Lee I think for the most

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.880 
filmmaker Grace Lee I think for the most
part<00:05:02.830> Grace<00:05:03.250> Lee<00:05:03.550> steps<00:05:04.480> out<00:05:04.690> too<00:05:05.260> much<00:05:05.530> and

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
part Grace Lee steps out too much and

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.100 
part Grace Lee steps out too much and
just<00:05:06.340> shows<00:05:06.730> her<00:05:07.060> as<00:05:07.270> her<00:05:07.570> life<00:05:07.810> in<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.080> very

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
just shows her as her life in a very

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.530 
just shows her as her life in a very
kind<00:05:08.560> of<00:05:08.770> meat<00:05:09.340> and<00:05:09.460> potatoes<00:05:09.910> documentary

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
kind of meat and potatoes documentary

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.360 
kind of meat and potatoes documentary
the<00:05:11.200> film<00:05:11.440> is<00:05:11.560> really<00:05:11.830> interesting<00:05:12.220> when<00:05:12.310> you

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
the film is really interesting when you

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.010 
the film is really interesting when you
see<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.610> generational<00:05:13.240> divide<00:05:13.540> and<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:13.840> kind

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
see the generational divide and the kind

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.600 
see the generational divide and the kind
of<00:05:14.080> cultural<00:05:14.440> divide<00:05:14.740> between<00:05:14.890> the<00:05:15.160> filmmaker

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
of cultural divide between the filmmaker

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.850 
of cultural divide between the filmmaker
and<00:05:15.880> the<00:05:16.000> subjects<00:05:16.510> I<00:05:16.660> can't<00:05:17.440> say<00:05:17.590> there<00:05:17.740> was

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
and the subjects I can't say there was

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.260 
and the subjects I can't say there was
enough<00:05:18.100> of<00:05:18.190> that<00:05:18.250> but<00:05:18.700> it's<00:05:18.850> still<00:05:19.060> pretty

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
enough of that but it's still pretty

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.180 
enough of that but it's still pretty
fascinating<00:05:19.810> in<00:05:19.870> its<00:05:19.990> own<00:05:20.140> right<00:05:20.350> so<00:05:20.980> let's

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
kind of had a shelter around her shields

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.920 
kind of had a shelter around her shields
into<00:06:00.220> getting<00:06:00.520> too<00:06:00.670> personal<00:06:00.750> she<00:06:01.750> wasn't

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
into getting too personal she wasn't

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.060 
into getting too personal she wasn't
particularly<00:06:02.350> personal<00:06:02.680> with<00:06:02.890> their<00:06:02.980> own

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
particularly personal with their own

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.680 
particularly personal with their own
husband<00:06:03.430> so<00:06:03.610> who<00:06:03.760> can<00:06:03.880> expect<00:06:04.240> the<00:06:04.300> filming

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690

crew to get personal Lovera despite that

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.660 
crew to get personal Lovera despite that
it's<00:06:07.840> still<00:06:08.050> very<00:06:08.110> interesting<00:06:09.010> and<00:06:09.250> really<00:06:09.460> a

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
it's still very interesting and really a

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.910 
it's still very interesting and really a
the<00:06:10.390> movie<00:06:10.720> I<00:06:10.750> think<00:06:11.050> speaks<00:06:11.320> to<00:06:11.440> greater

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:11.920 
the movie I think speaks to greater

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.770 
the movie I think speaks to greater
lengths<00:06:12.310> about<00:06:12.580> social<00:06:13.090> revolutions<00:06:13.690> in

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
lengths about social revolutions in

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.630 
lengths about social revolutions in
American<00:06:14.140> specifically<00:06:14.770> Detroit<00:06:15.220> the<00:06:15.400> city

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640 
American specifically Detroit the city

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.790 
American specifically Detroit the city
as<00:06:15.910> much<00:06:16.600> as<00:06:16.780> it<00:06:16.930> speaks<00:06:17.170> about<00:06:17.260> Grace<00:06:17.590> Lee

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
as much as it speaks about Grace Lee

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.950 
as much as it speaks about Grace Lee
Boggs<00:06:17.950> the<00:06:18.250> activists<00:06:18.790> so<00:06:19.180> in<00:06:19.390> that<00:06:19.540> regard<00:06:19.720> I

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
Boggs the activists so in that regard I

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.210 
Boggs the activists so in that regard I
really<00:06:20.290> think<00:06:20.440> that<00:06:20.560> this<00:06:20.710> is<00:06:20.770> a<00:06:20.920> worthwhile

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
really think that this is a worthwhile

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.210 
really think that this is a worthwhile
film<00:06:21.960> so<00:06:22.960> there<00:06:23.110> you<00:06:23.140> have<00:06:23.260> it<00:06:23.380> 70<00:06:23.830> out<00:06:23.920> of<00:06:23.950> 100

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220
