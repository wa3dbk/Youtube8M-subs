00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
fast I actually prefer the bigger size

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.250 
fast I actually prefer the bigger size
now<00:02:17.590> compared<00:02:18.069> to<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.250> 55<00:02:18.580> millimeters<00:02:19.000> and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
now compared to the 55 millimeters and

now compared to the 55 millimeters and
again<00:02:20.260> this<00:02:20.470> cube<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:21.100> just<00:02:21.459> great<00:02:22.140> 45<00:02:23.140> reverse

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
again this cube is just great 45 reverse

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.540 
again this cube is just great 45 reverse
over<00:02:24.700> half<00:02:24.940> piece<00:02:25.270> it's<00:02:25.630> just<00:02:25.960> a<00:02:26.050> great<00:02:26.230> q<00:02:26.470> 4<00:02:27.430> by

over half piece it's just a great q 4 by

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.500 
over half piece it's just a great q 4 by
4<00:02:27.790> I

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
use a half modded changzhou 505 when I

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.110 
use a half modded changzhou 505 when I
say<00:02:55.930> half<00:02:56.170> modded<00:02:56.560> i<00:02:56.680> mean<00:02:57.040> i<00:02:57.250> modded

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
say half modded i mean i modded

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.860 
say half modded i mean i modded
literally<00:02:58.920> three<00:02:59.920> centers<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.640> then<00:03:01.329> i<00:03:01.359> left

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
literally three centers and then i left

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.410 
literally three centers and then i left
it<00:03:02.079> sitting<00:03:02.290> there<00:03:02.709> for<00:03:03.430> about<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.849> month<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.299> i

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
it sitting there for about a month and i

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.550 
it sitting there for about a month and i
totally<00:03:04.599> forgot<00:03:04.810> about<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:05.379> i<00:03:05.409> just

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
totally forgot about it so i just

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.229 
totally forgot about it so i just
decided<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:06.069> reassemble<00:03:06.579> it<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.849> put<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.120> back

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
decided to reassemble it and put it back

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.629 
decided to reassemble it and put it back
together<00:03:07.389> and<00:03:08.099> now<00:03:09.099> that<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.310> have<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.519> back

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
together and now that I have it back

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.460 
together and now that I have it back
together<00:03:09.909> I<00:03:10.239> don't<00:03:10.450> think<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.989> I'm<00:03:11.139> going<00:03:11.349> to

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
together I don't think that I'm going to

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.170 
together I don't think that I'm going to
mod<00:03:11.709> anything<00:03:12.129> else<00:03:12.280> because<00:03:12.400> this<00:03:12.849> turns

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
mod anything else because this turns

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.979 
mod anything else because this turns
just<00:03:13.540> nice<00:03:13.810> for<00:03:13.840> me<00:03:14.200> it's<00:03:14.500> really<00:03:15.489> fast<00:03:15.989> smooth

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
just nice for me it's really fast smooth

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.539 
just nice for me it's really fast smooth
and<00:03:17.290> bumpy<00:03:17.680> at<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.829> same<00:03:17.980> time<00:03:18.099> just<00:03:18.400> what<00:03:18.519> i

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
and bumpy at the same time just what i

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.690 
and bumpy at the same time just what i
really<00:03:18.819> like<00:03:19.560> corner<00:03:20.560> cuts<00:03:20.739> well<00:03:20.950> on<00:03:21.310> some

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
really like corner cuts well on some

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.309 
really like corner cuts well on some
sides<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.120> can<00:03:22.359> reverse<00:03:22.690> because<00:03:22.840> I'm<00:03:23.019> added

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
sides a can reverse because I'm added

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.339 
sides a can reverse because I'm added
some<00:03:23.470> sides<00:03:23.709> but<00:03:23.980> it's<00:03:24.879> just<00:03:25.269> nice<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.840> I'm

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
some sides but it's just nice and I'm

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.530 
some sides but it's just nice and I'm
starting<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.680> end<00:03:26.829> of<00:03:26.920> 5<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.159> 5<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.639> this<00:03:28.239> is

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
starting the end of 5 of 5 and this is

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.649 
starting the end of 5 of 5 and this is
good<00:03:28.720> enough<00:03:28.900> for<00:03:28.959> me<00:03:29.519> six<00:03:30.519> by<00:03:30.670> six<00:03:30.730> I<00:03:31.030> use<00:03:31.629> a

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
good enough for me six by six I use a

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.960 
good enough for me six by six I use a
shank<00:03:32.200> so<00:03:32.349> 6<00:03:32.590> by<00:03:32.709> 6<00:03:32.739> which<00:03:33.099> I<00:03:33.220> have<00:03:33.400> changed<00:03:33.819> the

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
shank so 6 by 6 which I have changed the

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.259 
shank so 6 by 6 which I have changed the
strings<00:03:34.269> in<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.900> cube<00:03:35.230> few<00:03:35.440> springs<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:36.269> I

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
strings in to cube few springs and I

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.099 
strings in to cube few springs and I
might<00:03:38.079> nod<00:03:38.260> this<00:03:38.579> but<00:03:39.579> this<00:03:39.970> cube<00:03:40.359> actually

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
might nod this but this cube actually

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.199 
might nod this but this cube actually
turns<00:03:41.379> very<00:03:41.680> nice<00:03:41.919> I<00:03:42.220> know<00:03:42.459> that<00:03:42.790> I've<00:03:42.970> said

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
turns very nice I know that I've said

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.460 
turns very nice I know that I've said
that<00:03:43.359> I<00:03:43.419> really<00:03:43.660> don't<00:03:43.840> like<00:03:43.959> mine<00:03:44.230> anymore

a<00:04:07.959> shame<00:04:08.139> try<00:04:08.349> seven<00:04:08.620> by<00:04:08.709> seven<00:04:08.739> lubed

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
a shame try seven by seven lubed

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.629 
a shame try seven by seven lubed
intentions<00:04:09.819> by<00:04:09.970> myself<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:11.680> did<00:04:12.220> try<00:04:12.459> with

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
intentions by myself I did try with

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.729 
intentions by myself I did try with
Diane<00:04:12.909> springs<00:04:13.239> in<00:04:13.510> there<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:13.959> i<00:04:14.379> found<00:04:14.650> that

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
Diane springs in there and i found that

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.060 
Diane springs in there and i found that
to<00:04:15.340> even<00:04:15.730> put<00:04:15.970> tension<00:04:16.299> on<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.840> springs<00:04:17.199> you

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
to even put tension on the springs you

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.979 
to even put tension on the springs you
needed<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.489> have<00:04:18.699> it<00:04:18.849> really<00:04:19.060> tight<00:04:19.269> to<00:04:19.840> where

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
needed to have it really tight to where

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.379 
needed to have it really tight to where
the<00:04:20.349> tension<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.489> screws<00:04:21.760> were<00:04:21.940> screwed<00:04:22.270> into

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
the tension the screws were screwed into

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.560 
the tension the screws were screwed into
tight<00:04:22.720> so<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.260> wouldn't<00:04:23.710> corner<00:04:23.979> cut<00:04:24.190> so<00:04:24.820> i

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
tight so it wouldn't corner cut so i

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.649 
tight so it wouldn't corner cut so i
find<00:04:26.050> that<00:04:26.400> just<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.639> way<00:04:27.760> it<00:04:27.909> normally<00:04:28.060> is<00:04:28.419> is

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659 
find that just the way it normally is is

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:31.200 
find that just the way it normally is is
fine<00:04:29.050> for<00:04:29.080> me<00:04:29.380> so<00:04:29.919> i<00:04:29.949> just<00:04:30.280> stick<00:04:30.970> with<00:04:31.180> it

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
fine for me so i just stick with it

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.450 
fine for me so i just stick with it
stock<00:04:31.690> because<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:32.710> works<00:04:32.889> good<00:04:33.130> enough<00:04:33.310> for

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
stock because it works good enough for

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.959 
stock because it works good enough for
me<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:33.909> i<00:04:34.120> still<00:04:34.360> get<00:04:34.570> good<00:04:34.900> times<00:04:35.729> megaminx<00:04:36.729> i

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:36.969 
me and i still get good times megaminx i

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.330 
me and i still get good times megaminx i
use<00:04:37.419> a<00:04:37.659> matted<00:04:38.080> changsha<00:04:38.469> megaminx

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
use a matted changsha megaminx

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.140 
use a matted changsha megaminx
I'm<00:04:40.240> added<00:04:40.660> this<00:04:40.780> over<00:04:41.290> spring<00:04:41.590> break<00:04:42.150> really

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
I'm added this over spring break really

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.220 
I'm added this over spring break really
awesome<00:04:44.100> it's<00:04:45.100> very<00:04:45.850> smooth<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.570> loosened<00:04:47.080> it<00:04:47.139> a

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
awesome it's very smooth I loosened it a

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.340 
awesome it's very smooth I loosened it a
lot<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:47.680> now<00:04:47.830> it's<00:04:48.190> kind<00:04:48.729> of<00:04:48.760> readily<00:04:49.150> but<00:04:49.510> it's

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
lot so now it's kind of readily but it's

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.550 
lot so now it's kind of readily but it's
very<00:04:50.620> fast<00:04:51.010> it<00:04:51.250> doesn't<00:04:51.550> pop<00:04:51.699> and<00:04:52.060> it<00:04:52.510> can<00:04:53.080> cut

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
very fast it doesn't pop and it can cut

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.670 
very fast it doesn't pop and it can cut
nice<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.280> reverse<00:04:54.790> a<00:04:55.090> little<00:04:55.330> bit<00:04:55.449> so<00:04:56.380> it's

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
nice and reverse a little bit so it's

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.189 
nice and reverse a little bit so it's
really<00:04:56.830> nice<00:04:57.040> I<00:04:57.880> might<00:04:58.540> actually<00:04:58.780> change

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
really nice I might actually change

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.680 
really nice I might actually change
maids<00:04:59.530> to<00:04:59.949> my<00:05:00.160> Diane<00:05:00.760> megamix<00:05:01.210> when<00:05:01.419> it<00:05:01.510> comes

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
maids to my Diane megamix when it comes

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.280 
maids to my Diane megamix when it comes
in<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:01.900> mail<00:05:02.080> but<00:05:02.979> we'll<00:05:03.280> see<00:05:03.490> about<00:05:03.610> that<00:05:04.290> but

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
in the mail but we'll see about that but

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.780 
in the mail but we'll see about that but
until<00:05:05.590> then<00:05:05.740> this<00:05:05.949> cube<00:05:06.250> is<00:05:06.370> really<00:05:06.610> nice<00:05:06.729> and

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
until then this cube is really nice and

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.290 
until then this cube is really nice and
I<00:05:07.180> like<00:05:07.570> how<00:05:07.810> it<00:05:07.960> turns<00:05:08.199> and<00:05:09.000> last<00:05:10.000> but<00:05:10.120> not

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
I like how it turns and last but not

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.580 
I like how it turns and last but not
least<00:05:10.360> this<00:05:11.080> is<00:05:11.639> from<00:05:12.639> one<00:05:12.669> hand<00:05:13.060> I<00:05:13.389> use<00:05:13.930> a<00:05:13.960> 55

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
least this is from one hand I use a 55

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.640 
least this is from one hand I use a 55
millimeters<00:05:15.070> and<00:05:15.190> she<00:05:15.340> now<00:05:15.840> I<00:05:16.840> found<00:05:17.410> that<00:05:17.530> the

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
millimeters and she now I found that the

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.140 
millimeters and she now I found that the
50<00:05:17.919> millimeter<00:05:18.280> which<00:05:18.430> is<00:05:18.550> what<00:05:18.669> i<00:05:18.700> used<00:05:18.940> to

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
50 millimeter which is what i used to

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.330 
50 millimeter which is what i used to
use<00:05:19.180> is<00:05:19.600> now<00:05:20.560> too<00:05:20.620> small<00:05:21.310> for<00:05:21.610> my<00:05:21.700> hands<00:05:22.150> um<00:05:22.389> I

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
use is now too small for my hands um I

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.040 
use is now too small for my hands um I
still<00:05:24.340> really<00:05:24.880> suck<00:05:25.240> at<00:05:25.270> one<00:05:25.540> hand<00:05:25.810> so<00:05:26.580> as<00:05:28.050> you

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
still really suck at one hand so as you

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.650 
still really suck at one hand so as you
can<00:05:29.139> see<00:05:29.410> i'm<00:05:29.620> not<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:29.919> best<00:05:30.160> i<00:05:30.490> I<00:05:31.000> only

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
can see i'm not the best i I only

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.290 
can see i'm not the best i I only
averaged<00:05:32.020> around<00:05:32.110> 40<00:05:32.530> 50<00:05:32.800> seconds<00:05:33.160> but<00:05:33.340> this

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
averaged around 40 50 seconds but this

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.840 
averaged around 40 50 seconds but this
cube<00:05:34.630> is<00:05:34.720> really<00:05:34.990> nice<00:05:35.110> it's<00:05:35.410> smooth<00:05:35.889> and<00:05:36.130> I

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
cube is really nice it's smooth and I

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.060 
cube is really nice it's smooth and I
gummed<00:05:37.510> it<00:05:37.630> up<00:05:37.750> a<00:05:37.960> little<00:05:38.169> bit<00:05:38.410> which<00:05:38.770> is<00:05:38.919> why<00:05:39.039> I

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
gummed it up a little bit which is why I

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.360 
gummed it up a little bit which is why I
switched<00:05:39.490> it<00:05:39.729> from<00:05:39.940> my<00:05:40.740> normal<00:05:41.740> main<00:05:42.070> to<00:05:42.220> one

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
switched it from my normal main to one

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.279
