00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.380
 you who like me wanted 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.810
 probably in short diesel all the 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.360
 week and even the weekend you will 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.820
 may be asking a question what 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.150
 it's buying a useless car 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.610
 we asked ourselves the question and that 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.289
 falls well we are at lamborghini a 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.170
 lamborghini 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.000
 so as you can see the 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.140
 chest is tiny 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.150
 because at the back and a motor a 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.280
 very big engine that pollute a lot 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.720
 who does a lot of co2 who takes 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.540
 a lot of room you have a car 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.399
 with maximum bulk for a 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.960
 minimum habitability 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.610
 if you want to have the definition of a 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.030
 useless car you have the answer 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.110
 she is here posted on the wall and who I 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.410
 want to clarify it for some of 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:01.630
 our readers could get banged on 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.630
 the norschleife by a megane rs trophy 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.720
 the useless car prototype that we 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.510
 have chosen 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.590
 spyder performing land then 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.590
 technical characteristics 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.320
 to add 125 kg to a couple evolves 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.370
 deleting 65 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.370
 you put more horses in the 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.630
 motor you put him some stickers a 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.530
 little everywhere and you have there 570 4 spyder 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.620
 performing 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.640
 it will be our mount for the trip 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.640
 more useless that there is not 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.490
 1 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.520
 and 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.520
 m 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.610
 we 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.470
 what is it worth this high-performance spyder and to 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.540
 his name was worn for 16 years 110 horses 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.310
 I had a couple under 600 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.310
 time of m two hundred and twenty thousand euros 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.609
 and knowing past you will see if you 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.749
 have several modes of transmission 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.939
 you have a sport mode in Corsica 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:58.799
 then the body that we put ourselves in would have 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.730
 city â€‹â€‹you have an automatic mode if 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.680
 you do not want to annoy 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.900
 pallets that by the way are not great 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.010
 well that two little ears are the 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.780
 cars that did not much 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.650
 but if it does not exist 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.740
 because sincerely we 're going to 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.740
 increase
