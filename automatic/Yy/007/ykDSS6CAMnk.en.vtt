00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:37.756
In 21st century sulphur is no longer a commodity
and becomes a bothersome industrial waste.

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:45.948
It is because of restrictive environmental laws compelling the
fuel industry to produce diesel fuel without sulphur content.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:51.649
In many countries around the world there are gigantic
heaps of sulphur waste rising beyond our view.

00:00:51.763 --> 00:00:55.141
This constitutes a serious threat to the environment.

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.388
The Polish company MARBET WIL was successful in working out technology

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:06.746
That changes hazardous industrial waste to ecological and
useful products for road and railway infrastructure.

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:15.980
Eng. Wlodzimierz Mysłowski, CEO of Marbet Wil: For over 10 years MARBET WIL
has been an company developing technologies based on modified sulphur.

00:01:16.016 --> 00:01:22.040
So far, we have developed dozens of technologies
that were patented across the world.

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:32.016
The SULTECH technology serves for stabilizing dangerous waste like
arsenic, lead, mercury and congealing them into useful products.

00:01:32.112 --> 00:01:38.699
SULCEM – a sulphur binder has been used in the
process of stabilization and congealing of waste.

00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:44.020
This is a solid substance of a light bronze
colour with a delicate smell of sulphur.

00:01:44.344 --> 00:01:49.232
All end products of MARBET WIL are based on SULCEM.

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:53.277
The production plant is located in Gliwice.

00:01:53.381 --> 00:01:58.877
The technological process starts from
the railway tank carrying sulphur.

00:01:59.558 --> 00:02:04.848
The sulphur is then pumped to reactors
where controlling agents are added.

00:02:05.227 --> 00:02:11.632
The binder - a sulphur polymer - is created in a
high temperature and is poured out on steel tape.

00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:14.303
That’s where crystallization takes place.

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:21.367
The SULCEM congealed binder is then flaked, stored
and subsequently used for further production.

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:31.116
The SULTECH polymer concrete containing waste is a perfect
thermoplastic material which can be formed into any shape.

00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:34.655
Products made of sulphur concrete have certificates of hygiene.

00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:45.331
Drainage systems, flood plates to form dykes, elements of drains in sewage
systems, slabs, road and motorway elements, railway traction loads…

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:50.148
This is but a handful of applications
of sulphur concrete from MARBET WIL.

00:02:50.349 --> 00:03:03.477
We were the very first in Europe to introduce sulphur concrete products and
since 2002 we have been delivering our goods for Polish roads and rail routes.

00:03:03.526 --> 00:03:10.785
MARBET WIL is creating a new sector of industry which in
a short time will offer thousands of new work places.
