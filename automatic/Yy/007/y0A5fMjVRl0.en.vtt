that and actually found eventually that

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.120 
that and actually found eventually that
the<00:01:31.389> devils<00:01:31.689> actually<00:01:31.899> migrate<00:01:32.170> astray<00:01:32.439> so<00:01:33.100> I

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
the devils actually migrate astray so I

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.590 
the devils actually migrate astray so I
started<00:01:33.369> looking<00:01:33.459> around<00:01:33.639> for<00:01:33.999> other<00:01:34.060> artists

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
started looking around for other artists

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.929 
started looking around for other artists
that<00:01:34.869> war<00:01:35.590> that<00:01:35.950> had<00:01:36.069> that<00:01:36.219> same<00:01:36.399> kind<00:01:36.459> of

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
that war that had that same kind of

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.609 
that war that had that same kind of
diversity<00:01:37.810> creativity<00:01:38.409> in<00:01:38.740> them<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:40.619> wanted

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
diversity creativity in them and wanted

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.769 
diversity creativity in them and wanted
to<00:01:41.709> kind<00:01:41.889> of<00:01:41.950> create<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.249> home<00:01:42.459> for<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:43.539> type

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:43.779 
to kind of create a home for that type

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:45.500 
to kind of create a home for that type
of<00:01:43.929> artist<00:01:44.289> you<00:01:44.619> know

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
of artist you know

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.480 
of artist you know
because<00:01:46.050> most<00:01:46.650> labels<00:01:46.830> don't<00:01:47.130> wanna<00:01:47.340> touch

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
because most labels don't wanna touch

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.620 
because most labels don't wanna touch
those<00:01:47.640> kind<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.850> artists<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.450> they

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
those kind of artists it's like they

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.940 
those kind of artists it's like they
don't<00:01:48.690> know<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:48.930> they<00:01:48.990> want<00:01:49.080> to<00:01:49.200> do<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.500> don't

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
don't know what they want to do I don't

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.690 
don't know what they want to do I don't
see<00:01:50.070> him<00:01:50.160> like<00:01:50.280> that

see him like that

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.490 
see him like that
I<00:01:50.730> see<00:01:51.270> him<00:01:51.360> as<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.690> having<00:01:51.840> being

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
I see him as just having being

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.670 
I see him as just having being
multi-talented<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> drink<00:01:53.820> I'm<00:01:54.210> saying

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
multi-talented like a drink I'm saying

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.410 
multi-talented like a drink I'm saying
and<00:01:55.680> then<00:01:55.830> on<00:01:55.920> top<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.370> so<00:01:56.940> that's<00:01:57.060> where

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and then on top of that so that's where

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.420 
and then on top of that so that's where
the<00:01:57.510> mix<00:01:57.780> back<00:01:57.990> concept<00:01:58.560> comes<00:01:58.770> from<00:01:59.040> people

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
the mix back concept comes from people

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.730 
the mix back concept comes from people
that<00:01:59.550> aren't<00:01:59.700> mix<00:01:59.940> back<00:02:00.180> kind<00:02:00.480> of<00:02:00.600> artists<00:02:00.960> and

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
that aren't mix back kind of artists and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.050 
that aren't mix back kind of artists and
they<00:02:02.310> won't<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.550> looking<00:02:02.790> at<00:02:02.880> some<00:02:03.000> other

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
they won't be looking at some other

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.880 
they won't be looking at some other
artists<00:02:03.420> as<00:02:03.480> well<00:02:03.510> but<00:02:03.810> that's<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.080> primarily

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
artists as well but that's the primarily

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
around 10 yeah but we get that's why we

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.490 
around 10 yeah but we get that's why we
build<00:04:47.940> in<00:04:48.030> a<00:04:48.090> strong<00:04:48.389> infrastructure<00:04:49.020> because

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
build in a strong infrastructure because

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.629 
build in a strong infrastructure because
one<00:04:49.650> of<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.800> things<00:04:49.979> that<00:04:50.160> we<00:04:50.250> found<00:04:50.400> is<00:04:50.610> that

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
one of the things that we found is that

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.450 
one of the things that we found is that
a<00:04:50.789> lot<00:04:51.000> of<00:04:51.030> labels<00:04:51.680> they<00:04:52.680> rise<00:04:52.889> and<00:04:52.919> fall<00:04:53.280> based

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
a lot of labels they rise and fall based

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.980 
a lot of labels they rise and fall based
on<00:04:53.639> infrastructure<00:04:54.180> that's<00:04:54.419> just<00:04:54.599> companies

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
on infrastructure that's just companies

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.450 
on infrastructure that's just companies
in<00:04:55.139> general<00:04:55.260> right<00:04:55.729> so<00:04:56.729> we<00:04:57.060> want<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.300> be<00:04:57.510> we

in general right so we want to be we

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.129 
in general right so we want to be we
emphasize<00:04:59.460> spend<00:04:59.940> a<00:04:59.970> lot<00:05:00.270> of<00:05:00.300> time<00:05:00.630> working<00:05:00.930> on

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
emphasize spend a lot of time working on

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.420 
emphasize spend a lot of time working on
our<00:05:01.289> infrastructure<00:05:01.770> you<00:05:01.949> build<00:05:02.160> in<00:05:02.340> that

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
our infrastructure you build in that

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.279 
our infrastructure you build in that
strong<00:05:02.820> foundation<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:03.900> what<00:05:04.139> we're

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
strong foundation so that what we're

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.159 
strong foundation so that what we're
bringing<00:05:04.470> artists<00:05:05.039> into<00:05:05.520> we<00:05:06.060> can<00:05:06.090> contain<00:05:06.570> you

bringing artists into we can contain you

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.420 
bringing artists into we can contain you
know<00:05:07.229> I<00:05:07.320> mean<00:05:07.500> we<00:05:07.560> can<00:05:07.680> contain<00:05:07.979> unless<00:05:08.250> we<00:05:08.370> get

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
know I mean we can contain unless we get

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.800 
know I mean we can contain unless we get
them<00:05:08.580> into<00:05:10.130> so<00:05:11.130> yeah<00:05:11.310> about<00:05:11.490> 10<00:05:11.789> right<00:05:11.940> now<00:05:11.970> the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
them into so yeah about 10 right now the

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.899 
them into so yeah about 10 right now the
oh<00:05:12.870> man<00:05:13.110> it's<00:05:13.620> been

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
oh man it's been

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.739 
oh man it's been
really<00:05:15.539> cool<00:05:15.749> I<00:05:16.639> think<00:05:17.639> that<00:05:17.849> when<00:05:18.509> we<00:05:18.569> talked

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:18.749 
really cool I think that when we talked

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:19.999 
really cool I think that when we talked
before<00:05:18.779> I<00:05:19.050> think<00:05:19.289> I<00:05:19.349> told<00:05:19.409> you<00:05:19.649> I<00:05:19.740> felt<00:05:19.919> like

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
before I think I told you I felt like

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:21.529 
before I think I told you I felt like
the<00:05:20.099> album<00:05:20.369> was<00:05:20.550> ahead<00:05:20.729> of<00:05:20.879> his<00:05:21.059> time<00:05:21.240> in<00:05:21.270> some

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
the album was ahead of his time in some

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.189 
the album was ahead of his time in some
ways<00:05:21.719> I<00:05:22.020> still<00:05:22.889> think<00:05:23.099> that<00:05:23.479> so<00:05:24.479> I<00:05:24.779> think<00:05:24.899> it's

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
ways I still think that so I think it's

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.010 
ways I still think that so I think it's
one<00:05:25.649> of<00:05:25.679> those<00:05:25.860> things<00:05:26.159> where<00:05:26.509> the<00:05:27.509> people<00:05:27.839> who

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
one of those things where the people who

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.499 
one of those things where the people who
got<00:05:28.259> it<00:05:28.469> got<00:05:28.889> it<00:05:28.919> and<00:05:29.929> you<00:05:30.929> know<00:05:31.669> for<00:05:32.669> for

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:33.509 
got it got it and you know for for

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.010 
got it got it and you know for for
others<00:05:33.929> this<00:05:34.709> is<00:05:35.539> they<00:05:36.539> crying<00:05:36.809> to<00:05:36.929> have

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
others this is they crying to have

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.369 
others this is they crying to have
enough<00:05:37.819> so<00:05:38.819> I'm<00:05:38.879> looking<00:05:39.089> for<00:05:39.240> that<00:05:40.139> kind<00:05:40.349> of

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:40.379 
enough so I'm looking for that kind of

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.209 
enough so I'm looking for that kind of

because conceptually is especially love
for<00:05:47.849> you<00:05:48.330> know<00:05:48.449> that<00:05:48.839> ain't<00:05:48.990> wouldn't<00:05:49.199> have<00:05:49.319> a
