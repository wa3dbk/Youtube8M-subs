00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.889
 hello and welcome in the garden beautiful that 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.780
 we are doing know we do today 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.190
 no no garden tour i want 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.580
 also do not make a greenhouse tour 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.740
 Today we make a trip to one 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.180
 garden corner usually does not 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.570
 at least not from the visit 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.939
 Perspective as you see it today 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.070
 mikrokosmos da rhine or again 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.199
 things always means and I have to 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.910
 I would like this plant loburg 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.590
 that he is not here is the same 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.990
 The first fruits come to grow 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.220
 then comes the first heat period and 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.760
 then you can see how the plants are planted 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.910
 dismantle 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.590
 the leaves become yellow the breakfast 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.680
 if they even come at all 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.300
 fall off and he does not take three 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.450
 weeks as the plant completely over 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.180
 so now look at what that is 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.590
 but maybe we would have one first 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:01.310
 look at the temperatures here 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:06.170
 we have smooth 42 degrees in it 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:08.450
 So the symptoms were pretty nice 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.490
 namely always a fine spinsting 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.600
 out with very tiny tierchen the 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.730
 to run around and who looks what 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.160
 same times from close to one each 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.810
 knows when is spiders reporting 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.090
 but they look at us more closely 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.970
 fishing is no I want them 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.470
 do not spoil the fun 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.040
 But they are also on the cucumbers themselves 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.940
 to find 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.500
 do not worry and let us know 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.340
 I can look a little better 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.380
 worried me so a usb microscope so 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.390
 computer connects to it you can 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.070
 nice to see we first take one 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.010
 this very heavily infected leaves with 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.510
 their 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.820
 and now we'll give more details 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.390
 look at 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.290
 only from a distance, they see more 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.290
 cute yet 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.850
 here's one that 'one time but I have to 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.520
 the whole sheet looks at then is full 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.740
 there are millions with these things 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.100
 No corner where these animals are not 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.100
 run around 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.890
 the decaying leaf is the more of 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.890
 the animals are there 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.240
 is for example a place there is the 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.240
 already completely destroyed 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.830
 even a bit greener here but that depends 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.330
 not to decompose over all these 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.170
 animals now give a full play of 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.170
 to look at the nearness 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:55.900
 there are some carcasses I would 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:56.950
 Do not say white eggs in the middle above 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.180
 why they have different colors 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:06.810
 that of a green gives the other red 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:09.310
 at least millions of them 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.110
 Here you can see well 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.880
 why the spiders mites most because in 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:21.880
 These threads depend on this thread 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:24.450
 tinker again there is also in this 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.450
 play in it 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:35.370
 million of them alone 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.370
 a leaf 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.250
 Hard to believe so I thought that 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.030
 Cucumbers plant against as soon as not 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.770
 we can put 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.390
 then I can clear leaf rib that can 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.770
 No cucumbers can survive 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.690
 are the only animals that I otherwise 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.670
 still found on the leaves was 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.410
 still that may be 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.670
 aphids you have no choice 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.670
 Voting eaten 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.319
 there are also on it as said you know 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.780
 Which urgently needs to do 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.700
 not a quick shower on the whole body 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.419
 I do not know objectively objectively me 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.210
 tingles millions all over the body 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.470
 of it and here to bite so heartily 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.970
 without washing and peeling 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.419
 it will not be that fast any more 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.970
 Do not be serious about how to do it 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.419
 this feature now gets away without 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.430
 chemistry 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.350
 the only practical variant must 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.030
 probably higher humidity is what 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.160
 but with tomatoes cucumbers in one 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.590
 house would work bad then 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.479
 my second i'm not tall if there 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.520
 come again ask that is still one 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.140
 this later this is not a small one 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.650
 refined that still holds much 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.030
 better 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.320
 that's three weeks later and after 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.270
 front is especially that has none 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.820
 Symptoms even younger 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.680
 that is just 1 meter high I have 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.910
 yes offset yes maybe goes 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.289
 so that somehow I have a handle as well 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.890
 I also tried with water too 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.590
 spray 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.200
 But you can not do that much water 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.030
 jump on it at the temperatures is 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.770
 completely nonsense 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.539
 one could probably also use beneficials 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.870
 I've tried there with aphids 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.760
 the movie costs a lot of money 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.010
 uncertain output is perhaps time 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.660
 a thing in the next years times 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.860
 to attempt 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.000
 so and now it's enough I have to 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.530
 It's too hot out of here 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.030
 tingling I 'm going to take a shower now 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.500
 I am willing to help then I will go again 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.330
 go with the camera and see if I'm in 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.280
 Garden does not find something for you 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.020
 the fun at the hobby gardener 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.669
 self-care to spoil are there 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.039
 but certainly other fishermen 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:44.630
 that are at least as funny as 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:46.560
 spider mites on cucumbers until soon 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.409
 Recently in the garden of the blog youtube 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.029
 Do not forget to subscribe to channel haase 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.099
 always looking in there always gives 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:55.519
 again interesting things so until then 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:55.519
 bye
