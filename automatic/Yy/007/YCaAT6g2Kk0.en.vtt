hi<00:00:06.390> from<00:00:06.690> this<00:00:06.930> video<00:00:07.230> we<00:00:07.350> are<00:00:07.379> going<00:00:07.470> to

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
hi from this video we are going to

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.799 
hi from this video we are going to
talking<00:00:08.010> about<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.340> logic<00:00:08.670> apart<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.420> use

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
talking about the logic apart and use

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.839 
talking about the logic apart and use
our<00:00:10.019> logic<00:00:10.410> an<00:00:10.469> ode<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.650> contain<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.490> drive

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
our logic an ode to contain the drive

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.060 
our logic an ode to contain the drive
your<00:00:12.059> agent<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.780> very<00:00:12.929> interesting<00:00:13.070> the

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
your agent that is very interesting the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.200 
your agent that is very interesting the
first<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.429> channel<00:00:14.670> we<00:00:14.759> are<00:00:14.820> going<00:00:15.089> to

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
first the channel we are going to

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.680 
first the channel we are going to
introduce<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.230> ground<00:00:16.470> channel<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.730> let's

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
introduce is the ground channel so let's

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.740 
introduce is the ground channel so let's
create<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.320> names<00:00:19.619> from<00:00:19.949> scratch<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.750> let's

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
create a names from scratch so let's

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.300 
create a names from scratch so let's
create<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.260> ground<00:00:22.529> here<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.820> plan<00:00:24.150> and

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
create in the ground here the plan and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.349 
create in the ground here the plan and
please<00:00:26.310> make<00:00:26.490> sure<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.180> 0<00:00:27.869> ok<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.039> then

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
please make sure this is 0 ok and then

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.729 
please make sure this is 0 ok and then
let's<00:00:30.359> add<00:00:30.840> some<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.199> subdivision<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.309> that

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
let's add some of subdivision to that

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.620 
let's add some of subdivision to that
please<00:00:34.739> make<00:00:34.950> sure<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.670> ground<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.390> too

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
please make sure this ground is not too

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.229 
please make sure this ground is not too
complex<00:00:37.140> then<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.890> increase<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.610> speed<00:00:39.000> of

complex then can increase the speed of
the<00:00:39.270> simulation<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.230> then<00:00:40.730> lets<00:00:41.730> some<00:00:42.110> change

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the simulation and then lets some change

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:53.689 
the simulation and then lets some change

agent they rotate for example some

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.559 
agent they rotate for example some
degree<00:03:37.400> 45<00:03:37.970> per<00:03:38.269> second<00:03:38.859> and<00:03:40.239> let's<00:03:41.239> run<00:03:41.540> a

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
degree 45 per second and let's run a

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.960 
degree 45 per second and let's run a
simulation<00:03:42.010> you<00:03:43.010> may<00:03:43.100> notice<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.670> agent

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
simulation you may notice that the agent

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.960 
simulation you may notice that the agent
will<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.900> rotate<00:03:45.410> a<00:03:45.440> little<00:03:45.650> bit<00:03:46.010> in<00:03:46.280> each

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
will the rotate a little bit in each

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.250 
will the rotate a little bit in each
second

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
second

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.990 
second
so<00:03:49.260> let's<00:03:49.709> create<00:03:50.010> in<00:03:50.159> the<00:03:50.280> ground<00:03:50.519> channel

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
so let's create in the ground channel

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.940 
so let's create in the ground channel
and<00:03:51.209> then<00:03:51.420> make<00:03:51.659> it<00:03:51.780> our<00:03:51.900> aging<00:03:52.170> adapt<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.830> the

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
and then make it our aging adapt to the

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.149 
and then make it our aging adapt to the
terrain<00:03:53.659> the<00:03:54.659> first<00:03:54.870> step<00:03:55.260> we<00:03:55.560> need<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.890> mark

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
terrain the first step we need to mark

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.660 
terrain the first step we need to mark
the<00:03:56.549> terrain<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.420> this<00:03:57.959> terrain<00:03:58.799> manager<00:03:59.489> we

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
the terrain in this terrain manager we

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.149 
the terrain in this terrain manager we
need<00:03:59.819> to<00:03:59.909> mark<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.390> terrain<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.470> our<00:04:01.680> system

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
need to mark the terrain so our system

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.670 
need to mark the terrain so our system
can<00:04:02.370> notice<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.180> this<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:04.140> hour<00:04:04.230> terrine

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
can notice that this is the hour terrine

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.030 
can notice that this is the hour terrine
and<00:04:05.750> our<00:04:06.750> agent<00:04:07.079> will<00:04:07.260> automatically<00:04:07.769> fill

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
and our agent will automatically fill

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.030 
and our agent will automatically fill
and<00:04:08.370> day<00:04:09.030> logic<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:10.079> ground<00:04:10.349> channel<00:04:10.799> can

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
and day logic the ground channel can

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.420 
and day logic the ground channel can
work<00:04:11.569> so<00:04:12.569> when<00:04:13.079> you<00:04:13.230> locked<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.860> in<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.400> can

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
work so when you locked it in it you can

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.099 
work so when you locked it in it you can
select<00:04:14.819> that<00:04:16.729> ok<00:04:17.729> and<00:04:17.910> then<00:04:18.510> let's<00:04:18.720> create<00:04:18.930> our

select that ok and then let's create our

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.259 
select that ok and then let's create our
ground<00:04:19.560> channel<00:04:20.040> and<00:04:20.190> make<00:04:20.639> it<00:04:20.729> our<00:04:20.910> agent

means<00:04:57.720> that<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.139> agent<00:04:58.440> is<00:04:58.530> stay<00:04:58.889> up<00:04:59.099> or<00:04:59.280> down

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
means that the agent is stay up or down

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.089 
means that the agent is stay up or down
the<00:04:59.520> ground<00:04:59.760> the<00:05:00.060> agent<00:05:00.330> will<00:05:00.450> go<00:05:00.840> down<00:05:01.110> t.y

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
the ground the agent will go down t.y

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.120 
the ground the agent will go down t.y
and<00:05:02.460> then<00:05:03.120> make<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.570> agent<00:05:03.900> go<00:05:04.080> down<00:05:04.380> the

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
and then make the agent go down the

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.510 
and then make the agent go down the
minus<00:05:05.490> 10<00:05:05.789> for<00:05:06.090> example<00:05:06.889> so<00:05:07.889> let's<00:05:08.099> test<00:05:08.460> that

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
minus 10 for example so let's test that

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.140 
minus 10 for example so let's test that
out<00:05:09.710> if<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:10.830> notice<00:05:11.070> that<00:05:11.250> some<00:05:11.490> of<00:05:11.520> agent<00:05:11.940> is

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
out if you notice that some of agent is

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.959 
out if you notice that some of agent is
up<00:05:12.479> or<00:05:12.720> down<00:05:12.750> this<00:05:13.020> grinder<00:05:13.440> will<00:05:13.560> go<00:05:13.770> down

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:18.969 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.759 

and<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:20.110> speed<00:05:20.469> is<00:05:20.860> managed<00:05:21.429> in<00:05:21.729> and<00:05:22.589> we<00:05:23.589> need

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:23.769 
and the speed is managed in and we need

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:29.879 
and the speed is managed in and we need
to<00:05:23.829> create<00:05:24.039> another<00:05:25.079> the<00:05:26.079> grunt<00:05:26.409> is<00:05:26.999> done<00:05:28.889> here

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
to create another the grunt is done here

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.739 
to create another the grunt is done here
and<00:05:30.329> if<00:05:31.329> the<00:05:31.629> agent<00:05:32.259> is<00:05:32.549> under<00:05:33.549> this<00:05:33.759> is<00:05:34.089> under

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:34.749 
and if the agent is under this is under

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:36.899 
and if the agent is under this is under
this<00:05:34.869> terrain<00:05:35.259> it<00:05:35.589> will<00:05:35.889> return<00:05:36.249> the<00:05:36.489> negative

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
this terrain it will return the negative

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:44.689 
this terrain it will return the negative
value<00:05:40.679> the<00:05:41.679> minus<00:05:42.129> infinity<00:05:42.579> to<00:05:42.849> the<00:05:43.059> zero<00:05:43.449> and

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 
value the minus infinity to the zero and

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:50.279 
value the minus infinity to the zero and
then<00:05:45.699> the<00:05:46.089> agent<00:05:46.419> will<00:05:46.569> go<00:05:46.749> up<00:05:47.369> 10<00:05:48.369> here<00:05:49.289> at

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
then the agent will go up 10 here at

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:52.350 
then the agent will go up 10 here at
this<00:05:50.619> time<00:05:50.860> our<00:05:51.099> agent<00:05:51.489> will<00:05:51.669> adapt<00:05:52.029> to<00:05:52.239> the

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
this time our agent will adapt to the

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.159 
this time our agent will adapt to the
ground<00:05:54.599> but<00:05:55.599> even<00:05:55.719> notice<00:05:56.110> that<00:05:56.139> the<00:05:56.409> agent<00:05:56.709> is

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
ground but even notice that the agent is

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.939 
ground but even notice that the agent is
slippery<00:05:59.669> so<00:06:00.669> that<00:06:01.059> is<00:06:01.179> means<00:06:01.449> there's<00:06:02.349> no<00:06:02.439> any

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
slippery so that is means there's no any

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:07.079 
slippery so that is means there's no any
of<00:06:03.129> the<00:06:03.309> fuzzy<00:06:04.089> blurred<00:06:04.539> the<00:06:05.789> range<00:06:06.789> between

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.089 
of the fuzzy blurred the range between

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.619 
of the fuzzy blurred the range between
the<00:06:08.079> app<00:06:08.679> and<00:06:09.009> the<00:06:09.189> time<00:06:09.369> so<00:06:09.729> let's<00:06:09.939> need<00:06:10.239> we

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:10.629 
the app and the time so let's need we

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:14.069 
the app and the time so let's need we
need<00:06:10.659> to<00:06:11.019> feel<00:06:11.259> the<00:06:11.439> fuzzy<00:06:12.479> fuzzy<00:06:13.479> value<00:06:13.869> here

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:14.079 
need to feel the fuzzy fuzzy value here

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:17.459 
need to feel the fuzzy fuzzy value here
for<00:06:14.319> example<00:06:14.409> we<00:06:14.709> feel<00:06:15.039> the<00:06:15.219> five<00:06:15.489> and<00:06:16.469> five

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:17.469 
for example we feel the five and five

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:21.659 
for example we feel the five and five
here<00:06:17.769> at<00:06:19.110> this<00:06:20.110> time<00:06:20.379> you<00:06:21.279> may<00:06:21.309> notice<00:06:21.639> that

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
here at this time you may notice that

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.179 
here at this time you may notice that
our<00:06:21.819> agent<00:06:22.209> will<00:06:22.419> follow<00:06:22.689> the<00:06:23.199> ground<00:06:23.499> to

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:24.189 
our agent will follow the ground to

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:28.619 
our agent will follow the ground to
subtly<00:06:25.619> we<00:06:26.619> solve<00:06:26.860> any<00:06:27.069> problem<00:06:27.639> let's<00:06:28.419> make

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:28.629 
subtly we solve any problem let's make

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:35.909 
subtly we solve any problem let's make
the<00:06:28.809> frame<00:06:29.619> longer<00:06:34.079> we<00:06:35.079> will<00:06:35.379> follow<00:06:35.739> the

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
the frame longer we will follow the

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:41.519 
the frame longer we will follow the
ground<00:06:39.149> so<00:06:40.149> this<00:06:40.389> is<00:06:40.419> an<00:06:40.659> introduction<00:06:41.079> of<00:06:41.379> the

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:41.529 
ground so this is an introduction of the

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:43.290 
ground so this is an introduction of the
ground<00:06:41.769> channel<00:06:42.219> in<00:06:42.369> the<00:06:42.550> next<00:06:42.849> video<00:06:42.999> we<00:06:43.269> are

ground channel in the next video we are

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.839 
ground channel in the next video we are
going<00:06:43.389> to<00:06:43.689> introduce<00:06:44.469> the<00:06:44.800> agency<00:06:45.459> to<00:06:45.489> follow

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:45.849 
going to introduce the agency to follow

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:48.209 
going to introduce the agency to follow
the<00:06:46.149> angle<00:06:46.719> of<00:06:46.809> this<00:06:47.019> terrain<00:06:47.409> thank<00:06:48.009> you<00:06:48.099> for
