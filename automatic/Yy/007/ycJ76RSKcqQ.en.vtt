00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:05.430
 At the moment, Ventana can do better sport Federer looks tense as well 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.690
 yesterday 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.290
 There was a short interview here and the press conference 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.430
 by the way, verbal was not there he completely rested 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:21.050
 Sacrificed number two physiotherapists shortly shorn it's all okay that 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.380
 Nadal's most important was that he return as soon as possible 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.009
 to fill up the memory that means a lot is meanwhile that is one 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.810
 Training do clean up tennis players so much that during intense 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.550
 Strength training is immediately what to eat No the DAX is for example 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.300
 do the indexed I prefer to go to the former 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.410
 fitness coach 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.530
 additional 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.840
 Tension rises 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.260
 the pulse too 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.350
 with all involved 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.630
 for Federer 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.260
 he has yesterday again 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.060
 said it is very important that he is well out of the starting blocks that he 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.700
 both reserved 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.790
 sounds all matches looked at 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.090
 a curious day of the ko-match that the power failed at him in the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.280
 hotel 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.680
 Light did not go on TV I went through good trained Scholz 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.130
 together 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.420
 he came late in the afternoon 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.890
 early evening Katrin Hirtz 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.440
 went out for a meal and saw the end of the game in his hotel room 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.410
 the meantime everything was again directed by this extreme heat wave 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:33.010
 There were blackouts here over 300,000 households were affected in recent years 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.560
 Days in this region 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.780
 three times in a row 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.890
 Florian Mayer 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.040
 the gas 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.280
 the one in Melbourne 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.350
 never 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.690
 temperatures 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.690
 measured 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.369
 Adjust bottles 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.780
 he is on the big drink then out of the little one is with his two water 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.170
 in it 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.560
 Federer is waiting 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.560
 Holger Dahl Prof 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.400
 Percent for it 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.400
 Federer begins 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.369
 a big highlight maybe the tennis history 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:15.419
 on normal 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.459
 as it comes out deserve that both Federer served 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.039
 St 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.739
 JPY 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.439
 the decline z 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.439
 di Natale 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.289
 as well as usual, but of course not quite as extreme 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:11.660
 jump off 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.660
 they're on board and a bit cooler 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.489
 the relatively heavy 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.489
 pretty quickly 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.259
 there was exclamation 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.459
 without correction 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.949
 because then he thinks over the whole topic and Minister Bahr 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:36.610
 14 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.610
 he would have become NATO 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:58.259
 PT reader 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.660
 Door slump in the ProTour started with two teachers mistakes big was very 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.789
 interesting that Federer recedes after the outer one was played but 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.150
 the recession came off pretty well 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.699
 So, as I said, pure tension 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.699
 Nadal has no chance of breaking 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.759
 8th 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.550
 I can not do that at all 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.550
 he tolerates Rafael Nadal 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.479
 Nervous order value of Federer Troicki to feel 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.939
 Of course he too nibbles on it 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.300
 why not also invented 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.289
 normal person still today 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.899
 wakes up again and again an insanity thinks finale again 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.629
 and on the other, since his election, his first grand-slam title is definitely his 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:23.199
 on hard court 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.499
 wants to win 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:28.129
 which has steadily increased in this tournament since 2004 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.610
 2006 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.659
 Bauer injured could not attend 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.300
 last year helped find Finale this year 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.009
 more 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.900
 Hu has improved his game in many ways 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.749
 Quietly Shields sharper flatter 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:49.039
 Serve better changed ball throw 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.879
 Forums no longer fully penetrate even flatter 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.229
 pulled under the back of the chest 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.229
 is outstanding 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.830
 very far behind the baseline 

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:53.149
 Rethel 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.520
 the FÃ¶rderverein der Sicherheit 

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:39.979
 Meanwhile sat 

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:40.999
 that was it 

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:43.779
 No who the Fuldatal rally 

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:46.779
 ddp 

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:53.009
 Ben 

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:56.699
 Dr 

00:08:11.529 --> 00:08:13.619
 the kick 

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:14.189
 simple
