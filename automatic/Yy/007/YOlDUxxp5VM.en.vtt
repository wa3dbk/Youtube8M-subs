series of low-profile reels these reels

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.939 
series of low-profile reels these reels
have<00:00:15.750> been<00:00:15.870> specifically<00:00:16.410> designed<00:00:16.830> for

crank<00:00:17.279> bait<00:00:17.430> fishing<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.480> we<00:00:18.570> use<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> very<00:00:19.050> low

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
crank bait fishing so we use a very low

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.200 
crank bait fishing so we use a very low
gear<00:00:19.619> ratio<00:00:19.949> he's<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> five<00:00:20.490> point<00:00:20.789> four<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.090> one

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
gear ratio he's a five point four to one

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.689 
gear ratio he's a five point four to one
this<00:00:22.020> allows<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.529> really<00:00:22.859> wind<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.519> those
