my old one which one's my new one if I
ever<00:04:21.130> get<00:04:21.430> them<00:04:21.609> mixed<00:04:21.729> up<00:04:22.000> in<00:04:22.240> any<00:04:22.450> case<00:04:22.860> so<00:04:23.860> um

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
ever get them mixed up in any case so um

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
yeah there's the no.1 and you just

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.480 
yeah there's the no.1 and you just
reverse<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.919> procedure<00:04:30.800> it's<00:04:31.800> it's<00:04:32.190> not<00:04:32.430> that

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
reverse the procedure it's it's not that

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.029 
reverse the procedure it's it's not that
hard<00:04:33.320> just<00:04:34.320> put<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.740> bars<00:04:35.130> back<00:04:35.400> on<00:04:36.860> make<00:04:37.860> sure

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
hard just put the bars back on make sure

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.689 
hard just put the bars back on make sure
they<00:04:38.190> sit<00:04:38.430> in<00:04:38.550> these<00:04:38.750> little<00:04:39.750> cases<00:04:40.430> snap<00:04:41.430> the

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
they sit in these little cases snap the

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:47.320 
they sit in these little cases snap the
braces<00:04:42.479> back<00:04:42.690> on<00:04:43.699> and<00:04:45.169> put<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.259> screws<00:04:46.530> in<00:04:46.560> and

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
braces back on and put the screws in and

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.150 
braces back on and put the screws in and
put<00:04:48.330> everything<00:04:48.570> back<00:04:48.930> together<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.620> reverse

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
put everything back together the reverse

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.110 
put everything back together the reverse
way<00:04:51.199> so<00:04:52.199> pretty<00:04:52.740> easy<00:04:54.590> but<00:04:55.590> um<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:56.160> mean<00:04:56.490> I'm<00:04:56.789> I'm
