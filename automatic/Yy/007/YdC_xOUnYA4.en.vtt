 all aloha dear friends with you andrew 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.750
 and today we continue to do reviews on 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.600
 mods for minecraft 5 in the frame climbed 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.939
 bed and even a little cub bed 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.130
 but no matter dear friends we already 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.450
 a very long time did not go on the channel 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.540
 one video namely about two days but i 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.900
 I ask you to treat this with understanding 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.970
 everyone has their own cockroaches in their heads as someone 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.750
 wrote a comment all your ants in 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.449
 I have my own head, so I don’t 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.280
 worry everything will get better soon 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.359
 videos will come out every day and all 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.480
 will be perfect for bohemian and 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.239
 awesome 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.340
 so dear friends you probably already 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.350
 just a little bit well, live a little bit 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.780
 I wonder what kind of mod I am today 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.360
 I 'll show you the trash inadvertently scored 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.900
 in the meantime, I will throw you out 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.860
 never wondered where to go 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.070
 souls are lost 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.530
 mobs which we kill what remains with 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.960
 their bodies with their lifeless carcasses 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.710
 never wondered 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.360
 and the developer of fashion is exactly the developer 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.310
 This mod which I will show you today 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.770
 most likely accuracy also thought 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.500
 why talk and not make a mod 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.549
 which will tell us where 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.350
 All the same, our little dear calves 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.720
 tarakashek namely creeper skeletons 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.040
 zombie zombie peak mans and in general all 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.549
 all all all together 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.060
 here is a mod dear friends I do not know 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.950
 how do you understand but I realized that he us 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.350
 shows what happens to guns 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.579
 after their own beats in general i 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.610
 you now have one mob 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.170
 I will fill you up and you will understand what I can 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.630
 explain to infinity here let's say 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.460
 here the seo regatta is called Gregory 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.390
 if we kill him what happens he 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.729
 lost breathlessly to the earth and from and 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.520
 disappeared literally in a fraction of a second, but if 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.010
 Now we see that the volume 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.500
 voila it seems so slow 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.670
 dissolves and goes where right on 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.440
 heaven what cannot be what cannot 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.050
 be that that can not be bad 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.730
 on the contrary, it is good and just as expensive 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.800
 friends 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.090
 but with skeletons let's say we killed 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.940
 the skeleton and he is so quietly leaving the spider 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.209
 please see the same with him they 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.760
 even splitting up the price of the components 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.769
 your how to say your 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.900
 components of their modelki see something 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:49.180
 there is everything now about more or less 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.780
 due to the fact there is no such that here 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.739
 Wait limes there is a certain 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.220
 certain kind of problems 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.290
 they are divided into parts from here 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.379
 a little talk but with the rest 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.660
 mobs everything is fine that take German 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.180
 littered with the phenomenon, too, there are small 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.489
 you see problems like a skull 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.940
 Well, as a matter of fact, this is right 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.849
 realism we all have to dig in realism 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.879
 cave spider please hto it blaze 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.819
 Blaze cool now die that 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:25.140
 here it creates the effect of all these sticks 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:28.420
 they fly and actually disappear as 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.000
 as something I certainly wanted 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.010
 on this would have to finish but I'm here 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.579
 thought why don't we sleep 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.690
 Gusta and not try his kill that same 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:42.880
 will be if we kill gusta ohrenet 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.109
 just just awesome mod to whom 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:50.260
 it seems that the mod is bad uninteresting 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:52.569
 guys well seriously interesting mod even 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.239
 let's say if you kill a resident well with residents 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.430
 there is a corner for them and sadness 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.099
 the trouble is squidward if we kill 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.180
 squidward here too we will see just such 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:06.250
 from the death animation and that is summarizing 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.799
 dear friends that shows us this 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.470
 mod and if so superficially take it 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.319
 adds animations to the game with animation 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.269
 death mobs here but what if 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:20.919
 a little bit like that 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:23.919
 then he he he shows what 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.910
 happens to the souls of the dead after them 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:30.120
 killing but I don’t know such nonsense 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.770
 but you still need to say something 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.650
 but no matter dear friends principle what 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.370
 I have all my dear friends on it 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.160

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.470
 here are two videos a day I'll post it because 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.650

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.080

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.080
