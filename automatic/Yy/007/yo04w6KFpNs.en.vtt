00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.029
 in the ramón sanchez pizjuán el sevilla 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.160
 Espanyol receives in return the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.690
 quarterfinals and the cup of his 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.060
 majesty the king a seville who 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.059
 I needed to turn the result 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.850
 harvested on the way out last week in 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.660
 the cornellá-el prat stadium where the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.000
 Spanish had been imposed by 3 to 1 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.920
 sevilla that did not get ahead in 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.470
 the score until the end of the game and 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.539
 a seville that saw as the set of 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.090
 sergio gonzález as the parakeet 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.449
 he played a very serious match and he knew 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.999
 capitalize on that advantage wearing the 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.339
 first leg the first time the 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:44.159
 party just start this 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:46.799
 stopped ball shot by part of 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:49.409
 anaitz arbilla on the part of the ex lateral 

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:51.149
 del valleyo ray and it crashed in the 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:55.620
 Crucita of the goal defended by 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.839
 beto a Sevilla side who tried to attack 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.449
 throughout the game but for many 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.670
 moments in many phases he did with more 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.900
 heart that head maybe this was the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.700
 clearest 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.850
 of the first part for the whole 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.160
 sevillista in this incorporation to 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.630
 attack by right band on the part of 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.850
 design of what was and the auction of 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.740
 colombian carlos bacca 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.159
 that was going to the left of the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.170
 goal defended by pau lópez 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.270
 taking advantage of that error in defense sergio 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.229
 García was carrying the ball he was trying 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.880
 throw a vaseline to beto and to point 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.680
 was about to get a new goal of 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.640
 flag the captain of the royal club 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.540
 Sporting Espanyol Sergio Garcia 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.490
 it took a lot of danger to 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.040
 Sevilla defense throughout the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.230
 party despite the fact that Spanish was not 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.410
 the one who had the most along the 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.560
 party there we saw that occasion already in the 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.200
 second period when unai emery gave 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.120
 entrance to some soda men 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.500
 between ever banega that was that there was 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.770
 approved that shot with right leg 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.960
 and again sergio garcía almost out of nowhere 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.930
 I managed to make that situation for 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.820
 that his companion christian stuani 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.649
 finish off with the right leg already 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.300
 end of the match with the overturned Sevilla 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.670
 yes it is true that some 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.790
 occasions like this shot by kevin 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.100
 gameiro that played in his partner 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.420
 Carlos Bacca and he was going to the right 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.850
 of the Sevilla goal 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.720
 I needed two goals to be in 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.980
 semifinals did not find the way 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.080
 I found a way to do it 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.880
 first although they happened 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.850
 also those attempts from outside the 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.000
 area in this case was gerard deulofeu the 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.370
 former FC Barcelona player Catalan 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.590
 the one who tried fortune but could not 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.230
 find the way of the 3 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.110
 the espanyol that he defended with all 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.540
 Seville that also hung balls and 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.129
 with several men who stayed 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.140
 looking for the unique auction and 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.510
 exclusively in the last minutes and 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.150
 here the center of gerard deulofeu what 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.540
 Carlos Bacca finished off what finished off the 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.910
 Colombian to the right of the frame of 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.040
 lopez a stick that did not have much work 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.500
 throughout the game but yes that is 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.299
 true that it conveyed a lot of security to 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.430
 rest of his peers and in this action 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.280
 in this shot of diogo figueres arrived 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.360
 the victory of Sevilla 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.970
 so much that in the 88th minute he gave some 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.519
 hope to the set of unai emery for 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.209
 being able to get into semi-finals needed 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.590
 the more so the more the Seville picture 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.019
 after this work of art of God ' 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.350
 feiras that came in refreshing in second 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.740
 period 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.510
 but in that goal the end never came 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.790
 seville and I tried with the game 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.590
 direct with that kind of balls to the 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.020
 head of his men jump like in this 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.320
 vicente iborra case but at the end of 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.850
 I find Espanyol lost 1 to 0 but 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.350
 due to this advantage of the first leg will be the 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.350
 team that is in the semifinals
