00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.860
 days a week we can make it Monday 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.280
 Wednesday and Friday giving a day of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.379
 Rest between training and good training 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.610
 let's get down to work 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.400
 there 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.410
 well the first day on Monday we are going to 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.200
 make chest and shoulder 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.850
 let's make an ascending pyramid 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.370
 we'll start on the front to bench and 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.260
 we are adding weight in each series these 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.930
 are the first series to adapt 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:07.710
 a little bit and the pyramid will be again 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.710
 of 15 12 10 8 or even 6 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.830
 I do not want to see two parts 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.630
 after the pyramid the whole pyramid 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.840
 of the four series is the series 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.540
 Maximum maximum weight we will work 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.520
 among 68 repetitions and this is the one 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.200
 we really have to get to the fault 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.600
 muscular we will even do some 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.280
 negative if necessary we go there 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.010
 vega roberto up a good we 're going 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.940

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:42.660
 4 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:47.540
 5 + 6 follow follow go 7 above 8 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.540
 will take out an extra extra wall outside 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.640
 very good good we have changed the pressure 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.220
 inclined to the top of the 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.650
 chest we have already done the three series of 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.650
 ascending pyramid is the heavy the 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.110
 maximum and let's work that let's go 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.890
 about eight repetitions ok we're going 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.890
 to there to roberto 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.160
 above 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.269
 Hello 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:24.819
 come on 3 press the chest 4 very good yes 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:29.019
 sir 5 we go 62 good one plus one more 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.040
 one more tirale tirale vale outside out 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.950
 roberto yes sir 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.110
 ok we change exercise openings 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.480
 inclined at 30 degrees for the area 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.880
 high chest but good a little more 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.510
 under the goal is a pyramid 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.920
 inverted we start with the maximum weight 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.660
 We will reduce the weight to increase 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.130
 the replays and work more on the subject 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.850
 of red fibers 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.400
 let's go to roberto we'll work on this 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.620
 series to 10 repetitions is an exercise 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.580
 to locate and you have to make a 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.140
 very strict execution here and squeezing 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.170
 up holding the negative very well 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.830
 we go roberto very well squeezing the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.090
 pectoral sit down 4 go 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.090
 5 very well 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:25.239
 up 7 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:29.829
 come on 8 we go squeeze to burst squeeze 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:32.439
 they nine one plus one more up holds 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.379
 tighten squeeze ok 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:37.359
 it's worth keeping in mind that this is the 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:41.319
 heavy now we have to reduce weight 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:45.700
 It's worth to do more repetitions in the 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.819
 pyramid will be 10 12 15 18 or 20 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.049
 repetitions the last one is the lightest 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.480
 ok this is going to be the last exercise 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.159
 we have already worked heavy is not about 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.370
 working with weight is simply 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.919
 of locating and making the muscle 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.719
 then we are going to do a triple series 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.030
 of rest break of ten seconds 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:06.159
 OK 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.480
 Well better to explain it better you see it 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:11.530
 how are we going to do let's go roberto 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.350
 come on 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.910
 each series to do 15 repetitions is 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:24.070
 contraction pump 2-3 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:29.470
 4 breast pendant squeezing 5 go 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:31.090
 6 we go roberto 7 we go there 8 press 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.200

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.480
 come on 9 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.870

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:47.110
 11 come 12 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:52.440
 13 come 14 one plus one plus one more worth 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.440
 ten seconds of rest clock 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.150
 and we started trying to maintain the weight 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.030
 although we have to decrease a little 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:05.810
 the repetitions we go there roberto vega 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.810
 go ahead let's go hit a 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:18.629

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.319
 7 come on we finish the chest 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:27.110
 we ended up destroying what we're going 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:31.310
 good yes sir very well let's go 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:36.320
 good for the lowest 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:38.780
 very well beats 10 seconds of clock and 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.160
 we make another series this you can 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.590
 lengthen the series that you want 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.110
 I do not think many but with three today 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:49.570
 we have enough if we do not reach 15 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.570
 we will arrive at the fault those who are lazy 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.289
