the<00:00:56.940> coral<00:00:57.239> update<00:00:57.600> tomorrow<00:00:58.640> so<00:00:59.640> coralline

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
the coral update tomorrow so coralline

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.650 
the coral update tomorrow so coralline
algae<00:01:00.829> as<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.160> see<00:01:02.399> that's<00:01:03.090> why<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.300> there

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
algae as you can see that's why I there

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.509 
algae as you can see that's why I there
I<00:01:03.870> don't<00:01:04.080> know<00:01:04.170> if<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.589> tell<00:01:04.769> but<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.339> is

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
I don't know if you can tell but it is

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.200 
I don't know if you can tell but it is

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
you can see coraline right there a

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.710 
you can see coraline right there a
little<00:01:40.650> bit<00:01:41.640> right<00:01:41.790> there<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:42.210> only<00:01:42.240> see<00:01:42.600> the

little bit right there can only see the
lights<00:01:42.960> shining<00:01:44.630> coming<00:01:45.630> around<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> edge

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
lights shining coming around the edge

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.020 
lights shining coming around the edge
all<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> front<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.610> this<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.759> only

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
been a week and it's quite a bit of

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.870 
been a week and it's quite a bit of
coraline<00:01:54.000> growth<00:01:55.759> like<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:59.399> see<00:01:59.670> is

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
coraline growth like on there and see is

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.230 
coraline growth like on there and see is
way<00:02:00.479> more<00:02:00.689> than<00:02:00.750> there<00:02:01.020> was<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:02.790> snail

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
way more than there was on a snail

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.240 
way more than there was on a snail
there's<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.869> bunch<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.770> can't<00:02:04.979> see<00:02:05.130> it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
there's a bunch but you can't see it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.219 
there's a bunch but you can't see it
really<00:02:06.020> that's<00:02:07.020> right<00:02:07.649> there's<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.060> fallacy

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
really that's right there's a fallacy

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.510 
really that's right there's a fallacy

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
actually know that started to grow a lot

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:20.990 
actually know that started to grow a lot
in<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.849> past<00:02:12.000> couple<00:02:12.150> days<00:02:19.400> on<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.640> back<00:02:20.970> of

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
in the past couple days on the back of

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.920 
in the past couple days on the back of
that<00:02:22.220> see<00:02:23.220> some<00:02:23.430> more<00:02:26.420> gotta<00:02:27.420> put<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.750> lens

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
that see some more gotta put the lens

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.860
