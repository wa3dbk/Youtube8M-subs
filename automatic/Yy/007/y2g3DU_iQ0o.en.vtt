00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.839 
you the stability this thing so I'm
putting<00:03:03.940> some<00:03:04.120> pressure<00:03:04.239> into<00:03:04.810> it<00:03:05.639> it'll<00:03:06.639> move

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
putting some pressure into it it'll move

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.280 
putting some pressure into it it'll move
a<00:03:07.000> little<00:03:07.180> bit<00:03:07.420> but<00:03:07.630> does<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:07.989> play

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
a little bit but does it play

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.220 
a little bit but does it play
it's<00:03:08.829> like<00:03:09.010> wobbly<00:03:09.609> necessarily<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.750> then

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
it's like wobbly necessarily and then

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.190 
it's like wobbly necessarily and then
you<00:03:12.160> know<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.310> don't<00:03:13.120> have<00:03:13.389> any<00:03:13.660> reason<00:03:14.019> to<00:03:14.109> do

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
you know I don't have any reason to do

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.650 
you know I don't have any reason to do
this<00:03:14.410> like<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.799> can<00:03:16.079> turn<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.290> bike<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:18.660> think

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
this like you can turn the bike I think

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.129 
this like you can turn the bike I think
we'll<00:03:19.840> be<00:03:19.959> good

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
we'll be good

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:53.470 
we'll be good
owner<00:03:20.769> shorter<00:03:21.370> second<00:03:21.970> here<00:03:25.380> being<00:03:26.380> careful

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.210 

okay<00:03:55.460> so<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:57.480> lowering<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.200> where<00:03:58.740> this<00:03:58.890> same

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
okay so the lowering is where this same

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.820 
okay so the lowering is where this same
kind<00:03:59.490> of<00:03:59.520> suckers<00:03:59.940> put<00:04:00.900> my<00:04:01.020> lip<00:04:01.230> lock<00:04:01.530> back

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
kind of suckers put my lip lock back

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:10.550 
kind of suckers put my lip lock back
underneath<00:04:02.130> I<00:04:03.170> think<00:04:04.170> goes<00:04:04.380> down<00:04:07.910> so<00:04:09.560> what

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
underneath I think goes down so what

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.470 
underneath I think goes down so what
I've<00:04:10.680> been<00:04:10.890> doing<00:04:11.190> this<00:04:11.310> grabbing<00:04:11.820> of<00:04:12.240> a

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
I've been doing this grabbing of a

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.680 
I've been doing this grabbing of a
ground<00:04:12.960> hand<00:04:13.500> bar<00:04:14.060> coming<00:04:15.060> up<00:04:15.240> which<00:04:15.390> on<00:04:15.570> the

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
ground hand bar coming up which on the

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.340 
ground hand bar coming up which on the
side<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.320> then<00:04:17.010> kind<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.430> light<00:04:17.670> pressure<00:04:18.350> and

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
side and then kind of light pressure and

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.090 
side and then kind of light pressure and
just<00:04:19.500> being<00:04:19.830> careful<00:04:21.140> actually<00:04:22.140> these<00:04:22.440> these

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
just being careful actually these these

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.210 
just being careful actually these these
things<00:04:23.400> right<00:04:23.670> here<00:04:23.700> lock<00:04:24.480> into<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.840> ground

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
things right here lock into the ground

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.650 
things right here lock into the ground
this<00:04:26.220> make<00:04:26.550> things<00:04:26.880> run<00:04:27.240> a<00:04:27.300> little<00:04:27.420> bit

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
this make things run a little bit

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.300 
this make things run a little bit
smoother<00:04:28.140> these<00:04:28.470> little<00:04:28.740> knobs<00:04:30.830> so<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:32.070> lock

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
smoother these little knobs so that lock

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.670 
smoother these little knobs so that lock
down<00:04:33.620> blew<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:34.770> now<00:04:35.720> light<00:04:36.720> pressure<00:04:36.990> on<00:04:37.169> pedal

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
down blew it now light pressure on pedal

00:04:37.680 --> 00:05:07.380 
down blew it now light pressure on pedal
Oh<00:04:46.100> locking<00:04:47.100> bars<00:04:47.280> liege
