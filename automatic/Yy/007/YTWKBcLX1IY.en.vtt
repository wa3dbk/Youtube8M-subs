eleven part puzzle that each car is

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.630 
eleven part puzzle that each car is
composed<00:02:10.750> on<00:02:10.959> so<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.500> doesn't<00:02:11.530> only<00:02:12.220> allow<00:02:12.489> us

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
composed on so it doesn't only allow us

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.670 
composed on so it doesn't only allow us
to<00:02:12.790> have<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.300> aesthetic<00:02:13.630> options<00:02:14.200> but<00:02:14.650> also

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
to have the aesthetic options but also

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.039 
to have the aesthetic options but also
the<00:02:15.069> performance<00:02:15.459> options<00:02:16.120> now<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:16.750> we've

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
the performance options now that we've

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.539 
the performance options now that we've
done<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.470> we're<00:02:17.890> going<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.069> slip<00:02:18.310> back<00:02:18.519> to

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
done that we're going to slip back to

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.460 
done that we're going to slip back to
another<00:02:18.970> character<00:02:19.360> class<00:02:19.780> we're<00:02:20.319> going<00:02:20.410> to

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
another character class we're going to

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.370 
another character class we're going to
choose<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.250> Camaro<00:02:21.700> again<00:02:22.090> but<00:02:22.660> in<00:02:22.900> terms<00:02:23.170> of

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
choose the Camaro again but in terms of

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.979 
choose the Camaro again but in terms of
a<00:02:23.620> street<00:02:24.010> car<00:02:24.310> now<00:02:24.760> street<00:02:25.120> cars<00:02:25.330> are<00:02:25.599> great

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
a street car now street cars are great

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.170 
a street car now street cars are great
in<00:02:26.230> terms<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.769> handling<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.910> they<00:02:27.970> have<00:02:28.150> a

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.360 
in terms of handling and they have a
decent<00:02:28.480> enough<00:02:28.989> speed<00:02:29.349> to<00:02:29.560> allow<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.190> be

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
decent enough speed to allow you to be

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.680 
decent enough speed to allow you to be
really<00:02:31.030> competitive

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
really competitive

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.199 
really competitive
during<00:02:32.049> street<00:02:32.349> races<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:32.890> as<00:02:33.400> Val<00:02:33.670> races<00:02:34.060> in

during street races and as Val races in
general<00:02:34.569> so<00:02:35.290> we're<00:02:35.410> going<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.590> take<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:36.549> same

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
general so we're going to take the same

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.750 
general so we're going to take the same
model<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.690> car<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:39.790> it's<00:02:40.120> available

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.430 

I<00:02:42.790> came<00:02:43.360> out<00:02:43.510> state

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.230 

there<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:50.950> can<00:02:51.130> see<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.640> slower

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
there it is and you can see it slower

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.750 
there it is and you can see it slower
it's<00:02:52.990> not<00:02:53.230> as<00:02:53.380> wide<00:02:53.590> it's<00:02:53.980> not<00:02:54.190> as<00:02:54.310> high<00:02:54.520> up

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
it's not as wide it's not as high up

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.340 
it's not as wide it's not as high up
doesn't<00:02:55.480> have<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.750> same<00:02:55.930> sort<00:02:56.290> of<00:02:58.050> tires<00:02:59.050> or

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
doesn't have the same sort of tires or

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.390 
doesn't have the same sort of tires or
chassis<00:02:59.740> on<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.040> too

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
chassis on it too

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.640 
chassis on it too
let's<00:03:00.730> do<00:03:00.850> a<00:03:00.910> little<00:03:00.970> bit<00:03:01.209> of<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.650> aesthetic

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
let's do a little bit of a aesthetic

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.120 
let's do a little bit of a aesthetic
customization<00:03:03.459> maybe<00:03:04.030> with<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.510> rims<00:03:05.130> these

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
customization maybe with the rims these

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.160 
customization maybe with the rims these
rims<00:03:06.340> are<00:03:06.520> cool<00:03:06.730> but<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.209> think<00:03:07.420> we<00:03:07.720> can<00:03:07.840> find

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
rims are cool but I think we can find

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.650 
rims are cool but I think we can find
something<00:03:08.380> at<00:03:08.620> just<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.310> tad<00:03:09.580> fancier

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.680 

there<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.350> go<00:03:14.740> happy<00:03:15.490> with<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:15.790> let's<00:03:16.540> go

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
there you go happy with that let's go

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.010 
there you go happy with that let's go
for<00:03:16.870> it

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
for it

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.350 
for it
let's<00:03:17.230> go<00:03:17.410> out<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.860> maybe<00:03:18.100> do<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.400> skill<00:03:19.090> in<00:03:19.240> New

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
let's go out and maybe do a skill in New

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.860 
let's go out and maybe do a skill in New
York<00:03:20.670> maybe<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.760> slant<00:03:22.120> on<00:03:22.240> scale<00:03:22.570> something

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
York maybe a slant on scale something

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:34.660 
York maybe a slant on scale something
that<00:03:23.230> people<00:03:23.740> haven't<00:03:24.040> seen

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.600 

reckless<00:03:35.480> driving<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.110> effect<00:03:36.650> streets<00:03:37.490> of

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
reckless driving and effect streets of

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.340 
reckless driving and effect streets of
Brooklyn

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.780 

so<00:03:45.350> there<00:03:45.560> are<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.770> skills<00:03:46.130> popping<00:03:46.610> up

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
so there are the skills popping up

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.699 
so there are the skills popping up
different<00:03:47.390> challenges<00:03:47.870> different<00:03:48.319> events

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
different challenges different events

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.920 
different challenges different events
there<00:03:49.069> were<00:03:49.190> hundreds<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:50.240> hundreds<00:03:50.810> of

they're still driving together and this

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.080 
they're still driving together and this
skill<00:04:04.459> is<00:04:05.420> a<00:04:05.480> slam<00:04:05.900> skill<00:04:06.440> each<00:04:07.069> gate<00:04:07.459> now<00:04:07.910> I've

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
skill is a slam skill each gate now I've

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.940 
skill is a slam skill each gate now I've
seen<00:04:08.270> a<00:04:08.330> lot<00:04:08.600> of<00:04:08.720> people<00:04:08.959> play<00:04:09.170> this<00:04:09.380> and<00:04:09.739> just

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
seen a lot of people play this and just

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.400 
seen a lot of people play this and just
bomb<00:04:10.280> as<00:04:10.670> fast<00:04:10.940> as<00:04:11.180> possible<00:04:11.630> that's<00:04:11.989> not<00:04:12.260> the

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
bomb as fast as possible that's not the

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.320 
bomb as fast as possible that's not the
way<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.560> get<00:04:12.830> the<00:04:12.920> best<00:04:13.100> scores<00:04:13.459> best<00:04:14.120> way<00:04:14.300> to

get the best scores is to control

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.460 
get the best scores is to control
exactly<00:04:16.820> your<00:04:17.209> trajectory<00:04:17.419> so<00:04:18.200> it's<00:04:18.320> that

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
exactly your trajectory so it's that

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.300 
exactly your trajectory so it's that
sweet<00:04:18.650> spot<00:04:19.040> between<00:04:19.570> avoiding<00:04:20.570> traffic
