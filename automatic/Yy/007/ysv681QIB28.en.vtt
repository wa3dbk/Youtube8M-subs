00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.050
 hello friends with you portal 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.040
 perfect and dot com and talk today 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.040
 about smartphone in 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.180
 disputes on the internet after prostatitis 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.710
 such photos of this device the 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.840
 police suspicion that you are not at all 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.960
 there is and as they say only 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.270
 not necessarily and not new 130 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.950
 really exist offer more 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.900
 get acquainted with the device and 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.310
 find out the developers were successful 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.100
 the effects of the disease that suffered 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.720
 younger brother to complete a special 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.550
 attention will not rush she 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.320
 standard 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.960
 The body of the smartphone is completely made of 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.730
 soft touch plastic from which than 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.790
 would hide fingerprints and hard 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.190
 herself go around the perimeter of the ends 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.640
 stretches pseudo metal edging and 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.260
 it will be quite spectacular despite 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.929
 its impressive size phone lies 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.940
 in hand very comfortable and as for 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.500
 design in general in any particular 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.170
 difference from the previous ring and run 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.850
 everything is still minimalist gracefully 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.710
 decorated 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.510
 the only thing that spoils the positive 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.510
 feeling of the look of the device so 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.730
 this build quality 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.380
 the body squeaks I think that the body 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.540
 any apparatus no matter how 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.450
 which segment from belongs to any 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.800
 moderate impact don't have to say 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.240
 before proceeding to the location 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.880
 elements on the body and let's listen 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.140
 what is under the cover secondly this 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.610
 slot for micro sd card 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.320
 according to information from the internet here 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.320
 up to 64 cards are supported 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.260
 gigabyte however so here are the cards of a friend 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.690
 the opinion was therefore a certainty 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.070
 there will be no prague information 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.410
 was located for 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.400
 two sim card slots first with only 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.820
 gps support 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.840
 and the second also with support for 3g networks and 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.810
 last thing I wanted to show you from here 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.180
 This is a battery capacity of 2000 250 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.310
 milliampere hours 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:02.890
 let's assemble the devices now 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:05.289
 and look at the location on the front 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.299
 the panels are located on top of the sensors 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.979
 approximation and illumination but 3 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.550
 megapixel front camera 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.050
 screen size is 5 inches and 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.160
 you are on this set of buttons 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.050
 android menu home and back on the back 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.580
 panels are located 8 megapixel 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.750
 camera led flash 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:29.890
 company logo or joke dynamics 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:33.400
 bottom microusb port and microphone on the right 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.410
 butt end only volume rocker left 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.660
 butt from generally smooth on top 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.799
 is located the power key and 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.010
 standard trans half 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.410
 millimeter jack for a few jack 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.819
 words about device firmware 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.440
 Initially, the smartphone worked under android 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.810
 4 1 with branded user 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.310
 it came to interfaces from lenovo 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.870
 reflash it was not possible 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.030
 install google play 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.920
 and there was no Russian language go 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.780
 received only on the firmware in which 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.390
 work hard to get here and put 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.209
 gave samsungovsky touchwiz now 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.799
 let's talk about the game is not here until 5 inch 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:12.670
 ips lcd screen resolution 960 by 540 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.859
 dots pixel density reaches 245 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.290
 so she has pretty saturated 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.299
 high color reproduction 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.060
 maximum brightness and wide angles 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:25.060
 review this put some pictures 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.700
 in full hd resolution you could in this 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.389
 make sure 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.780
 the only thing to note here 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:34.450
 that when tilted, the brightness drops a little 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.620
 although the color rendering remains the same 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.639
 screen quality plan this device 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.700
 proposed 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:46.810
 its predecessor namely lenovo 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.590
 a820 and 830 is based on quad 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.920
 mtk types mt65xx 9 frequency controlled 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.010
 1 2 gigahertz responsible for graphics power 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.230
 vr ice jig 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.930
 44 bp amount of RAM 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.159
 is 1 gigabyte as for 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.950
 internal memory then here she is 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.980
 is 4 gigabytes but micro sd slot 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.450
 will be able to completely fix this problem 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.269
 Of course the unit is equipped with a gyroscope and 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.040
 also modules gps and Wi-Fi considering 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.569
 smartphone price classes to manufacturer 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.459
 the wall would have no complaints 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.019
 if the video content was high 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:28.970
 permission lost without lag and 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:30.979
 hangs the machines to the gods say what 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.770
 Are you concerned with their 8 megapixel camera ? 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.050
 then it will not be your abilities 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.240
 take a photo you can look at 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.800
 Our site did not like the court that 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.880
 autofocus is not rarely mistaken and 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.770
 it happens mostly when 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.530
 macro photography let's do it together now 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.530
 take a picture and see how it goes 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.940
 let's focus 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.000
 see the picture is blurred and even very 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.510
 this is unacceptable to us an answer to eight 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.190
 megapixel camera don't see it 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.990
 practical benefits but still emphasize 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.520
 that in custom firmware you are given 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.720
 ability to customize the front camera 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.889
 over 5 and the back is 12 megapixels and another 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.449
 a few words about the dynamics 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.770
 outgoing skills sound these loud need 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.960
 answer for your frequency 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.280
 The situation is similar when 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.430
 sounding through headphones 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.410
 let me put you music now not 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.479
 I know how well it will be heard through 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.479
 camera microphone yet 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.490
 but 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.500
 well, like this 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.300
 note a few pros and cons 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.280
 This device to the pluses can be 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.140
 carry case materials nice 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.370
 quality screen design is not bad 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.560
 performance in games and other 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.870
 applications as well as a long time 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.670
 battery life 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.350
 minus is not very high-quality assembly 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.820
 lags and freezing during 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.480
 high video playback 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.520
 by permission 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.130
 By the way, it should be noted that the problem is 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.510
 and the previous model was generally possible 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.620
 confidently say that the device with such 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.660
 a set of positive or negative 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.640
 qualities definitely has the right to 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.290
 existence and what this model is full 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.680
 It turned out much more interesting than me 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.430
 predecessor for today all with you 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.500
 there was a portal 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.860
 interns city ​​thanks for watching 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.860
 I'll see you
