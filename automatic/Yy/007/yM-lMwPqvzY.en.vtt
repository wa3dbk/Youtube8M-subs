00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.589
 first kill second kill what's up 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.210
 youtube also happens to scorpions beck am 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.500
 start that for you and warmly 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.780
 welcome here to another 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.030
 Gameplay arrives at the main channel today 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.230
 The reason again free for everything 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.730
 I'm very sorry but I show that 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.010
 Gameplay for two reasons firstly 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.510
 because sovereign yes there was none 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.800
 Almost not at all youtube 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.000
 almost no savran gameplay 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.789
 seen in this factory with the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.109
 weird gas will leak what 3 for 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.279
 the area at the round here disadvantage 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.539
 because we are completely honest I am anyway 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.740
 the biggest sound cloth and if that 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.790
 then nothing is seen 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.899
 for the problem of course because of me 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.980
 eh only on sound games I can do it 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.300
 Just kill like I want 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.500
 because they really are not 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.000
 could withstand more, however, the pretty 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.850
 has done stupid used the whole 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.950
 yes, the second reason is the weapon 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.390
 and that you have seen already in office 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.410
 what makes the rest but with the eu 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.850
 we have to look in any case over 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.149
 in the case of power so stark form 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.649
 nails look that are so 2 1 490 you 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.690
 mate on the left side of it 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.770
 an equal sign if i have 2 1 40 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.170
 mate what do we have a biology 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.879
 Of course, a weapon will come out 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.079
 and before we got started 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.820
 Of course not much to call this weapon 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.739
 she will not know yes it will be 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.180
 weapon that even looks like the 194 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.460
 where it already thought it was 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.619
 one and yes people I present you 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.880
 today as the title says mine 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.110
 favorite hope the best thrower or 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.240
 even the Swiss weapons have no idea 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.830
 as they wanted to call in any case the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.659
 ak 12 I have decided now 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.590
 I have the whole two weeks until now 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.840
 three weeks I just sit 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.979
 let think about which weapons 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.390
 are now deserving the new swiss 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.869
 to become weapons and it is damned 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.979
 again the ak 12 the weapon at it 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.240
 everyone said at the beginning that 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.430
 the weapon that is from therefore 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.270
 do not congratulate you on any weapon you are 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.460
 just the weapon that suits me best 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.290
 I like it is just so completely honest 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.340
 At that time, expanded magazine and 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.780
 this is probably the one who is leaving 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.509
 absolute madness as a small weapon 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.430
 the recall is absolutely on the neck of one 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.020
 correctness had really awesome 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.420
 what for that and that's why this weapon is 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.710
 just my Swiss weapon I have to 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.700
 here is still gold playing that is 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.869
 actually the next goal I was 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.390
 but should be quite honest 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.219
 that is so cool 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.240
 and yes, I just do not know 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.969
 I'm just happy that's one of those 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.590
 weapon I give my obsidian 490 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.909
 of course it will be able to replace it 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.280
 of course a really important one 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.049
 and big question, because honestly yes the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.360
 1 has already meant a lot to us 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.800
 in the black ops 2 2 what the weapon the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.220
 I made the whole game 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.200
 only the recorded and 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.400
 yes I'm very curious how the whole 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.250
 now it goes on here I will have 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.830
 yes the black ops two gameplay before three 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.690
 That can be days 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.130
 and of course that arrived very well 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.420
 and that's why I could 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.160
 imagine a bit more old too 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.210
 cds to show so black ops next case 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.040
 it saw you to ghost already full 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.550
 but do you think such a gameplay here 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.550
 on the website 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.120
 so the rest of us here ten like a 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.230
 already not so often 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.970
 has seen happy of course if 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.830
 it also cheers you so honestly 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.600
 all gymnastics strikes and so on high 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.920
 and I find it way over boring 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.209
 I think only one channel 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.100
 quite honestly seen tracks and gameplay 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.690
 what can you do that is always 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.770
 the same and so on and on load 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.270
 that I am a bit of something 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.980
 to do something different and that's why 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.330
 You should get this weird factory here 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.040
 sovereign or as I always say 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.390
 sovereign yes and yes if you asked 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.459
 why are you doing it to this 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.840
 Stupid topic simply because it lies 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.070
 Of course, I care a lot about the next one 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.900
 tip was confused I have that 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.310
 already told then but so recognizes 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.490
 the video the calm before the storm and 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.770
 then , for the first time, reference is made to it 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.750
 because the calm before the storm which means 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.160
 It was the the fact again before 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.930
 Big outside we knew nothing about 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.900
 the maps and the weapons and now 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.670
 after three packed weeks you know 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.680
 Again, everything about the game man 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.720
 Just know everything without shit 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.570
 there are the maps to choose from, you know 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.430
 immediately aha strikes without games i aha 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.600
 I do not play the map which takers 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:41.560
 at that time, for example, which one do I fit 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.910
 about all these maps oh degrees again 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.549
 I just played here with 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.560
 the anton the mp and solution and me 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.150
 am every time killed because strikes so 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.930
 what have you got with me now? 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.570
 already asked 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.400
 Without shit the folder recommends what is 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.489
 because storm supposedly strike sun 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.410
 stream of is just so shit man 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.820
 First of all, you can not see anything because of it 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.209
 the rain you hear nothing because of that 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.010
 rain 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.870
 the only thing you on the map 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.959
 The shots still sounded when the kill 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.959
 tomatoes 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:16.299
 the thermal attachment screwdriver 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.010
 again by then but the thermal 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.530
 abroad as well as through the rain sees 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.570
 he sees you have it, the run since 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.590
 back around like la la la la happens 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.570
 anyway nothing ground-death death thermal 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.600
 natural quality is natural 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.530
 evil as specialist reaches 15 yes 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.670
 I also still the old time 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.780
 turned off where I pull fast and me 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.090
 there had now I have I am 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.690
 last video mentioned only once 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.580
 breathe 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.020
 quickly where do I pull out of here 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.340
 heightens and now the gas comes 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.560
 What a shit this fights off 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.120
 come up with them from the espresso 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.440
 the map you just leaked that this 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.540
 and brown colors just looks 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.580
 not like no other faymann 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.140
 sand road with the iraq war age no 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.090
 plan what's going on in any case 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.980
 well the gameplay looks good, too 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.330
 here in ghetto zocker count the 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.570
 lobby very large type in any case 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.700
 certainly not abonnent that goes to you 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.530
 say to say to that 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.610
 say old marcel are you really paralyzed 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.680
 age I think I have to go to the 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.210
 go to school for dining again 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.210
 I have a year now fun 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.480
 I know that I remember that 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.130
 I once that fits the bin as if 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.480
 the video already canceled as well as completely 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.800
 many commentators that if already 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.150
 would break off the whole and now 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.710
 would do it again because then they too 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.090
 yes, that would say too often 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.050
 promised but I find something about 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.070
 gay because I am someone who can 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.180
 actually very good for talking because 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.640
 I promise so that's it 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.690
 just do not be so tough when 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.100
 Me or my promise then it is 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.870
 simply to style no idea her 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.550
 quite frankly knows my art so completely honest 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.050
 people who always cut the commentary 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.030
 even that is really boring or 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.680
 Write me the comments exactly if you 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.730
 Even so, real-life teams are better off 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.960
 just like I just do right now 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.100
 take it and start at the start 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.230
 little store or you will also 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.270
 this and there he is now running here 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.160
 along I speak extra slowly with it 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.320
 you can understand everything well though 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.490
 I invite you to come now and now 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.540
 the first cup because I do not first 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.400
 probably would have promised 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.020
 next sentence a bit annoying just bad 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.700
 not really boring because of that 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.330
 here this rocket was going for me 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.670
 use 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.310
 Twice even what's up with that 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.690
 Of course nothing but well if mine 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.070
 I would want to meet again 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.340
 subscribe scorpion placement because there 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.450
 arrives today at 15 o'clock as easy as 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.920
 It continues on the channel on each 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.500
 case there are three videos today 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.090
 So times a start as I said again 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.410
 all if you do not have enough marcel 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.440
 because I can already get it 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.610
 most blatant type of eu and fun so if you 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.750
 still want to see a few videos of me 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.289
 then you can bite 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.990
 to stop by does not cost anything 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.669
 costs nothing anyway I hope you know and 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.869
 because you can speak so many games 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:37.979
 from me see so today three videos 

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:39.300
 but not normally worry 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.099
 usually come on scorpion place 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.740
 two videos a day and on a channel 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:45.149
 here comes a video a day and see 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.289
 all the more and children liked more 

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:47.339
 so I tend to be a bit short 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.169
 would make videos 

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:51.300
 Honestly, if I like it all the time 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:52.439
 songs week out he had, so to speak can 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.270
 it was here, as nearly all of 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.499
 then I do not do so short videos 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.960
 but the one or clips here but 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:07:00.119
 it the most like anyway 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.550
 the kernel set triggered the whole 

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:04.020
 30,000 floor also leaves my friends 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.909
 and of course I am very happy if 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.050
 can take in this video you wenns 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:07.409
 could entertain me a lot 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.270
 looking forward 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:11.069
 two seconds and I'll soon see what 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.709
 they celebrate what did not run nicer people 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:17.839
 this place and then I say only 

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:17.839
 skin in until next time people
