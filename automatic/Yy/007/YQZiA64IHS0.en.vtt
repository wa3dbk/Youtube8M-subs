00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
so hey youtube in this video I have a

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:20.810 
so hey youtube in this video I have a
review<00:00:02.700> of<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.090> die<00:00:03.240> on<00:00:03.270> two<00:00:03.600> by<00:00:03.750> two

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.890 

in<00:00:21.820> case<00:00:22.000> you're<00:00:22.180> wondering<00:00:22.330> why<00:00:22.630> there<00:00:22.810> was

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
in case you're wondering why there was

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.870 
in case you're wondering why there was
no<00:00:22.930> unboxing<00:00:23.590> video<00:00:23.830> the<00:00:24.490> reason<00:00:24.610> is<00:00:24.849> that

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
no unboxing video the reason is that

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.150 
no unboxing video the reason is that
this<00:00:25.570> I<00:00:25.840> stole<00:00:26.260> this<00:00:26.410> cube<00:00:26.650> for<00:00:26.800> my<00:00:26.890> friends

and he has absolutely no idea that I

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.529 
and he has absolutely no idea that I
took<00:00:29.020> it<00:00:29.580> not<00:00:30.580> just<00:00:30.789> kidding

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
used Lubich Sontag your puzzles just

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.780 
used Lubich Sontag your puzzles just
saying<00:00:49.120> that<00:00:49.300> right<00:00:49.449> now<00:00:49.600> go<00:00:50.140> buy<00:00:50.379> it<00:00:50.440> it's<00:00:50.860> it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
saying that right now go buy it it's it

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.360 
saying that right now go buy it it's it
makes<00:00:52.000> a<00:00:52.269> huge<00:00:52.750> difference<00:00:52.809> on<00:00:53.500> almost

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
makes a huge difference on almost

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.789 
makes a huge difference on almost
everything<00:00:54.790> so<00:00:55.600> you<00:00:56.080> should<00:00:56.229> definitely<00:00:56.350> buy

everything so you should definitely buy

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.660 
everything so you should definitely buy

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
it and but now for the guy on 2x2 just

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.590 
it and but now for the guy on 2x2 just
sort<00:01:00.850> off<00:01:01.000> it's<00:01:01.210> really<00:01:01.629> fast<00:01:03.030> did<00:01:04.030> it<00:01:04.239> start

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
sort off it's really fast did it start

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.649 
sort off it's really fast did it start
it<00:01:04.690> out<00:01:04.809> pretty<00:01:05.080> fast<00:01:05.290> um<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.970> was<00:01:07.180> really<00:01:07.210> fast

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
it out pretty fast um it was really fast

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.100 
it out pretty fast um it was really fast
to<00:01:07.840> start<00:01:08.080> out<00:01:08.200> with<00:01:08.290> but<00:01:08.530> not<00:01:08.710> like<00:01:09.340> like<00:01:09.850> this

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
to start out with but not like like this

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.010 
to start out with but not like like this
I'll<00:01:11.110> show<00:01:11.170> you<00:01:11.350> an<00:01:11.500> algorithm<00:01:11.770> okay<00:01:15.840> yeah<00:01:16.840> so

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
I'll show you an algorithm okay yeah so

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.020 
I'll show you an algorithm okay yeah so
algorithm<00:01:17.500> flow<00:01:18.130> really<00:01:18.369> nicely<00:01:18.640> on<00:01:18.909> this

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
algorithm flow really nicely on this

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.240 
algorithm flow really nicely on this
cube<00:01:19.270> so<00:01:20.170> that's<00:01:20.380> one<00:01:20.560> high<00:01:20.770> point<00:01:20.979> about

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
cube so that's one high point about

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.690 
cube so that's one high point about
another<00:01:21.969> thing<00:01:22.240> is<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:22.659> cuts<00:01:22.930> 45<00:01:23.439> degrees<00:01:23.799> here

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
another thing is it cuts 45 degrees here

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.870 
another thing is it cuts 45 degrees here
45<00:01:25.180> yep<00:01:26.189> gonna<00:01:27.189> do<00:01:27.369> it<00:01:27.520> yep<00:01:28.119> a<00:01:28.359> little<00:01:29.140> bit<00:01:29.439> more

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
45 yep gonna do it yep a little bit more

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.700 
45 yep gonna do it yep a little bit more
yeah<00:01:30.880> pretty<00:01:31.119> much<00:01:31.270> it<00:01:31.719> goes<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:32.109> little<00:01:32.320> bit

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
yeah pretty much it goes a little bit

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.380 
yeah pretty much it goes a little bit
over<00:01:32.950> 45<00:01:33.340> degrees<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:33.939> that's<00:01:34.060> pretty<00:01:34.270> much

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
over 45 degrees and that's pretty much

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.099 
over 45 degrees and that's pretty much
it<00:01:34.509> and<00:01:35.289> that's<00:01:35.649> really<00:01:35.920> good<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:37.450> rubik's

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
it and that's really good the rubik's

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.240 
it and that's really good the rubik's
made<00:01:38.259> it<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.439> little<00:01:38.619> bit<00:01:38.799> better<00:01:38.979> with

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
made it a little bit better with

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.060 
made it a little bit better with
corner-cutting<00:01:39.729> but<00:01:40.439> yeah<00:01:41.439> so<00:01:41.619> that<00:01:41.770> helped<00:01:42.009> a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
corner-cutting but yeah so that helped a

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.969 
corner-cutting but yeah so that helped a
little<00:01:42.159> bit<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:43.420> also<00:01:43.810> i<00:01:44.380> just<00:01:44.619> do<00:01:44.710> a<00:01:44.740> song

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
little bit and also i just do a song

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.550 
little bit and also i just do a song
right<00:01:45.159> now<00:01:45.310> just<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.609> show<00:01:45.789> you<00:01:46.170> I'm<00:01:47.170> not<00:01:47.320> gonna

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
right now just to show you I'm not gonna

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.899 
right now just to show you I'm not gonna
time<00:01:47.710> myself<00:01:47.829> but<00:01:48.189> you<00:01:48.249> can<00:01:48.429> time<00:01:48.609> me<00:01:48.640> by

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
time myself but you can time me by

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.370 
time myself but you can time me by
looking<00:01:49.179> at<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.359> time<00:01:49.539> right<00:01:49.689> down<00:01:49.869> there<00:01:50.049> if

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
looking at the time right down there if

00:01:50.380 --> 00:02:03.380 
looking at the time right down there if
you<00:01:51.100> want<00:01:51.340> to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.179 

yeah<00:02:04.390> once<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.049> get<00:02:05.200> used<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.530> how<00:02:05.619> fast<00:02:05.920> this

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
yeah once you get used to how fast this

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:06.870 
yeah once you get used to how fast this
thing<00:02:06.399> really<00:02:06.609> is

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
thing really is

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.680 
thing really is
it's<00:02:07.329> really<00:02:07.719> good<00:02:08.800> like<00:02:09.670> yes<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.300> when<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.420> did

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
it's really good like yes and when I did

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.059 
it's really good like yes and when I did
my<00:02:10.810> first<00:02:10.959> couple<00:02:11.230> songs<00:02:11.440> on<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.769> they<00:02:11.860> weren't

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
my first couple songs on it they weren't

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.199 
my first couple songs on it they weren't
that<00:02:12.190> good<00:02:12.220> but<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:12.640> just<00:02:12.790> really<00:02:13.060> have<00:02:13.090> to

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
that good but you just really have to

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.390 
that good but you just really have to
get<00:02:13.420> used<00:02:13.629> to<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.290> probably<00:02:15.010> part<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.310> it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
get used to it and probably part of it

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.390 
get used to it and probably part of it
is<00:02:15.489> working<00:02:15.819> in<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.000> Lubich<00:02:16.330> as<00:02:16.510> well<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:17.650> and

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
is working in the Lubich as well so and

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.039 
is working in the Lubich as well so and
now<00:02:18.549> I'll<00:02:18.640> just<00:02:18.670> quickly<00:02:19.299> compare<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.959> the

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
now I'll just quickly compare it to the

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.520 
now I'll just quickly compare it to the
b2<00:02:20.560> because<00:02:20.709> I<00:02:20.920> do<00:02:20.980> own<00:02:21.250> one<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:23.170> pretty

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
b2 because I do own one and so pretty

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.400 
b2 because I do own one and so pretty
much<00:02:23.790> v-cube<00:02:24.790> -<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.450> has<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.690> different<00:02:26.200> feel<00:02:26.379> to

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
much v-cube - it has a different feel to

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.940 
much v-cube - it has a different feel to
it

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
it

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.250 
it
first<00:02:27.459> of<00:02:27.610> all<00:02:27.700> -<00:02:27.879> much<00:02:28.120> louder<00:02:30.959> yeah<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.019> can

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
first of all - much louder yeah you can

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.039 
first of all - much louder yeah you can
hear<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.590> difference<00:02:33.480> but<00:02:34.480> yeah<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
hear the difference but yeah the

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.569 
hear the difference but yeah the
viewcube<00:02:35.349> to<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.680> still<00:02:35.920> really<00:02:36.160> good

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
viewcube to is still really good

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.670 
viewcube to is still really good
compared<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.450> but<00:02:37.660> I<00:02:37.690> do<00:02:37.810> prefer<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.530> die

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
compared to it but I do prefer the die

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.589 
compared to it but I do prefer the die
on<00:02:38.829> two<00:02:39.010> by<00:02:39.190> two

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
on two by two

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.819 
on two by two
note<00:02:40.599> that<00:02:40.630> this<00:02:40.870> is<00:02:41.079> the<00:02:41.230> stickerless<00:02:41.560> one

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
note that this is the stickerless one

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.530 
note that this is the stickerless one
the<00:02:41.980> stickered<00:02:42.340> one<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.790> don't<00:02:43.269> know<00:02:43.360> how<00:02:43.480> that

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
the stickered one I don't know how that

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.970 
the stickered one I don't know how that
compares<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.140> v-cube<00:02:44.590> but<00:02:45.489> yeah<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.980> but

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
compares to the v-cube but yeah so but

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.490 
compares to the v-cube but yeah so but
overall<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.489> cube<00:02:48.790> is<00:02:48.970> great<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.870> really

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
overall this cube is great I really

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.460 
overall this cube is great I really
loved<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:52.420> would<00:02:52.569> give<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.900> 9/10<00:02:53.319> 5

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
loved it and I would give it a 9/10 5

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.150 
loved it and I would give it a 9/10 5
out<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:53.680> 10

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
out of 10
