00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:13.890
 and that's cool, it's ok, we'll continue 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.900
 I think how to use which 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.779
 identify in today's class 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.029
 I'll teach you how to revisit the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.400
 scientific calculator 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.270
 Let's assume you're making your 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.869
 calculations and numbers begin to appear 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:34.170
 undesirable in a strange way, 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.780
 Sometimes you have reconfigured your 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.430
 calculator in a weird way 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.430
 You do not know why they're showing up. 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.980
 some numbers you want is that she 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.390
 go back to normal so she comes back if 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.299
 she was before right 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.150
 when you bought the calculator then 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:54.510
 to reset scientific calculator has 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.670
 three forms of revenue is you first 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.769
 press the shift key 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.390
 Look here shift after mode shift 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.420
 then mode 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.060
 now you have three types of reset 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.390
 if you want to visit your calculator 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.630
 here you can click on a ninth digit 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.780
 on or 2 or on digit 3 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.890
 Clicking on the said you will result 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.030
 whole memory of your calculator 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.770
 clicking number 2 you will revisit is 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.320
 only the configuration of your calculator 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.270
 and clicking number 3 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.970
 you will revisit calculator as a 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.000
 everything is fine, you choose either 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.550
 to redeem the memory of the calculator is only 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.800
 click on one you come here everything indicates 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.979
 none and press the same 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.550
 If you want to rescue the memory, just 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.640
 you then click shift then bite goes 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:58.650
 get on that screen there clicking number 1 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.720
 just look here in an opinion here that you 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.930
 you are rescuing the memory now it's just 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.030
 tighten even and ready to work 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.780
 when I appear this tightness 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.580
 screen so you only reserve the calculator 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.549
 It's good to rescue the memory. 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:20.159
 Now this case if to reset 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:25.109

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:28.200
 2 reject setup right now 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.110
 close to 0 the same match here and ea 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.650
 configuration 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.670
 result of modclima is new 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.190
 the configuration being rescued now only 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.070
 here starts a new configuration if 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.140
 You want to make the calculator 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.840
 go back to how you bought it is to rescue 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.280
 the whole calculator is not at once 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:55.240
 it was only you to press shift bite the digit 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.180
 three here because it will appear 3 right now 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.310
