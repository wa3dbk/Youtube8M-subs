00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.020
 Hey guys, if you're playing in 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.600
 brain is in the active and that never 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.330
 Stay tonight, do not disturb it. 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.610
 sectoral and does not bother you you do 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:11.670
 a simple saying system is just one 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.240
 son up here there is only one time 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.700
 It takes time to leave, it's still there, right? 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.050
 active 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.210
 So how do you use it? Let's put it. 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:31.520
 to stay the night so we use tone 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:35.670
 barratt time 77 19 mil 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.520
 every time I saw an energy or about 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:44.480
 night to take hands 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:48.440
 to miss peaceful 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.080
 there is a certain personal and like what more 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.190
 has function is here you can put 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:59.769
 so when you use the arroba a vai 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:11.390
 for all the players then the bar lives 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:15.769
 to steal at 10 20 and 64 as it goes 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.540
 to run is like let's say so you 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.129
 it is not useful who saw that he had a 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.049
 name for many people their every 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:29.170
 so long you spend the time it does 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:33.230
 this is the time that only here activates 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.079
 comes 64 due to each for all 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.739
 people on your brain 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:43.200
 there runs command well the 21st and the block 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.739
 sure and without neckline the amount 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.739
 personnel and the other two functions leaves 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:55.680
 I think it's random that 's what you want. 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:04:00.209
 also show that the 2064 starts 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:03.709
 Does a just so personal 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.709
 the person arrives and sees the item 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.680
 It's these people you can use for yourself. 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.780
 Do not want to keep getting told you use usa. 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.090
 very a fourth item 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.850
 When you want, you'll arrive here. 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:22.120
 close and and it was catcher that would add me 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:28.840
 I 'll go on going. 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.840
 I do not know exactly what it's for 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.920
 exactly what it's for 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:42.020
 but this is his main choice right? 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:45.700
 Let's leave it to him to ign 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.700
 I like 5 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.629
 right to and type is only you have to serve 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.370
 yo gold is playing a creative way 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:58.669
 You will realize what you 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.199
 look here will not be at least 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:05.330
 I did not find any place I looked for 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:09.020
 enough there, people can not 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.090
 build it is not sure making the 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.250
 build but I do not think it's because 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.900
 they think people do not serve to build themselves 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.289
 ready 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.069
 His name is Commander Bloch. 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.659
 I'm probably not finished yet 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:26.810
 before in this version but I think it will 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:33.379
 have it but it 's how to generate it is simple 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:37.099
 type bar and 20 and its right name and 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:38.659
 like we the daily is 137 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:42.319
 When you type, will you see him? 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:48.669
 your inventory you put it in 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:48.669
 people put on whatever you want, right? 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.340
 769 thousand here 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.660
 the asset here is pacheco at night already 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.310
 here there is another 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.490
 configuration 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.650
 I believe this video is just that 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.470
 I wanted to show you, personally, want to 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.170

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:13.970

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:18.670
 Child, but it's okay.
