00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.130
 hey people cray xt and sincerely 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.750
 Welcome to a second video 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.250
 while i'm on vacation i hope im 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.930
 rest that the first video example 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.430
 has arrived and have in this video 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.970
 I once again a concept map for 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.410
 you start 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.580
 those who have been with me for a bit longer 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.689
 They have subscribed to each other 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.250
 case know that I personally find it a 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.840
 pretty big fan of such concept 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.070
 cards and so on 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.050
 like to show because I just something 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.390
 I think it's extremely cool and I like it 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.430
 Imagine if you gta 5 or even gts 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.750
 6 in such a big map 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.100
 if I had in any case 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.780
 pretty cool but I would say so 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.040
 just do not waste now 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.660
 even more time with it and look at us 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.969
 this card just directly to me 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.039
 guess most of you will be direct 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.530
 notice that there's a pretty well-known one 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.570
 timing this gta 5 card is and indeed 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.670
 at the bottom left you can do it directly 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.620
 Let's see the map of dos santos 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.570
 the map from gta 5 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.219
 and yes, what can you say about that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.199
 you definitely go to santos and see 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.180
 the complete gta 5 card this is here 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.559
 simply integrated and we look 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.060
 us but easy sometimes even 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.979
 the other cities are involved 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.229
 let's just go on for a while 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.960
 up in the north and there you can 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.250
 we can see that one can at the golden 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.990
 gate bridge can be seen here in the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.040
 north has and that if i look at everyone 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.630
 already cool if it is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.890
 not just a big city, but 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.450
 you have several times directly here 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.670
 big cities like in this case directly 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.920
 times in the north Saveiro then we'll see 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.930
 directly to the right of it in the east 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.159
 quite a big mountain and that's what you'll find 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.630
 I personally also pretty cool though 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.189
 It's not just cities and things like that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.900
 would just be a huge one 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.820
 mountain landscape then hear this 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.560
 this mountain landscape you with the gta 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.150
 5 card comparison is the bottom left 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.280
 then you can tell it's real 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.619
 a gps that really as big as that 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.509
 complete idea a5 card and find that 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.770
 I'm pretty cool because of such huge forests 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.509
 or something like that you could definitely 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.100
 hide some easter eggs for 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.990
 For example, you could do rockstar games 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.549
 since a big freeze install day or 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.930
 one or the other hut with one 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.860
 killer is eco or something like me 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.780
 Deputy me all in any case 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.000
 It's pretty cool, too 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.770
 as if the snow were lying and that 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.240
 of course I wish so synonymous who 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.530
 knows my wishlist videos will 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.390
 In any case, I know that too 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.070
 more weather animations wishes for gta 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.479
 5 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.950
 So you just have the whole year 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.520
 over snow and not only to 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.290
 Christmas time 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.610
 but since we are at snow 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.500
 Let's take a look right now 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.760
 the sand or the deserts better 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.680
 we just go for that now 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.970
 further south and there we can 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.390
 directly already the city of las ventas 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.520
 see which in real las vegas 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.630
 should represent and this city is located 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.820
 just in the middle of one 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.230
 coastal area and this 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.910
 desert area is of course again 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.250
 really big again comparable 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.020
 with the complete gta 5 card is called us 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.070
 There would be a huge desert area 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.990
 expect and I think that would be 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.430
 to be really bad about being offroad 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.080
 little to drive with the motocross 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.239
 with the buggy or with the new one 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.620
 controller could be there but right 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.060
 make horny offroad stretch 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.440
 In any case , I would quite like that 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.350
 cool and natural in the midst of this 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.300
 desert area islas ventouras so one 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.950
 right gambling metropolis where you 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.450
 then, for example, the casino times 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.950
 could enter in any case be real 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.810
 pretty cool 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.959
 then we go to the top right corner 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.180
 So in the northeast of this map and 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.489
 yes then you can also just lena 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.050
 So, in fact , the gta 4 map is looking at 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.940
 this gta 4 with was not changed 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.310
 but that does not matter to me personally either 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.299
 I think these cards or this max 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.200
 had not really changed 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.730
 I'll just find it pretty much 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.560
 cool that you have all these cards 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.760
 screwed together and I think so 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.260
 also pretty cool so if rockstar 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.910
 games are not necessarily a new card 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.480
 would have to create that would have the 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.709
 function 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.790
 they do not even have it from me 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.200
 do not have to do something completely new 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.180
 but they could just develop 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.680
 a lot of old things put together to one 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.540
 In any case, I find that new as well 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.579
 pretty cool and there is like 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.350
 also said the eta firm liberty 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.730
 city ​​as I said that if I look at everyone 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.590
 also pretty cool if this then 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.480
 would also be there and now 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.510
 Let's go to the last 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.160
 southeast of this map and there you can 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.660
 We also see vicecity 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.829
 this is definitely recognizable by this 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.450
 now go to these two 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.190
 peninsula and of course I think so 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.590
 also pretty cool white that needs 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.480
 of course, including myself and of course 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.709
 find this complete concept 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.120
 card just as I said really pretty 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.290
 cool to write 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.940
 but of course as always your opinion 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.360
 below in the comments what thinks 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.950
 you about it 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.600
 I'm definitely there as I said 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.459
 always evil the fan of it i imagine 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.650
 Always like to see how it is with us 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.440
 such a fat gta card then too 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.760
 play as I said you should 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.200
 your opinion on how to get into the bottom 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.940
 comments then just tell me 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.190
 a like da if this card is the same 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.299
 cool finds best a skin purely 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.299
 people your kremlin
