 despite coming from outside they are 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.770
 intimately linked with our interior 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.200
 by the law of resonance we can not 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.559
 get in contact with something with what 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.469
 we have nothing to do with the propensity

 the accident exists for a certain 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.760
 kind of people is a stop in 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.820
 our life that we should investigate from 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.659
 this new situation should arise something

 lh2 accidents are not accidental as 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:15.940
 everything else in our life does not 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.520
 we create them it's not about us 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.970
 let's say we want to have an accident 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.709
 but that our mental models 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.190
 can attract to us a 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:30.250
 accident it seems that some people 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.830
 were prone to accidents in 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.490
 so much so that others go through life without 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.580
 never make a scratch the accidents 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.160
 are expressions of anger that indicate 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.350
 an accumulation of frustrations in 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.190
 someone who does not feel free to 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.940
 express or indicate to assert 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.850
 also rebellion against the authority we 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.940
 we harden so much that we want to hit 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.940
 someone and instead the beaten ones we are 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.459
 us when we get angry with 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.640
 ourselves when we feel 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.820
 guilty when we have the need to 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.150
 punishing us an accident is a way 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.730
 great to get it can we 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.060
 it's hard to believe but the 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.910
 accidents we provoke 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.450
 we are helpless victims of a whim 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.060
 of the destination an accident allows us 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.209
 to turn to others to have compassion 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.660
 and help us while they heal and 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.180
 they tend to our wounds frequently 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.780
 we also have to do bed rest 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.950
 sometimes long and bear 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.849
 the pain accidents lh2 everything happens by 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.970
 a reason to accidents sometimes 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.100
 they happen to make us reflect on 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.970
 the course that you are taking in our 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.340
 life if you have an accident try 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.769
 reflect the reason why what 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.980
 you had although it seems strange that a 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:10.470
 event that seems pure bad luck have 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:13.840
 a deeper meaning meaning 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.970
 expresses an urgent need for 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.660
 rethink the path we follow 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.240
 so far according to the affected area of 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.610
 body means one thing or another 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.520
 possible solution 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:32.439
 of direction and focus of what we are 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:35.530
 making and taste of physical blockage a 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:37.750
 accident is an event not foreseen by 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.139
 what is often considered 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.810
 product of chance the important thing of a 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.599
 accident is to observe what part of the 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.169
 body is injured as well as the 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:52.330
 severity of the emotional block injury 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.030
 the accident occurs so that the 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.639
 person realizes that he feels 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.819
 guilty that is accused of something in the 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.150
 level of I am having an accident is 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:05.439
 one of the ways that humans 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.469
 they use to neutralize their 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:12.250
 guilt they think that's how they pay their 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:15.400
 blame unfortunately all this 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.189
 it happens in an unconscious way when 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.710
 the effects of an accident are what 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:23.560
 serious enough to prevent the 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.050
 person work or do something in 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.870
 special we are before a form 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:32.990
 Unaware of giving us a break 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.390
 this person would feel too 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.110
 guilty if I consciously decided 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:41.540
 give yourself a break mental block you should 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.870
 check your mental perception of the 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.240
 guilt according to our 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.840
 legal system a person is declared 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.900
 guilty when checked without a place 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.390
 doubts he wanted to hurt 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:59.600
 I intentionally suggest that you 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.970
 ask every time I accuse you is if 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.900
 You really intended to cause 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:09.980
 hurt if it was not like that stop accusing you 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:13.460
 there is no reason for punishment in addition 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:16.490
 when a person is guilty the law of 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.630
 cause and effect deals with it because 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:23.000
 everything returns to us according to our intention 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:26.600
 a prudent and responsible person is 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.510
 recognizes guilty when it is the case asks 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.910
 forgive the injured person and accept 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.600
 the idea that one day that will be 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.900
 returned to the conscious being will live it from 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.410
 a 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:42.350
 harmonious way in acceptance and you will know 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.949
 that everything is in order according to the 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:48.380
 divine justice if your accident was 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:51.470
 unconsciously provoked to 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.199
 to be able to rest it is important that you 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.979
 account that you could have allowed 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:07:00.020
 that rest without causing you harm 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:03.979
 using a much simpler medium 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:06.949
 openly raise your needs if 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:09.590
 your accident is important and it produces you 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:11.960
 a great pain like in the case of a 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.539
 fracture it indicates that you have 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.360
 thoughts of violence towards someone 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:20.449
 it does not matter that you are aware of 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.539
 them or not like you can not afford 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:26.300
 this kind of attitude and this violence already 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:29.720
 it can not be contained it turns against 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:32.449
 you must free yourself and express what 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.639
 you feel towards the person involved 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:38.000
 without forgetting to forgive you for these 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:40.669
 spiritual block thoughts for 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.520
 know the spiritual blockade that you 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.460
 prevents 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.889
 It was an important need of your being 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.889
 use the suggested questions
