00:00:16.585 --> 00:00:25.585
 Small bromeliad native to South America; develops long stiff and thick leaves, gathered in very dense and compact rosettes 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:34.869
 Among the leaves there is a large inflorescence, typically bright pink, consisting of bracts of papyrus consistency 

00:00:35.275 --> 00:00:40.275
 among which several small pink or purple flowers bloom within a few weeks 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.880
 Let's grow these plants in a partially shady place, with a minimum temperature not below 10-12 Â° C 

00:00:55.068 --> 00:01:03.068
 containers that are not too capacious are used, filled with soil made up of pieces of bark, sphagnum and peat 

00:02:14.114 --> 00:02:20.110
 The tillandsie do not like to have an excessively moist soil, when we water them we avoid to wet the ground 

00:02:21.202 --> 00:02:27.200
 but we fill the cup that is formed between the leaves, from which the plant will draw all the moisture it needs 

00:02:30.642 --> 00:02:37.640
 If grown in a very dry place, we periodically spray the entire plant with demineralized water 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.450
 When the inflorescence tends to dry up we can remove it 

00:02:49.398 --> 00:03:00.400
 if it is also drying the plant we will not throw it: most likely we will see at the base of the rosette being dried the development of new small rosettes of leaves
