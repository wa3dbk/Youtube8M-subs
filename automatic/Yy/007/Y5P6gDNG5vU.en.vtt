00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.330
 because it is very good today 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.680
 welcome gentlemen to this new video 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.110
 in which I am going to present you gentlemen 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.980
 my new project my new baby that 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.650
 I just launched 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.970
 a little while ago a couple of 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.650
 I throw it, gentlemen, and I'm very 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.970
 excited about it the call of forum 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.830
 duty zombies or carlos luque in 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.240
 general in Spanish this is a project 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.520
 that you have tried twice in the past 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.890
 It did not work because it's hard to moderate 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.379
 So many people and they want to try again 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.480
 starting from scratch starting from very 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.460
 down little by little to see if it's that 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.719
 I hope this works and if so 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.100
 moment has worked very well I did it 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.539
 public on twitter first I did 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.010
 public later in the description of 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.109
 yesterday's video but now I do them 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.730
 100% public so that you can 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.870
 know well these good gentlemen a 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.670
 Once you enter the page to the 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.719
 what do you fuck active point forum 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.569
 dot com 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.429
 before that the domain is a little bit 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.589
 ugly for this active forum but it's the 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.719
 price that we had to pay for doing it 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.129
 free in a certain way because the page 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.530
 main is active forum which 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.880
 allows free forums but if the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.570
 forum has a lot of activity we are going to 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.220
 give away a domain 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.930
 and after that we could choose a name 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.940
 father as call of duty hispanic dotcom 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.770
 or things like that but it will be later in the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.360
 future then you sitting in the forum 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.650
 gentlemen here they will pass the buttons 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.060
 register and login 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.070
 you register put your name on 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.810
 user your mail and blah blah ya ya 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.820
 later since they enter then they will be able to 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.260
 participate and answer and blah blah how 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.060
 a good gentlemen forum works first 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.770
 a forum works on the basis of categories 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.900
 the categories are like the themes 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.970
 generals of what is going to be able to speak 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.950
 within this at the moment only 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.390
 we have black ops 3 and suggestions because 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.940
 I do not want to do more because I want to have 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.250
 like everything well controlled but in the 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.440
 future you will be able to see more of 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.630
 these of these topics the expensive fans 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.250
 warfare anything of those these 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.210
 gentlemen in white 3 are just the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.850
 news section 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.950
 the sections are the subtopics of the subject 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.119
 general that already after it comes out 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.280
 black ops 3 then here we will see 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.899
 zombie multiplayer campaign not those 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.690
 three sections then right now 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.090
 They are within this news within 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.530
 the section you can create post or 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.690
 can create themes 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.610
 at this time there are only two subjects one 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.620
 which is a global announcement here below 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.300
 you can see the symbology of each 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.709
 one of these is a global announcement on 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.260
 which I did that will appear in all 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.420
 the in all the topics of the forums in 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.620
 all sections and this well that I 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.840
 he also says it's part of the little 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.600
 stress that I am putting you for 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.550
 a couple of days then you create a post 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.580
 and for example if we are in the section 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.230
 of created zombies you create one I found in the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.420
 secret song not then you create the 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.459
 post you put where each of the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.019
 parts of the secret song and after 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.330
 the people will answer you is true if 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.400
 is here and is not here maybe someone 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.620
 says the video of the song that is not 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.989
 the case is like feedback each 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.300
 post and yet gentlemen 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.819
 when I put this theme of evo evo 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.560
 evo that is part of the small distracts 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.260
 as I tell you that I'm putting you as 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.239
 can see there are in 400 voices answers 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.370
 now that's good because because there 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.410
 much activity however there is a 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.330
 term called off topic which 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.000
 means not related to the subject 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.670
 what is the problem that 80% of these 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.030
 412 messages 70 percent or so 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.459
 it's off 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.170
 because because many are not 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.050
 familiar with a forum believe that a 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.910
 forum is a chat believe that a post this 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.220
 it's a post from the main post called 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.680
 evo evo evo evo evo believe that it is a chat 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.170
 but it's not like that, gentlemen because 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.550
 not when you put a post is supposed 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.580
 that all that will answer the 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.200
 reference has to do with that post without 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.360
 However for example here I speak to him of voice 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.850
 put something right put what he found 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.310
 in the videos he used the information that he 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.900
 found but then he had advanced there 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.940
 many pages advancements for example 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.440
 here and I say I do not want to burn people 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.150
 I honestly do not want to burn people but 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.459
 you will find people who say 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.019
 web to submit whatsapp and pass me your 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.150
 cell phone number they are the costa rica 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.530
 where are you and another one responds to you I'm from 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.850
 mexico but I do not have xbox and this 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.550
 I would answer I'm going to sleep good 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.430
 nights I say it's okay they want 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.319
 socialize know but in a forum the 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.670
 posts are not handled like this if what 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.530
 you want is to talk like that 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.630
 They want to have a little group to talk about. 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.400
 a chat here gentlemen under the banner 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.560
 on the main page where you 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.120
 they give you to connect and they can talk to 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.340
 anyone with anyone 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.609
 that is online within the chat 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.460
 then let's put I want to give you love 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.680
 to pride then here you are already 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.930
 speaking out your username comes out 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.520
 your message and so you already have a chat with 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.410
 all the people online in that 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.010
 moment then I'm going to ask you gentlemen 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.930
 that the post in the future take them as 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.760
 what they are and not as a chat and that 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.380
 speak only about that because if 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.970
 someone wants to enter to see information 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.139
 of this interest because they see back will see 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.400
 many answers will be traces 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.780
 socializing by saying that they are going to 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.419
 sleep and where is all the information 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.770
 who wanted to look for it at the beginning 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.840
 well many people shared all their 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.960
 information but for example this is 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.760
 it just does not go there but 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.100
 it is necessary to put it in the post not what 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.990
 put on if it's something that has a 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.570
 answer as well as that direct as a 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.460
 how are you not going inside the post this is 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.870
 something very important gentlemen this is 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.860
 good already leaving that little 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.680
 rule when you register 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.729
 they will have a level which right now 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.680
 we are still working on it 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.659
 it's still not sure how this is going 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.449
 to work which is sub as its level 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:23.340
 of if it's a level within the forum do not go 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.919
 to start with human and the goal is 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.870
 that the better the user of the 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.639
 forum you are going up the level first 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.099
 human then zombie and then zombie 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.659
 special then samantha then doctor 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.150
 maximum be like to give you a 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:39.360
 little awards to good 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.979
 users but that's going to be with the 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.330
 time right now is not well implemented 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.009
 this anything I go 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.319
 implementing gentlemen I will create a 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.610
 new category or even here in 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:49.319
 suggestion changed the name or something 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.819
 so where will I be putting everything 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.490
 the new thing that is added to the forum 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:55.979
 the more I go forward not then 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.199
 would be all gentlemen for the moment I think 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.060
 down here you can see all the users 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.009
 here they can search 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.840
 can share here they can see their 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.340
 notifications can begin to monitor 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.080
 a theme so that all the 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.479
 answers of that subject can also 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.390
 make mentions when you respond 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:15.180
 some for example some data 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:19.650
 Some post can put the name of the 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:21.210
 user and they will look like the arroba or 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.550
 be the link to that profile 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.690
 user then I think it would be all 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.950
 gentlemen as I tell you here are the 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.840
 suggestions where you can report me 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.640
 mistakes or give me your suggestions that 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.860
 They want to see what they would like to see or 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.470
 it goes wrong in the forum or things like that but 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.270
 the moment that would be all gentlemen 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.530
 It can also be a post with rules that 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.410
 I know many people do not read but I want 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.480
 that is there to at least apply the 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.580
 said under warning there is no deception 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.140
 no and well sir that would be all for 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.460
 today's video I hope you register 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.290
