if you're whining at the airport if you

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.050 
if you're whining at the airport if you
if<00:01:43.259> you're<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> bus<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.009> know<00:01:44.579> wherever<00:01:44.790> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
if you're on a bus you know wherever you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.429 
if you're on a bus you know wherever you
are<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.360> take<00:01:45.509> your<00:01:45.780> entertainment<00:01:46.140> with

are you can take your entertainment with

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.830 
are you can take your entertainment with
you<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.740> well<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.939> you've<00:01:48.060> got<00:01:48.210> your<00:01:48.360> fourteen

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
you as well so you've got your fourteen

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.969 
you as well so you've got your fourteen
point<00:01:49.049> one<00:01:49.110> inch<00:01:49.350> wide<00:01:49.530> screen<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:49.950> I

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
point one inch wide screen that I

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.770 
point one inch wide screen that I
mentioned<00:01:50.280> earlier<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.670> has<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> maximum

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
mentioned earlier that has a maximum

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.350 
mentioned earlier that has a maximum
resolution<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.229> 1024<00:01:52.920> by<00:01:53.100> 768<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.299> you

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
resolution of 1024 by 768 so if you

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.910 
resolution of 1024 by 768 so if you
think<00:01:54.570> about<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.439> equivalent<00:01:55.680> of

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
think about it that is the equivalent of

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.740 
think about it that is the equivalent of
720p<00:01:56.579> resolution<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.450> kind<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.719> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
720p resolution so it's kind of like a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.810 
720p resolution so it's kind of like a
high-def<00:01:58.170> TV<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.130> great<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.369> watching

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
high-def TV so it's great for watching

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.510 
high-def TV so it's great for watching
your<00:01:59.909> DVDs<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.710> widescreen<00:02:01.710> now<00:02:02.100> earlier<00:02:02.460> in

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
your DVDs in widescreen now earlier in

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.609 
your DVDs in widescreen now earlier in
the<00:02:02.640> very<00:02:02.820> beginning<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.299> mentioned<00:02:03.619> speedstep

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the very beginning I mentioned speedstep

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.089 
the very beginning I mentioned speedstep
technology<00:02:05.630> what<00:02:06.630> exactly<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.469> speed<00:02:07.829> step

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
technology what exactly is a speed step

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.139 
technology what exactly is a speed step
and<00:02:08.250> what<00:02:08.399> does<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.580> do<00:02:08.670> it's<00:02:08.819> all<00:02:08.940> about

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
and what does it do it's all about

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.470 
and what does it do it's all about
saving<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.929> battery<00:02:10.289> life<00:02:10.470> how<00:02:10.649> fresh

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
saving that battery life how fresh

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.600 
saving that battery life how fresh
is<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:11.900> when<00:02:12.319> you're<00:02:12.470> working<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.340> proposal

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
is it when you're working on a proposal

you're almost done and that little

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.750 
you're almost done and that little

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
annoying bubble pops up and says hey

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.729 
annoying bubble pops up and says hey
you're<00:02:20.540> about<00:02:20.659> to<00:02:20.900> run<00:02:21.049> out<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.200> battery<00:02:21.349> life

to<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.340> lower<00:02:52.400> frequency<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.329> voltage<00:02:53.450> to

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
to a lower frequency and voltage to

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.349 
to a lower frequency and voltage to
conserve<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.859> battery<00:02:54.890> life<00:02:55.549> so<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.150> very

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
conserve the battery life so it's very

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.210 
conserve the battery life so it's very
cool<00:02:56.569> especially<00:02:56.780> if<00:02:57.049> you're<00:02:57.200> away<00:02:57.440> from<00:02:57.500> any

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
cool especially if you're away from any

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.500 
cool especially if you're away from any
sort<00:02:58.459> of<00:02:58.519> power<00:02:58.700> source<00:02:58.970> if<00:02:59.150> you're<00:02:59.269> sitting

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
sort of power source if you're sitting

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.119 
sort of power source if you're sitting
on<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.780> chair<00:02:59.810> that's<00:03:00.170> nowhere<00:03:00.410> near<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.680> plug<00:03:00.950> or

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
on a chair that's nowhere near a plug or

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.460 
on a chair that's nowhere near a plug or
anywhere<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:02.359> you're<00:03:02.629> moving<00:03:02.989> around<00:03:03.079> like

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
anywhere that you're moving around like

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.780 
anywhere that you're moving around like
a<00:03:03.500> subway<00:03:03.859> for<00:03:04.040> instance<00:03:04.370> now<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:04.640> also

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
a subway for instance now it also

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.130 
a subway for instance now it also
depends<00:03:05.150> on<00:03:05.209> what<00:03:05.329> kind<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.569> applications

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
depends on what kind of applications

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.660 
depends on what kind of applications
you're<00:03:06.260> running<00:03:06.470> for<00:03:07.160> example<00:03:07.489> if<00:03:07.549> you're

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
you're running for example if you're

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.009 
you're running for example if you're
running<00:03:07.819> an<00:03:07.970> application<00:03:08.390> that's<00:03:08.480> very<00:03:08.810> heavy

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
running an application that's very heavy

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.420 
running an application that's very heavy
on<00:03:09.200> graphics<00:03:09.650> like<00:03:09.739> yeah<00:03:09.920> if<00:03:10.129> you're<00:03:10.250> playing

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
on graphics like yeah if you're playing

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.740 
on graphics like yeah if you're playing
video<00:03:10.670> games<00:03:10.940> for<00:03:11.030> instance<00:03:11.180> okay<00:03:11.599> that's

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
video games for instance okay that's

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.819 
video games for instance okay that's
kind<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:11.959> an<00:03:12.049> extreme<00:03:12.230> example<00:03:12.410> but<00:03:12.799> still

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
kind of an extreme example but still

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.550 
kind of an extreme example but still
anything<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:13.730> uses<00:03:14.329> a<00:03:14.569> lot<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:14.989> processor

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
anything that uses a lot of processor

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.229 
anything that uses a lot of processor
power<00:03:15.769> compared<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.489> just<00:03:16.700> surfing<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.120> web

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
power compared to just surfing the web

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.210 
power compared to just surfing the web
it's<00:03:17.959> gonna<00:03:18.109> know<00:03:18.380> that<00:03:18.410> hey<00:03:18.709> I'm<00:03:18.829> surfing<00:03:19.160> the

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
it's gonna know that hey I'm surfing the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.559 
it's gonna know that hey I'm surfing the
web<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:19.519> when<00:03:19.639> you're<00:03:19.730> surfing<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.120> web<00:03:20.209> it'll

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
web so when you're surfing the web it'll

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.569 
web so when you're surfing the web it'll
scale<00:03:20.870> down<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.470> speed<00:03:21.709> of<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:21.919> processor<00:03:22.430> to

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
scale down the speed of the processor to

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.460 
scale down the speed of the processor to
actually<00:03:22.849> save<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.780> battery<00:03:24.139> life<00:03:24.319> so

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
actually save you the battery life so

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.170 
actually save you the battery life so
it's<00:03:24.590> all<00:03:24.680> about<00:03:24.709> making<00:03:25.489> that<00:03:25.700> battery<00:03:25.970> last

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
it's all about making that battery last

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.240 
it's all about making that battery last
as<00:03:26.389> long<00:03:26.630> as<00:03:26.870> possible<00:03:27.109> now<00:03:27.769> let's<00:03:27.980> see<00:03:28.130> what

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
as long as possible now let's see what

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.250 
as long as possible now let's see what
options<00:03:28.569> compact<00:03:29.569> gives<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.780> in<00:03:29.870> terms<00:03:30.079> of

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
options compact gives you in terms of

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.409 
options compact gives you in terms of
connectivity<00:03:30.769> so<00:03:31.489> it's<00:03:31.639> gonna<00:03:31.849> start<00:03:32.239> off<00:03:32.389> in

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
connectivity so it's gonna start off in

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:33.640 
connectivity so it's gonna start off in
the<00:03:32.660> front<00:03:32.840> I'm<00:03:33.019> gonna<00:03:33.109> tilt<00:03:33.319> this<00:03:33.380> back<00:03:33.560> so

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
the front I'm gonna tilt this back so

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.050 
the front I'm gonna tilt this back so
you<00:03:33.709> can<00:03:33.769> see<00:03:33.950> over<00:03:34.099> there<00:03:34.190> okay<00:03:34.940> of<00:03:35.000> course

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
you can see over there okay of course

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.520 
you can see over there okay of course
that's<00:03:35.359> the<00:03:35.450> volume<00:03:35.780> up<00:03:35.959> and<00:03:36.139> down<00:03:36.169> switch

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
that's the volume up and down switch

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.620 
that's the volume up and down switch
right<00:03:36.739> over<00:03:36.769> there<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.370> again<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:38.269> just<00:03:38.299> kind
