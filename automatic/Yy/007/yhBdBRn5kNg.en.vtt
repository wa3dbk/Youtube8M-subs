00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
actually devised a nice setup where you

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.950 
actually devised a nice setup where you
have<00:00:53.160> hooks<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> backside<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.570> panel

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
and they hook into the door and then

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.380 
and they hook into the door and then
that<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.829> then<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> top<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.850> kind<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.090> drops

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
that and then the top just kind of drops

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.550 
that and then the top just kind of drops
down<00:01:03.589> okay<00:01:04.589> once<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.129> remove<00:01:06.140> this<00:01:07.140> control

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
down okay once you remove this control

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.190 
down okay once you remove this control
panel

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
panel

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.140 
panel
you<00:01:10.200> got<00:01:10.409> three<00:01:10.830> connectors<00:01:11.250> here

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
you got three connectors here

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.020 
you got three connectors here
two<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.750> them<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.110> wrapped<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:14.030> electrical

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
two of them are wrapped in electrical

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.560 
two of them are wrapped in electrical
tape<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.900> undo<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> tape<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.860> then<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:18.360> can

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
tape just undo the tape and then you can

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.740 
tape just undo the tape and then you can
you<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.080> disconnect<00:01:19.380> these<00:01:19.710> three<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:21.270> then

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
you can disconnect these three and then

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.749 
you can disconnect these three and then
you'll<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.049> clearance<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.189> door<00:01:23.369> panel

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
you'll have clearance for the door panel

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.249 
you'll have clearance for the door panel
itself<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> now<00:01:28.820> that<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.270> connectors<00:01:30.900> are

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
itself so now that the connectors are

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.289 
itself so now that the connectors are
I'm<00:01:32.189> done<00:01:32.659> there's<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:34.259> more<00:01:35.030> screw<00:01:36.030> right

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
I'm done there's one more screw right

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.649 
I'm done there's one more screw right
here<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.869> needs<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.560> removed<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.509> get

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
here that needs to be removed so you get

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.730 
here that needs to be removed so you get
that<00:01:40.100> I'm<00:01:41.100> done<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:42.720> that's<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.020> total<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.409> three

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that I'm done so that's a total of three

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.730 
that I'm done so that's a total of three
one<00:01:44.040> at<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> bottom<00:01:45.140> one<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> left<00:01:46.560> side

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
one at the bottom one on the left side

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.859 
one at the bottom one on the left side
of<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> door<00:01:47.189> panel<00:01:47.579> over<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:47.850> these<00:01:48.810> are

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
of the door panel over here these are

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.870 
of the door panel over here these are
the<00:01:49.110> screws<00:01:49.579> right<00:01:50.579> here<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.860> one<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.670> left

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the screws right here so one on the left

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.450 
the screws right here so one on the left
one<00:01:54.270> on<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.450> bottom<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.930> then<00:01:55.140> one<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.680> take

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
one on the bottom and then one here take

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.420 
one on the bottom and then one here take
this<00:01:56.610> center<00:01:56.909> panel<00:01:57.090> off<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.979> then

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
this center panel off and then

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:20.800 
this center panel off and then
back<00:02:01.430> this<00:02:01.610> up<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:01.939> little<00:02:02.090> bit<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:20.239> whole<00:02:20.390> unit

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
back this up a little bit the whole unit

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.080 
back this up a little bit the whole unit
pulls<00:02:21.050> away<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:22.550> just<00:02:22.670> have<00:02:22.849> to<00:02:23.000> have

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
pulls away you just have to have

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.130 
pulls away you just have to have
clearance<00:02:23.540> from<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:24.560> handle<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:26.720> can

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
clearance from the handle but you can

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.080 
clearance from the handle but you can
essentially<00:02:27.560> get<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.010> whole<00:02:28.190> panel<00:02:28.670> off<00:02:28.849> like

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
essentially get the whole panel off like

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.720 
essentially get the whole panel off like
this<00:02:29.380> then<00:02:30.380> if<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.650> need<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.950> get<00:02:31.099> to<00:02:31.280> any<00:02:31.459> of

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
this then if you need to get to any of

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.559 
this then if you need to get to any of
the<00:02:32.620> pieces<00:02:33.620> back<00:02:33.980> here<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:35.060> just<00:02:35.330> pulls

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
the pieces back here this just pulls

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.940 
the pieces back here this just pulls
away<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.200> can<00:02:36.319> get<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.709> window

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
away and you can get to the window

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.199 
away and you can get to the window
regulator<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.810> door<00:02:39.080> locks<00:02:40.209> anything

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
regulator the door locks anything

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.729 
regulator the door locks anything
speakers<00:02:41.870> anything<00:02:42.830> from<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.100> backside<00:02:43.549> here

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
speakers anything from the backside here

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.710 
speakers anything from the backside here
so<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.860> problem<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.489> was<00:02:46.760> after<00:02:49.120> was<00:02:50.120> on

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
so the problem that I was after was on

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.330 
so the problem that I was after was on
the<00:02:51.200> backside<00:02:51.769> of<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.370> lock<00:02:52.730> cylinder<00:02:53.200> as<00:02:54.200> a

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
the backside of the lock cylinder as a

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.190 
the backside of the lock cylinder as a
unit<00:02:55.340> here<00:02:55.819> that<00:02:56.140> hooks<00:02:57.140> into<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:59.750> control<00:03:00.170> of

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
unit here that hooks into the control of

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.800 
unit here that hooks into the control of
the<00:03:00.410> lock<00:03:00.590> cylinder<00:03:01.069> itself<00:03:01.489> so<00:03:02.390> this<00:03:02.510> kind<00:03:02.750> of

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
the lock cylinder itself so this kind of
