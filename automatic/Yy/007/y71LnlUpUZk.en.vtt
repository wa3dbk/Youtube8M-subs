00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.130
 and obviously the anchovies that must be very fresh 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.080
 because they will be then 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.620
 later eat raw 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.379
 to recognize anchovies 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.330
 lightening spray 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.500
 must have is predominantly the whole belly 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.130
 because being a very delicate blue fish 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.360
 if they are caught the day before they have a broken stomach in this 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.360
 case they have a full belly 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.860
 clean the anchovies and very simple 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.789
 you need to take the recipe 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:07.360
 in hand 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.360
 to remove the head just crush the head 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.070
 estra speaks of the body 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.190
 fresh flowers 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.190
 plus the belly and simply comes away 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.610
 let's try again 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.490
 crush the head 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.430
 lay it out for the body 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.420
 and take it off remove the belly 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.420
 you can always help yourself with a finger 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.260
 let's try the third time we crush the head we tear it from the body 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.340
 and we take away from the inside 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.780
 after having washed them to remove the remaining blood 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.890
 we have to pull the plug 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.700
 to remove the plug you do in this world 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.960
 need 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.890
 take the license 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.840
 pass with your finger 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.350
 slightly open the belly you feel the plug immediately 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.889
 and to see columbia over the spinet trying to divide the meat from the 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.119
 overlying spine 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.119
 run backwards by text alone 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.479
 and appear 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.049
 in this world 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.869
 then you have to pull the plug from the tail 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.789
 and remove it from the meat 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:33.959
 need 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.449
 remove the plug from the meat starting from the tail 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.489
 and take away the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.519
 gently 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.709
 from the meat 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.709
 ours there are barbed 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.920
 we see that the very fresh from the fact that the color of the meat despite being 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.379
 dark and almost transparent 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.870
 the marinating of the anchovies is very simple 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.569
 it's enough 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.189
 place the anchovy fillets in a deep dish 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:16.729
 take white wine vinegar 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.680
 to overpower is only to submerge it they will speak quare 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:25.789
 makes the fruitless drown in the certain 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:29.609
 we use white wine vinegar because it makes the high school girl 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.539
 sweeter if instead 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.769
 a more bitter, more bitter taste is preferred 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.930
 it is necessary to use fresh lemon juice 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:48.359
 the anchovies after about ming 2 hours of marinating and the white wine vinegar yes 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.939
 they present so 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:58.129
 for the dressing after the marinating, it is necessary to make a pic 2 small 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.409
 precautions then we must only remove from the agreement 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:11.059
 dabbing the excess acid in the vinegar to remove the pil 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.909
 and you have to place them on your plate 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.169
 for seasoning 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.020
 just add 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.330
 an emulsion of salt oil is a drop of lemon 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.099
 we add above 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.099
 a little bit of parsley 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.990
