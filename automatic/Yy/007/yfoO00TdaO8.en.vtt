point is on the rear turn signal looking
forward<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.030> found<00:01:18.900> mounting<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.470> turn

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
forward I found mounting on the turn

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.800 
forward I found mounting on the turn
signals<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.790> highlights<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.390> camera

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810

shake<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.350> don't<00:01:22.710> really<00:01:22.890> care<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.430> this

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
shake and don't really care for it this

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.450 
shake and don't really care for it this
could<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.450> used<00:01:24.689> as<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.110> real<00:01:25.470> quick<00:01:25.740> cut<00:01:26.100> just

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
could be used as a real quick cut just

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.050 
could be used as a real quick cut just
to<00:01:26.610> show<00:01:26.790> something<00:01:27.060> different<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.689> guess<00:01:29.060> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
to show something different I guess the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.789 
to show something different I guess the
fourth<00:01:30.479> mount<00:01:30.780> point<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.320> their<00:01:31.500> rear

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
fourth mount point is on their rear

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.280 
fourth mount point is on their rear
fender<00:01:32.189> looking<00:01:32.490> back<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.720> obviously

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
fender looking back this is obviously

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.870 
fender looking back this is obviously
best<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.250> another<00:01:35.549> writer

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
best if you have another writer

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.859 
best if you have another writer
following<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:39.000> fifth<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.570> final

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
following you and the fifth and final

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.170 
following you and the fifth and final
mount<00:01:40.229> point<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> front<00:01:41.400> forks<00:01:41.850> way

down<00:01:42.450> low<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.020> actually<00:01:43.680> liked<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.280> video

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
down low I actually liked this video

quite<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.939> bit<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.869> had<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> hard<00:01:46.259> time

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
quite a bit but it had a hard time

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.530 
quite a bit but it had a hard time

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
getting the clamp to stay in place and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.050 
getting the clamp to stay in place and
will<00:01:49.020> need<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.320> experiment<00:01:49.860> went<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.970> a
