00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
those off and loosen those so you can

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.490 
those off and loosen those so you can
actually<00:02:36.690> cut<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.290> part<00:02:37.620> right<00:02:37.800> here<00:02:39.500> just

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
actually cut this part right here just

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.840 
actually cut this part right here just
removing<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.190> bolt<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.060> top<00:02:43.640> makes<00:02:44.640> it

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
removing that bolt on the top makes it

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.850 
removing that bolt on the top makes it
to<00:02:44.970> where<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.270> can't<00:02:45.660> actually<00:02:45.989> get<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.500> blade

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
to where you can't actually get a blade

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.620 
to where you can't actually get a blade
or<00:02:47.100> anything<00:02:47.459> in<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.880> so<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.180> got<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.480> make

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
or anything in it so you got to make

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.590 
or anything in it so you got to make
sure<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.800> take<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.250> bolt<00:02:50.519> out<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.180> these

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
sure you take that bolt out and these

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.160 
sure you take that bolt out and these
bolts<00:02:52.019> out<00:02:52.140> on<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.590> bottom<00:02:52.800> here<00:02:57.170> the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
bolts out on the bottom here the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.490 
bolts out on the bottom here the
confusing<00:02:58.709> part<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.120> cut<00:03:00.450> was<00:03:00.840> there's<00:03:01.410> a

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
confusing part of the cut was there's a

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.470 
confusing part of the cut was there's a
brace<00:03:01.800> that<00:03:01.830> goes<00:03:02.250> right<00:03:02.519> here<00:03:02.970> if<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.269> should

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
brace that goes right here if I should

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.229 
brace that goes right here if I should
cut<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.140> other<00:03:04.170> side<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.860> brace<00:03:05.239> or

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
cut on the other side of the brace or

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.330 
cut on the other side of the brace or
not<00:03:08.660> that<00:03:09.660> brace<00:03:09.989> is<00:03:10.260> actually<00:03:10.650> gets<00:03:10.860> removed

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
not that brace is actually gets removed

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.140 
not that brace is actually gets removed
so<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.150> don't<00:03:12.390> have<00:03:13.640> obstruction<00:03:14.640> right<00:03:14.850> here

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
so you don't have obstruction right here

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.680 
so you don't have obstruction right here
and<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:15.390> looks<00:03:16.290> kind<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.590> goofy<00:03:17.329> so<00:03:18.329> I<00:03:18.360> went

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
and it looks kind of goofy so I went

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.340 
and it looks kind of goofy so I went
ahead<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:18.989> cut<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.769> bracket<00:03:20.280> off<00:03:24.170> don't<00:03:25.170> be

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
ahead and cut that bracket off don't be

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.720 
ahead and cut that bracket off don't be
afraid<00:03:26.510> it's<00:03:27.510> only<00:03:27.630> metal<00:03:28.549> worst-case<00:03:29.549> you

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
afraid it's only metal worst-case you

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.430 
afraid it's only metal worst-case you
got<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:30.000> add<00:03:30.120> some<00:03:30.390> more<00:03:30.510> metal<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:31.140> if<00:03:31.290> you

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
got to add some more metal to it if you

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.920 
got to add some more metal to it if you
screw<00:03:31.769> up<00:03:32.209> you<00:03:33.209> want<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.480> make<00:03:33.600> sure<00:03:33.630> that

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
screw up you want to make sure that

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.270 
screw up you want to make sure that
there's<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.260> lip<00:03:34.560> right<00:03:35.280> here<00:03:36.920> that<00:03:37.920> parts

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
there's a lip right here that parts

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.410 
there's a lip right here that parts
really<00:03:38.489> not<00:03:39.019> attached<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.290> anything<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:42.090> later

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
really not attached to anything so later

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.170 
really not attached to anything so later
on<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.959> might<00:03:43.380> go<00:03:43.620> ahead<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.100> tack<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:44.400> in<00:03:44.910> I'm

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
on I might go ahead and tack that in I'm

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.620 
on I might go ahead and tack that in I'm
not<00:03:45.450> sure<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:46.519> think<00:03:47.519> it<00:03:47.670> goes<00:03:47.880> in<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.180> little

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
not sure I think it goes in a little

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.009 
not sure I think it goes in a little
slot<00:03:48.989> where<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.530> tube<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:50.480> when<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.600> holds<00:03:51.900> it

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
slot where the tube is when it holds it

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.020 
slot where the tube is when it holds it
in<00:03:52.140> place<00:03:52.440> but<00:03:52.829> I<00:03:53.100> haven't<00:03:53.820> got<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.000> far<00:03:54.209> yet

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
in place but I haven't got that far yet

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.640 
in place but I haven't got that far yet
another<00:03:57.030> thing<00:03:57.360> that<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.630> noticed<00:03:58.230> it's<00:03:58.410> kind

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
another thing that I noticed it's kind

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.370 
another thing that I noticed it's kind
of<00:03:58.739> weird<00:03:58.980> is<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:01.110> fit<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:01.530> finish<00:04:02.480> your<00:04:03.480> your

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
of weird is the fit and finish your your

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.120 
of weird is the fit and finish your your
tube<00:04:04.650> fenders<00:04:05.690> this<00:04:06.690> should<00:04:06.900> be<00:04:06.989> bolted<00:04:07.260> up<00:04:07.650> so

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
tube fenders this should be bolted up so

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.780 
tube fenders this should be bolted up so
it's<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.489> place<00:04:09.590> but<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.650> can't<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:11.310> can't<00:04:11.579> do

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
it's in place but you can't you can't do

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.430 
it's in place but you can't you can't do
that<00:04:11.970> because<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.450> bolts<00:04:12.780> are<00:04:12.900> actually<00:04:13.320> in

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
that because the bolts are actually in

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.219 
that because the bolts are actually in
the<00:04:13.560> way<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:15.120> what<00:04:15.480> I'm<00:04:15.600> thinking<00:04:15.630> about<00:04:16.049> doing

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
the way so what I'm thinking about doing

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.240 
the way so what I'm thinking about doing
is<00:04:16.799> actually<00:04:18.260> bolting<00:04:19.260> this<00:04:19.410> back<00:04:19.650> up<00:04:19.979> and

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
is actually bolting this back up and

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.219 
is actually bolting this back up and
then<00:04:20.430> put<00:04:20.669> an<00:04:20.760> attack<00:04:21.090> on<00:04:21.330> here<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:22.019> holds

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
then put an attack on here so it holds

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.600 
then put an attack on here so it holds
it

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.920 

but<00:04:27.610> that's<00:04:27.820> what<00:04:28.030> it<00:04:28.150> is<00:04:28.180> that's<00:04:28.630> what<00:04:28.870> it

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
but that's what it is that's what it

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:39.480 
but that's what it is that's what it
looks<00:04:29.110> like<00:04:29.350> if<00:04:30.220> your<00:04:30.400> finger<00:04:30.699> cut<00:04:30.940> off<00:04:38.490> can't

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
looks like if your finger cut off can't

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.650 
looks like if your finger cut off can't
wait<00:04:39.669> until<00:04:39.820> stone<00:04:40.440> looking<00:04:41.440> good
