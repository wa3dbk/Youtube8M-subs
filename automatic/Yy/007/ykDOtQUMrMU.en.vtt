00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.120
Hi, my name is OtÃ¡rio (Sucker)!

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.000
Do you know what I did today?

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.130
I bought a brasilian Lottery ticket!

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.200
I'll be rich!

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.200
Yeahhh!

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.020
This time I'll win!

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.100
But the Brasilian Lotteries is a serious business?

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.280
Or is it just bullshit?

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.140
Well, if you also like to buy these tickets.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.160
Before dreaming about what you will do
with these millions of dollars in your account ...

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.190
It's good to know about some things.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.230
So here we go!

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.090
Generally, the draw of the Lottery
are conducted from Monday through Saturday ...

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.160
inside a truck. That's right, a truck!

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.240
Somewhere of Brazil.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.120
It is through this mobile unit
that CAIXA democratizes the draw.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.070
So, people from all regions of the country

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.260
Can check the transparency
and safety of the sweepstakes.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.180
Ok!

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.180
But is it really safe?

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.180
Well, besides the audience...

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.210
[Sound of crickets]

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.120
All sweepstakes are conducted and validated
formally by CAIXA employees ...

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.030
And two other members of the public
that act as "auditors".

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.110
Hummmmm, auditors selected from the public

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.230
Ahhhh, that's good, huh?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.110
I just wonder what these audience selected
auditors would do...

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.290
if they have to audit a magic show 
from David Coperfield!

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.250
Well, but now that I know that the CAIXA ensures
a secure and fraud proof sweepstakes...

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.250
inside a truck...

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.140
And the auditors are experienced and reliable!

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.000
Where does the money goes
from these bets, huh?

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.030
Part of the amount collected from the bets
is transferred to the Federal Government

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.040
Who can then invest in areas like: 
health, education, security, culture and sports.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.120
Benefiting the entire population!

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.150
Wowwwww that's cool!

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.060
Now, I am much more relaxed!

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.220
But what is the probability that I have
of winning in the Mega Sena, for example?

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.210
The chance of winning with a ticket
of 6 numbers is basically 1 in 50 million!

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.260
Can you imagine what this mean?

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.260
This means the following...

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.030
It is easier to you to be struck by lightning!
(1 / 1.000.000)

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.290
Or getting hit by a truck
(1 / 16.000)

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.160
Or take a shot in a robbery (in Brazil)
(1 / 5.000)

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.130
Than winning the Mega Sena!

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.230
But okay, I'm very lucky...
The system is safe...

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.180
CAIXA is anti-fraud and
I'm helping society.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.100
But, what about the "money laundering"?

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.220
Am I contributing for this shit to happen?

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.180
What does CAIXA's Lottery and money laundering have in common?!

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.020
One of the simplest ways
to launder money ...

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.040
Is buying winners lottery tickets 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.250
Or even making bets that often
outweigh the value of his own award!

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.220
But, is it possible to CAIXA to prevent 
that this type of crime to happen?

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.290
Some simple procedures like,
registration of the players...

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.010
And insertion of player's ID on the 
ticket at the time that the bet in done

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.160
Whould decrease a lot this type of crime

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.030
But why they don't do that?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.160
Is it so difficult to register a punter

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.210
Or put a simple ID on the ticket, 
making it nominal?

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.250
Am I a genius and they
had never thought of that before?!

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.180
Or will it hinder the interests of
those who gain from this scheme?

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.090
The Jogo do Bicho (a brasilian illigal game), it also helps poor communities, promotes the carnival and auditors from the public!

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.210
But the harm that they bring to
society are far greater than the benefits!

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.110
The way things are...

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.050
the only difference I see between
CAIXA's Lotteries and the "Jogo do Bicho"...

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.210
Is that the scale of things in the CAIXA's 
Lotteries are infinitely greater.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.160
CAIXA, when you guys are going to make 
something about this problem?!

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.090
Otherwise, it looks like you guys are
colluded with this shit!

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.190
You guys are not colluding with this shit, huh?

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.000
Next time you're thinking to get rich 
with games like this, think again...

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.160
Maybe if you save your money, you may 
have much more in the future!

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.270
If you spend 40 reais per month in
Mega Sena, for example...

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.240
After 20 years, if you were not drawn,
you have thrown away a brand new car.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.170
And if you're one of those addicted gamblers,
who spend more than 1000 reais monthly!

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.140
After 20 years, you will have thrown in the trash,
about $ 1 million reais!

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.230
That is, you gave away a winning 
ticket of 1 million reais...

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.120
And took a ticket that gives you 
the chance to win that value!

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.080
Does that make sense?

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.250
Don't fuck me!

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.180
Ahhhh .... Can I ask
my money back?

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.100

- To the lucky, everyone is equal
[CAIXA's Lotteries slogan]

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.000
But to launder money,
the best are the CAIXA's Lotteries.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.200
Let's go!
