00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
but the community is on here so that

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.340 
but the community is on here so that

a<00:00:52.440> little<00:00:52.649> strange<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.309> if<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.520> look<00:00:53.820> it's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
a little strange but if you look it's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.360 
a little strange but if you look it's
like<00:00:54.270> they<00:00:54.690> already<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.260> these<00:00:55.559> nice<00:00:55.800> Wii<00:00:56.190> U

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370

models<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.120> all<00:00:57.690> these<00:00:57.870> characters<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.770> I'm

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
models of all these characters so I'm

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.580 
models of all these characters so I'm
guessing<00:00:59.910> development<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:01.109> Animal<00:01:01.440> Crossing

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
guessing development for Animal Crossing

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
guessing development for Animal Crossing
Wii<00:01:02.430> U<00:01:02.579> whatever<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.090> gonna<00:01:03.180> be<00:01:03.359> held<00:01:03.539> Animal

I'm<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> guess<00:01:07.860> because<00:01:08.070> look<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:08.549> got

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
I'm going to guess because look they got

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.950 
I'm going to guess because look they got
all<00:01:08.790> these<00:01:08.880> models<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.420> here<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.750> they<00:01:09.840> look

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
all these models in here and they look

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.620 
all these models in here and they look
great<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.830> they're<00:01:10.979> probably<00:01:11.210> deep<00:01:12.210> into<00:01:12.510> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
great so they're probably deep into that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570
