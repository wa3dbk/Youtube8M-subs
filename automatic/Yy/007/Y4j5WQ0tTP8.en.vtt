00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
fence at the 19 inch mark now for the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.130 
fence at the 19 inch mark now for the
next<00:01:11.430> three<00:01:11.729> boards<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.479> simply<00:01:12.869> line<00:01:13.110> up

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
next three boards I can simply line up

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.440 
next three boards I can simply line up
the<00:01:13.470> 19<00:01:13.890> inch<00:01:14.100> mark<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.880> boards<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the 19 inch mark on the boards with the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.719 
the 19 inch mark on the boards with the
mark<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> fence<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.490> cut

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
mark on the fence and know that the cut

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.580 
mark on the fence and know that the cut
will<00:01:17.939> be<00:01:17.970> consistent<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.080> first<00:01:19.290> piece

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
will be consistent with the first piece

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.460 
will be consistent with the first piece
I<00:01:20.030> find<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> good<00:01:21.750> idea<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.170> clamp

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
I find that it is a good idea to clamp

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.260 
I find that it is a good idea to clamp
the<00:01:22.680> board<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> table<00:01:23.580> when<00:01:23.729> cutting<00:01:24.119> at

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the board to the table when cutting at

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.390 
the board to the table when cutting at
an<00:01:24.390> angle<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> board<00:01:25.799> doesn't<00:01:26.070> move

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
an angle so that the board doesn't move

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.690 
an angle so that the board doesn't move
because<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.450> compound<00:01:27.960> angles<00:01:28.409> are<00:01:28.700> 45

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
because the compound angles are 45

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.719 
because the compound angles are 45
degrees<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.390> 45<00:01:30.990> degree<00:01:31.350> tilt<00:01:31.619> no<00:01:32.430> saw

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
degrees and 45 degree tilt no saw

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.700 
degrees and 45 degree tilt no saw
adjustments<00:01:33.509> are<00:01:33.659> needed<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.290> complete<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
adjustments are needed to complete the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.190 
adjustments are needed to complete the
compound<00:01:35.310> angle<00:01:35.670> cuts<00:01:35.939> simply<00:01:36.930> flip<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
compound angle cuts simply flip the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.730 
compound angle cuts simply flip the
board<00:01:37.560> over<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.979> cut<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.850> other<00:01:39.000> side<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.740> made

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
board over and cut the other side I made

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.760 
board over and cut the other side I made
a<00:01:40.770> mark<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.549> board<00:01:41.729> at<00:01:41.970> 12<00:01:42.240> inches<00:01:42.770> after

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
a mark on the board at 12 inches after

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.249 
a mark on the board at 12 inches after
cutting<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> first<00:01:44.790> board<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.420> marked<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
cutting the first board I marked the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.520 
cutting the first board I marked the
fence<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> did<00:01:47.250> earlier<00:01:47.810> now<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:49.229> align

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
fence like I did earlier now I can align

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.340 
fence like I did earlier now I can align
the<00:01:49.680> remaining<00:01:50.159> boards<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:50.670> ease<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.930> final

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the remaining boards with ease the final

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.010 
the remaining boards with ease the final
step<00:01:52.590> involves<00:01:53.159> putting<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.640> 36<00:01:54.420> degree<00:01:54.780> bevel

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
step involves putting a 36 degree bevel

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.850 
step involves putting a 36 degree bevel
on<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.590> uprights<00:01:56.719> this<00:01:57.719> step<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.290> not<00:01:58.469> really
