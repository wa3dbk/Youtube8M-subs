put my glue i'm going to Center mine and

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.460 
put my glue i'm going to Center mine and
just<00:02:39.430> make<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:39.640> like<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:39.940> band<00:02:40.239> so<00:02:41.170> I'm<00:02:41.290> going<00:02:41.440> to

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
stripe of glue across my card now if you

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.770 
stripe of glue across my card now if you
wouldn't<00:02:53.980> use<00:02:54.160> other<00:02:54.430> glue<00:02:54.880> feel<00:02:55.239> free<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.599> do

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
wouldn't use other glue feel free to do

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.360 
wouldn't use other glue feel free to do
that<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:56.140> just<00:02:56.170> really<00:02:56.620> like<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:56.980> hot<00:02:57.130> glue

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
that I just really like the hot glue

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.960 
that I just really like the hot glue
because<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:58.890> yarn<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.160> fabric<00:03:00.579> and<00:03:00.760> things

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
because it yarn and fabric and things

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.759 
because it yarn and fabric and things
stick<00:03:01.329> to<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.660> really<00:03:01.810> well<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.380> it<00:03:02.500> dries

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
stick to it really well and it dries

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.580 
stick to it really well and it dries
fairly<00:03:03.130> quickly<00:03:03.549> but<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:05.200> can<00:03:05.349> still

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
fairly quickly but you can still

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.620 
fairly quickly but you can still
reposition<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:06.970> I'm<00:03:07.030> just<00:03:07.209> kind<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.450> like

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
reposition it so I'm just kind of like

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.440 
reposition it so I'm just kind of like
tapping<00:03:07.989> it<00:03:08.349> into<00:03:08.680> place<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:10.090> don't<00:03:10.239> want<00:03:10.390> it

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
tapping it into place you don't want it

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.770 
tapping it into place you don't want it
to<00:03:10.569> use<00:03:10.780> through<00:03:11.349> so<00:03:12.040> just<00:03:12.910> be<00:03:13.060> careful<00:03:13.269> not<00:03:13.599> to

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
to use through so just be careful not to

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.440 
to use through so just be careful not to
burn<00:03:13.930> yourself<00:03:13.989> as<00:03:14.620> well<00:03:14.910> okay<00:03:15.910> so<00:03:15.970> we<00:03:16.180> have<00:03:16.209> it

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
burn yourself as well okay so we have it

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.509 
burn yourself as well okay so we have it
secured<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.019> bottom<00:03:17.410> now<00:03:18.160> I'm<00:03:18.250> going<00:03:18.430> to

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
secured to the bottom now I'm going to

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.839 
secured to the bottom now I'm going to
flip<00:03:18.940> down<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.269> top<00:03:20.190> now<00:03:21.190> our<00:03:21.370> top<00:03:21.579> has<00:03:21.819> a

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
flip down the top now our top has a

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.430 
flip down the top now our top has a
little<00:03:22.120> bit<00:03:22.269> of<00:03:22.329> a<00:03:22.450> scallop<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.079> you<00:03:23.170> can<00:03:23.319> kind

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
little bit of a scallop and you can kind

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.479 
little bit of a scallop and you can kind
of<00:03:23.530> accommodate<00:03:24.069> whatever<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:26.100> swatch<00:03:27.100> that

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:24.339 
hand delivering just you know you won't

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:26.759 
hand delivering just you know you won't
have<00:05:24.429> to<00:05:24.519> worry<00:05:24.669> about<00:05:24.729> that<00:05:24.879> but<00:05:25.679> getting<00:05:26.679> it

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:26.769 
have to worry about that but getting it

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:27.989 
have to worry about that but getting it
into<00:05:26.919> the<00:05:27.129> envelope<00:05:27.549> might<00:05:27.699> be<00:05:27.819> a<00:05:27.849> little

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:27.999 
into the envelope might be a little

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:29.850 
into the envelope might be a little
tricky<00:05:28.449> but<00:05:28.569> you<00:05:28.719> should<00:05:28.899> be<00:05:29.049> okay<00:05:29.319> I<00:05:29.499> think<00:05:29.769> it

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
tricky but you should be okay I think it

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.339 
tricky but you should be okay I think it
might<00:05:30.039> be<00:05:30.069> flat<00:05:30.459> enough<00:05:30.759> if<00:05:31.329> not<00:05:31.749> just<00:05:32.079> hand

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
might be flat enough if not just hand

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.309 
might be flat enough if not just hand
deliver<00:05:32.439> without<00:05:32.889> a<00:05:33.069> number<00:05:33.429> what<00:05:33.959> okay<00:05:34.959> so

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
deliver without a number what okay so

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:36.509 
deliver without a number what okay so
what<00:05:35.499> you're<00:05:35.649> going<00:05:35.739> to<00:05:35.829> do<00:05:35.979> is<00:05:36.159> just<00:05:36.189> keep

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:36.519 
what you're going to do is just keep

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:43.919 
what you're going to do is just keep
folding<00:05:36.999> that<00:05:37.419> swatch<00:05:37.839> inward<00:05:42.749> just<00:05:43.749> like

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:43.929 
folding that swatch inward just like

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:46.229 
folding that swatch inward just like
that<00:05:44.139> now<00:05:44.469> mine<00:05:44.739> came<00:05:45.159> up<00:05:45.309> a<00:05:45.429> little<00:05:45.549> short<00:05:45.699> and

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:46.239 
that now mine came up a little short and

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:47.489 
that now mine came up a little short and
that's<00:05:46.389> okay<00:05:46.689> this<00:05:46.869> glue<00:05:47.079> will<00:05:47.199> dry<00:05:47.229> you<00:05:47.409> can
