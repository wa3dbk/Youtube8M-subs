00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:19.009
 the practice of irrigation and the way it is done are elements 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.869
 important to consider within our port of intensive 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.119
 for estrada we try that the risk is of the form more similar to how 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.130
 occurs in nature 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.110
 we use in this case 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.960
 be it a watering can 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.690
 with a fan-shaped exit so that the water is dispersed as much as possible 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.600
 this also helps us 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.060
 that air 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.530
 can be incorporated into the soil since the water particles 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.400
 they catch a little air and this is integrated into the ground 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.780
 In some cases it is important to consider that when crops are grown 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.870
 find 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.690
 in the pollination stage 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.280
 or in the formation of the seeds because it was important to try not to irrigate 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.110
 floral structures for this as it is recommended to be a risk 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.930
 as low as possible of the crop 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.340
 so that without it is that the soil is not insufficient but not homogeneous 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.010
 parts of the crop it is important to take care 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.010
 this consideration will also be very important 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.370
 crops like la paz cpa in chile 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.030
 the tomato that are from the Solanaceae family 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.220
 and that are very sensitive to excess moisture 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 and the formation of fungi in their leaves 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.840
 This type of practice will help us 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.840
 to do a very efficient water course 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.780
 and this efficient use as well as hand in hand with some of the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.520
 principles of the biointensive method 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.130
 as they are the double excavation 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.130
 the plantings nearby 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.449
 the incorporation of compost in our soil 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:13.519
 that will help us is that the humidity is kept as long as possible 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.259
 on the floor 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:21.529
 in this case we recommend making the risks of preference 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.119
 in the afternoon 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:26.779
 after the sun has gone down 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.209
 a little bit since this is going to allow the water 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.069
 have enough time to incorporate monthly 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.079
 hence, when irrigation is done 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.659
 percent at noon for most of the water that we are 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:45.909
 Incorporating evaporates when we have high temperatures 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.729
 It is important that at the time of performing our risk 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:57.039
 as the movements or the change of site of the hose 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:59.719
 noceda 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:00.859
 my strength 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.449
 but that these movements are 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.879
 winds so we can water the largest surface 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.889
 in the ti I send as little as possible to our plants at the time of the river 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:17.229
 in this case then in the bed with vegetation as it is 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.289
 the alfalfa 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:22.289
 the irrigation then be distributed in the best way 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:28.269
 when we have one to love where the vegetation begins 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.959
 as we grow we need to be more careful 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.219
 for the purpose of 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.369
 of this soil 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:46.159
 shalgham fired outside our cultivation bed so in these 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.009
 cases as the movements of bÃ©ranger 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:53.929
 more careful even when there is vegetation and our sun 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:04:01.609
 for this it will be very important that we know and learn what is the type 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.109
 of soil that we have in our body since this will give us the guidelines 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.369
 and the ideas to work it in an appropriate way 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.469
 while more organic matter we have in the soil 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:22.609
 and more compost we can incorporate into our soils these 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:26.189
 in this lapse herbera greater amount of humidity 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.870
 by better regulate the existing humidity 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:42.509
 highlighted the risk and efficient use of water within the biointensive method 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.169
 of the crop 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.930
 Remember that while our areas are smaller 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.210
 we can produce more food with less water consumption
