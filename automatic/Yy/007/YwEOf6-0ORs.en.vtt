00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:19.720
 [music] 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.420
 Good day friends added up 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.060
 Canadians past video on vangovanie 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.870
 scored more than 3,000 likes if I'm not 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.400
 wrong and as i promised i expected 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.370
 the moment I can tell you 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.040
 some new information and this moment 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.680
 actually came and i check 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.050
 VKontakte vote immediately 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.410
 I decided to make this video in general that 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.250
 served let's say so click and push 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:51.129
 for this it is of course dvd posts in 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.650
 the war thunder forum and where he let slip about 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:58.059
 that which exists in our game shell 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:01.089
 b2 71st and when he was asked for what 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.040
 technique he is he said that there is 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.710
 make up there will almost be a technique for 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.260
 he was asked him for which car he 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.050
 implied this shell and he replied that 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.720
 you yourself understand everything well, only two options 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.020
 This su 57 and face 57 2 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.000
 but as we understand desu 57 2 is a car 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.980
 5 5 years and it does not quite fit 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.230
 time frame of our game 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.390
 high know us while tant pis from 1 year 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.420
 the eldest though planned kind of like 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.810
 this 10m and so on but a little bit about that 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.270
 later very much 57 2 she could well imagine 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.370
 to be in our game and there were ballas 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.970
 most likely it will not be 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.560
 asu 57 what is this such a miracle in 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.910
 overall this is a very light car 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.460
 designed specifically for 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.160
 landing, along with parts of the VDV 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.330
 the Soviet Union in general since the 30s 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.190
 standing at the forefront of the troops 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.080
 airborne and proper for 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.480
 they needed some kind of car which 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.660
 could help them fight tanks 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.600
 enemy technique itself at the end 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.270
 forties it was developed 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.979
 first there were projects and su-76 but later 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.819
 stopped all the same on the project 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.950
 asu 57 this car weighing less than four 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.080
 dong with bulletproof booking 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.810
 and there is about six millimeters thick 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.330
 here from the stern if 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.500
 do not look at all was duralumin here 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.030
 engines could not resist the victory 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.770
 practically and then from this engine 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.660
 there are about 50 horsepower and 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.459
 actually rang out speed up to forty 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.080
 five kilometers per hour the main thing 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.660
 The advantage is that it is just the same it 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:46.120
 Sara dbr 271 m and possibly the projectile was 271 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:48.519
 n actually these two tables here by 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.370
 widespread and actually have a table 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.930
 in and they differ not much 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.610
 armor penetration 2 second table she 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.620
 somewhat less optimistic 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.500
 armor penetration at long distances 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.780
 but nevertheless it no longer has 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.269
 of some special significance is that 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.380
 most likely this instrument is a descendant from 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.390
 this gun zis-2 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.280
 direct descendant in principle, especially not 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.890
 different shot and the same 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.530
 shells except card here and in 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.709
 Basically, I think this car is quite 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.750
 yourself could attend 3 or 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.239
 why because i'm only height 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.230
 meter forty corners aiming vertical 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.359
 minus 5 plus 12 but not the worst because 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.120
 its low visibility it could on 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.910
 do quite a lot of say so 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.609
 bad deeds and quite myself could vomit 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.380
 and tigers and panthers basically it 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.620
 visually able to resist even 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.930
 tank 4 but a crew of two 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.540
 totally missing booking is not 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.170
 the best mobility still does 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.420
 this car but so controversial by 4 Reno 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.340
 3 I think that she will show herself 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.440
 very, very good 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.569
 in real life fighting she 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.720
 as I understand it did not work out for you 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.340
 I participated in let's say I do not even know 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.200
 what is called but 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.040
 peacekeeping mission to name new 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.190
 Warsaw Pact operations in 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.419
 Eastern Europe when they suggested there 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.950
 socialist authorities suppressed any 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:23.350
 there I will say this rebellion against 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.980
 socialist socialist power 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.060
 here we see it by the way in the pictures 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.730
 there were more projects 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:36.940
 asu 57 floating armor itself was 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:41.140
 even weaker she was and alloys 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:44.080
 aluminum and other metals and proper 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.700
 but very weak was the armor built 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.350
 there were about four five copies 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.020
 further passed dart state tests could 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.970
 be adopted but especially 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.250
 well she did not seem and the time already 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.470
 this car came to an end they 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.830
 coped after giving birth to the 50s she is quite 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.200
 myself could hit many tanks say 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.960
 so western to board a hundred percent with 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.600
 large distances in the forehead sabaline 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.790
 shells from let's say so close 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.340
 distances could also hit them but for 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.400
 she existed stood means 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.490
 landing of course it was initially 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.500
 Yakovlev gliders that towed 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.140
 different planes there planned and 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.980
 right up there there is a tu-4 which was supposed to 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:30.400
 let's say them but drag these plans 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.410
 there was a self-propelled gun 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.080
 tank Destroyer 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:39.010
 here and with a crew of two people like this 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.280
 airplanes were later developed 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:45.820
 which could transport and more than 2 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:50.110
 minutes very two cars this famous 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:53.380
 An-12 from the same widely known in narrow 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.510
 circles like a black tulip right here 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.270
 interested in the history of the same Afghan 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.440
 wars i think i know about this plane 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.950
 firsthand 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.560
 cargo 200 and so on also an mi-6 helicopter 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.890
 attitude he transports it 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.750
 fighter Mig-15 teach to leave 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:13.240
 training but to understand 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.210
 how huge he is just i saw in 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.590
 real life is something unreal that's 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.800
 this car is just but 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:24.320
 makes a sensation but I do not know how 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.240
 explain here were later various 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.550
 Su-85 installations which are popularly 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.290
 often called su-85 although it is not 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.920
 quite right eighty-five 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:37.220
 millimeter cannon other options and 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:40.850
 soon in the 60s they were worn seriously 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:43.190
 We are working on BMD-1 which are still 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.700
 apply and in Russia there more from a place 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:50.780
 and congestion in Ukraine and other others 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.550
 countries of the former Soviet Union here 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.040
 this machine will be pretty 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.570
 interesting hope you enjoyed eating 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.050
 likes will be as many as in 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.520
 last time there are over 3000 i will 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.050
 I will follow all the news as 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.500
 Only there will be some hints 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:10.120
 that the car will drive some new 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:13.280
 I am some kind of unusual for you 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.350
 I will make a review write in your comments 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.940
 I really wonder how old you are 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.650
 Now heading still some there 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:24.620
 large historical warehouse layout 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:26.480
 Information here with you was to nazira 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:30.080
 and in the end I would still 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:33.080
 count lines from one too wide 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:36.650
 well-known in narrow circles songs forgive me 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:40.250
 Basil Filippitch we forgive we do not 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:44.750
 saved the banners of the guard divisions on 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:49.640
 century put on covers from the bottom who knows 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:51.850
 such a Vasily Filipovich Margela while 

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.850
 until
