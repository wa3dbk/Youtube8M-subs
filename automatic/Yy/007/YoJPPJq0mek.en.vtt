 advice about the right people

 the problem is most people who don't 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.270
 succeed in listening 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.400
 xerox tips in a row moreover their 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.750
 the forecast of the hour is that they are too numerous 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.560
 Tina to other people's advice 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.860
 people listen to advice about relationships 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.480
 people from people who are themselves 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.510
 the ratio of number lived will heed this 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.329
 years of how to eat right 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.600
 but they themselves only have a bride has a bunch 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.060
 sore on his body 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.670
 people listened to the weather advice how 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.970
 to build a business from people 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.720
 who have no business at all 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.200
 no relation stated sykora and 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.870
 started building and all that does not know 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.200
 insulting sects this only from from the fact that 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.370
 history of the situation in the movies or read 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.940
 books or you were in newspapers and magazines 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.010
 and the problem is really 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.150
 most people that they listen 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.460
 advice but listens to ninety-nine 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.060
 percent and maybe ninety nine 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.479
 tenths of a percent 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:23.290
 tips 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.130
 completely wrong people 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.720
 people who have absolutely no 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.210
 no relation to that advice 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.760
 which they give 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.630
 we dropped off it was know why people 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.760
 give advice it will not tell only about 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.820
 what's the point of listening 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.920
 special place years ago I heard 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.140

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.869

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:44.960
 speaker beat gala 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.649
 it is clear that he thought that 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:48.899
 in america for example 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.410

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.430
 but only a few few 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.369
 dozens of people 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.530

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:00.489
 per year on a professional with 

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:02.320

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.860
 hundreds and hundreds of hundreds of speaker who 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.210
 barely barely make ends meet 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.289
 held and training oratorical 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.190
 art and professionally 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.290
 Speaking promising people 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.920
 that passing their schools learning their schools and 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.329
 courses and n 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.069
 their training, they will also be able to earn 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.599
 money 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.050
 questions how can pupils 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.080
 making money making a million 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.610
 dollars a month as a speaker 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.020
 if the tutorial 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.769
 not even close to this figure 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.549
 and unfortunately it is everywhere and therefore 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:34.859
 for 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.430
 myself and a few years ago I took it 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.140
 decision 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.399
 that I will listen to the advice of only those 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.719
 in business and only those who are in business 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:44.749
 why he advises 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:46.199
 earning more than one 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.989
 million 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.209
 dollars a year 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.550
 and so in this I want to say again 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.040
 if you want a hand to listen to advice then 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.150
 The check was done first by that person 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.860
 who gives you advice he himself 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.480
 enjoys what he talks about 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.000
 the result is what we have on the occasion of the summer we 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.250
 concerns and business 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.799
 it applies to relationships 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.829

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.079

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.989

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.469
 those who are in business already making a million 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:15.460

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.220

 one topic worthy of this podcast is 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:38.569

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.069
 stop it depends on the opinion 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.959
 other people 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.479
 there is a problem for most people 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.099
 listen to other people just because 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.699
 depends on other people's opinions 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.599
