alright here we are part two so I pulled

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.849 
alright here we are part two so I pulled
off<00:00:03.370> the<00:00:03.399> water<00:00:03.790> pump<00:00:04.120> and<00:00:04.630> this<00:00:05.589> is<00:00:05.710> what<00:00:05.799> it

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:05.859 
off the water pump and this is what it

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:08.039 
off the water pump and this is what it
looks<00:00:06.009> like<00:00:06.160> what<00:00:06.339> it's<00:00:06.460> off<00:00:06.720> ski<00:00:07.720> breathing

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:08.049 
looks like what it's off ski breathing

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.180 
looks like what it's off ski breathing
and<00:00:08.230> rinse<00:00:08.349> with<00:00:08.530> water<00:00:10.559> make<00:00:11.559> sure<00:00:11.769> you<00:00:11.889> clean

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
and rinse with water make sure you clean

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.019 
and rinse with water make sure you clean
up<00:00:12.219> your<00:00:12.840> your<00:00:13.840> gasket<00:00:14.500> faces<00:00:15.040> here<00:00:15.490> make<00:00:15.880> sure

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
up your your gasket faces here make sure

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.340 
up your your gasket faces here make sure
that's<00:00:16.150> all<00:00:16.390> smooth<00:00:16.779> which<00:00:17.020> I've<00:00:17.199> already

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.350 
that's all smooth which I've already

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.870 
that's all smooth which I've already
done<00:00:17.500> and<00:00:17.910> as<00:00:18.910> well<00:00:19.150> over<00:00:19.600> here<00:00:20.520> basically<00:00:21.520> the

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
done and as well over here basically the

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.150 
done and as well over here basically the
same<00:00:22.090> thing<00:00:22.420> make<00:00:22.600> sure<00:00:22.630> the<00:00:22.990> surface<00:00:23.769> is

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
same thing make sure the surface is

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.509 
same thing make sure the surface is
smooth<00:00:25.500> before<00:00:26.500> you<00:00:26.800> reassemble<00:00:27.869> okay<00:00:28.869> so<00:00:29.650> my

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
smooth before you reassemble okay so my

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.790 
smooth before you reassemble okay so my
particular<00:00:30.880> problem<00:00:31.689> with<00:00:31.840> my<00:00:31.990> water<00:00:32.320> pump<00:00:32.590> I

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
particular problem with my water pump I

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.389 
particular problem with my water pump I
think<00:00:33.160> by<00:00:33.430> looking<00:00:33.940> at<00:00:34.329> it<00:00:34.510> I<00:00:35.190> don't<00:00:36.190> know<00:00:36.309> if

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
think by looking at it I don't know if

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.160 
think by looking at it I don't know if
you<00:00:36.489> can<00:00:36.610> tell<00:00:36.820> with<00:00:37.090> this<00:00:37.300> but<00:00:37.930> there's<00:00:38.110> a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
you can tell with this but there's a

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.590 
you can tell with this but there's a
little<00:00:38.290> bit<00:00:38.440> of<00:00:38.530> I<00:00:39.100> just<00:00:39.640> knocked<00:00:39.820> it<00:00:39.969> off<00:00:40.120> a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
little bit of I just knocked it off a

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.250 
little bit of I just knocked it off a
little<00:00:40.899> bit<00:00:41.050> of<00:00:41.230> corrosion<00:00:41.440> here<00:00:42.340> and<00:00:43.260> that's

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
little bit of corrosion here and that's

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.420 
little bit of corrosion here and that's
my<00:00:44.559> suspect<00:00:45.370> of<00:00:45.700> where<00:00:46.000> it<00:00:46.120> was<00:00:46.270> leaking

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
my suspect of where it was leaking

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.850 
my suspect of where it was leaking
because<00:00:48.430> of<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:48.640> gasket<00:00:49.149> failing<00:00:49.860> and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
because of the gasket failing and

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.380 
because of the gasket failing and
eventually<00:00:51.340> -<00:00:51.520> if<00:00:51.670> you<00:00:51.760> don't<00:00:51.879> change<00:00:52.210> and

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
eventually - if you don't change and

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.319 
eventually - if you don't change and
flush<00:00:52.629> your<00:00:52.809> coolant<00:00:53.410> it<00:00:54.039> does<00:00:54.489> become<00:00:55.000> acidic

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
flush your coolant it does become acidic

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.600 
flush your coolant it does become acidic
and<00:00:55.690> then<00:00:55.930> of<00:00:56.199> course<00:00:56.469> with<00:00:56.770> aluminum<00:00:57.280> parts

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
and then of course with aluminum parts

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.700 
and then of course with aluminum parts
you<00:00:58.329> definitely<00:00:58.840> want<00:00:58.989> to<00:00:59.050> make<00:00:59.109> sure<00:00:59.469> you

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
you definitely want to make sure you

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.279 
you definitely want to make sure you
flush<00:00:59.949> that<00:01:00.160> every<00:01:00.460> now<00:01:00.579> and<00:01:00.730> again<00:01:01.170> showing<00:01:02.170> a

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
flush that every now and again showing a

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:03.720 
flush that every now and again showing a
little<00:01:02.469> bit<00:01:02.559> of<00:01:02.649> rust<00:01:02.859> going<00:01:03.280> against<00:01:03.609> the

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
little bit of rust going against the

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.080 
little bit of rust going against the
cast<00:01:04.089> block<00:01:04.420> but<00:01:05.049> other<00:01:06.010> than<00:01:06.189> that<00:01:06.250> not<00:01:06.580> too

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
cast block but other than that not too

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.539 
cast block but other than that not too
too<00:01:07.330> bad<00:01:07.540> nothing<00:01:08.350> in<00:01:08.710> here<00:01:08.979> there's<00:01:09.159> no<00:01:09.220> weep

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
too bad nothing in here there's no weep

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.310 
too bad nothing in here there's no weep
holes<00:01:09.880> like<00:01:10.150> we<00:01:10.299> used<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:10.630> see<00:01:10.840> back<00:01:11.110> in<00:01:11.140> the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
holes like we used to see back in the

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.039 
holes like we used to see back in the
day<00:01:11.909> there's<00:01:12.909> nothing<00:01:13.240> like<00:01:13.360> that<00:01:13.420> in<00:01:13.630> here

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
day there's nothing like that in here

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:15.570 
day there's nothing like that in here
usually<00:01:14.470> you<00:01:14.650> have<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:14.799> weep<00:01:15.070> hole<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.490> you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
usually you have a weep hole that you

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.950 
usually you have a weep hole that you
know<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:15.850> your<00:01:16.030> pump<00:01:16.240> is<00:01:16.360> failed

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
know that your pump is failed

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.670 
know that your pump is failed
it's<00:01:17.740> me<00:01:17.950> it<00:01:18.070> looks<00:01:18.250> like<00:01:18.430> just<00:01:18.580> a<00:01:19.530> gasket<00:01:20.530> hit

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
it's me it looks like just a gasket hit

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.510 
it's me it looks like just a gasket hit
failed<00:01:20.950> so<00:01:22.710> that's<00:01:23.710> what<00:01:23.890> these<00:01:24.070> little<00:01:24.280> guys

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
failed so that's what these little guys

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.789 
failed so that's what these little guys
look<00:01:24.820> like

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.349
