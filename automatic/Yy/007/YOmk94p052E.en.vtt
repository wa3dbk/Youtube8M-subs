00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.220
 Y 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:17.189
 the truth, I do not think that from the beginning 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.080
 both technical body and 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.509
 players has shown a unity is 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.179
 very important that inside and outside the 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.829
 court has been shown and I believe that 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.679
 that gives it the solidity that today 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:32.460
 has the group we get along very well 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:35.640
 all the technical staff as well as the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.520
 managers have joined us and 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.780
 us to them and that makes also 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.039
 work in comfort work with 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.809
 joy 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.000
 work consciously and work with the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.940
 responsibility that we ourselves 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.829
 we have set goals and projects that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.039
 let's go step by step getting I think 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.769
 that he had not lived in other 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.140
 times has really been very easy 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.539
 because we all have the same mentality 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.579
 of wanting to make history of wanting to do 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.930
 something good that of striving and of 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.290
 help the partner 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.830
 I think that already inside the field is very 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.880
 easy to talk to colleagues very easy 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.640
 bundle us also with a job 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.960
 before the games with Miguel and everything 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.189
 the body I have to do it pretty 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:27.460
 well is another one of 'facilitates it more and 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.470
 it really is a joint work that 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.420
 that we are all putting our granite 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.049
 of sand for this kind of 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.509
 results from a start in this era 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:42.000
 with Miguel we have proposed things 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.890
 important and I think the phrase 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.820
 it's important the group is to do 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.800
 history 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.159
 and well let's go step by step match 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.840
 party working with humility the 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:58.330
 team is making a great effort and 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.479
 we hope to maintain the level that 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.060
 now we have already shown and with content 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.250
 for being in the next round but 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.490
 comes an extremely difficult match 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.490
 as well
