so<00:05:31.670> we'll<00:05:31.790> probably<00:05:31.940> one<00:05:32.300> of<00:05:32.420> these<00:05:32.510> like<00:05:32.750> once

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
so we'll probably one of these like once

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.930 
so we'll probably one of these like once
a<00:05:33.140> month<00:05:33.320> it's<00:05:33.590> maybe<00:05:33.830> I<00:05:34.070> don't<00:05:34.160> know<00:05:34.310> I<00:05:34.340> I'm
