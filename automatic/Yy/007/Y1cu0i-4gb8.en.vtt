00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.017
 Give a random word 

00:00:03.056 --> 00:00:06.118
 Sadness say- 

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.152
 Melancholy has a number of synonyms 

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:12.061
 But what about the synonyms of these synonyms? 

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:16.094
 Synonyms and synonyms are synonymous with l? 

00:00:17.072 --> 00:00:19.076
 If you go far enough and in the right direction - 

00:00:20.014 --> 00:00:21.092
 What words will you find? 

00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:23.138
 How will these words become different? 

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:29.024
 So a path of "melancholy" to a word like, say - 

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:33.102
 "Fulfillment" can be detected if you dig deep enough 

00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:37.031
 Tandem is a game found on these tracks 

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:04.054
 When you start a new game you are presented with a target word, and it's definition 

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:08.096
 For this tutorial, our goal word is "tandem" 

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:14.052
 Banging from right to left, we see our starting word, in this case "trust" 

00:01:15.062 --> 00:01:19.158
 We see confidence has many pages of synonyms, four per page 

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:27.071
 Tapping any one of these replaces the current range and reveals synonyms for a new word 

00:01:28.068 --> 00:01:34.154
 In order to complete the game, you must get the target word as fast and comfortable as possible 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.094
 The voice reacts dynamically to your choices and can help clarify whether you are going in the right direction 

00:01:43.084 --> 00:01:47.092
 If you make a mistake, the previous word is always in the top right corner 

00:01:49.048 --> 00:01:54.092
 If the target word is among the synonyms of the current word, it will always be in the top right 

00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:05.032
 In the "More" section, you can change the difficulty of the game 

00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:08.048
 You can also see the latest winning methods and dozens of other players 

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:18.136
 By holding down the 'New Game' button, you can enter a challenge mode where you can enter a passcode 

00:02:19.078 --> 00:02:24.144
 If two players enter the same pass code and they are on the same difficulty place, they can compete 

00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:34.045
 This way, you can challenge dozens on Twitter or race friends and family 

00:02:36.014 --> 00:02:41.014
 Hope you enjoy your trip through tandem!
