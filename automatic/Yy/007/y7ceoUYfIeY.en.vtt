take the cab key in with you if you have
got<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> battery<00:01:41.869> get<00:01:42.869> them<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.289> change<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
got a battery get them to change the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.660 
got a battery get them to change the
battery<00:01:44.390> but<00:01:45.390> keep<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.899> old<00:01:46.050> battery

that's for random again CAD key you miss

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.980 
that's for random again CAD key you miss
your<00:02:10.270> mathlete

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.050
