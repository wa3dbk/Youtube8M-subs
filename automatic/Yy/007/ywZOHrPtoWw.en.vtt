here you can have a set focus button and
you<00:02:02.369> tap<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.790> screen<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.450> walk<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.869> focus

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
you tap the screen and you walk to focus

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.350 
you tap the screen and you walk to focus
in<00:02:04.409> which<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.710> kind<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.920> nice<00:02:05.070> turn<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:06.060> torch

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
in which is kind of nice turn on torch

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.580 
in which is kind of nice turn on torch
is<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:06.810> what<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:06.930> sounds<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.350> it's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
is just what it sounds like it's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.290 
is just what it sounds like it's
starting<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> flash<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.729> back<00:02:09.000> there

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
starting on the flash on the back there

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.260 
starting on the flash on the back there
even<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> 928<00:02:10.890> we<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.370> an<00:02:11.489> LED<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.120> that

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
even on a 928 we have an LED so that

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.000 
even on a 928 we have an LED so that
works<00:02:12.480> with

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
works with

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.720 
works with
and<00:02:13.400> then<00:02:14.209> you<00:02:14.480> have<00:02:15.189> you<00:02:16.189> can<00:02:16.340> do<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.459> front

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
and then you have you can do a front

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.179 
and then you have you can do a front
facing<00:02:16.939> camera<00:02:17.390> if<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:17.659> choose<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.349> and<00:02:18.620> then

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
facing camera if you choose to and then

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.819 
facing camera if you choose to and then
once<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.579> start<00:02:20.390> tapping<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.900> screen<00:02:21.079> you

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
once you start tapping the screen you

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.830 
once you start tapping the screen you
can<00:02:21.920> see<00:02:22.069> that<00:02:22.220> little<00:02:22.370> progress<00:02:22.760> bar<00:02:23.239> it<00:02:23.480> is

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
can see that little progress bar it is

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.479 
can see that little progress bar it is
actually<00:02:24.019> recording<00:02:24.680> little<00:02:24.950> video<00:02:25.189> clips

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
actually recording little video clips

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.339 
actually recording little video clips
now<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:25.939> that's<00:02:26.180> how<00:02:26.299> you<00:02:26.360> do<00:02:26.599> vine<00:02:26.840> right<00:02:27.170> you

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
now so that's how you do vine right you

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.770 
now so that's how you do vine right you
set<00:02:27.560> up<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.829> shot<00:02:28.040> take<00:02:28.879> a<00:02:28.909> small<00:02:29.540> little

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
set up the shot take a small little

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.380 
set up the shot take a small little
video<00:02:30.170> clip<00:02:30.409> and<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:31.069> keep<00:02:31.250> tapping<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:31.909> then

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
video clip and you keep tapping and then

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.509 
video clip and you keep tapping and then
eventually<00:02:32.510> you're<00:02:33.079> going<00:02:33.349> to<00:02:33.470> lock<00:02:34.129> it<00:02:34.370> in

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
eventually you're going to lock it in

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.360 
eventually you're going to lock it in
and<00:02:34.700> upload<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:35.959> server<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.739> that's

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
and upload it to the server and that's

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.699 
and upload it to the server and that's
how<00:02:37.519> it<00:02:37.670> works<00:02:37.940> actually<00:02:38.239> is<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:39.049> uploads<00:02:39.560> it

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
how it works actually is it uploads it

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.000 
how it works actually is it uploads it
through<00:02:39.980> Rudy<00:02:40.700> humans<00:02:41.030> server<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:42.560> then<00:02:42.859> it

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
through Rudy humans server and then it

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.930 
through Rudy humans server and then it
processes<00:02:43.609> it<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.909> the<00:02:44.359> vine<00:02:45.019> server<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.760> it's

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
processes it to the vine server so it's

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.940 
processes it to the vine server so it's
sort<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.180> like<00:02:47.299> the<00:02:47.480> first<00:02:48.140> instagram<00:02:48.709> app

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
sort of like the first instagram app

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.520 
sort of like the first instagram app
that<00:02:49.220> we've<00:02:49.340> had<00:02:49.579> and<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.720> uses<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:51.109> relay

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
that we've had and so it uses a relay

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.140 
that we've had and so it uses a relay
system<00:02:51.950> but<00:02:52.400> it's<00:02:52.549> actually<00:02:52.639> pretty<00:02:52.879> fast

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
system but it's actually pretty fast

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.910 
system but it's actually pretty fast
it's<00:02:53.420> working<00:02:53.720> well<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.139> i've<00:02:54.290> had<00:02:54.319> no<00:02:54.620> issues

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
it's working well and i've had no issues

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.460 
it's working well and i've had no issues
so<00:02:55.310> far<00:02:55.340> with<00:02:55.819> it<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:56.359> can<00:02:56.540> even<00:02:56.659> then<00:02:56.959> post<00:02:57.290> to

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470
