00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.410
 batista70phone lights today I present to you 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.960
 a waterproof bag that you can find 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.220
 in our shop at very cheap prices 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.900
 competitive 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.439
 then as you see above we have the 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.360
 possibility of closing in a manner 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.949
 hermetic 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.199
 ok 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.240
 the nice thing about this bag then 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.370
 this is the back and this is the part 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.239
 frontal now we are going to enter mine 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.120
 g2 I assume all the responsibilities 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.540
 we are going to close well above 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.079
 let's try to adhere should it have 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:50.620
 joined well you should not open yes 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.559
 hopes yes as you see is now firmly in place 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.180
 double tap number takes because I have the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.710
 film though once I go 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.210
 to unlock 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.129
 as you can see there is no minimum 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.899
 problem I can safely 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.539
 interact with hands I want to go 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.910
 in the neutral wer a second one is loaded 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:13.380
 and I'm going to interact quietly 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.330
 I want to go and consult the internet 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.450
 I go to my website peacefully Apple 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.759
 opens I can easily do all the 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.670
 operations I usually do for 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.009
 this film adheres really well e 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.869
 keep in mind that I have the further 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:33.849
 glass film above so let's say that 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.429
 as you can see despite our site 

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:38.170
 be it even a little newco you can see that 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.119
 it flows quietly then we return 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.619
 from the home 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.550
 if on one side it flows on the other 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.140
 without any problem 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.520
 come on now we can turn it off as 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.380
 see take the inactivation command 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.450
 I don't understand why he can't 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.039
 take it probably from Cuba too 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.989
 from the film life in this case does 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.979
 we have nothing behind our button 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:59.050
 release 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.259
 now we're going to do the non water test 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.810
 should it work lucio will hear me 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.800
 given that usual idea and his we go to 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.479
 put it in the water 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.520
 and now everything obviously touched inside 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.470
 the keys do not work when in the water does not work 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.940
 as you well know there is no management 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.910
 so it can't work if we pull it 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.470
 out of the water we give a play like 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.770
 you see it's already back to work 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.140
 completely without any problems 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.459
 now let's dry a little I don't want to get wet 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.280
 everywhere we do what they do 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.980
 let's stop for a moment let's give one 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.989
 dried to the bag for safety 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.870
 because if you are at sea, for example, you are 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.470
 bring in the water and then with the stubborn 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.260
 from the bag 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:52.500
 I would say for safety to give him first 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.910
 a clean we have a passatina ok now 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.520
 we are going to extract it from our back 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.260
 as you can see above there is some water 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.390
 water has not entered now we do it 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.760
 go out eat the shirt does nothing 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.360
 now let's extract our own 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.660
 mobile phone 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.100
 our mobile is perfectly 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.470
 dry wait for no one for a moment 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.180
 the hands above are ok the water is 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.040
 entry but that little stuff as if 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.260
 it was a drop of rain 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.650
 let's go to unlock it and see 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.950
 therefore our mobile is safe and sound 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.840
 Try these beppe completely 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.260
 as I told you, you find yourself cheap 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.360
 of our shop 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.700
 you can safely use it in holding 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.350
 in hand with the bag above going into the water 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.000
 without any problem like 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.799
 see the mobile continues a 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.310
 running did not undergo any kind of 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.530
 damage 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.870
 with this concluded greeting from loris 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.870
