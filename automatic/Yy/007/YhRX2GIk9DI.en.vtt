00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.620
 another interesting sport 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.359
 the direction we wanted today 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.140
 talk this football freestyle and us 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.760
 today will tell 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.309
 Dmitry Gorsky Dmitry Hello 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello dmitry in two words what 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.049
 this direction is the direction 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.820
 appeared in the world of the beginning of the two thousandth 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.439
 years 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.410
 represents three disciplines and the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.099
 upper and tricks on the head and neck sitting 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.029
 tricks sitting and lying and opera tricks on the legs 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.910
 worth that we can not demonstrate 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.020
 so that it was clearer tricks of the fanatics 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.020
 for example the most 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.490
 the second direction of his Christ and the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.490
 upper 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
 Alina 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.720
 3 10 pnv and set it sitting 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.960
 impressive but something most 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.700
 simple most banal say of tricks 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.329
 foot and you could show me for example 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.970
 could repeat 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:19.630
 meeting three disciplines la vera is 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:21.850
 crossover 3 trains with a roll that is 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.960
 you need and then also the movement is performed 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.960
 with coinage 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.359
 to wash from that here as well 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.479
 then we have a word about white heat to 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.039
 keeping well let's put in place 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:55.520
 where the hair begins and on to the spot 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.520
 sounds pretty easy 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.500
 issues 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.880
 here 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.800
 foot 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.780
 Dmitry apparently nothing special with me 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.310
 It did not work out but that all of them and how 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.170
 don't please the viewers maybe 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.920
 demonstrate something from 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.920
 especially difficult 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.810
 it was gorgeous dmitry when the trick 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.340
 called on the sofa and now if there is 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.720
 some kind of school complexity how much do you need 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.730
 the complexity of which branches are big 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.319
 thank you for teaching you very cool 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.430
 I hope that this is the direction 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.629
 organists will only recruit 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.629
 popularity thanks
