alright<00:00:02.700> guys<00:00:02.879> I'll<00:00:03.480> show<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.750> how<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.870> do<00:00:04.020> a

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
alright guys I'll show you how to do a

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.500 
alright guys I'll show you how to do a
PWM<00:00:04.859> delete<00:00:05.600> for<00:00:06.600> your<00:00:06.810> 4l60e<00:00:07.410> transmission

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
PWM delete for your 4l60e transmission

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.650 
PWM delete for your 4l60e transmission
PWM<00:00:10.580> now<00:00:11.580> what<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:11.910> want<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.120> do<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.509> want

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
PWM now what you want to do is you want

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.299 
PWM now what you want to do is you want
to<00:00:12.690> take<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.960> PWM<00:00:13.530> solenoid<00:00:14.009> out<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
to take the PWM solenoid out of the

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.550 
to take the PWM solenoid out of the
passenger<00:00:14.580> side<00:00:15.240> valve<00:00:15.719> body<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.410> have<00:00:16.529> to

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
passenger side valve body you have to

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.099 
passenger side valve body you have to
drop<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.949> pan<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.400> course<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.449> there's<00:00:18.990> like

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
drop the pan of course and there's like

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.260 
drop the pan of course and there's like
a<00:00:19.140> little<00:00:19.289> clip<00:00:19.650> right<00:00:20.160> here<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.850> just<00:00:21.060> get<00:00:21.240> a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
a little clip right here you just get a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.939 
a little clip right here you just get a
pic<00:00:21.600> or<00:00:21.750> something<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.230> there<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.619> pry<00:00:22.890> it

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
pic or something in there and you pry it

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.580 
pic or something in there and you pry it
out<00:00:23.539> and<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.109> whole<00:00:25.199> thing<00:00:25.439> I'll<00:00:25.560> just

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
out and it's the whole thing I'll just

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.769 
out and it's the whole thing I'll just
slide<00:00:25.949> back<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.640> will<00:00:26.849> be<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.210> passenger

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
slide back this will be on the passenger

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.810 
slide back this will be on the passenger
side<00:00:27.990> very<00:00:28.380> passenger<00:00:29.279> side<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.640> valve

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
side very passenger side of the valve

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.110 
side very passenger side of the valve
body<00:00:30.619> it<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:31.859> slides<00:00:32.160> out<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.520> cut<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
body it just slides out and cut the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
body it just slides out and cut the
connector<00:00:35.899> and<00:00:37.579> you<00:00:38.579> want<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> take<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.450> front

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
connector and you want to take the front

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.319 
connector and you want to take the front
o<00:00:40.379> ring<00:00:45.260> damn<00:00:46.260> thing<00:00:46.500> will<00:00:46.680> focus<00:00:47.120> there<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.180> go

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
o ring damn thing will focus there we go

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.100 
o ring damn thing will focus there we go
I'm<00:00:48.450> gonna<00:00:48.570> take<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.960> front<00:00:49.230> overhang<00:00:49.500> off

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
I'm gonna take that front overhang off

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.580 
I'm gonna take that front overhang off
and<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.620> newer<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.230> what<00:00:55.500> you

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
want to do is take a Dremel drill bit

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.700 
want to do is take a Dremel drill bit
this<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.789> like<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> little<00:01:00.210> dremel<00:01:00.989> tool<00:01:01.410> kind

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
this is like a little dremel tool kind

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.229 
this is like a little dremel tool kind
of<00:01:01.859> thing<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.250> didn't<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.910> none<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> those

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
of thing I didn't have none of those

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.980 
of thing I didn't have none of those
little<00:01:03.300> little<00:01:04.140> small<00:01:04.470> disks<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.189> it

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
little little small disks for it

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.219 
little little small disks for it
exhale<00:01:07.530> broke<00:01:08.010> up<00:01:08.400> anyway<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:09.840> want<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.080> get

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
exhale broke up anyway you want to get

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.609 
exhale broke up anyway you want to get
that<00:01:10.820> get<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.030> those<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.479> cut<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> little

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
that get one of those and cut a little

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:23.420 
that get one of those and cut a little
knot<00:01:16.939> into<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:21.890> and<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.280> want

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
knot into it just like that and you want

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.560 
knot into it just like that and you want
to<00:01:23.490> leave<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.820> overhang<00:01:24.360> off<00:01:26.150> so<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.299> just

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
to leave that overhang off so it just

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.469 
to leave that overhang off so it just
pretty<00:01:28.049> much<00:01:28.229> bypasses<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:30.299> pwm<00:01:31.229> solenoid

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
pretty much bypasses the pwm solenoid

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.910 
pretty much bypasses the pwm solenoid
it's<00:01:33.479> not<00:01:33.689> regulated<00:01:34.110> anymore<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.740> whenever

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it's not regulated anymore so whenever

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.230 
it's not regulated anymore so whenever
the<00:01:35.930> transmission<00:01:36.930> locks<00:01:37.530> up<00:01:37.829> it'll<00:01:38.280> lock<00:01:38.939> up

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the transmission locks up it'll lock up

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.700 
the transmission locks up it'll lock up
write<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:39.990> there<00:01:40.140> instead<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.470> slipping

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
write that in there instead of slipping

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.980 
write that in there instead of slipping
in<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:40.979> lock<00:01:41.220> up<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:42.360> what<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.689> solenoid

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
in the lock up like what this solenoid

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.530 
in the lock up like what this solenoid
makes<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.710> makes<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.540> pretty

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
makes it do it makes it like a pretty

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.520 
makes it do it makes it like a pretty
much<00:01:45.720> where<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:45.960> don't<00:01:46.110> even<00:01:46.229> feel<00:01:46.500> it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
much where you don't even feel it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.700 
much where you don't even feel it
shifting<00:01:47.659> very<00:01:48.659> shifting<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.170> lock-up<00:01:49.590> you

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
shifting very shifting the lock-up you

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.719 
shifting very shifting the lock-up you
pretty<00:01:49.890> much<00:01:49.979> don't<00:01:50.159> feel<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:50.610> this

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
pretty much don't feel it with this

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.980 
pretty much don't feel it with this
thing<00:01:51.710> but<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.090> also<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.750> want<00:01:54.899> to

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
thing but you know also if you want to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.560 
thing but you know also if you want to
hook<00:01:55.259> up<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.530> switch<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.070> your<00:01:56.159> TCC<00:01:56.700> manually

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
hook up a switch to your TCC manually

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.389 
hook up a switch to your TCC manually
control<00:01:57.930> lockup<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.860> would<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.219> take

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
control lockup you would have to take

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.300 
control lockup you would have to take
this<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.880> do<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.689> mod<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:01.979> do

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
this and do this mod so that you can do

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.249 
this and do this mod so that you can do
that<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:05.390> there<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.509> go<00:02:06.689> I'll<00:02:06.930> tell<00:02:07.110> you

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
that so there you go I'll tell you

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.029 
that so there you go I'll tell you
eliminate<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.700> PWM<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> 4l60e

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
eliminate the PWM and the 4l60e

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.250 
eliminate the PWM and the 4l60e
transmission
