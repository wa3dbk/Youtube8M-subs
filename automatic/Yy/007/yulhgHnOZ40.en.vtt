because<00:03:48.959> not<00:03:49.260> only<00:03:49.290> does<00:03:49.590> he<00:03:49.650> get<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.920> spell

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
because not only does he get the spell

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.680 
because not only does he get the spell
and<00:03:50.250> trap<00:03:50.310> protection<00:03:51.209> but<00:03:51.360> then<00:03:51.480> he<00:03:51.540> gets

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
and trap protection but then he gets

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.620 
and trap protection but then he gets
kirky<00:03:52.080> on<00:03:52.230> yeah<00:03:52.640> that<00:03:53.640> is<00:03:53.820> really<00:03:54.030> bad<00:03:54.360> that<00:03:54.540> he

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
kirky on yeah that is really bad that he

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.430 
kirky on yeah that is really bad that he
had<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.980> infestation<00:03:55.980> infection<00:03:57.440> so

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
had the infestation infection so

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.180 
had the infestation infection so
basically<00:03:58.890> um<00:04:00.050> knifing<00:04:01.050> I<00:04:01.500> guess<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:02.040> could

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
basically um knifing I guess you could

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.140 
basically um knifing I guess you could
say<00:04:02.370> he<00:04:02.550> got<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.880> use<00:04:03.030> my<00:04:03.060> team<00:04:03.510> on<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.780> pandemic

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
say he got to use my team on a pandemic

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.490 
say he got to use my team on a pandemic
because<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.270> know<00:04:06.450> British<00:04:06.750> era<00:04:06.959> wants<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.410> it

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
because you know British era wants to it

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.860 
because you know British era wants to it
see<00:04:07.709> here<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.610> know<00:04:08.640> he<00:04:08.910> wants<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.150> exceed<00:04:09.540> and

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
see here you know he wants to exceed and

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.490 
see here you know he wants to exceed and
try<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.260> kill<00:04:10.500> affion<00:04:10.890> he<00:04:11.520> probably<00:04:11.820> wants<00:04:12.330> to

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
try and kill affion he probably wants to

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.530 
try and kill affion he probably wants to
make<00:04:13.500> 101<00:04:14.070> or<00:04:14.190> something<00:04:14.550> but<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.090> problem<00:04:15.240> is

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
make 101 or something but the problem is

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.810

if you want to want it now then chances

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.860 
if you want to want it now then chances
are<00:04:17.910> your<00:04:18.120> opponent's<00:04:18.480> just<00:04:18.600> going<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.810> go
