00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you know we're hoping that we're going

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.530 
you know we're hoping that we're going
to<00:01:10.260> see<00:01:10.530> snow<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> Rockies<00:01:11.520> that's<00:01:12.240> for

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
to see snow in the Rockies that's for

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.840 
to see snow in the Rockies that's for
sure<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.650> say<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.159> eastern<00:01:14.580> seaboard

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
sure and as I say the eastern seaboard

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.020 
sure and as I say the eastern seaboard
in<00:01:16.100> january-february<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.250> supposed<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.850> get

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
in january-february is supposed to get

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.149 
in january-february is supposed to get
some<00:01:18.240> pretty<00:01:18.450> good<00:01:18.659> storms<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.040> know

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
some pretty good storms but you know

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.310 
some pretty good storms but you know
what<00:01:20.549> they<00:01:20.729> haven't<00:01:21.119> taken<00:01:21.299> into<00:01:21.720> account<00:01:21.750> is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
what they haven't taken into account is

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.859 
what they haven't taken into account is
this<00:01:22.530> missing<00:01:23.070> sea<00:01:23.400> ice<00:01:23.580> Craig<00:01:24.150> up<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
this missing sea ice Craig up in the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.249 
this missing sea ice Craig up in the
Arctic<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.470> when<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> ice<00:01:26.610> isn't<00:01:27.000> there<00:01:27.509> all

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
Arctic and when the ice isn't there all

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.620 
Arctic and when the ice isn't there all
the<00:01:28.619> energy<00:01:29.189> that's<00:01:29.460> stored<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> Arctic

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the energy that's stored in the Arctic

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.440 
the energy that's stored in the Arctic
bleeds<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.560> into<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> atmosphere<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.909> then

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
bleeds up into the atmosphere and then

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.109 
bleeds up into the atmosphere and then
we<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:33.780> these<00:01:34.079> huge<00:01:34.770> blobs<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> jet

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
we get these huge blobs of the jet

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.690 
we get these huge blobs of the jet
stream<00:01:36.350> bringing<00:01:37.350> more<00:01:37.680> intense<00:01:38.159> cold

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
weather down into the lower 48 so it's a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.899

crapshoot right now you know let's let's

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.990 
crapshoot right now you know let's let's
take<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> look<00:01:45.600> at<00:01:45.750> past<00:01:46.229> snow<00:01:46.619> totals<00:01:47.130> if<00:01:47.729> we

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
take a look at past snow totals if we

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.569 
take a look at past snow totals if we
can<00:01:48.149> pull<00:01:48.329> those<00:01:48.509> up<00:01:49.009> bigger<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.189> want<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.460> take

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
can pull those up bigger I want to take

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.580 
can pull those up bigger I want to take
a<00:01:50.610> look<00:01:50.759> at<00:01:50.909> these<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.509> think<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.439> probably

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
a look at these I think you can probably

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.109 
a look at these I think you can probably
see<00:01:52.799> when<00:01:53.009> your<00:01:53.130> screen<00:01:53.340> there<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.610> this

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
see when your screen there is this

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.030 
see when your screen there is this

year's prediction just part of normal
fluctuations<00:01:56.790> or<00:01:56.909> are<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.600> looking<00:01:57.899> at

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
fluctuations or are we looking at

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.590 
fluctuations or are we looking at
something<00:01:58.229> entirely<00:01:58.649> different<00:01:58.860> here<00:01:59.600> yeah

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
something entirely different here yeah

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.030 
something entirely different here yeah
well<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.140> are<00:02:01.320> looking<00:02:01.619> at<00:02:01.740> something

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
well we are looking at something

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.100 
well we are looking at something
entirely<00:02:02.490> different<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.329> earth<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.810> warming

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
entirely different the earth is warming

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.800 
entirely different the earth is warming
up<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.920> know<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.159> as<00:02:05.490> things<00:02:05.880> warm<00:02:06.240> up<00:02:06.509> we're

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
up you know and as things warm up we're

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.619 
up you know and as things warm up we're
getting<00:02:07.170> these<00:02:07.320> wild<00:02:08.069> storms<00:02:08.819> wild<00:02:09.390> weather

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
getting these wild storms wild weather

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.870 
getting these wild storms wild weather
and<00:02:10.099> we<00:02:11.099> are<00:02:11.310> supposed<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.790> see<00:02:12.060> higher<00:02:12.330> toe

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
and we are supposed to see higher toe

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.110 
and we are supposed to see higher toe
but<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.410> know<00:02:14.530> it's<00:02:15.160> it's<00:02:15.430> like<00:02:15.520> there's<00:02:16.060> a

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
but it you know it's it's like there's a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.540 
but it you know it's it's like there's a
new<00:02:16.420> normal<00:02:16.780> happening<00:02:17.620> all<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.800> time<00:02:18.040> and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
new normal happening all the time and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.480 
new normal happening all the time and
and<00:02:18.930> we<00:02:19.930> know<00:02:20.110> one<00:02:20.350> thing<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:21.040> weather<00:02:21.250> is

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
and we know one thing the weather is

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.960 
and we know one thing the weather is
going<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.790> be<00:02:21.850> wild<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.710> wooly<00:02:23.820> all<00:02:24.820> right
