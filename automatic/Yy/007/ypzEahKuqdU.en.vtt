00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
components are absolutely key and it

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.490 
components are absolutely key and it
doesn't<00:02:35.580> necessarily<00:02:36.330> mean<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.470> have

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
doesn't necessarily mean that you have

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.960 
doesn't necessarily mean that you have
to<00:02:37.739> be<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.129> greatest<00:02:38.310> teacher<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:38.940> world

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
to be the greatest teacher in the world

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.670 
to be the greatest teacher in the world
of<00:02:39.390> course<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.959> greater<00:02:40.170> skills<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.650> have

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
of course the greater skills you have

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.820 
of course the greater skills you have
the<00:02:41.010> better<00:02:41.190> but<00:02:42.030> it's<00:02:42.239> not<00:02:42.379> this<00:02:43.379> money

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
the better but it's not this money

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.250 
the better but it's not this money
making<00:02:44.310> ability<00:02:44.819> is<00:02:44.970> not<00:02:45.180> really<00:02:45.569> centered

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
making ability is not really centered

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.630 
making ability is not really centered
around<00:02:47.150> your<00:02:48.150> guitar<00:02:48.480> teaching<00:02:48.780> skills<00:02:49.050> alone

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
around your guitar teaching skills alone

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.369 
around your guitar teaching skills alone
so<00:02:50.640> even<00:02:51.030> if<00:02:51.120> your<00:02:51.300> teaching<00:02:51.780> skills<00:02:51.870> are<00:02:52.200> only

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
so even if your teaching skills are only

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.949 
so even if your teaching skills are only
let's<00:02:52.830> just<00:02:52.920> say<00:02:53.220> average<00:02:53.480> they're<00:02:54.480> not<00:02:54.660> super

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
let's just say average they're not super

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.399 
let's just say average they're not super
great<00:02:55.379> you<00:02:56.069> can<00:02:56.400> still<00:02:57.330> make<00:02:57.569> a<00:02:57.780> lot<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.260> money

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
great you can still make a lot of money

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.220
