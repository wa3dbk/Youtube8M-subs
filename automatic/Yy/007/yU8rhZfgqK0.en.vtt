is<00:03:48.139> at<00:03:48.440> what<00:03:48.680> they're<00:03:48.829> doing<00:03:49.099> down<00:03:49.130> there

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
is at what they're doing down there

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.839

here's<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.000> guy<00:03:50.180> standing<00:03:50.480> there<00:03:51.639> the<00:03:52.639> disc

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
here's the guy standing there the disc

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.339 
here's the guy standing there the disc
set<00:03:53.060> down<00:03:53.209> on<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.480> platforms<00:03:54.079> remember

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
set down on the platforms remember

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:55.599 
set down on the platforms remember
earlier<00:03:54.709> I<00:03:54.769> was<00:03:54.919> telling<00:03:55.160> me<00:03:55.220> about<00:03:55.280> how<00:03:55.549> the

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
earlier I was telling me about how the

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.400 
earlier I was telling me about how the
condensers<00:03:56.180> charge<00:03:56.480> out<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.840> bottom<00:03:57.200> we<00:03:57.349> have

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
condensers charge out the bottom we have

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.620 
condensers charge out the bottom we have
to<00:03:57.620> charge<00:03:57.919> the<00:03:58.099> field<00:03:58.340> up<00:03:58.609> if<00:03:58.819> you<00:03:59.329> get<00:03:59.480> too

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
to charge the field up if you get too

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.690 
to charge the field up if you get too
close<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.200> earth<00:04:00.349> the<00:04:00.799> charge<00:04:01.069> dissipates

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
close to the earth the charge dissipates

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.759 
close to the earth the charge dissipates
because<00:04:02.090> it's<00:04:02.269> grounded<00:04:02.720> these<00:04:03.319> metal

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
because it's grounded these metal

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.409 
because it's grounded these metal
platforms<00:04:04.430> they<00:04:04.549> sit<00:04:04.790> them<00:04:04.970> down<00:04:05.000> on<00:04:05.180> the

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
platforms they sit them down on the

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:07.870 
platforms they sit them down on the
platforms<00:04:06.109> then<00:04:06.680> they<00:04:07.069> can<00:04:07.250> keep<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.609> ship

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
platforms then they can keep the ship

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.300 
platforms then they can keep the ship
charged<00:04:08.419> up<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:09.410> if<00:04:09.500> they<00:04:09.620> need<00:04:09.769> to<00:04:09.799> take<00:04:10.040> back

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
charged up and if they need to take back

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.970 
charged up and if they need to take back
off

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
off

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.350 
off
way<00:04:11.069> they<00:04:11.280> can<00:04:11.489> they<00:04:11.700> don't<00:04:11.909> have<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.180> wait<00:04:12.330> for

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
way they can they don't have to wait for

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.119 
way they can they don't have to wait for
the<00:04:12.540> ship<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.810> charge<00:04:13.170> back<00:04:13.470> up<00:04:13.500> the

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
the ship to charge back up the

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.490 
the ship to charge back up the
platform's<00:04:14.790> charge<00:04:15.120> them<00:04:15.390> up<00:04:15.510> for<00:04:15.750> them<00:04:15.959> so

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
platform's charge them up for them so

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.650 
platform's charge them up for them so
they<00:04:16.530> can<00:04:16.650> lift<00:04:16.949> right<00:04:17.160> back<00:04:17.430> off<00:04:17.669> if<00:04:18.209> they<00:04:18.479> was

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
they can lift right back off if they was

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.390 
they can lift right back off if they was
sitting<00:04:18.989> down<00:04:19.019> without<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.680> platform<00:04:20.220> on<00:04:20.370> the

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
sitting down without the platform on the

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.340 
sitting down without the platform on the
tripod<00:04:20.729> legs<00:04:21.209> they<00:04:21.750> got<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.019> go<00:04:22.079> through<00:04:22.229> the

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
tripod legs they got to go through the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.750 
tripod legs they got to go through the
process<00:04:22.560> again<00:04:22.919> at<00:04:23.190> charging<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.639> capacitor

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
process again at charging the capacitor

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.520 
process again at charging the capacitor
is<00:04:24.360> up<00:04:24.479> which<00:04:24.630> takes<00:04:24.840> three<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.169> four<00:04:25.380> minutes

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
is up which takes three to four minutes

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.050 
is up which takes three to four minutes
so<00:04:26.250> if<00:04:26.340> there's<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.580> hurry<00:04:26.760> to<00:04:26.910> get<00:04:27.000> away

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
so if there's a hurry to get away

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.150

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.850 
bombs or anything out of them it ignites
the<00:05:14.729> balls<00:05:14.940> so<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:15.960> took<00:05:16.080> of<00:05:16.229> Allah<00:05:16.440> they<00:05:16.650> don't

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
the balls so it took of Allah they don't

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.200 
the balls so it took of Allah they don't
even<00:05:16.979> have<00:05:17.099> weapons<00:05:17.580> on<00:05:17.729> them<00:05:17.849> for<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:18.090> while

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
even have weapons on them for a while

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.870 
even have weapons on them for a while
then<00:05:18.690> they<00:05:18.780> had<00:05:18.930> to<00:05:19.020> come<00:05:19.169> up<00:05:19.200> with<00:05:19.880> other

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
then they had to come up with other

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.700 
then they had to come up with other
kinds<00:05:21.270> of<00:05:21.360> devices<00:05:21.599> this<00:05:22.349> was<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.590> first

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
kinds of devices this was the first

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.800 
kinds of devices this was the first
pictures<00:05:23.280> I<00:05:23.430> saw<00:05:23.700> from<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:23.970> kid<00:05:24.210> in<00:05:24.330> Florida

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
pictures I saw from the kid in Florida

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.080 
pictures I saw from the kid in Florida
of<00:05:24.870> his<00:05:24.990> German<00:05:25.410> contacts<00:05:25.950> and<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.940> my

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
of his German contacts and to my

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.610 
of his German contacts and to my
knowledge<00:05:27.270> I<00:05:27.570> still<00:05:27.840> think<00:05:28.050> they're<00:05:28.200> his<00:05:28.320> best

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
knowledge I still think they're his best

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.550 
knowledge I still think they're his best
and<00:05:28.889> perhaps<00:05:29.310> his<00:05:29.639> only<00:05:29.970> contacts<00:05:30.539> I<00:05:30.840> think<00:05:31.410> he

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
and perhaps his only contacts I think he

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.110 
and perhaps his only contacts I think he
probably<00:05:31.590> had<00:05:32.070> a<00:05:32.099> couple<00:05:32.370> of<00:05:32.490> contacts<00:05:32.970> from

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
probably had a couple of contacts from

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.379 
probably had a couple of contacts from
these<00:05:33.330> people<00:05:33.720> they<00:05:33.990> came<00:05:34.789> they<00:05:35.789> took<00:05:35.820> him<00:05:36.150> for

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
these people they came they took him for

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:37.850 
these people they came they took him for
a<00:05:36.419> ride<00:05:36.510> it<00:05:36.990> looks<00:05:37.139> like<00:05:37.289> a<00:05:37.320> one<00:05:37.620> or<00:05:37.740> two

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
a ride it looks like a one or two

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.529 
a ride it looks like a one or two
occasions<00:05:38.160> and<00:05:38.669> then<00:05:38.940> perhaps<00:05:39.090> they<00:05:39.360> never

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
occasions and then perhaps they never

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.600 
occasions and then perhaps they never
came<00:05:39.750> back<00:05:39.960> so<00:05:40.289> it's<00:05:40.830> we<00:05:41.160> found<00:05:41.460> this

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
came back so it's we found this

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.339 
came back so it's we found this
situation<00:05:42.240> on<00:05:42.360> several<00:05:42.720> people<00:05:42.990> around<00:05:43.200> the

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
situation on several people around the

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:49.730 
situation on several people around the
planet<00:05:43.740> so<00:05:44.490> it's<00:05:44.880> not<00:05:45.060> an<00:05:45.210> uncommon<00:05:45.510> situation

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.680 

it<00:05:50.740> wasn't<00:05:51.100> et<00:05:51.400> nothing<00:05:51.760> to<00:05:51.850> do<00:05:51.970> with<00:05:52.120> ET<00:05:52.390> Now

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
it wasn't et nothing to do with ET Now

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.350 
it wasn't et nothing to do with ET Now
just<00:05:53.650> get<00:05:53.920> old<00:05:54.070> German<00:05:54.490> intelligence<00:05:54.730> figured

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
just get old German intelligence figured

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.450 
just get old German intelligence figured
it<00:05:55.450> out<00:05:55.570> I<00:05:56.200> can<00:05:56.770> tell<00:05:56.920> you<00:05:57.040> where<00:05:57.190> they<00:05:57.310> got

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
it out I can tell you where they got

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.920 
it out I can tell you where they got
it's<00:05:57.700> kind<00:05:57.910> of<00:05:57.970> a<00:05:58.060> long<00:05:58.210> story<00:05:58.270> but<00:05:58.870> basically

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
it's kind of a long story but basically

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.830 
it's kind of a long story but basically
it<00:05:59.440> came<00:05:59.650> from<00:06:00.300> German<00:06:01.300> people<00:06:01.480> who<00:06:01.720> had

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
it came from German people who had

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.870 
it came from German people who had
travelled<00:06:02.290> to<00:06:02.350> India<00:06:02.500> to<00:06:02.740> study<00:06:02.890> the<00:06:03.370> concept

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
travelled to India to study the concept

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.130 
travelled to India to study the concept
of<00:06:03.970> the<00:06:04.090> grill<00:06:04.360> the<00:06:04.600> energy<00:06:04.930> of<00:06:05.020> the<00:06:05.110> universe

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
of the grill the energy of the universe

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.230 
of the grill the energy of the universe
and<00:06:05.800> they<00:06:06.280> were<00:06:06.340> trying<00:06:06.670> to<00:06:06.760> figure<00:06:06.910> out<00:06:07.120> how

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
and they were trying to figure out how

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.120 
and they were trying to figure out how
to<00:06:07.300> levitate<00:06:07.660> their<00:06:08.020> own<00:06:08.140> bodies<00:06:08.560> to<00:06:08.830> move<00:06:08.980> in

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
to levitate their own bodies to move in

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.190 
to levitate their own bodies to move in
time<00:06:09.370> and<00:06:09.730> they<00:06:10.150> came<00:06:10.420> back<00:06:10.660> and<00:06:11.140> they

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
time and they came back and they

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.540 
time and they came back and they
explained<00:06:11.680> it<00:06:11.770> to<00:06:11.920> people<00:06:12.220> what<00:06:12.310> they<00:06:12.490> were

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
explained it to people what they were

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.950 
explained it to people what they were
doing<00:06:12.790> in<00:06:13.030> India<00:06:13.300> how<00:06:13.450> they<00:06:13.600> were<00:06:13.690> trying<00:06:13.870> to

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
doing in India how they were trying to

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.410 
doing in India how they were trying to
travel<00:06:14.380> in<00:06:14.500> time<00:06:14.710> and<00:06:15.040> some<00:06:15.610> German<00:06:15.940> engineers

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
travel in time and some German engineers

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.480 
travel in time and some German engineers
tried<00:06:16.660> to<00:06:16.870> build<00:06:17.140> a<00:06:17.380> machine<00:06:17.530> to<00:06:17.740> travel<00:06:18.130> in

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
tried to build a machine to travel in

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.490 
tried to build a machine to travel in
time<00:06:18.700> but<00:06:19.420> when<00:06:19.570> they<00:06:19.690> turn<00:06:19.900> the<00:06:20.080> thing<00:06:20.230> on<00:06:20.440> and

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
time but when they turn the thing on and

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.710 
time but when they turn the thing on and
lift<00:06:20.890> it<00:06:21.010> up<00:06:21.100> off<00:06:21.280> the<00:06:21.460> floor<00:06:21.610> instead<00:06:22.180> they

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
lift it up off the floor instead they

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.420 
lift it up off the floor instead they
didn't<00:06:23.020> time<00:06:23.200> travel<00:06:23.620> but<00:06:23.740> it<00:06:23.830> floated<00:06:24.250> and

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
didn't time travel but it floated and

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.130 
didn't time travel but it floated and
they<00:06:24.880> stumble<00:06:25.240> onto<00:06:25.390> the<00:06:25.570> idea<00:06:25.870> of<00:06:25.960> how<00:06:26.110> to

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
they stumble onto the idea of how to

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.050 
they stumble onto the idea of how to
make<00:06:26.530> what's<00:06:26.800> called<00:06:26.860> a<00:06:27.130> real<00:06:27.370> levitation

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
make what's called a real levitation

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.210 
make what's called a real levitation
device<00:06:28.360> we<00:06:29.020> think<00:06:29.320> they<00:06:29.470> did<00:06:29.500> that<00:06:29.680> probably

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
device we think they did that probably

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.680 
device we think they did that probably
the<00:06:30.280> first<00:06:30.460> time<00:06:30.730> in<00:06:31.000> sometime<00:06:31.450> probably

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
the first time in sometime probably

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.770 
the first time in sometime probably
around<00:06:32.020> 25<00:06:32.590> or<00:06:32.800> 27<00:06:33.280> and<00:06:33.670> then<00:06:34.210> the<00:06:34.300> concept

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
around 25 or 27 and then the concept

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.270 
around 25 or 27 and then the concept
laid<00:06:34.930> around<00:06:35.080> in<00:06:35.350> private<00:06:35.680> circles<00:06:36.070> for<00:06:36.250> a

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
laid around in private circles for a

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.430 
laid around in private circles for a
while<00:06:36.370> and<00:06:36.730> then<00:06:36.850> became<00:06:37.150> a<00:06:37.200> potential<00:06:38.200> thing

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
while and then became a potential thing

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.230 
while and then became a potential thing
during<00:06:38.680> the<00:06:38.860> war<00:06:39.070> and<00:06:39.100> then<00:06:39.520> really<00:06:40.000> didn't

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
during the war and then really didn't

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.260 
during the war and then really didn't
happen<00:06:40.510> till<00:06:40.630> after<00:06:40.990> the<00:06:41.020> war
