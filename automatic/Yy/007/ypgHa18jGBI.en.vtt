00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:25.900
 Employed by the Emperor Nilfgaard, murderer, thief, cannibalism... 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.200
 Will be hanged here... 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.980
 Or torture 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.760
 Don't step in, take the bounty and leave 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.220
 help me! 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.520
 I know that your hunters will not despise the money of the empire. 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.440
 Is hunting difficult? 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.240
 Itâ€™s definitely harder than what you are doing. 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.120
 Evil is evil 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.380
 No matter how big or small, or compromises - there is no difference 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.460
 The slut dared to bite me! 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.340
 Grab her, according to my words 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.640
 Do you like it, scorpion? 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.340
 Give me the hammer 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.280
 Knock off her teeth! 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.820
 The degree of evil is determined by himself, and the definition is very vague. 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.120
 If I want to make a choice between one kind of evil and another 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.640
 Then I would rather not choose 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.380
 Quick fix, Geralt 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.480
 Messed up? 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.580
 Close your eyes 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.660
 Flat him! 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.140
 You... Are you doing this? 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.280
 Demon demon...
