00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
fur stole collar I think it's very

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.490 
fur stole collar I think it's very
lovely<00:00:27.449> because<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:27.750> quite<00:00:27.900> seasonally

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
lovely because it's quite seasonally

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.019 
lovely because it's quite seasonally
colorful<00:00:29.010> I've<00:00:29.160> also<00:00:29.429> paired<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.789> with<00:00:29.820> these

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
colorful I've also paired it with these

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.700 
colorful I've also paired it with these
shoes<00:00:30.390> which<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> small<00:00:31.050> heel<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.619> they

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
shoes which have a small heel and they

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.010 
shoes which have a small heel and they
do<00:00:31.769> have<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> pony<00:00:32.730> hair<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.300> suppose<00:00:33.660> you'd<00:00:33.840> say

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
do have a pony hair I suppose you'd say

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.229 
do have a pony hair I suppose you'd say
at<00:00:34.620> detail<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:35.460> actually<00:00:35.760> real<00:00:36.000> pony

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
at detail it's not actually real pony

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.330 
at detail it's not actually real pony
hair<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.110> think<00:00:37.320> having<00:00:37.440> texture<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.040> shoes

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
hair and I think having texture on shoes

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.520 
hair and I think having texture on shoes
is<00:00:38.610> rather<00:00:38.790> an<00:00:39.000> unexpected<00:00:39.750> detail<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.440> I

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
is rather an unexpected detail and I

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.290 
is rather an unexpected detail and I
also<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.980> wearing<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.399> quite<00:00:41.760> short<00:00:42.030> skirt

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
also like wearing this quite short skirt

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.030 
also like wearing this quite short skirt
with<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.570> because<00:00:42.750> if<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> cape<00:00:43.440> blows<00:00:43.710> even

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
with it because if the cape blows even

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.590 
with it because if the cape blows even
in<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.190> wind<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.579> bit<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.390> wasn't

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
in the wind it's a bit like I wasn't

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.330 
in the wind it's a bit like I wasn't
expecting<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> whole

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
expecting that and because the whole

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
expecting that and because the whole
outfit<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.820> itself<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.270> rather<00:00:48.450> demure<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.200> do

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
outfit in itself is rather demure I do

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.049 
outfit in itself is rather demure I do
think<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.710> makes<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.160> quite<00:00:50.430> modern<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
think that makes it quite modern and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.209 
think that makes it quite modern and
quite<00:00:51.690> young<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.289> also<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> leather<00:00:52.829> skirt

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
quite young and also the leather skirt

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.130 
quite young and also the leather skirt
makes<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:53.699> quite<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> nice<00:00:54.149> kind<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.510> texture

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
makes for quite a nice kind of texture

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.139 
makes for quite a nice kind of texture
contrast<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.800> think<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.430> also<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.059> wear

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
contrast I think and I also like to wear

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.450 
contrast I think and I also like to wear
this<00:00:57.239> tartan<00:00:57.690> cape<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.590> black<00:00:58.890> ruffle

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
this tartan cape with this black ruffle

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.340 
this tartan cape with this black ruffle
e<00:00:59.520> blouse<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.329> obviously<00:01:00.809> that's<00:01:01.050> quite

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
e blouse and obviously that's quite

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.709 
e blouse and obviously that's quite
romantic<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.160> historical<00:01:02.879> as<00:01:03.000> well<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.510> it's

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
romantic and historical as well and it's

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.719 
romantic and historical as well and it's
quite<00:01:03.960> reminiscent<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.400> said<00:01:05.640> in

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
quite reminiscent of as I said in

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.550 
quite reminiscent of as I said in
previous<00:01:05.880> videos<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.420> kind<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.810> period<00:01:07.229> drama

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
previous videos a kind of period drama

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.410

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.219 
this one on um it is a tweed we've won
it<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:11.970> has<00:01:12.150> some<00:01:12.330> really<00:01:12.450> lovely<00:01:12.630> detail

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.719 
it just has some really lovely detail
slightly<00:01:13.740> reminiscent<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.340> trench<00:01:14.610> coat

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
slightly reminiscent of a trench coat

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.789 
slightly reminiscent of a trench coat
just<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> kind<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.659> flap<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.409> know<00:01:16.590> how<00:01:16.770> I

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
just the kind of flap you all know how I

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.679 
just the kind of flap you all know how I
feel<00:01:17.040> about<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.340> word<00:01:17.460> flap<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.270> has<00:01:18.420> yes

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
feel about the word flap that it has yes

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.719 
feel about the word flap that it has yes
that<00:01:18.930> flap<00:01:19.290> section<00:01:19.560> there<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.310> got<00:01:20.490> very

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
that flap section there it's got very

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.120 
that flap section there it's got very
interesting<00:01:21.270> leather<00:01:21.659> piping<00:01:21.960> detail<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
interesting leather piping detail and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.950 
interesting leather piping detail and
just<00:01:23.280> those<00:01:23.490> small<00:01:23.670> details<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.390> clothing<00:01:24.720> I

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
just those small details on clothing I

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.179 
just those small details on clothing I
think<00:01:25.140> really<00:01:25.320> makes<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.710> look<00:01:25.830> much<00:01:25.950> more

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
think really makes it look much more

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.249 
think really makes it look much more
expensive<00:01:26.430> than<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.030> okay<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.600> next<00:01:27.930> I'm

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
expensive than it is okay so next I'm

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.289 
expensive than it is okay so next I'm
wearing<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.799> Navy<00:01:29.130> cape<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.210> is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
wearing this Navy cape and this one is

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.880 
wearing this Navy cape and this one is
actually<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> exact<00:01:31.049> same<00:01:31.259> style<00:01:31.530> as<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
actually the exact same style as the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.859 
actually the exact same style as the
tartan<00:01:32.310> cape<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.640> showed<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.970> first<00:01:33.150> but

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
tartan cape I showed you first but

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.899 
tartan cape I showed you first but
obviously<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.560> Navy<00:01:34.770> rather<00:01:35.189> than<00:01:35.369> tartan<00:01:35.729> I

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
obviously it's Navy rather than tartan I

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.819 
obviously it's Navy rather than tartan I
think<00:01:36.180> probably<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.780> matching<00:01:37.229> colors<00:01:37.590> of

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
think probably the matching colors of

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.920 
think probably the matching colors of
the<00:01:37.920> tartan<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.670> pinstripe<00:01:39.240> Navy<00:01:39.600> trows

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the tartan and the pinstripe Navy trows

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.719 
the tartan and the pinstripe Navy trows
this<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.229> what<00:01:40.380> make<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.650> appear<00:01:40.920> quite<00:01:41.220> suit

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
this is what make it appear quite suit

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.700 
this is what make it appear quite suit
esque<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.299> suppose<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
esque I suppose and I do like the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.620 
esque I suppose and I do like the
pairing<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> quite<00:01:44.490> subtle<00:01:44.850> pinstripe

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
pairing of the quite subtle pinstripe

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.510 
pairing of the quite subtle pinstripe
with<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> block<00:01:46.439> colour<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> Cape<00:01:47.220> and

the crisp whiteness of the blouse I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.899 
the crisp whiteness of the blouse I
think<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.560> very<00:01:49.799> smart<00:01:50.189> looking<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.729> like

jumper<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.640> think<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.939> makes<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.270> much

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450

more<00:02:00.689> casual<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.350> also<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.680> course<00:02:01.740> chilly

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
more casual and also of course chilly

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.370 
more casual and also of course chilly
weather<00:02:02.490> appropriate<00:02:02.969> if<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.049> swap<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
weather appropriate if you just swap the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.990 
weather appropriate if you just swap the
blouse<00:02:04.590> for<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> jumper<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.460> makes<00:02:05.640> everything

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
blouse for a jumper it makes everything

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.270 
blouse for a jumper it makes everything
much<00:02:06.270> warmer<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.930> also<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.799> said<00:02:07.860> much<00:02:08.220> more

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
much warmer and also as I said much more

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.669 
much warmer and also as I said much more
casual<00:02:08.849> I've<00:02:09.179> also<00:02:09.390> added<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.899> plush<00:02:10.349> hat

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
casual I've also added this plush hat

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.890 
casual I've also added this plush hat
which<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.009> rather<00:02:11.280> 20<00:02:11.849> style

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
which is rather 20 style

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.780 
which is rather 20 style
interestingly<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.829> did<00:02:14.159> some<00:02:14.280> research<00:02:14.430> about

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
interestingly I did some research about

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.369 
interestingly I did some research about
clash<00:02:15.030> hats<00:02:15.299> as<00:02:15.510> well<00:02:15.659> before<00:02:16.019> I<00:02:16.079> started

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
clash hats as well before I started

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.170 
clash hats as well before I started
doing<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.709> video<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.610> found<00:02:17.939> that<00:02:18.120> a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
doing this video and I found that a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.030 
doing this video and I found that a
cloche<00:02:18.540> actually<00:02:19.110> comes<00:02:19.379> from<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.709> French

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
cloche actually comes from the French

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.190 
cloche actually comes from the French
word<00:02:20.370> for<00:02:20.400> barrel<00:02:21.150> because<00:02:21.569> obviously<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
word for barrel because obviously the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.660 
word for barrel because obviously the
hat<00:02:22.379> looks<00:02:22.409> rather<00:02:22.799> like<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> bell<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.640> I

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
hat looks rather like a bell so I

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.770 
hat looks rather like a bell so I
thought<00:02:23.849> that<00:02:23.939> was<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.090> rather<00:02:24.209> sweet<00:02:24.540> little

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
thought that was a rather sweet little

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.539 
thought that was a rather sweet little
fact<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.170> throw<00:02:25.379> in<00:02:25.500> there<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.250> also

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
fact to throw in there for you and also

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.589 
fact to throw in there for you and also
going<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.849> show<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.269> rather
