questions<00:00:09.510> regarding<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.290> script<00:00:10.650> one<00:00:11.010> was

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
questions regarding the script one was

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.749 
questions regarding the script one was
what<00:00:13.139> would<00:00:13.290> happen<00:00:13.679> if<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.130> splines<00:00:14.519> are

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
what would happen if the splines are

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.599 
what would happen if the splines are
actual<00:00:15.360> closed<00:00:15.719> spline<00:00:16.260> system<00:00:16.830> straight

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
actual closed spline system straight

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.519 
actual closed spline system straight
lines<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:18.150> kind<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.080> like<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.380> way<00:00:19.500> i

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
lines on kind of like the way i

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.060 
lines on kind of like the way i
demonstrate<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.460> all<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.939> other<00:00:20.970> videos<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
demonstrate in all the other videos and

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.620 
demonstrate in all the other videos and
so<00:00:23.070> I've<00:00:23.220> set<00:00:23.490> up<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.789> scene<00:00:24.060> here<00:00:24.390> that

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
so I've set up this scene here that

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.890 
so I've set up this scene here that
looks<00:00:24.900> like<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.109> little<00:00:25.470> kind<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.859> round<00:00:26.900> closed

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
looks like a little kind of round closed

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.040 
looks like a little kind of round closed
track<00:00:28.410> with<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.849> pass<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.810> we're<00:00:30.900> gonna

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
track with to pass on it and we're gonna

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.150 
track with to pass on it and we're gonna
add<00:00:31.289> some<00:00:31.590> vehicles<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:34.530> other<00:00:34.649> question

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
add some vehicles and the other question

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.389 
add some vehicles and the other question
was<00:00:35.570> regarding<00:00:38.510> some<00:00:39.510> weird<00:00:40.250> movement<00:00:41.250> that

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
was regarding some weird movement that

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.869 
was regarding some weird movement that
was<00:00:41.550> happening<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:43.219> one<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.489> video

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
was happening in in one of the video

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.950 
was happening in in one of the video
tutorials<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.200> showed<00:00:46.559> and

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
tutorials that I that I showed and

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.990 
tutorials that I that I showed and
basically<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.649> was<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.430> main<00:00:50.610> video

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
basically it was on the main video

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.040 
basically it was on the main video
tutorial<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.809> did<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:53.120> minutes<00:00:54.530> 25<00:00:57.050> 35

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
tutorial if I did and that minutes 25 35

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.939 
tutorial if I did and that minutes 25 35
50<00:00:58.350> i<00:00:58.590> believe<00:00:59.180> 226<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:01.140> would<00:01:01.289> see<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.559> bus

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
50 i believe 226 you would see this bus

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.280 
50 i believe 226 you would see this bus
kind<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.460> going<00:01:02.699> around<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.000> corner<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.600> kind

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
kind of going around the corner and kind

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.640 
kind of going around the corner and kind
of<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.500> moving<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.189> really<00:01:05.640> weird<00:01:06.650> manner

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
of like moving in a really weird manner

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.550 
of like moving in a really weird manner
and<00:01:08.070> basically<00:01:08.909> that's<00:01:09.210> only<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.990> display

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
and basically that's only a display

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.340 
and basically that's only a display
issue<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.220> I'm<00:01:11.340> gonna<00:01:11.549> show<00:01:12.390> showing<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.320> here

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
issue and I'm gonna show showing it here

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.679 
issue and I'm gonna show showing it here
really<00:01:14.250> quickly<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.580> basically<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.570> I'm

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
really quickly so basically what I'm

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.740 
really quickly so basically what I'm
gonna<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:16.110> I'm<00:01:16.740> gonna<00:01:17.340> open<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.240> script

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
gonna do I'm gonna open up the script

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.499 
gonna do I'm gonna open up the script
create<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.830> crater<00:01:20.250> 8<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.210> type<00:01:21.479> of

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
create a crater 8 for this type of

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.649 
create a crater 8 for this type of
vehicle<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.580> could<00:01:23.580> click<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> build<00:01:24.299> rig

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
vehicle and could click the build rig

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.719 
vehicle and could click the build rig
and<00:01:24.960> right<00:01:25.530> now<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.280> vehicle

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
and right now that we have the vehicle

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.910 
and right now that we have the vehicle
set<00:01:27.720> what<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:28.650> gonna<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:29.130> instead<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:30.920> just

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
set what I'm gonna do instead of just

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.679 
set what I'm gonna do instead of just
sitting<00:01:32.579> me<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> path<00:01:33.090> i'm<00:01:33.299> going<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> do<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
sitting me to a path i'm going to do a

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.710 
sitting me to a path i'm going to do a
quick<00:01:33.990> keyframe<00:01:34.590> animation<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:36.390> i'm<00:01:36.509> gonna

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
quick keyframe animation so i'm gonna

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.800 
quick keyframe animation so i'm gonna
move<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> little<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:38.100> away<00:01:38.220> out

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
move this one a little bit away out

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:47.389 
move this one a little bit away out
there<00:01:40.670> actually<00:01:42.229> way<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:44.840> that's<00:01:45.840> 0<00:01:46.399> let's

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
there actually way so that's 0 let's

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.859 
there actually way so that's 0 let's
focus<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.060> here<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> hundred<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.610> right<00:01:50.610> now

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
focus on here to a hundred and right now

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.080 
focus on here to a hundred and right now
if<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.049> play<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:53.250> will<00:01:53.399> see<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.060> has

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
if I play this you will see that it has

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.130 
if I play this you will see that it has
always<00:01:54.780> weird<00:01:55.490> jerky<00:01:56.490> movement<00:01:56.969> happening<00:01:57.149> in

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
always weird jerky movement happening in

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.620 
always weird jerky movement happening in
there<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.100> that's<00:01:59.579> because<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.299> screen

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
there so that's because the screen

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.719 
there so that's because the screen
controller<00:02:01.110> tries<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.710> calculate<00:02:02.310> all<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
controller tries to calculate all the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.920 
controller tries to calculate all the
movement<00:02:03.210> happening<00:02:03.390> while<00:02:04.259> I'm<00:02:04.469> recording

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
movement happening while I'm recording

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.080 
movement happening while I'm recording
and<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:08.979> by<00:02:09.979> my<00:02:10.280> laptop<00:02:10.670> it's<00:02:10.880> not

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
and the by my laptop it's not

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.300 
and the by my laptop it's not
necessarily<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.870> fastest<00:02:12.650> machine<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.190> it's

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
necessarily the fastest machine and it's

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.210 
necessarily the fastest machine and it's
a<00:02:13.520> promise<00:02:14.300> L<00:02:14.660> designed<00:02:15.140> for<00:02:15.410> 3d<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.420> basically

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
a promise L designed for 3d so basically

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.070 
a promise L designed for 3d so basically
right<00:02:19.220> now<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.490> saw<00:02:20.000> how<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.270> actually<00:02:20.480> plays

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
right now you saw how it actually plays

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.610 
right now you saw how it actually plays
it's<00:02:21.560> all<00:02:22.000> jerky<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.030> weird<00:02:23.300> but<00:02:24.080> if<00:02:24.200> we<00:02:24.230> go

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
it's all jerky and weird but if we go

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.330 
it's all jerky and weird but if we go
here<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:26.260> make<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.290> quick<00:02:29.920> animated<00:02:30.920> sequence

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
here and make a quick animated sequence

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.010 
here and make a quick animated sequence
file<00:02:32.980> you'll<00:02:33.980> see<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.000> actual<00:02:35.330> movement

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
file you'll see that the actual movement

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.410 
file you'll see that the actual movement
it's<00:02:36.410> smooth<00:02:36.950> once<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:37.580> read<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.000> rate<00:02:38.150> then

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
it's smooth once you read the rate then

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.280 
it's smooth once you read the rate then
when<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.810> kind<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.739> set<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.070> up<00:02:40.220> for<00:02:40.600> for<00:02:41.600> for

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
when you kind of set it up for for for

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.890 
when you kind of set it up for for for
animation<00:02:43.030> invariant<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.060> see<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.390> actual

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
animation invariant to see the actual

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.560 
animation invariant to see the actual
movement<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.850> slowly<00:02:48.040> takes<00:02:49.040> off<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.700> only

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
movement so it slowly takes off and only

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.640 
movement so it slowly takes off and only
goes<00:02:50.989> into<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.590> stop<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:53.390> basically<00:02:54.320> that<00:02:54.380> was

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
goes into a stop so basically that was

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.670 
goes into a stop so basically that was
the<00:02:55.250> first<00:02:55.520> issue<00:02:58.930> listen<00:02:59.930> let's<00:03:00.290> look<00:03:00.500> at

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
the first issue listen let's look at

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.740 
the first issue listen let's look at
these<00:03:00.830> tracks<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:01.520> basically<00:03:01.970> for<00:03:02.000> this<00:03:02.420> track

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
these tracks so basically for this track

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.690 
these tracks so basically for this track
i<00:03:03.020> want<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.590> show<00:03:03.800> other<00:03:04.190> thing<00:03:04.489> that<00:03:04.520> i

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
i want to show other thing that i

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.120 
i want to show other thing that i
haven't<00:03:04.850> showed<00:03:05.180> in<00:03:05.390> that<00:03:05.570> in<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:06.130> other

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
haven't showed in that in the other

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.010 
haven't showed in that in the other
tutorials<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:07.820> I've<00:03:08.060> made<00:03:08.300> so<00:03:08.570> basically

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
tutorials that I've made so basically

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.259 
tutorials that I've made so basically
here<00:03:09.440> i<00:03:09.590> have<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.220> group<00:03:11.140> of<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:13.670> group<00:03:14.090> of

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
here i have a group of a group of

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.670 
here i have a group of a group of
separate<00:03:14.810> big<00:03:15.049> objects<00:03:15.880> that<00:03:16.930> are<00:03:17.930> creating

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
separate big objects that are creating

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.680 
separate big objects that are creating
my<00:03:18.830> terrain<00:03:19.360> so<00:03:20.360> basically<00:03:20.810> i<00:03:22.480> close<00:03:23.480> this

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
my terrain so basically i close this

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.949 
my terrain so basically i close this
group<00:03:24.019> now<00:03:24.950> when<00:03:25.519> i<00:03:25.549> when<00:03:26.090> i<00:03:26.120> go<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.510> script

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
group now when i when i go to the script

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.680 
group now when i when i go to the script
and<00:03:28.780> go<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.560> environment<00:03:30.890> setup<00:03:31.540> when<00:03:32.540> I

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
and go to the environment setup when I

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.370 
and go to the environment setup when I
said<00:03:33.010> cratering<00:03:34.010> from<00:03:34.250> selection<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:35.230> have<00:03:36.230> the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
said cratering from selection I have the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.630 
said cratering from selection I have the
object<00:03:36.709> selected<00:03:37.280> you'll<00:03:38.000> see<00:03:38.560> it<00:03:39.560> gives<00:03:40.489> me

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
object selected you'll see it gives me

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.210 
object selected you'll see it gives me
the<00:03:40.670> message<00:03:41.200> from<00:03:42.200> space<00:03:42.500> modify<00:03:43.040> was

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
the message from space modify was

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.380 
the message from space modify was
created<00:03:43.700> it<00:03:44.150> actually<00:03:44.840> creates<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:49.390> object

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
created it actually creates this object

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.630 
created it actually creates this object
here<00:03:52.810> I<00:03:53.810> salute<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.260> selection<00:03:54.739> you<00:03:55.370> see

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
here I salute the selection you see

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.150 
here I salute the selection you see
that's<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.120> filtering<00:03:57.049> all<00:03:57.440> welded<00:03:58.010> together

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
that's the filtering all welded together

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.780 
that's the filtering all welded together
and<00:03:58.760> all<00:03:59.060> attached<00:03:59.570> together<00:03:59.900> as<00:04:00.610> one<00:04:01.610> object

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
and all attached together as one object

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:10.810 
and all attached together as one object
to<00:04:02.360> be<00:04:02.900> used<00:04:03.260> in<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:07.060> in<00:04:08.060> our<00:04:08.209> simulations<00:04:09.820> so

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
to be used in the in our simulations so

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:19.060 
to be used in the in our simulations so
let's<00:04:11.739> let's<00:04:12.739> hide<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.730> initial<00:04:14.150> terrain

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:31.940 

it<00:04:20.070> always<00:04:20.310> selected<00:04:27.980> okay<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:30.590> now<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.800> we

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
it always selected okay and now that we

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.430 
it always selected okay and now that we
have<00:04:32.270> this<00:04:33.270> new<00:04:33.540> terrain<00:04:33.980> let's<00:04:36.410> make<00:04:37.410> it

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
have this new terrain let's make it

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:45.620 
have this new terrain let's make it
again<00:04:38.010> visible<00:04:39.140> so<00:04:40.140> select<00:04:43.340> an<00:04:44.340> object<00:04:44.630> pick

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
again visible so select an object pick

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.720 
again visible so select an object pick
the<00:04:45.810> Turing<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.290> be<00:04:46.440> used<00:04:46.710> right<00:04:47.370> now<00:04:47.520> we're

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
the Turing to be used right now we're

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.540 
the Turing to be used right now we're
ready<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:48.060> set<00:04:48.720> up<00:04:48.810> our<00:04:48.960> animation<00:04:49.590> so<00:04:50.220> what

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
ready to set up our animation so what

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.180 
ready to set up our animation so what
I'm<00:04:50.670> going<00:04:50.850> to<00:04:50.910> do<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.330> it<00:04:51.390> quickly<00:04:51.570> here<00:04:52.190> i'm

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
I'm going to do and it quickly here i'm

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.970 
I'm going to do and it quickly here i'm
going<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.460> show<00:04:53.670> you<00:04:53.700> with<00:04:54.980> only<00:04:55.980> one<00:04:56.490> vehicle

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
going to show you with only one vehicle

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.470 
going to show you with only one vehicle
so<00:04:59.150> basically<00:05:00.150> i'm<00:05:00.660> gonna<00:05:00.930> build<00:05:01.500> a<00:05:01.620> week

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
so basically i'm gonna build a week

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.510 
so basically i'm gonna build a week
regularly<00:05:03.480> for<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:03.960> four-wheel<00:05:04.740> vehicle<00:05:05.280> I'm

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
regularly for the four-wheel vehicle I'm

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.430 
regularly for the four-wheel vehicle I'm
not<00:05:05.760> gonna<00:05:06.000> have<00:05:06.180> body<00:05:06.510> dynamics<00:05:06.750> because

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
not gonna have body dynamics because

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.350 
not gonna have body dynamics because
this<00:05:07.650> is<00:05:07.770> a<00:05:07.860> kind<00:05:08.160> of<00:05:08.280> like<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.430> far<00:05:08.880> way<00:05:09.060> shot

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
this is a kind of like a far way shot

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.410 
this is a kind of like a far way shot
and<00:05:10.550> build<00:05:11.550> a<00:05:11.640> wink<00:05:12.890> and<00:05:13.890> now<00:05:14.130> i'm<00:05:14.910> going<00:05:15.150> to<00:05:15.210> go

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
and build a wink and now i'm going to go

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:21.830 
and build a wink and now i'm going to go
to<00:05:19.430> I'm<00:05:20.430> gonna<00:05:20.640> go<00:05:20.790> to<00:05:20.850> the<00:05:21.090> environment<00:05:21.390> setup

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
to I'm gonna go to the environment setup

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:30.580 
to I'm gonna go to the environment setup
and<00:05:23.390> choose<00:05:24.500> select<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.770> drink<00:05:26.040> path<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:27.420> then

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.500 

in<00:05:31.590> selective<00:05:32.160> like<00:05:32.370> Tareen<00:05:35.000> and<00:05:36.000> right<00:05:36.360> now

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
in selective like Tareen and right now

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.840 
in selective like Tareen and right now
we<00:05:36.570> have<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:37.080> vehicle<00:05:37.560> going<00:05:38.160> on<00:05:38.370> the<00:05:38.730> terrain

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
we have the vehicle going on the terrain

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.540 
we have the vehicle going on the terrain
too<00:05:41.850> much<00:05:42.030> so<00:05:42.840> first<00:05:43.200> go<00:05:43.860> from<00:05:44.070> the<00:05:44.160> beginning

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
too much so first go from the beginning

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.600 
too much so first go from the beginning
and<00:05:45.470> he<00:05:46.470> play<00:05:47.330> you'll<00:05:48.330> see<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:48.690> vehicle<00:05:49.140> goes

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
and he play you'll see the vehicle goes

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.070 
and he play you'll see the vehicle goes
around<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:50.730> track<00:05:51.060> really<00:05:51.540> really<00:05:51.810> quickly

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
around the track really really quickly

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.110 
around the track really really quickly
and<00:05:52.460> it<00:05:53.460> loops<00:05:53.870> properly<00:05:54.870> with<00:05:55.140> no<00:05:55.290> problems

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
and it loops properly with no problems

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:04.520 
and it loops properly with no problems
no<00:05:57.120> issues<00:05:57.480> there<00:06:00.980> so<00:06:01.980> basically<00:06:03.260> those<00:06:04.260> are

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
no issues there so basically those are
