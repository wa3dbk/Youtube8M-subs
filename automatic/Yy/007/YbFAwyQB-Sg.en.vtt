00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.499
 so what do we need to do this 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.620
 pink is to catch the rice we need rice 

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:11.750
 that is bright and that it is also a 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.940
 rice that is sticky the rice 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.450
 vote with rice to make sushi is the 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.450
 same rice 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.360
 some bags houses say rice for 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.610
 sow lighter more important 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.529
 then we put the rice that the rice 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.240
 I already have it previously in paid if 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.279
 you are and soaking the burritos is not like 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.710
 those that we commonly cook with a 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.130
 rinse with let stand for a while with 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.760
 they take it away from that we're going to add 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.760
 1 can of milk 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:48.680
 after 400 milliliters unforgiven 42 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.960
 milliliters were the milk slab 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:57.770
 web canteens we go to degrees phases 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:00.590
 during water and we mix it there 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.180
 we mix the average perfectly 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.670
 because slow starts to stick 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.010
 important the song the one that is of mouth 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.130
 big low walls and also very 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.430
 important that I have peace then I do not 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.430
 let's lose 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.270
 After the time it takes the 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.610
 rice to have this function always 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.310
 go approving a never from the table 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.869
 It's usual because maybe I do not know 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.790
 how this is handling the temperature 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.450
 so things he likes climb the 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.450
 plot like my mom 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.950
 then do not look well at the quantities or 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.810
 they go up a lot also loses the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.970
 broth you want to light up and then what 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.860
 that we need to add a little more 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.420
 water a little more coconut milk 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.700
 go approving the grain that is 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.770
 soft it's going to look sticky it's going to 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.730

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.730
 that's the rice 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.980
 it is good then the rice of the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.110
 media stopped because it is sticky 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.460
 so this is now we are going to add 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.460
 all good 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.610

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.170
 sugar were very pretty nothing more than 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.720

 porsche as sweet as me 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.930
 put less and if you like very sweet 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.930
 add a little more 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.900
 question of taste 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.220
 true 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.450
 It is strong because I am a great 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.349
 ganas and rap 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.349

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.879

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.200
 I'm going to use it with a little bit of 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.209
 sugar then I will add 2 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.220

 putting nothing else 2 tablespoons of cream 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.480
 peanut butter 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.030
 I start to disrupt all this if this one 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.030
 I find my balloon 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.450

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.810
 two tea leaves 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.579
 it removes all excess moisture 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.450
 they are really hydrated in water 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.450
 hot or warm 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:14.349
