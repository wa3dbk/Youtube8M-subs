00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.660
 hello everyone welcome to the stand today 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.900
 I would like to teach this online 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.750
 something that I have done 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.900
 which is very simple very easy and very 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.670
 quick to do 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.670
 as you can see the closure is with a bow 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.130
 it simply opens 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.130
 he has his pocket 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.540
 and the structure is like that 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.540
 being so 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.129
 as you wish 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.140
 no way 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.310
 you want to see how I've made it look 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.110
 the tutorial 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.540
 Well, to begin with we are going to 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.610
 need two pieces of cardboard the 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.900
 first piece that I measure 48 centimeters 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.220
 by 17 centimeters and the second 28 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.470
 centimeters by 17 centimeters 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.980
 Now let's take the cardboard 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.170
 it measures 48 centimeters by 17 centimeters and 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.800
 we are going to fold every 12 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.800
 centimeters 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.340
 Y 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.780
 to 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.780
 ah 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.590
 now we doubled by the brands that 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.230
 we have one for one side and one for the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.020
 another giving it accordion shape 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.210
 we take the card of 28 x 17 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.640
 centimeters and we're going to do two 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.830
 fold the first one to 12 centimeters 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.470
 and the second one at 24 centimeters 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.020
 and we doubled by the brands one for a 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.119
 side and one for the other 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.429
 to decorate the agreed although we have already 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.030
 done we need 11 decorated papers 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:12.400
 11 centimeters and a half by 16 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.830
 centimeters and a half and we try them with 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.960
 distress ink 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.570
 once we have all the edges 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.270
 in tints of all the papers we are going to 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.710
 put double- sided tape and we're going to 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.710
 stick to the structure 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.510
 we will put the decorated papers in all 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.970
 the pages of the structure except in 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.010
 the last one because this is going to be stuck to 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.470
 the structure of the anima lids 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.820
 let's say and you will not see 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.830
 place all the decorated papers 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.830
 should be the ones like that 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.020
 with these four centimeters we are going to 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.600
 do is going to be a pocket for it what 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.190
 we will place like this on the first page of 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.730
 so when we open it here we have the 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.860
 pocket we will put tail up and down and 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.450
 when we paste it, the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.480
 pocket made and so what are we going to 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.490
 doing is going to be joining the two parts to 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.390
 give a different touch to the pocket I'm going 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.300
 to use an edge cutter 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.680
 then to stick the pocket I 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.730
 I use white glue would call the 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.620
 two extremes 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.620
 and then we would add to the paper 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.430
 once the tail is dry 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.819
 We cut a strip of paper of 16 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.849
 centimeters and a half by 2 centimeters the 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:52.980
 we tried previously we put tape 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.980
 double-sided and we put it in its place 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.820
 now we have the accordion finished 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.150
 with our pocket and it would be of this 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.150
 shape 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.650
 now we need a cardboard of 17 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.079
 centimeters and a half by 29 centimeters and 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.390
 we are going to make several folds the 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.170
 first 10 centimeters and a half 11 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:25.400
 centimeters and a half 24 centimeters and a 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.400
 25 centimeters 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.160
 i 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.380
 ah 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.680
 now I'm going to round the corners of the 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.680
 album 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.380
 to line the album inside we're going to 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.160
 need two pieces of decorated paper 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.710
 one that measure 10 centimeters by 17 and 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.170
 another 3 centimeters and a half by 17 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.910
 centimeters and like the caps of the 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.910
 album I'm going to round the corners 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.350
 let's hit the accordion for that in the 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.690
 area where we did not have decorated paper 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.680
 because we put the double - sided tape 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.680
 we pay on your site 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.390
 Y 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.310
 to line the album on the outside 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:32.490
 we will need two 8-millimeter pieces 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.370
 by 17 centimeters a piece of 3 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.279
 centimeters and a half by 17 other than 10 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:42.779
 by 17 and one last of 12 centimeters 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:45.360
 by 17 centimeters to the two parties 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:48.270
 ahead I'm going to round the corners 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.219
 just like the album and at the time of 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.650
 paste, let's hit first 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:55.460
 the papers of 3 centimeters and a half and 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.460
 those of 8 millimeters 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.150
 once I have already pasted the first 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.780
 part and the two sides I'll do the 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.490
 closing the album with a loop for it 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.199
 I'm going to stick it on the front 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.659
 chub and in the back another chunk 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:12.699
 so we will calculate the center we will stick 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:15.150
 the tie and on top we will put the paper 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.150
 decorated 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.020
 Y 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.530
 do not 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.740
 ah 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:53.619
 Y 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.800
 Y 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:13.420
 well we have the album finished just 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.950
 we would need to decorate it so nothing 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.300
 I hope you liked the tutorial and 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.300
 See you in the next video
