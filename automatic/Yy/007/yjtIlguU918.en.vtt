for<00:00:18.300> Linux<00:00:18.630> are<00:00:18.810> built<00:00:19.140> using<00:00:19.380> node.js<00:00:20.060> so

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
for Linux are built using node.js so

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.370 
for Linux are built using node.js so
let's<00:00:21.240> start<00:00:21.570> with<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> installation<00:00:22.109> of

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
let's start with the installation of

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.620 
let's start with the installation of
node.js<00:00:22.789> so<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.850> very<00:00:24.000> first<00:00:24.240> command<00:00:24.570> that

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
node.js so the very first command that

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.689 
node.js so the very first command that
we<00:00:24.810> are<00:00:24.869> going<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.109> run<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.650> get<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.400> latest

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
we are going to run is to get the latest

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.830 
we are going to run is to get the latest
version<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.210> node.js<00:00:28.160> so<00:00:29.160> let's<00:00:30.150> type<00:00:30.630> this

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
version of node.js so let's type this

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.270 
version of node.js so let's type this
command<00:00:31.080> which<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.529> add<00:00:35.390> apt<00:00:37.280> repository

point 5 MB of packages and it's going to
quickly<00:01:40.390> set<00:01:40.720> it<00:01:40.840> up<00:01:40.990> on<00:01:41.470> our<00:01:41.679> machine

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.070 

alright<00:01:45.220> once<00:01:46.220> this<00:01:46.400> is<00:01:46.580> done<00:01:46.790> let's<00:01:47.630> check

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
the version of node by typing nord

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.820 
the version of node by typing nord
followed<00:01:53.450> by<00:01:53.630> version<00:01:55.900> so<00:01:56.900> that's<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.440> latest

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
followed by version so that's the latest

the azure NPM is installed the next step

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.670 
the azure NPM is installed the next step
is<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:39.250> download<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.599> publish<00:02:41.599> settings<00:02:41.870> file

so once this is done let's close this

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:30.149 
so once this is done let's close this
and<00:03:26.000> we'll<00:03:26.079> be<00:03:27.079> back<00:03:27.319> let<00:03:27.889> me<00:03:27.920> make<00:03:28.250> sure<00:03:28.280> that

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
and we'll be back let me make sure that

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:36.759 
and we'll be back let me make sure that
the<00:03:31.510> Downloads<00:03:32.620> directory<00:03:34.780> has<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.139> publish

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
the Downloads directory has the publish

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.339 
the Downloads directory has the publish
settings<00:03:36.950> file<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:38.720> there<00:03:38.930> we<00:03:39.139> go

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
settings file so there we go

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.300 
settings file so there we go
janakirama<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:40.639> shi'ites<00:03:41.120> followed<00:03:41.720> by<00:03:42.310> the

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
janakirama so shi'ites followed by the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.240 
janakirama so shi'ites followed by the
date<00:03:43.549> credentials<00:03:44.419> or<00:03:44.690> publish<00:03:45.019> settings<00:03:45.260> so

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
date credentials or publish settings so

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.619 
date credentials or publish settings so
once<00:03:46.430> we<00:03:46.609> have<00:03:46.819> this<00:03:47.530> we<00:03:48.530> need<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:49.329> point<00:03:50.329> the

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
once we have this we need to point the

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.360 
once we have this we need to point the
command<00:03:50.900> line<00:03:51.079> tools<00:03:51.379> to<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.099> publish

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
command line tools to the publish

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.180 
command line tools to the publish
settings<00:03:52.579> file<00:03:52.940> so<00:03:53.359> I'm<00:03:53.449> going<00:03:53.599> to<00:03:53.690> type<00:03:54.190> is

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
settings file so I'm going to type is

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:02.199 
settings file so I'm going to type is
your<00:03:55.750> account<00:03:57.400> import<00:03:58.989> followed<00:03:59.989> by<00:04:01.209> the

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
your account import followed by the

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.869 
your account import followed by the
downloads<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:03.139> the<00:04:04.069> publish<00:04:04.370> settings<00:04:04.519> file

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
downloads and the publish settings file

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.559 
downloads and the publish settings file
so<00:04:05.750> this<00:04:05.900> is<00:04:06.049> going<00:04:06.199> to<00:04:07.269> enumerate<00:04:08.269> all<00:04:08.540> the

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
so this is going to enumerate all the

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.589 
so this is going to enumerate all the
accounts<00:04:09.169> and<00:04:09.609> bring<00:04:10.609> them<00:04:10.819> onto<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.299> command

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
accounts and bring them onto the command

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.879 
accounts and bring them onto the command
line<00:04:11.750> tools<00:04:12.430> so<00:04:13.430> once<00:04:13.609> this<00:04:13.879> step<00:04:14.090> is<00:04:14.269> done<00:04:14.889> we

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
line tools so once this step is done we

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.740 
line tools so once this step is done we
can<00:04:15.919> check<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.970> installation<00:04:17.239> or<00:04:17.840> rather<00:04:18.079> the

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
can check the installation or rather the

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.189 
can check the installation or rather the
configuration<00:04:20.750> by<00:04:21.169> typing<00:04:21.650> as<00:04:22.190> your<00:04:23.199> config

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
configuration by typing as your config

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.790 
configuration by typing as your config
list<00:04:25.150> so<00:04:26.150> this<00:04:26.300> is<00:04:26.419> going<00:04:26.599> to<00:04:26.720> show<00:04:26.990> us<00:04:27.169> the

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
list so this is going to show us the

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.070 
list so this is going to show us the
available<00:04:28.370> endpoints<00:04:29.120> and<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.750> subscription

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
available endpoints and the subscription

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.520 
available endpoints and the subscription
settings<00:04:30.470> in<00:04:31.159> my<00:04:31.430> case<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:31.970> only<00:04:32.120> have<00:04:32.240> one<00:04:32.599> but

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
settings in my case I only have one but

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.640 
settings in my case I only have one but
in<00:04:33.889> in<00:04:34.610> in<00:04:34.909> some<00:04:34.990> instances<00:04:35.990> you<00:04:36.229> may<00:04:36.500> have

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
in in in some instances you may have

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.500 
in in in some instances you may have
more<00:04:36.919> than<00:04:36.979> one<00:04:37.190> account<00:04:37.789> associated<00:04:38.210> with

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
more than one account associated with

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.560 
more than one account associated with
your<00:04:38.840> subscription<00:04:39.199> in<00:04:39.680> that<00:04:40.490> case<00:04:40.789> the<00:04:41.330> very

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
your subscription in that case the very

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.680 
your subscription in that case the very
first<00:04:41.900> account<00:04:43.000> mentioned<00:04:44.000> in<00:04:44.120> this<00:04:44.240> is<00:04:44.479> going

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
first account mentioned in this is going

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.610 
first account mentioned in this is going
to<00:04:44.780> be<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:44.960> default

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
to be the default

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.750 
to be the default
so<00:04:46.680> in<00:04:46.830> this<00:04:46.979> step<00:04:47.250> we<00:04:48.590> pointed<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.889> is<00:04:50.220> your

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
so in this step we pointed the is your

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.870 
so in this step we pointed the is your
tools<00:04:51.060> installed<00:04:51.630> on<00:04:51.810> ubuntu<00:04:51.979> to<00:04:52.979> our<00:04:53.130> is<00:04:53.550> your

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
tools installed on ubuntu to our is your

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.189 
tools installed on ubuntu to our is your
subscription<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:55.620> now<00:04:55.770> that<00:04:55.830> this<00:04:56.220> is<00:04:56.280> done

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
subscription so now that this is done

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.110 
subscription so now that this is done
let's<00:04:58.199> go<00:04:58.380> ahead<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.860> execute<00:04:59.610> some<00:04:59.910> of<00:05:00.000> the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
let's go ahead and execute some of the

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.510 
let's go ahead and execute some of the
commands<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:01.830> very<00:05:01.979> first<00:05:02.220> thing<00:05:02.370> that<00:05:02.460> I

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
commands the very first thing that I

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.100 
commands the very first thing that I
want<00:05:02.669> to<00:05:02.760> check<00:05:03.030> is<00:05:03.330> by<00:05:04.260> typing<00:05:04.590> is<00:05:05.130> your

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
want to check is by typing is your

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.909 
want to check is by typing is your
account<00:05:07.550> followed<00:05:08.550> by<00:05:08.760> a<00:05:08.870> storage<00:05:09.870> list<00:05:10.470> so

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
account followed by a storage list so

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.330 
account followed by a storage list so
this<00:05:11.100> is<00:05:11.220> going<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.580> list<00:05:11.820> all<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:13.340> storage

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
this is going to list all the storage

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.280 
this is going to list all the storage
accounts<00:05:14.880> that<00:05:15.030> are<00:05:15.150> associated<00:05:15.449> with<00:05:16.020> my

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
accounts that are associated with my

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.980 
accounts that are associated with my
account<00:05:16.650> okay<00:05:17.180> let<00:05:18.180> me<00:05:18.300> try<00:05:18.419> out<00:05:18.630> a<00:05:18.660> couple<00:05:18.930> of

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
account okay let me try out a couple of

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.560 
account okay let me try out a couple of
more<00:05:19.199> commands<00:05:19.650> so<00:05:20.639> this<00:05:20.850> time<00:05:21.090> I'm<00:05:21.300> going<00:05:21.479> to

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
more commands so this time I'm going to

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.770 
more commands so this time I'm going to
try<00:05:21.900> a<00:05:22.520> short<00:05:23.520> VM<00:05:24.949> followed<00:05:25.949> by<00:05:26.160> location<00:05:27.120> list

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
try a short VM followed by location list

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.810 
try a short VM followed by location list
so<00:05:28.620> this<00:05:28.740> is<00:05:28.830> going<00:05:28.979> to<00:05:29.100> fetch<00:05:29.400> all<00:05:29.669> the

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
so this is going to fetch all the

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.600 
so this is going to fetch all the
locations<00:05:30.120> where<00:05:30.600> the<00:05:30.660> Windows<00:05:31.110> Azure<00:05:31.610> VM

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
locations where the Windows Azure VM

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.860 
locations where the Windows Azure VM
feature<00:05:33.030> is<00:05:33.389> available<00:05:34.250> in<00:05:35.250> preview<00:05:35.729> so<00:05:36.660> once

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
feature is available in preview so once

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.080 
feature is available in preview so once
this<00:05:37.020> becomes<00:05:37.320> generally<00:05:37.830> available<00:05:38.280> all<00:05:38.820> the

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
this becomes generally available all the

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.670 
this becomes generally available all the
locations<00:05:39.360> will<00:05:39.720> start<00:05:39.960> supporting<00:05:40.410> it<00:05:40.530> but

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
locations will start supporting it but

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.469 
locations will start supporting it but
for<00:05:40.889> now<00:05:40.919> it's<00:05:41.400> selectively<00:05:41.850> available<00:05:42.389> in

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
for now it's selectively available in

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:43.879 
for now it's selectively available in
certain<00:05:42.630> locations<00:05:43.139> so<00:05:43.289> this<00:05:43.470> command<00:05:43.770> is

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
certain locations so this command is

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.189 
certain locations so this command is
going<00:05:44.039> to<00:05:44.130> show<00:05:44.310> us<00:05:44.460> all<00:05:44.669> the<00:05:45.000> locations<00:05:45.660> of

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
going to show us all the locations of

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.129 
going to show us all the locations of
Windows<00:05:46.770> Azure<00:05:47.000> data<00:05:48.000> centers<00:05:48.449> or<00:05:48.660> regions

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
Windows Azure data centers or regions

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.240 
Windows Azure data centers or regions
supporting<00:05:50.100> the<00:05:50.220> VM<00:05:50.870> capability<00:05:52.250> similarly

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
supporting the VM capability similarly

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.719 
supporting the VM capability similarly
we<00:05:53.400> can<00:05:53.580> type<00:05:53.940> as<00:05:54.810> your<00:05:55.289> site<00:05:56.270> followed<00:05:57.270> by

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
we can type as your site followed by

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.480 
we can type as your site followed by
