 certainly he has lived a lot in the forum 

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:13.329
 does not emit 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:17.449
 and say do it because from where 1 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.039
 moderator 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.619
 holy faith as I do it will not be the best of marbles 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.919
 now I have tried to learn one I can complain about 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.140
 I would try fashion is going to have 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.699
 in the professional 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.940
 and we go but I can 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.390
 but the mother or tutor who precedes that someone criticizes me about it and from 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.550
 last night it fused well what was the most way I do not want to be able to already say so 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.990
 I'm not going to do it 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.480
 you will see the best way because what it does is simply chicken can but the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.350
 truth that is looking for victory of the moderate I am in Spain 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.140
 and I found so 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.520
 how the stand can better than nothing 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.770
 in order a command of driving scoring 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.060
 the first thing we are going to accommodate a person the madman is worth a character a 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.180
 Priority character to his wife images d reference 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.210
 yorke taken at the moment taken advantage of by guanajuato 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.550
 and is that the abuse 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.590
 he does not have a good time 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.190
 rejected also carries despite that against the Internet is worth 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.310
 we need 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.380
 heberprot-p port in front so words a little raised or in 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.340
 right angle of everything as it is 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.070
 i a profile of a choreographer that fit inside the silhouette of the profile 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.439
 this account delay relies on a postmark 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.090
 yes my team hirezi 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.290
 and was caught in the middle of the character and doubles the left will set still 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.610
 of simitÃ­ colar fuga of the costume the puntita of all all sides of the baker 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.060
 Equalize unpublished ports that is not necessary but by providing more than one 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.060
 a little more 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.560
 easy and that's worth 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.319
 and the profile with the species 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.369
 important every penalty is that more or less balanced between my goal of Lima the 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.870
 ethic tourist height of the umbilicus entity 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.000
 the pump matches that phrase the turkey is to check with some image editor 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.329
 first grid or something would be kosovo and chad 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.430
 mature by expect populated and I remain tantrum mathura same height takes no 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.479
 It supports haystacks that see that mahoma 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.479
 the eta image are compensated world 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.139
 ok let's start 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.139
 the first thing we have to do 3 percent 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:27.700
 the gib 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.929
 but brawn vaquerano image to put 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.549
 the background image 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.549
 what do we want? 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.529
 in this reference image 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.869
 we can make it clearer as your cures 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:46.129
 choo 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.059
 agree more 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.949
 we open another view 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:55.179
 i also dive gives supposed to pay more of his rival 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:59.229
 Regarding the massacre of view count the number of the newspaper per second 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.639
 in this view of pit number 3 valenti well 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:06.469
 we are going to leave it 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.469
 we take our curro and we put it 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.819
 in centers and more or less 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.209
 as soon as otan section of this year 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.299
 s 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.319
 We stayed and slightly more 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.319
 so that he will defend this way tried to ensure that this 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.869
 the center more or less the object mode 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:32.650
 for this edition but we do not see that we can run 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.869
 we make a small 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:38.979
 a subdivision this cube 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.859
 your GDP is going to incite Bosnian 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.919
 in Cuba if that way 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.779
 and it was 11 percent 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:48.779
 to apply 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:52.979
 let's apply a modifier 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.009
 but before 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:56.419
 let's put it 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.629
 yes yes 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.239
 what the center of the desert cube and with Titus cossa what this line ado 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.919
 exactly with the vertex 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.009
 p vale 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:14.399
 g to move go this fact 

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:16.449
 nothing we have done with pieces eta 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.219
 that's why p 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:20.759
 and then continue 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.439
 but beautiful stick jelloun of leisure peking 

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:26.729
 to align the dot this is patent 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:32.370
 gx 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.789
 and there is that there is fear 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.419
 everything well that you can live 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:37.420
 it's worth once 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.819
 done this 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:40.499
 let's go here 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.499
 let's win this a little bit 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.889
 alan modifiers 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.990
 and we are going to add a modifier 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.789
 quito 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:53.969
 my mistake 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.969
 mirror 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.389
 the mets lost their lives 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.050
 before mirror
