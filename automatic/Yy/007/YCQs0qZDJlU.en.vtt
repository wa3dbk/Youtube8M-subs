00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 the reality of part nÃ© ai galera 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.830
 got a steering wheel like american 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.250
 that steering wheel that I was wanting 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.199
 and better yet won gift here is 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.550
 and come back here, who gave me the gift was 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.250
 my friend dilma 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.279
 I want to thank him. Thank you so much. 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.710
 a whole show and there I am now 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.960
 restoring the wheel here already did 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.359
 polish there as you have seen 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.700
 and then I'm just restoring the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.989
 hoot button ho it button 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.270
 I was well 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.260
 mendes way he was arrested for 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.840
 heat cause 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.960
 This plastic is soft enough then 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.950
 I with a thermal blower I went back to 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.079
 get round of a finish here 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.550
 in him 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:56.010
 this part of the horn trail was 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.739
 and I did a weld well. 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.230
 not to interfere in the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.520
 why drive because the drive 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.549
 works like this 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.340
 is a copper plate below have these 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.979
 two dowel rings and this plate 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.860
 covers up and then when you press 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.040
 the rubber presses this copper plate 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.890
 and the contacts and ring and the horn works 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.830
 so let's put the hood here and 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.130
 test to see if the horn is working 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.220
 working before placing the cover 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.140
 We have to learn here with 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.440
 crepe tape on the contact so it does not 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.850
 exit along with the rubber and spoil 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.320
 in case you need to disassemble one day 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.080
 new button 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.050
 Then you 'll have to take off that eraser. 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.229
 so usually the one that gets covered goes 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.729
 along with a ride and then end up making 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:02:01.540
 plate damage in student contact 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:05.110
 the tip of today parties to speak also 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.150
 Yes, I'll make a restoration video. 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.100
 the daspet maverick 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.150
 there are enough people who suffer for 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.340
 restoring this piece is a good job. 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.260
 slow and boring to do but I'm going 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.870
 teach you and it will be the first 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.010
 aulinha bild part of restoration and 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.080
 Teasing if it works, I'll do more 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.890
 videos in this format let's see what comes out 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.700
 There you go. 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.030
 I speak we do not learn here in contact 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.200
 for him not to leave and then we put the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.200
 rubber cover 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.120
 the rubber cover to fit 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:52.030
 perfect she has to fit this 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.980
 way here this part here she has a 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:59.110
 inner ledge that fits the edge 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:04.269
 of the plastic part and then the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.519
 it is the internal rubber wipe 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.630
 be able to finish the glass of the 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.200
 steering wheel 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.200
 like this 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.710
 We put the finishing touches on the 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.200
 now the pines have always lost a 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:25.120
 restored in it was also a bit 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:32.650
 battered refills this painting and a 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:41.020
 polishing inside our black 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:42.820
 lady and there approved the button still 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.910
 No, you do not have to think, let's see if it's 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.910
 it works 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:57.870
 the good thing is that it works 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:04:00.460
 if you get the contacts here negative and 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.820
 positive 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:17.500
 Let's squeeze the pope is working 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:22.240
 then yes 3rd party level at the time we go 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:26.020
 see how the steering wheel is now me 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.540
 fit will only fit us button 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.300
 see is good 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.190
 another legal tip explains that it is the 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.620
 when it is put in the car 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.170
 it has to be put in this way that 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.410
 is that he has the screws in this 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.610
 position because here inside the steering wheel 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.670
 It has this lock 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.670
 This lock here must know how to follow. 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.800
 with this part of the right button that is 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.760
 dug 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.760
 then we fit in here 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.259
 we have a steering wheel of a ford maverick 0 to 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:14.400
 NATO was pretty much even reset the 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.699
 air as I said I have a polish 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.879
 I took the risks all of them were well 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:24.870
 cool is that steering wheel here or unable to 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:26.969
 agree is the strong madrid original gt 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.699
 I came to know the steering wheel here hooded. 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:33.150
 leather with the colonel with his own 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:35.819
 right wine that makes the car's finish and 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.180
 here or incapable with leather that is a 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:41.370
 finish more top and then when I go 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.090
 put in the car do a test video 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.699
 What's up there again, thank you. 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:52.639

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:55.639
 gave in the age of today shares the
