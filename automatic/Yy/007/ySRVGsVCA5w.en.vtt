don't<00:02:54.269> like<00:02:54.419> spawn<00:02:54.810> them<00:02:54.989> with<00:02:55.109> dispensers

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
don't like spawn them with dispensers

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.559 
don't like spawn them with dispensers
the<00:02:56.310> only<00:02:56.579> way<00:02:56.699> to<00:02:56.760> really<00:02:56.939> spread<00:02:57.269> them<00:02:57.480> out

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
the only way to really spread them out

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.270 
the only way to really spread them out
correctly<00:02:58.139> is<00:02:58.379> to<00:02:58.500> actually<00:02:58.620> place<00:02:58.980> them<00:02:59.159> down

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
correctly is to actually place them down

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.830 
correctly is to actually place them down
individually<00:02:59.519> so<00:03:00.269> they<00:03:00.359> all<00:03:00.510> attack

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
individually so they all attack

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.649 
individually so they all attack
different<00:03:01.079> mobs<00:03:01.439> at<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.709> same<00:03:01.980> time<00:03:02.659> we'll

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
ratio a bit because they were working as

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.350 
ratio a bit because they were working as

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
trying to work as a team right in the

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.570 
trying to work as a team right in the
middle<00:05:38.139> here<00:05:38.500> like<00:05:38.860> four<00:05:39.190> of<00:05:39.310> them<00:05:39.400> going

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
after one at the same time I have a

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.439 
after one at the same time I have a
feeling<00:05:42.460> this<00:05:42.759> was<00:05:42.909> going<00:05:43.000> to<00:05:43.090> be<00:05:43.180> really

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
feeling this was going to be really

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:44.820 
feeling this was going to be really
close<00:05:43.690> because<00:05:43.870> some<00:05:44.169> of<00:05:44.199> the<00:05:44.320> iron<00:05:44.469> golems

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
close because some of the iron golems

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.010 
close because some of the iron golems
are<00:05:44.919> going<00:05:45.280> down<00:05:45.580> there's<00:05:46.180> still<00:05:46.389> quite<00:05:46.810> a<00:05:46.840> few

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
glowstone monsters left alive here but

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.010 
glowstone monsters left alive here but
look<00:05:50.949> right<00:05:50.979> over<00:05:51.190> here<00:05:51.729> there<00:05:52.599> was<00:05:52.750> how<00:05:52.960> many

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.339 
look right over here there was how many
is<00:05:53.229> that<00:05:53.380> like<00:05:53.560> seven<00:05:54.120> after<00:05:55.120> one<00:05:55.419> oh<00:05:55.750> man

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
is that like seven after one oh man

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:58.290 
is that like seven after one oh man
they're<00:05:56.500> getting<00:05:56.740> together<00:05:56.830> right<00:05:57.219> now<00:05:57.300> they

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
they're getting together right now they

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.080 
they're getting together right now they
are<00:05:58.330> about<00:05:58.509> to<00:05:58.750> destroy<00:05:59.199> them

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
are about to destroy them

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.700 
are about to destroy them
this<00:06:01.090> is<00:06:01.180> going<00:06:01.270> to<00:06:01.360> be<00:06:01.449> so<00:06:01.719> close<00:06:01.960> yeah<00:06:02.680> I

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.230 
this is going to be so close yeah I
think<00:06:02.860> this<00:06:03.099> might<00:06:03.280> be<00:06:03.340> the<00:06:03.610> biggest<00:06:03.909> battle

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
think this might be the biggest battle

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.790 
think this might be the biggest battle
you've<00:06:04.479> ever<00:06:04.659> had<00:06:04.990> in<00:06:05.139> the<00:06:05.229> arena<00:06:05.469> I<00:06:05.560> want<00:06:05.740> to

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
do something special since we actually

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.600 
do something special since we actually
could<00:06:07.960> do<00:06:08.110> this<00:06:08.229> with<00:06:08.409> these<00:06:08.560> mobs<00:06:08.889> because

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
could do this with these mobs because

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.820 
could do this with these mobs because
some<00:06:09.909> mobs<00:06:10.180> I<00:06:10.300> have<00:06:10.389> to<00:06:10.479> do<00:06:10.570> one<00:06:10.780> on<00:06:10.810> once<00:06:11.259> only

some mobs I have to do one on once only

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.920 
some mobs I have to do one on once only
this<00:06:12.490> is<00:06:12.610> a<00:06:12.639> perfect<00:06:13.120> to<00:06:13.210> want<00:06:13.360> to<00:06:13.479> do<00:06:13.570> a<00:06:13.599> giant

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
this is a perfect to want to do a giant

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.219 
this is a perfect to want to do a giant
battle<00:06:14.880> this<00:06:15.880> poor<00:06:16.150> glowstone<00:06:16.570> monster<00:06:16.990> can't

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
battle this poor glowstone monster can't

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:18.450 
battle this poor glowstone monster can't
reach<00:06:17.349> the<00:06:17.530> ground<00:06:17.740> they<00:06:17.919> keep<00:06:18.070> throwing<00:06:18.310> them

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
reach the ground they keep throwing them

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.600 
reach the ground they keep throwing them
so<00:06:18.669> high<00:06:19.590> it's<00:06:20.590> going<00:06:20.710> to<00:06:20.800> be<00:06:20.889> close<00:06:21.190> there<00:06:21.219> are

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
so high it's going to be close there are

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.570 
so high it's going to be close there are
maybe<00:06:21.930> ten<00:06:22.930> left<00:06:23.530> actually<00:06:24.070> I<00:06:24.280> think<00:06:24.370> there's

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
maybe ten left actually I think there's

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.950 
maybe ten left actually I think there's
more<00:06:24.669> iron<00:06:24.849> golems<00:06:25.270> into<00:06:25.449> our<00:06:25.570> glowstone
