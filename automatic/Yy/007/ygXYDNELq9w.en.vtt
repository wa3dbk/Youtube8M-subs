00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.840
 and Hello dear friends with you Ashka 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.549
 today we continue to look at fashion 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.109
 for the game minecraft service interesting mod 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.520
 with which you can add to 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.500
 game new lamp 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.789
 but this lamp will not 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.880
 imply a blog 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.550
 such as a lantern lamp jack or 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.849
 Zhaglov Tamansky block not all much 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.619
 easier it will have a connecting thread 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.510
 goldstone and let's right now 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.430
 see how to do it all like it 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.140
 all get and how it all melts well in 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.570
 Generally we go in from recruit 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.730
 a little tired of doing it all i think 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.170
 and we here arises here were 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.149
 principle it was in the original 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.280
 minecraft but now she has added a new one 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.340
 function we can click on the floor right 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.590
 click this claus then with us and with us 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.960
 a chain of blu-100 will appear but as you can see 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.750
 It may even be connected as roadstone 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.969
 but I'll tell you now what the glow 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.250
 the table and glad the table in no way can 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.140
 connect that is, they see no 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.680
 way do not connect that is if 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.680
 deep water it glows then the brine does not glow 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.180
 in general, in this way even 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.150
 more clearly it will be that they see 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.470
 strong and united. on point and you 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.990
 probably many have already noticed that 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.110
 redstone glows a glow stone glows 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.080
 initially 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.420
 and basically amore i don't have anything else 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.540
 I can tell the mod is very suitable for 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.509
 those people who want to warm their 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.310
 the milky way in the light and so on you 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.270
 Probably many know what the glow stone 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.360
 make it very difficult to make a lantern very 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.509
 difficult torch and of course an option but torches 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.700
 in castles in my opinion it is somehow ugly 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.180
 Is that a chain that is 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.799
 will be in the form of a carpet or under glass 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.200
 I think the carpet will be pretty 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.600
 original and also want to add something 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.390
 this glow table thread in no way 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.399
 can activate leverage and also it doesn't 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.700
 can activate doors and so on in 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.370
 general then it is not used as 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.979
 electricity and 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.720
 I think I told this mod all if 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.880
 here will come then you can subscribe to 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.160
 channel put like call friends and with 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.160
