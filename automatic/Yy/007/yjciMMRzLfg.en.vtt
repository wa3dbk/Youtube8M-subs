with<00:00:09.090> Damian<00:00:09.420> Wayne<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:10.250> so<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.450> R

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
with Damian Wayne and so this is the R

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.470 
with Damian Wayne and so this is the R
for<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.230> shirt<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.969> think<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.269> turned<00:00:15.420> out

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
for the shirt I think it turned out

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.679 
for the shirt I think it turned out
pretty<00:00:15.540> well<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:17.539> so<00:00:18.859> it's<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:19.980> one<00:00:20.689> layer

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
pretty well and so it's just one layer

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.630 
pretty well and so it's just one layer
yellow<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.260> one<00:00:22.380> layer<00:00:22.560> black<00:00:23.039> how<00:00:23.400> that

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
yellow and one layer black how that

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.210 
yellow and one layer black how that
might<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.000> thought<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.359> was<00:00:24.510> enough<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.220> and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
might I thought that was enough so and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.130 
might I thought that was enough so and
then<00:00:26.340> here<00:00:26.640> are<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.820> gauntlets<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.750> her<00:00:27.840> see

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
then here are the gauntlets for her see

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.500 
then here are the gauntlets for her see
I<00:00:28.170> even<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.529> spikes<00:00:32.000> you<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.239> spikes

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
I even have spikes you have the spikes

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.690 
I even have spikes you have the spikes
on<00:00:33.750> here<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.850> they're<00:00:35.850> double<00:00:36.180> layered<00:00:37.700> so

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
on here and they're double layered so

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.540 
on here and they're double layered so
they're<00:00:38.879> sturdier<00:00:39.350> here's<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> other<00:00:40.530> one

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.959 

and<00:00:44.550> then<00:00:44.789> here's<00:00:45.090> her<00:00:45.210> mask<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:46.850> couldn't<00:00:47.850> make

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
and then here's her mask I couldn't make

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.350 
and then here's her mask I couldn't make
it<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.510> masquerade<00:00:48.960> mask<00:00:49.340> because

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
it out of the masquerade mask because

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.180 
it out of the masquerade mask because
the<00:00:51.360> mask<00:00:51.570> was<00:00:51.750> too<00:00:51.930> small<00:00:52.140> because<00:00:52.890> she<00:00:53.070> got

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the mask was too small because she got

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.799 
the mask was too small because she got
one<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.370> them<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.640> half<00:00:54.120> cut<00:00:54.390> ones<00:00:54.600> or

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
one of them like half cut ones or

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.430 
one of them like half cut ones or
something<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.680> quarter<00:00:56.010> cut<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.570> think<00:00:58.350> it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
something or quarter cut so I think it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.840 
something or quarter cut so I think it
turned<00:00:58.620> out<00:00:58.710> pretty<00:00:58.770> good<00:00:59.219> he<00:00:59.579> made<00:00:59.730> it

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
turned out pretty good he made it

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.240 
turned out pretty good he made it
symmetrical<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.949> same<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.219> both

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
symmetrical so it's the same on both

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.070 
symmetrical so it's the same on both
sides

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
sides

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.039 
sides
so<00:01:04.339> then<00:01:05.339> onto<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> best<00:01:05.880> thing<00:01:06.119> ever<00:01:06.270> it's

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
so then onto the best thing ever it's

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.080 
so then onto the best thing ever it's
the<00:01:07.229> belt<00:01:07.790> yeah

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the belt yeah

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.260
