00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
alright so right on top looks like we've

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.849 
alright so right on top looks like we've
got<00:00:29.490> some<00:00:29.960> instructions<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.199> let's<00:00:31.410> go<00:00:31.560> over

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
got some instructions and let's go over

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.340 
got some instructions and let's go over
those<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.940> second<00:00:33.329> because<00:00:33.750> first<00:00:34.170> I

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
those in just a second because first I

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.990 
those in just a second because first I
wanted<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.649> show<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.860> guys<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.579> end<00:00:35.730> links

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
wanted to show you guys the end links

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.260 
wanted to show you guys the end links
here<00:00:36.770> alright<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.129> pull<00:00:38.370> these<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.730> you

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
here alright so if I pull these out you

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.850 
here alright so if I pull these out you
can<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.890> cob<00:00:40.890> logo<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.520> them<00:00:42.469> right<00:00:43.469> there

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
can see the cob logo on them right there

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.459 
can see the cob logo on them right there
okay<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.870> then<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.989> course<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
okay and then of course we have the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.380 
okay and then of course we have the
adjustability<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.910> order<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.210> adjust

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
adjustability and in order to adjust

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.260 
adjustability and in order to adjust
these<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.620> loosen<00:00:50.520> these<00:00:50.640> up<00:00:50.700> right<00:00:51.090> here

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
these we just loosen these up right here

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.660 
these we just loosen these up right here
and<00:00:51.559> then<00:00:52.559> we<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.739> either<00:00:53.219> turn<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
and then we can either turn the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.880 
and then we can either turn the
centerpiece<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.239> bring<00:00:54.539> those<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.870> or<00:00:55.140> out<00:00:55.500> or

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
centerpiece to bring those in or out or

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.880 
centerpiece to bring those in or out or
of<00:00:56.760> course<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.449> do<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.530> just

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
of course we can do it like that just

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.110 
of course we can do it like that just
depend<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.309> whether<00:00:59.489> they're<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.850> or<00:01:00.000> off<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
depend on whether they're on or off the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.340 
depend on whether they're on or off the
car<00:01:00.559> initial<00:01:01.559> setup<00:01:01.770> stuff<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.550> so

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
car initial setup stuff like that so

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.509 
car initial setup stuff like that so
some<00:01:04.350> other<00:01:04.500> things<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.799> wanted<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> point<00:01:05.220> out

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
some other things I wanted to point out

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.460 
some other things I wanted to point out
to<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:05.970> kit<00:01:06.210> were<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> bearings

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
to you in this kit were the bearings

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.740 
to you in this kit were the bearings
themselves<00:01:08.040> now<00:01:08.790> these<00:01:09.180> are<00:01:09.360> spherical

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
themselves now these are spherical

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.149 
themselves now these are spherical
bearings<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.409> what<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.650> means<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.979> there's

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
bearings and what that means is there's

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.270 
bearings and what that means is there's
no<00:01:11.549> rubber<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.659> at<00:01:13.020> all<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.220> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
no rubber in here at all and so it is a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.310 
no rubber in here at all and so it is a
little<00:01:14.490> bit<00:01:14.640> noisy<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.840> nice<00:01:15.990> thing<00:01:16.020> is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
little bit noisy but the nice thing is

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.170 
little bit noisy but the nice thing is
there's<00:01:16.710> zero<00:01:17.189> compliance<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:17.939> means

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
there's zero compliance which means

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.230 
there's zero compliance which means
there's<00:01:18.750> no<00:01:18.840> movement<00:01:19.409> between<00:01:20.100> or<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.880> here

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
there's no movement between or in here

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.600 
there's no movement between or in here
at<00:01:21.540> all<00:01:21.960> whereas<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:23.220> rubber<00:01:23.490> or

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
at all whereas a with rubber or

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.740 
at all whereas a with rubber or
polyurethane<00:01:23.880> you're<00:01:24.299> always<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> get

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
polyurethane you're always going to get

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.350 
polyurethane you're always going to get
a<00:01:24.780> little<00:01:24.930> bit<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.229> movement<00:01:26.060> which<00:01:27.060> works

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
a little bit of movement which works

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.929 
a little bit of movement which works
however<00:01:27.650> for<00:01:28.650> racing<00:01:28.979> purposes<00:01:29.460> or<00:01:29.700> when<00:01:29.850> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
however for racing purposes or when you

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.730 
however for racing purposes or when you
need<00:01:30.090> precise<00:01:30.570> control<00:01:30.600> these<00:01:31.409> spherical

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
need precise control these spherical

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.310 
need precise control these spherical
bearings<00:01:32.220> are<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> lot<00:01:33.840> better<00:01:33.900> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
bearings are going to be a lot better a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.230 
bearings are going to be a lot better a
lot<00:01:34.409> more<00:01:34.650> high<00:01:34.829> performance<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:36.119> also

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
lot more high performance but also

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.460 
lot more high performance but also
generate<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:36.960> bit<00:01:37.049> more<00:01:37.170> noise

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
generate a little bit more noise

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.219 
generate a little bit more noise
harshest<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.189> vibration<00:01:38.930> over<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> rubber

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
harshest and vibration over the rubber

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.140 
harshest and vibration over the rubber
and<00:01:40.500> polyurethane<00:01:41.310> bushings<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:41.790> just<00:01:42.000> kind

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and polyurethane bushings so just kind

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.030 
and polyurethane bushings so just kind
of<00:01:42.210> keep<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.720> mind<00:01:43.009> when<00:01:44.009> you're

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
of keep that in mind when you're

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.800 
of keep that in mind when you're
ordering<00:01:44.369> these<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.729> looking<00:01:45.000> at<00:01:45.119> end<00:01:45.540> links
