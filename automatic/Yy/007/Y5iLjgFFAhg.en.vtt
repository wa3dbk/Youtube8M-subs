00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.640
This tutorial covers several methods on how
to take a screenshot in Windows 8.1.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.940
The first method we will cover is to use the
share feature on the new “Charms Bar”.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.549
Open the app you want to share.

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.810
For testing we will open the “Weather”
app.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.699
Open the “Charms Bar” by bringing the
mouse to either the top or bottom right corner

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:35.480
of the screen or by using the keyboard shortcut
of “Windows Key + C”.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.070
Select “Share” on the charms bar.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.070
The “Share” bar will open.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.520
Click on the drop down menu at the top, and
select “Screenshot”.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.700
We have the option to share using the Mail
or OneNote applications.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.590
If you have more supported apps installed
they will show in the list.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.700
There is no option here to save the screenshot.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:17.780
If we select Mail it will open the screenshot
in the Mail app.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:27.791
The best method is to use the keyboard shortcut
of “Windows Key + Print Screen”.

00:01:27.791 --> 00:01:33.250
If you have a touch screen device press and
hold the Windows button and the volume down

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.250
button.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:45.249
The button combination may be different depending
on the manufacturer.

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:52.719
When you take the screenshot the screen will
temporarily dim to show it was taken.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:58.399
Using this method takes the screenshot and
places it directly in the pictures folder.

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:59.819
Select the Photos app.

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:08.069
There is a folder created called “Screenshots”.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:26.080
All screenshots taken using this method are
saved directly to this folder.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.142
The last method we will review is using the
“Snipping Tool”.

00:02:28.142 --> 00:02:34.080
The Snipping Tool allows you to take screenshots
of the entire screen or just parts of the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.810
screen.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.890
It also allow for editing of the screenshot.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.860
We will navigate back to the “Start Screen”
and select the “All Apps” button to open

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.870
the “Apps View”.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:56.850
Scroll to the right, under “Windows Accessories”
select “Snipping Tool”.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.750
The “Snipping Tool” will open to the Windows
desktop.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:09.670
If we click the down arrow to the right of
the “New” button we can see the 4 available

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.670
options.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.250
“Full-screen Snip” will take a screenshot
of the entire screen.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.510
“Window Snip” allows you to take a screenshot
of a single open window

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:36.460
“Rectangular Snip” allows you to select
part of the screen by dragging a box around

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:49.890
the part you want to capture.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.130
“Free-form Snip” allows you to select
part of the screen by drawing a line around

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:11.870
the part you want to capture.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.980
After the image is captured it will open to
allow further editing.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:40.580
There are multiple colored pens that you can
use to mark up the image.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:53.689
There is a highlighter that can be used to
draw attention to areas of interest.

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:59.090
There is an eraser but it does not erase parts
of the image, but instead removes markups

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:12.400
individually from the pen or highlighter.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:20.479
After the screen capture is edited to your
satisfaction, click on the “Save” button.

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.440
Select a location and name for the file.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:38.310
