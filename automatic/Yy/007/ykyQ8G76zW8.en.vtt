00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 yes 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.380
 How about youtube friends like they are 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.190
 Well, in this video, we're going to talk 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.470
 of the new game of 'resident evil' 7 and 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.630
 Well, this information is already 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.090
 updated information and we have tried 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.820
 to collect the most information 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.400
 possible and good then let's start as 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.020
 we all know cap with already accepted to take out 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.600
 a new videogame of the saga of 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.150
 resident and bud which has not said anything 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.850
 about the game not even the name that 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.699
 will not take its release date but 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.870
 will come at the end of 2015 or early 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.880
 of 2016 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.180
 the video game will continue to be for 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.940
 multiple platforms was only one 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.030
 myth that would come exclusively for the 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.360
 xbox one or the playstation 4 but if 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.240
 you will have very good exclusive content 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.240
 for playstation 4 and also capcom 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.539
 already stated that it will announce the new receives 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.620
 level 7 in the next e3 to be celebrated 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:23.560
 12 to 14 June 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.830
 I also wanted to make it clear that only 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.800
 they are rumors that they reside and 27 will leave 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.110
 to be a game of his rival horror 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.440
 capcom has not said anything to the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.080
 Regarding the question now is that if 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.420
 decide at level 7 it will finally return to 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.150
 the franchise to its roots of 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.920
 survival minimizing the emphasis by 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.860
 action that characterized 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.130
 recent deliveries and well then in 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.730
 conclusion still nothing is known about 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.920
 characters game modes graphics and in 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.020

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.570
