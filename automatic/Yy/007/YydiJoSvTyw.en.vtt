00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
point I'm going to start out with

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.240 
point I'm going to start out with
explaining<00:00:37.610> what<00:00:38.420> aperture<00:00:38.930> is<00:00:39.290> since<00:00:39.680> it's<00:00:40.100> a

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
explaining what aperture is since it's a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.020 
explaining what aperture is since it's a
very<00:00:40.610> useful<00:00:40.879> tool<00:00:41.469> you<00:00:42.469> can<00:00:42.620> really<00:00:43.190> focus<00:00:43.730> on

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
very useful tool you can really focus on

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.029 
very useful tool you can really focus on
subjects<00:00:44.600> for<00:00:44.750> example<00:00:45.289> you<00:00:45.320> can<00:00:45.530> do<00:00:45.620> special

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
subjects for example you can do special

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.889 
subjects for example you can do special
effects<00:00:46.280> with<00:00:46.520> it<00:00:46.700> and<00:00:46.910> it<00:00:47.450> can<00:00:47.600> be<00:00:47.629> sometimes

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
effects with it and it can be sometimes

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.840 
effects with it and it can be sometimes
a<00:00:48.140> little<00:00:48.230> bit<00:00:48.379> baffling<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.399> I've<00:00:49.579> got<00:00:49.820> my

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
a little bit baffling so I've got my

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.229 
a little bit baffling so I've got my
trusty<00:00:50.510> camera<00:00:51.230> here<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:51.949> I'll<00:00:52.190> be<00:00:52.430> using<00:00:52.699> to

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
trusty camera here that I'll be using to

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.819 
trusty camera here that I'll be using to
take<00:00:53.390> some<00:00:53.539> still<00:00:53.809> shots<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.379> show<00:00:54.559> you<00:00:54.620> what

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
take some still shots and show you what

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.380 
take some still shots and show you what
it<00:00:54.920> looks<00:00:54.949> like<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:55.879> I<00:00:56.739> also<00:00:57.739> have<00:00:58.039> this<00:00:58.390> fun

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
it looks like and I also have this fun

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.720 
it looks like and I also have this fun
an<00:00:59.480> old<00:00:59.690> lens<00:00:59.989> probably<00:01:00.440> as<00:01:00.559> old<00:01:00.649> as<00:01:00.829> I<00:01:01.010> am<00:01:01.039> but

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
an old lens probably as old as I am but

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.389 
an old lens probably as old as I am but
it's<00:01:02.030> a<00:01:02.149> great<00:01:02.449> tool<00:01:02.719> to<00:01:02.780> use<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:03.890> show<00:01:04.339> you

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
it's a great tool to use to show you

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.190 
it's a great tool to use to show you
when<00:01:04.640> that<00:01:04.790> pitcher<00:01:05.119> actually<00:01:05.210> looks<00:01:05.720> like<00:01:05.990> so

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
when that pitcher actually looks like so

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.590 
when that pitcher actually looks like so
you<00:01:06.290> can<00:01:06.409> kind<00:01:06.560> of<00:01:06.619> get<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.770> idea<00:01:06.909> so<00:01:07.909> let's

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
you can kind of get the idea so let's

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.210 
you can kind of get the idea so let's
get<00:01:08.720> started<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.170> first<00:01:09.380> learn<00:01:09.619> about<00:01:09.650> what

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
get started and first learn about what

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.429 
get started and first learn about what
aperture<00:01:10.970> actually<00:01:11.600> is<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:12.080> what<00:01:12.170> it<00:01:12.260> looks

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
aperture actually is and what it looks

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.929 
aperture actually is and what it looks
like<00:01:12.650> when<00:01:12.860> you're<00:01:13.070> actually<00:01:13.310> dealing<00:01:13.700> with

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
like when you're actually dealing with

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.390 
like when you're actually dealing with
one<00:01:16.150> so<00:01:17.150> here<00:01:17.390> we<00:01:17.420> have<00:01:17.570> that<00:01:18.020> Carlton<00:01:18.590> size<00:01:18.830> 50

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
one so here we have that Carlton size 50

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.399 
one so here we have that Carlton size 50
millimeter<00:01:19.759> lens<00:01:20.000> that<00:01:20.210> I'm<00:01:20.330> using<00:01:20.540> this<00:01:21.200> one

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
millimeter lens that I'm using this one

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.950 
millimeter lens that I'm using this one
has<00:01:21.560> an<00:01:21.710> aperture<00:01:22.100> or<00:01:22.520> an<00:01:22.729> f-stop<00:01:23.030> of<00:01:24.189> 1.4<00:01:25.189> and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
has an aperture or an f-stop of 1.4 and

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.600 
has an aperture or an f-stop of 1.4 and
i'm<00:01:26.960> using<00:01:27.380> this<00:01:27.500> lens<00:01:27.740> because<00:01:28.159> it<00:01:28.430> has<00:01:28.580> a

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
i'm using this lens because it has a

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.640 
i'm using this lens because it has a
very<00:01:28.880> large<00:01:29.240> opening<00:01:29.689> so<00:01:29.810> it's<00:01:29.960> quite<00:01:30.200> easy<00:01:30.229> to

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
very large opening so it's quite easy to

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.480 
very large opening so it's quite easy to
see<00:01:31.100> how<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:32.240> iris<00:01:32.780> diaphragm<00:01:32.960> works<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.979> make

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
see how the iris diaphragm works to make

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.450 
see how the iris diaphragm works to make
the<00:01:34.670> aperture<00:01:35.450> larger<00:01:36.110> or<00:01:36.320> smaller<00:01:36.350> plus<00:01:37.310> i

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
the aperture larger or smaller plus i

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.100 
the aperture larger or smaller plus i
can<00:01:37.610> set<00:01:37.790> it<00:01:37.880> manually<00:01:38.299> i<00:01:38.479> don't<00:01:38.780> need<00:01:38.869> to<00:01:38.990> have

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
can set it manually i don't need to have

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.780 
can set it manually i don't need to have
it<00:01:39.200> on<00:01:39.290> a<00:01:39.320> camera<00:01:39.650> works<00:01:40.280> really<00:01:40.520> well<00:01:40.640> for

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
it on a camera works really well for

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.179 
it on a camera works really well for
this<00:01:41.060> purpose<00:01:41.299> and<00:01:41.630> as<00:01:42.409> you<00:01:42.590> can<00:01:42.740> see<00:01:42.770> i'm

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
this purpose and as you can see i'm

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.819 
this purpose and as you can see i'm
turning<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.759> dial<00:01:43.960> to<00:01:44.960> set<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.500> aperture

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
turning the dial to set the aperture

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.609 
turning the dial to set the aperture
size<00:01:46.220> when<00:01:47.180> it's<00:01:47.299> wide<00:01:47.509> open<00:01:47.540> you<00:01:48.200> can<00:01:48.229> see

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
size when it's wide open you can see

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.620 
size when it's wide open you can see
right<00:01:48.890> through<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.220> lens<00:01:49.460> they're<00:01:49.790> quite

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
right through the lens they're quite

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.270 
right through the lens they're quite
easily<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:51.229> basically<00:01:51.649> means<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:52.009> a<00:01:52.100> lot

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
easily that basically means that a lot

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.850 
easily that basically means that a lot
of<00:01:52.430> light<00:01:52.640> can<00:01:52.939> enter<00:01:53.270> your<00:01:53.479> film<00:01:54.470> or<00:01:54.710> your

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
of light can enter your film or your

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.300 
of light can enter your film or your
Center<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.430> goes<00:01:55.640> through<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.990> lens<00:01:57.200> now<00:01:57.890> if

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
Center it goes through the lens now if

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.910 
Center it goes through the lens now if
you<00:01:58.610> restrict<00:01:59.170> how<00:02:00.170> much<00:02:00.380> light<00:02:00.619> goes<00:02:00.799> through

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
you restrict how much light goes through

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.179 
you restrict how much light goes through
the<00:02:01.130> lens<00:02:01.310> that's<00:02:01.520> when<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.759> have<00:02:01.909> that<00:02:02.149> small

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
the lens that's when you have that small

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.649 
the lens that's when you have that small
diameter<00:02:04.189> they're<00:02:04.399> that<00:02:04.610> small<00:02:04.939> opening<00:02:05.450> and

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
diameter they're that small opening and

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.020 
diameter they're that small opening and
of<00:02:06.290> course<00:02:06.320> now<00:02:06.680> you're<00:02:06.890> getting<00:02:07.189> less<00:02:07.670> light

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
of course now you're getting less light

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.199 
of course now you're getting less light
into<00:02:09.020> your<00:02:09.259> lens<00:02:09.830> but<00:02:10.489> of<00:02:10.610> course<00:02:10.819> this<00:02:11.000> has

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
into your lens but of course this has

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.210 
into your lens but of course this has
some<00:02:11.510> side<00:02:11.959> effects<00:02:12.349> which<00:02:12.770> I'll<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.190> course

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
some side effects which I'll of course

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.930 
some side effects which I'll of course
talk

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
talk

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.110

depends<00:03:24.220> on<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.310> amount<00:03:24.489> of<00:03:24.670> light<00:03:24.849> you<00:03:25.000> have

depends on the amount of light you have

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.690 
depends on the amount of light you have
but<00:03:25.959> nonetheless<00:03:26.200> that's<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.860> idea

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
but nonetheless that's the idea

but nonetheless that's the idea
and<00:03:28.790> by<00:03:29.510> now<00:03:29.690> you're<00:03:29.870> probably<00:03:29.900> thinking<00:03:30.260> okay

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
and by now you're probably thinking okay

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.490 
and by now you're probably thinking okay
great<00:03:31.489> so<00:03:31.730> I<00:03:31.760> know<00:03:31.879> what<00:03:32.180> this<00:03:32.360> f-stop<00:03:32.959> means

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
great so I know what this f-stop means

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.199 
great so I know what this f-stop means
in<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.069> aperture<00:03:34.640> I<00:03:34.670> know<00:03:34.819> what<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.180> looks

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
in the aperture I know what it looks

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.050 
in the aperture I know what it looks
like<00:03:35.629> but<00:03:35.690> really<00:03:36.590> what<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.129> can<00:03:37.519> this<00:03:37.640> be<00:03:37.819> used

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
like but really what it can this be used

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.170 
like but really what it can this be used
for<00:03:38.390> well<00:03:39.110> it's<00:03:39.500> required<00:03:40.160> basically<00:03:40.760> for<00:03:41.060> the

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
for well it's required basically for the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.449 
for well it's required basically for the
shutter<00:03:41.540> speed<00:03:41.930> in<00:03:42.230> other<00:03:42.379> words<00:03:42.620> it's<00:03:43.010> needed

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
shutter speed in other words it's needed

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.580 
shutter speed in other words it's needed
for<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:44.090> correct<00:03:44.420> exposure<00:03:44.930> so<00:03:45.410> your

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
for the correct exposure so your

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.589 
for the correct exposure so your
pictures<00:03:45.950> not<00:03:46.130> too<00:03:46.340> dark<00:03:46.580> and<00:03:46.790> it's<00:03:47.180> not<00:03:47.390> too

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
pictures not too dark and it's not too

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.589 
pictures not too dark and it's not too
light<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:49.400> also<00:03:49.550> sets<00:03:49.940> your<00:03:50.120> depth<00:03:50.390> of

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
light and it also sets your depth of

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.600 
light and it also sets your depth of
field<00:03:50.930> in<00:03:51.200> other<00:03:51.590> words<00:03:51.800> how<00:03:52.190> much<00:03:52.220> of<00:03:52.400> your

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
field in other words how much of your

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.240 
field in other words how much of your
photograph<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.269> going<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.630> be<00:03:53.750> in<00:03:53.870> focus<00:03:54.250> so

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
photograph is going to be in focus so

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.030 
photograph is going to be in focus so
basically<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.760> larger<00:03:56.239> f-stop<00:03:56.930> or<00:03:57.290> f<00:03:57.590> number

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
basically a larger f-stop or f number

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.130 
basically a larger f-stop or f number
means<00:03:58.760> that<00:03:59.030> you'll<00:03:59.150> have<00:03:59.360> more<00:03:59.750> of<00:03:59.989> your

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
means that you'll have more of your

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.160 
means that you'll have more of your
picture<00:04:00.590> in<00:04:00.769> focus<00:04:01.640> if<00:04:01.849> you're<00:04:02.480> using<00:04:02.720> smaller

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
picture in focus if you're using smaller

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.920 
picture in focus if you're using smaller
numbers<00:04:03.590> less<00:04:04.160> will<00:04:04.400> be<00:04:04.519> in<00:04:04.610> focus<00:04:04.790> let's<00:04:05.720> take

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
numbers less will be in focus let's take

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.460 
numbers less will be in focus let's take
a<00:04:05.959> look<00:04:07.390> so<00:04:08.390> one<00:04:08.569> of<00:04:08.599> the<00:04:08.750> ways<00:04:08.780> i'm<00:04:09.140> going<00:04:09.349> to

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
a look so one of the ways i'm going to

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.930 
a look so one of the ways i'm going to
demonstrate<00:04:09.590> how<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.310> get<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:10.730> field

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
demonstrate how to get the field

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.610 
demonstrate how to get the field
actually<00:04:11.180> looks<00:04:11.599> like<00:04:11.810> it's<00:04:12.200> kind<00:04:12.380> of<00:04:12.410> cliché

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
actually looks like it's kind of cliché

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.430 
actually looks like it's kind of cliché
but<00:04:12.980> it<00:04:13.069> works<00:04:13.250> got<00:04:14.030> a<00:04:14.060> ruler<00:04:14.360> and<00:04:15.049> i've<00:04:15.260> got<00:04:15.410> a

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
but it works got a ruler and i've got a

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.849 
but it works got a ruler and i've got a
50<00:04:15.739> millimeter<00:04:15.890> macro<00:04:16.519> lens<00:04:16.790> here<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.859> this

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
50 millimeter macro lens here and this

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.090 
50 millimeter macro lens here and this
starts<00:04:19.370> at<00:04:19.489> f2<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:21.470> goes<00:04:21.620> up<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.919> believe

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
starts at f2 and it goes up to believe

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.740 
starts at f2 and it goes up to believe
that<00:04:22.280> point<00:04:22.580> if<00:04:22.669> you<00:04:22.790> off<00:04:22.970> top<00:04:23.180> my<00:04:23.330> in<00:04:23.479> I<00:04:23.510> should

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
that point if you off top my in I should

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.530 
that point if you off top my in I should
know<00:04:23.870> that<00:04:23.900> but<00:04:24.650> nonetheless<00:04:25.280> I'm<00:04:26.270> going<00:04:26.450> to

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
know that but nonetheless I'm going to

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.120 
know that but nonetheless I'm going to
be<00:04:26.630> kind<00:04:27.020> of<00:04:27.080> putting<00:04:27.229> it<00:04:27.380> like<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.740> I'll<00:04:27.950> put

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
be kind of putting it like that I'll put

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.129 
be kind of putting it like that I'll put
it<00:04:28.220> on<00:04:28.310> one<00:04:28.490> of<00:04:28.550> my<00:04:28.669> balance<00:04:29.030> here<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.479> I'll

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
it on one of my balance here and I'll

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.129 
it on one of my balance here and I'll
take<00:04:30.380> a<00:04:30.440> couple<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.280> shots<00:04:31.580> using<00:04:32.450> a<00:04:32.810> different

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
take a couple of shots using a different

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.900 
take a couple of shots using a different
depth<00:04:33.350> of<00:04:33.470> field<00:04:33.680> settings<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.760> our

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
depth of field settings and our

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.779 
depth of field settings and our
different<00:04:35.240> apertures<00:04:35.539> and<00:04:36.070> that<00:04:37.070> way<00:04:37.250> you

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
different apertures and that way you

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.180 
different apertures and that way you
won't<00:04:37.970> be<00:04:38.030> able<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.360> see<00:04:38.539> about<00:04:39.200> how<00:04:39.590> much<00:04:39.860> of

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
won't be able to see about how much of

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.420 
won't be able to see about how much of
the<00:04:40.669> ruler<00:04:41.000> is<00:04:41.240> actually<00:04:41.780> in<00:04:41.930> focus<00:04:42.430> simple

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
the ruler is actually in focus simple

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.060 
the ruler is actually in focus simple
but<00:04:43.550> it<00:04:43.729> works<00:04:44.260> so<00:04:45.260> after<00:04:45.410> setting<00:04:45.830> up<00:04:45.889> my

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
but it works so after setting up my

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.980 
but it works so after setting up my
camera<00:04:46.400> here's<00:04:46.910> what<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.240> images<00:04:47.600> look<00:04:47.750> like

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
camera here's what the images look like

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.740 
camera here's what the images look like
so<00:04:48.950> the<00:04:49.070> ruler<00:04:49.340> is<00:04:49.400> really<00:04:49.820> close<00:04:50.030> here<00:04:50.389> and<00:04:50.570> I

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
so the ruler is really close here and I

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.040 
so the ruler is really close here and I
have<00:04:50.870> it<00:04:51.020> my<00:04:51.289> lens<00:04:51.590> set<00:04:52.039> to<00:04:52.220> f2<00:04:52.850> as<00:04:53.180> you<00:04:53.720> can<00:04:53.840> see

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
have it my lens set to f2 as you can see

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.020 
have it my lens set to f2 as you can see
compared<00:04:54.620> Lee<00:04:54.770> see<00:04:54.979> anything<00:04:55.460> at<00:04:55.550> all<00:04:55.669> quite

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
compared Lee see anything at all quite

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.629 
compared Lee see anything at all quite
frankly<00:04:56.479> all<00:04:56.930> you<00:04:57.260> see<00:04:57.440> is<00:04:57.560> just<00:04:57.590> a<00:04:57.860> tiny

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
frankly all you see is just a tiny

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.270 
frankly all you see is just a tiny
little<00:04:58.760> line<00:04:59.210> there<00:04:59.440> but<00:05:00.440> as<00:05:00.710> I<00:05:00.860> adjust<00:05:01.010> my

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
little line there but as I adjust my

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.840 
little line there but as I adjust my
lens<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:02.020> f-22<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.650> can<00:05:03.830> see<00:05:04.039> the<00:05:04.280> quite<00:05:04.820> a

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
lens to f-22 you can see the quite a

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.850 
lens to f-22 you can see the quite a
massive<00:05:05.360> difference<00:05:05.600> now<00:05:06.200> you<00:05:06.260> can<00:05:06.500> see<00:05:06.680> quite

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
massive difference now you can see quite

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.909 
massive difference now you can see quite
a<00:05:06.950> bit<00:05:07.039> of<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.340> ruler<00:05:07.639> in<00:05:08.030> focus<00:05:08.780> I<00:05:09.020> have<00:05:09.889> a

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
a bit of the ruler in focus I have a

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.980 
a bit of the ruler in focus I have a
nice<00:05:10.100> little<00:05:10.250> animation<00:05:10.970> here<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:11.450> we'll

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
nice little animation here and we'll

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.900 
nice little animation here and we'll
swing<00:05:12.349> right<00:05:12.560> through<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:12.860> so<00:05:13.490> you<00:05:13.580> can<00:05:13.700> see

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
swing right through that so you can see

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.510 
swing right through that so you can see
how<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.630> depth<00:05:14.900> of<00:05:15.080> field<00:05:15.349> increases<00:05:15.860> as<00:05:16.460> you

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
how the depth of field increases as you

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.529 
how the depth of field increases as you
increase<00:05:17.260> your<00:05:18.260> f<00:05:18.530> number<00:05:19.180> now<00:05:20.180> as<00:05:20.479> you

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
increase your f number now as you

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.779 
increase your f number now as you
increase<00:05:21.380> your<00:05:21.650> f<00:05:21.830> number<00:05:22.220> the<00:05:22.400> one<00:05:22.550> thing<00:05:22.760> to

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
increase your f number the one thing to

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.180 
increase your f number the one thing to
keep<00:05:23.000> in<00:05:23.150> mind<00:05:23.210> is<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:24.229> aperture<00:05:24.710> actually

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
keep in mind is the aperture actually

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.550 
keep in mind is the aperture actually
gets<00:05:25.400> smaller<00:05:25.849> that's<00:05:26.510> when<00:05:26.780> that<00:05:26.960> iris

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
gets smaller that's when that iris

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.800 
gets smaller that's when that iris
diaphragm<00:05:27.760> closes<00:05:28.760> up<00:05:28.940> so<00:05:29.510> you're<00:05:29.630> actually

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
diaphragm closes up so you're actually

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.480 
diaphragm closes up so you're actually
letting

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
letting

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.110 
letting
and<00:05:31.580> quickly<00:05:32.509> for<00:05:32.840> some<00:05:33.139> real<00:05:33.560> life<00:05:33.830> examples

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
and quickly for some real life examples

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.820 
and quickly for some real life examples
this<00:05:35.120> first<00:05:35.360> image<00:05:35.539> is<00:05:35.840> one<00:05:36.319> I<00:05:36.349> took<00:05:36.500> of<00:05:36.740> a

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
this first image is one I took of a

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.730 
this first image is one I took of a
dragonfly<00:05:37.520> and<00:05:37.849> as<00:05:38.330> you<00:05:38.449> can<00:05:38.599> see<00:05:38.840> there's<00:05:39.500> a

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
dragonfly and as you can see there's a

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.400 
dragonfly and as you can see there's a
very<00:05:40.580> shallow<00:05:40.880> depth<00:05:41.270> of<00:05:41.389> field<00:05:41.449> here<00:05:42.110> the

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
very shallow depth of field here the

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.070 
very shallow depth of field here the
Dragonfly<00:05:42.949> sharp<00:05:43.370> so<00:05:43.639> the<00:05:43.819> leaf<00:05:43.970> it's<00:05:44.180> on<00:05:44.360> but

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
Dragonfly sharp so the leaf it's on but

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.290 
Dragonfly sharp so the leaf it's on but
those<00:05:45.380> leaves<00:05:45.650> behind<00:05:45.919> it<00:05:46.340> which<00:05:46.490> were<00:05:46.699> only<00:05:46.940> a

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
those leaves behind it which were only a

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.570 
those leaves behind it which were only a
few<00:05:47.360> inches<00:05:47.569> away<00:05:47.930> are<00:05:48.410> already<00:05:49.009> quite<00:05:49.250> blurry

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
few inches away are already quite blurry

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.529 
few inches away are already quite blurry
in<00:05:50.539> this<00:05:50.990> next<00:05:51.319> image<00:05:51.710> of<00:05:52.520> a<00:05:52.669> compass<00:05:53.180> and

tiny<00:06:00.800> items<00:06:01.280> the<00:06:01.460> compass<00:06:01.789> is<00:06:01.910> about<00:06:02.120> an

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
tiny items the compass is about an

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.240 
tiny items the compass is about an
ancient<00:06:02.569> diameter<00:06:03.080> so<00:06:03.620> you<00:06:03.680> can<00:06:03.800> see<00:06:03.949> again<00:06:04.190> I

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
ancient diameter so you can see again I

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.550 
ancient diameter so you can see again I
took<00:06:04.400> a<00:06:04.580> shot<00:06:04.849> and<00:06:05.090> the<00:06:05.599> depth<00:06:05.810> of<00:06:05.900> field<00:06:06.139> very

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
took a shot and the depth of field very

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.529 
took a shot and the depth of field very
tiny<00:06:06.949> the<00:06:07.250> dice<00:06:07.460> that<00:06:07.759> were<00:06:07.909> about<00:06:08.120> half<00:06:08.360> an

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
tiny the dice that were about half an

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:09.879 
tiny the dice that were about half an
inch<00:06:08.690> remit<00:06:08.990> already<00:06:09.500> starting<00:06:09.770> to<00:06:09.830> be

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
inch remit already starting to be

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.939 
inch remit already starting to be
blurred<00:06:10.630> but<00:06:11.630> now<00:06:11.810> we<00:06:11.870> move<00:06:12.110> to<00:06:12.169> another<00:06:12.530> image

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:12.949 
blurred but now we move to another image

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.749 
blurred but now we move to another image
where<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.550> depth<00:06:13.789> of<00:06:13.970> field<00:06:14.210> is<00:06:14.419> enormous<00:06:15.169> and

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 
where the depth of field is enormous and

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.520 
where the depth of field is enormous and
it<00:06:16.759> also<00:06:16.940> depends<00:06:17.389> on<00:06:17.539> the<00:06:17.659> type<00:06:17.840> of<00:06:17.870> lens<00:06:18.199> use

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
it also depends on the type of lens use

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.129 
it also depends on the type of lens use
this<00:06:18.740> was<00:06:18.949> a<00:06:18.979> wide-angle<00:06:19.250> lens<00:06:19.789> and<00:06:20.090> up<00:06:20.840> front

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
this was a wide-angle lens and up front

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.020 
this was a wide-angle lens and up front
you<00:06:21.259> can<00:06:21.289> see<00:06:21.440> the<00:06:21.680> rocks<00:06:21.919> are<00:06:22.190> completely

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
you can see the rocks are completely

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.330 
you can see the rocks are completely
sharp<00:06:23.300> whereas<00:06:24.110> the<00:06:24.470> rockies<00:06:24.979> at<00:06:25.099> the<00:06:25.190> back

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
sharp whereas the rockies at the back

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.080 
sharp whereas the rockies at the back
those<00:06:25.819> are<00:06:26.090> sharp<00:06:26.300> as<00:06:26.449> well<00:06:27.669> so<00:06:28.669> that's<00:06:28.849> it<00:06:29.060> for

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
those are sharp as well so that's it for

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.749 
those are sharp as well so that's it for
today's<00:06:29.930> episode<00:06:30.110> I<00:06:30.740> hope<00:06:30.919> you<00:06:31.130> enjoyed<00:06:31.580> it
