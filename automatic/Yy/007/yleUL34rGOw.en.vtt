00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.259
 one together 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.910
 The box here I want it once 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.190
 in short, the differences between two 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.760
 Show appliances once we have on the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.800
 right side of the nokia lumia 920 das 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.539
 new nokia flagship and on the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.699
 left side we have the nexus 4 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.699
 which in cooperation of google and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.460
 lg, both have emerged in their own way 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:31.079
 flagships once windows phone 8 and 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.829
 once android 4.2 so see the two 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.899
 ruble so from the front that times 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.550
 you've seen both devices 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:45.269
 by the way, a resolution of 12 80 x 768 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:50.730
 you have here at nokia lumia 4 5 inches 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:51.480
 47 here is your weight 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.449
 it's a bit natural, of course 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.980
 different here once 139 grams 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.320
 we have the whopping 185 grams here 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.920
 design at nokia lumia 800 that is the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.150
 af the 920 is the monoblock see 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:15.720
 It's natural, too 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:22.409
 a bit more powerful of the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:26.579
 back the nokia lumia 920 features 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.740
 via wireless charging facilities that 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.979
 you will be at the nexus 4 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.340
 We also have the one here 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.829
 normal data possibilities we would be 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.990
 here have lte that now stood in 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.630
 the usa, for example, with this device 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.390
 But we have to be aware of that 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.560
 I believe the 16 gigabyte variant 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.360
 costs 349 euro while here we are around 600 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.700
 euro currently in 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.700
 pay yes here in 2000 mah battery 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:03.340
 it, got here once in 2100 mah 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:06.190
 lithium polymer in the 920 is the camera 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.340
 specify with 8.7 megapixels 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.740
 purple for technology that's natural 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.950
 if you have seen the photos really ne 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.470
 house number and I'm curious what that 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.160
 nexus with its eight megapixels so 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.440
 can make 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.700
 So far I have been from these award cameras 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.650
 but not so pleased 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.630
 Here we see once now carl 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.280
 zeiss optics with a led lightning 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:36.640
 here you have the camera of the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.140
 nexus 4g other devices like you 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.480
 different can hardly be 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.670
 at least as far as the operating system is concerned 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:49.480
 I have to look at it so it 's frugal 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.550
 from windows phone 8 has the well-known 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.650
 tiling while we at android 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.200
 of course the well-known surface 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.290
 find the api-data for example 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.320
 also balls which you the cards 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.120
 indicates and you have your thing and no 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.239
 Maybe he will 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.790
 then worked here again so that 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.630
 first so the rough optical 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.080
 differences 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:18.970
 that's what I've always thought so 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.269
 the fun looks so if you still 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.450
 ask to have a say 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.190
 Of course we try to answer 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.690
 Of course, devices keep coming 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.440
 what the two devices are turning now 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.440
 of course 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.909
 nfc difference is of course still 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.200
 while we are here at the camera 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.650
 Display had to press here 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.200
 still a dedicated at nokia 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.290
 camera button so first time as 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:54.569
 first overview between the nexus 4 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.750
 and the lumia 920 from nokia to the right 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.750
 watch
