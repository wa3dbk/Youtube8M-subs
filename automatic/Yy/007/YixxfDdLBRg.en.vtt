00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.240 
thinking about that song how it says
like<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.750> have<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.079> dog<00:03:14.290> his<00:03:14.470> name<00:03:14.590> is<00:03:14.769> spot<00:03:15.040> not

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
like I have a dog his name is spot not

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.130 
like I have a dog his name is spot not
much<00:03:15.489> brains<00:03:15.790> but<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.030> love<00:03:16.269> him<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.480> lot<00:03:16.780> and

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
much brains but I love him a lot and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.080 
much brains but I love him a lot and
he's<00:03:17.709> never<00:03:17.920> on<00:03:18.130> time<00:03:18.430> because<00:03:18.640> he's<00:03:18.880> always

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
he's never on time because he's always

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.360 
he's never on time because he's always
late<00:03:19.530> because<00:03:20.530> he's<00:03:20.680> not<00:03:20.829> very<00:03:21.010> good<00:03:21.160> on<00:03:21.250> his

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
late because he's not very good on his

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.650 
late because he's not very good on his
roller<00:03:21.519> skates<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.060> thought<00:03:22.209> that<00:03:22.420> didn't

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
roller skates and I thought that didn't

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.920 
roller skates and I thought that didn't
make<00:03:22.750> sense<00:03:22.810> because<00:03:23.940> even<00:03:24.940> if<00:03:25.090> spots<00:03:25.599> not

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
make sense because even if spots not

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.610 
make sense because even if spots not
good<00:03:26.170> on<00:03:26.290> his<00:03:26.440> roller<00:03:26.709> skates<00:03:28.290> he's<00:03:29.290> pretty

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
good on his roller skates he's pretty

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.890 
good on his roller skates he's pretty
intelligent<00:03:30.069> he<00:03:30.519> even<00:03:30.970> be<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.120> tempting<00:03:31.629> roller

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
intelligent he even be a tempting roller

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.479 
intelligent he even be a tempting roller
skating<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:34.709> he's<00:03:35.709> probably<00:03:35.950> late<00:03:36.129> cuz<00:03:36.340> he's

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
skating and he's probably late cuz he's

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.250 
skating and he's probably late cuz he's
doing<00:03:36.790> better<00:03:36.970> stuff<00:03:37.450> than<00:03:37.750> hanging<00:03:38.019> out<00:03:38.200> with

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
doing better stuff than hanging out with

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.819 
doing better stuff than hanging out with
somebody<00:03:38.680> who<00:03:38.890> doesn't<00:03:39.069> appreciate<00:03:40.829> ain't
