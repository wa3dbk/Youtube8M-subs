00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
that's what the valve body removed from

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.810 
that's what the valve body removed from
the<00:00:09.990> vehicle<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.769> will<00:00:10.980> need<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> multimeter

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.610 

now<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.480> black<00:00:45.690> thing<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.050> called<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.379> puck

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
now this black thing is called the puck

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.580 
now this black thing is called the puck
right<00:00:46.980> we'll<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.670> pull<00:00:48.030> straight<00:00:48.270> up<00:00:48.590> you

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
right we'll just pull straight up you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.220 
right we'll just pull straight up you
might<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.010> pry<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.370> little<00:00:50.520> bit<00:00:51.230> don't

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
might have to pry it a little bit don't

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.689 
might have to pry it a little bit don't
want<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> force<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.769> too<00:00:52.920> much<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:55.460> for<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.579> I

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
want to force it too much now for this I

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.549 
want to force it too much now for this I
use<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.030> digital<00:00:57.210> multimeter<00:00:57.719> digital

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
use the digital multimeter digital

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.649 
use the digital multimeter digital
multimeters<00:00:59.100> pretty<00:00:59.909> much<00:01:00.089> stupid<00:01:00.449> proof

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
multimeters pretty much stupid proof

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.130 
multimeters pretty much stupid proof
she's<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.440> read<00:01:01.650> and<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:03.570> me<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.930> little

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
she's to read and to me it's a little

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.649 
she's to read and to me it's a little
bit<00:01:04.259> more<00:01:04.440> accurate<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.640> get<00:01:05.850> better<00:01:06.090> results

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
bit more accurate you get better results

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.219 
bit more accurate you get better results
from<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.140> set<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.890> multimeter<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:09.330> 200<00:01:09.960> ohms

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
from I set this multimeter on a 200 ohms

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.830 
from I set this multimeter on a 200 ohms
scale<00:01:13.729> don't<00:01:14.729> worry<00:01:14.909> about<00:01:15.030> we're<00:01:15.360> positive

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
scale don't worry about we're positive

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.900 
scale don't worry about we're positive
and<00:01:15.990> negative<00:01:16.350> leads<00:01:16.380> are<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:17.070> about<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
and negative leads are going about the

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.219 
and negative leads are going about the
same<00:01:17.940> doesn't<00:01:18.570> matter<00:01:20.450> we<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.720> want<00:01:21.899> to<00:01:22.020> fly

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
same doesn't matter we just want to fly

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.060 
same doesn't matter we just want to fly
it<00:01:22.289> to<00:01:22.649> both<00:01:22.830> contacts<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.710> see<00:01:25.860> this

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
it to both contacts and you can see this

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.960 
it to both contacts and you can see this
one's<00:01:26.280> good<00:01:27.440> an<00:01:28.440> awful<00:01:28.830> normal<00:01:29.369> operations

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
one's good an awful normal operations

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.850 
one's good an awful normal operations
four<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.869> half<00:01:30.899> to<00:01:31.200> five<00:01:31.470> arms<00:01:33.470> as<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.710> can

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
four and a half to five arms as you can

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.010 
four and a half to five arms as you can
see<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.310> one's<00:01:35.580> not<00:01:35.909> within<00:01:36.179> spec<00:01:36.630> that's

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
see this one's not within spec that's

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.980 
see this one's not within spec that's
not<00:01:37.259> within<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.860> home<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:39.030> other<00:01:39.179> one<00:01:39.420> so

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
not within one home of the other one so

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.870 
not within one home of the other one so
this<00:01:40.229> one<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.740> bad

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.880 

I'll<00:01:44.180> test<00:01:44.689> this<00:01:45.020> one<00:01:45.520> this<00:01:46.520> is<00:01:46.939> just<00:01:47.329> obvious

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
I'll test this one this is just obvious

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:57.469 
I'll test this one this is just obvious
Taiwan's<00:01:48.890> really<00:01:49.310> bad

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.660 

and<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.560> one's<00:01:58.799> dead<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.340> money<00:01:59.369> that

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and that one's dead on the money that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:08.729 
and that one's dead on the money that
one's<00:02:00.030> good<00:02:03.049> and<00:02:04.049> really<00:02:04.890> bad

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.110 

so<00:02:09.739> one<00:02:10.099> thing<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.369> want<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:10.580> make<00:02:10.640> sure<00:02:10.759> you

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
so one thing you want to make sure you

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.300 
so one thing you want to make sure you
do<00:02:11.300> just<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.750> make<00:02:11.930> sure<00:02:12.170> is<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:12.860> want<00:02:13.160> to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
do just to make sure is you want to

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.820 
do just to make sure is you want to
double<00:02:13.610> check<00:02:13.640> these<00:02:14.110> it's<00:02:15.110> very<00:02:15.319> important

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
double check these it's very important

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.350 
double check these it's very important
to<00:02:15.920> do<00:02:16.099> that<00:02:16.129> because<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.760> might<00:02:16.910> get<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.120> false

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
to do that because you might get a false

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.690 
to do that because you might get a false
reading<00:02:17.629> the<00:02:18.500> longer<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.010> leave<00:02:19.190> these<00:02:19.370> leads

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
reading the longer you leave these leads

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.240 
reading the longer you leave these leads
connected<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.870> longer<00:02:21.290> you'll<00:02:21.950> get<00:02:22.099> an

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
connected the longer you'll get an

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.949 
connected the longer you'll get an
accurate<00:02:22.610> reading<00:02:22.849> you<00:02:23.209> can<00:02:23.390> see<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.660> numbers

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
accurate reading you can see the numbers

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.759 
accurate reading you can see the numbers
changing<00:02:24.440> but<00:02:25.160> we<00:02:25.190> know<00:02:25.370> number<00:02:25.700> four<00:02:25.910> is<00:02:26.060> bad

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
changing but we know number four is bad

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.520 
changing but we know number four is bad
we<00:02:27.769> know<00:02:27.890> number<00:02:28.130> five<00:02:28.459> is<00:02:28.700> good<00:02:28.940> obviously

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
we know number five is good obviously

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.940 
we know number five is good obviously
which<00:02:30.530> happens<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.950> be<00:02:30.980> fourth<00:02:31.340> gear<00:02:32.950> then

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
which happens to be fourth gear then

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.860 
which happens to be fourth gear then
we're<00:02:34.130> doing<00:02:34.400> three<00:02:34.700> which<00:02:34.880> is<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.239> TCC

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
we're doing three which is the TCC

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.140 
we're doing three which is the TCC
that's<00:02:36.200> bad

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
that's bad

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.699 
that's bad
and<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.510> course<00:02:38.720> second<00:02:39.170> gear<00:02:39.410> which<00:02:39.680> is

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
and of course second gear which is

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.140 
and of course second gear which is
number<00:02:39.980> two<00:02:40.250> that<00:02:40.640> one's<00:02:40.880> bad<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:43.459> number<00:02:43.910> one

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
number two that one's bad and number one

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.509
