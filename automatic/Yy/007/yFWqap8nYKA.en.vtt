choose<00:01:42.080> I'll<00:01:42.440> scoot<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.830> down<00:01:42.980> a<00:01:43.010> little<00:01:43.100> bit

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
choose I'll scoot that down a little bit

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.640 
choose I'll scoot that down a little bit
you<00:01:43.670> want<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:43.940> choose<00:01:44.120> blue<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:45.050> is<00:01:45.200> going<00:01:45.470> to

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
you want to choose blue that is going to

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.410 
you want to choose blue that is going to
dry<00:01:46.010> clearer<00:01:46.490> because<00:01:46.820> there's<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.060> chance

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
dry clearer because there's a chance

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.760 
dry clearer because there's a chance
that<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:47.720> glue<00:01:47.870> could<00:01:48.050> seep<00:01:48.290> out<00:01:48.440> underneath

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
that the glue could seep out underneath

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.190 
that the glue could seep out underneath
the<00:01:48.890> Scrabble<00:01:49.370> tiles<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:49.910> you<00:01:50.750> can<00:01:50.930> get<00:01:51.050> the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
the Scrabble tiles and you can get the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.720 
the Scrabble tiles and you can get the
Scrabble<00:01:51.560> tiles<00:01:51.740> from<00:01:52.010> the<00:01:52.100> Scrabble<00:01:52.520> game

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
Scrabble tiles from the Scrabble game

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.820 
Scrabble tiles from the Scrabble game
but<00:01:53.000> also<00:01:53.150> craft<00:01:53.960> shops<00:01:54.200> would<00:01:54.410> have<00:01:54.590> some

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
but also craft shops would have some

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.050 
but also craft shops would have some
sort<00:01:55.100> of<00:01:55.160> lettering<00:01:55.430> that<00:01:55.550> you'd<00:01:55.760> be<00:01:55.850> able<00:01:55.910> to

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
sort of lettering that you'd be able to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.110 
sort of lettering that you'd be able to
use<00:01:56.270> too<00:01:56.540> so<00:01:57.380> I<00:01:57.710> think<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.220> trick<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.910> putting

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
use too so I think the trick to putting

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.210 
use too so I think the trick to putting
this<00:01:59.300> on<00:01:59.480> is<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.810> use<00:02:00.050> just<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.470> right<00:02:00.560> amount

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
this on is to use just the right amount

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.090 
this on is to use just the right amount
of<00:02:01.310> glue<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.520> don't<00:02:01.850> want<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.030> use<00:02:02.150> too<00:02:02.180> much

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
of glue you don't want to use too much

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.230 
of glue you don't want to use too much
but<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.190> don't<00:02:04.370> want<00:02:04.520> these<00:02:04.610> too<00:02:05.030> little

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
but you don't want these too little

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.910 
but you don't want these too little
either<00:02:05.510> so<00:02:05.810> just<00:02:06.050> a<00:02:06.140> couple<00:02:06.290> little<00:02:06.650> dabs

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
either so just a couple little dabs

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.480 
either so just a couple little dabs
would<00:02:07.190> be<00:02:07.340> perfect<00:02:07.929> and<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:08.990> can<00:02:09.920> also<00:02:10.070> make

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
would be perfect and you can also make

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.740 
would be perfect and you can also make
this<00:02:10.640> really<00:02:10.940> fun<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.330> make<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.570> like<00:02:11.720> a

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
this really fun and make it like a

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.520 
this really fun and make it like a
Scrabble<00:02:12.380> game<00:02:13.630> unfortunately<00:02:14.630> we<00:02:15.320> can't

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
Scrabble game unfortunately we can't

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.050 
Scrabble game unfortunately we can't
really<00:02:15.680> do<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:15.890> with<00:02:16.040> DSM<00:02:16.490> living<00:02:16.790> but<00:02:16.970> if

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
really do that with DSM living but if

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.030 
really do that with DSM living but if
you<00:02:17.180> had<00:02:17.330> had<00:02:17.780> something<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.290> could<00:02:18.440> put<00:02:18.890> the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
you had had something you could put the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.830 
you had had something you could put the
letters<00:02:19.280> down<00:02:19.580> or<00:02:19.880> across<00:02:20.240> or<00:02:20.450> whatever<00:02:20.690> you

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
letters down or across or whatever you

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.770 
letters down or across or whatever you
wanted<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.200> do

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.590 

I'll<00:02:25.780> put<00:02:25.960> these<00:02:26.110> little<00:02:26.500> guys<00:02:26.620> on<00:02:26.890> here<00:02:27.250> and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
I'll put these little guys on here and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.300 
I'll put these little guys on here and
then<00:02:28.600> once<00:02:29.080> we<00:02:29.260> get<00:02:29.410> them<00:02:29.620> on<00:02:29.770> here<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.190> takes

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
then once we get them on here it takes

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.010 
then once we get them on here it takes
about<00:02:30.520> ten<00:02:30.880> or<00:02:31.060> fifteen<00:02:31.420> minutes<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.870> have

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
about ten or fifteen minutes to have

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.010 
about ten or fifteen minutes to have
them<00:02:32.260> dry<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:33.400> this<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.940> very<00:02:34.390> very<00:02:34.720> quick

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
them dry so this is a very very quick

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.350 
them dry so this is a very very quick
project<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.770> actually<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.670> think<00:02:36.790> my<00:02:37.060> kiddos

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
project and actually I think my kiddos

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.540 
project and actually I think my kiddos
at<00:02:37.510> home<00:02:37.660> would<00:02:37.780> love<00:02:37.960> to<00:02:38.080> do<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.380> too<00:02:38.710> pretty

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
at home would love to do this too pretty

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.960 
at home would love to do this too pretty
easy

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.140 
[Music]
right<00:02:49.840> on<00:02:50.019> there<00:02:50.290> all<00:02:50.470> right<00:02:50.650> our<00:02:51.489> last<00:02:51.519> letter

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
right on there all right our last letter

right on there all right our last letter
is<00:02:52.390> on<00:02:53.099> so<00:02:54.099> we're<00:02:54.549> going<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.700> take<00:02:54.849> a<00:02:54.909> look<00:02:55.090> at

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
is on so we're going to take a look at

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.320 
is on so we're going to take a look at
this<00:02:55.299> I<00:02:55.450> think<00:02:55.629> that<00:02:55.750> looks<00:02:55.900> pretty<00:02:56.080> good

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
this I think that looks pretty good

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.420 
this I think that looks pretty good
straighten<00:02:58.330> them<00:02:58.420> out<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.540> little<00:02:58.690> bit<00:02:58.840> weather

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
straighten them out a little bit weather

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.550 
straighten them out a little bit weather
still<00:03:00.430> drying<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.090> then<00:03:01.870> again<00:03:02.110> just<00:03:02.409> take

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
still drying and then again just take

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.869 
still drying and then again just take
about<00:03:02.739> 10<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:02.980> 15<00:03:03.400> minutes<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.790> let<00:03:03.879> it<00:03:04.030> dry<00:03:05.879> all

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
about 10 to 15 minutes to let it dry all

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.130 
about 10 to 15 minutes to let it dry all
right<00:03:07.180> well<00:03:07.329> looks<00:03:07.480> like<00:03:07.540> our<00:03:07.720> letters<00:03:07.959> have

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
right well looks like our letters have

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.600 
right well looks like our letters have
dried<00:03:08.379> on<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.620> photo<00:03:08.829> so<00:03:09.159> we<00:03:09.280> will<00:03:09.430> go<00:03:09.519> ahead

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
dried on the photo so we will go ahead

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.890 
dried on the photo so we will go ahead
and<00:03:09.730> pop<00:03:10.120> them<00:03:10.420> in<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:10.720> picture<00:03:11.019> frame<00:03:12.900> so

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
and pop them in the picture frame so

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.390 
and pop them in the picture frame so
just<00:03:14.110> turn<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.319> frame<00:03:14.560> around<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:15.159> again<00:03:15.370> I

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
just turn the frame around and again I

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.000 
just turn the frame around and again I
used<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.760> little<00:03:16.000> bit<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.239> thicker<00:03:16.720> mat<00:03:17.019> so<00:03:17.980> I

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
used a little bit of a thicker mat so I

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.470 
used a little bit of a thicker mat so I
think<00:03:18.099> that<00:03:18.340> will<00:03:18.489> really<00:03:18.790> make<00:03:18.909> the<00:03:19.150> picture

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
think that will really make the picture

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.930 
think that will really make the picture
pop<00:03:21.599> I'll<00:03:22.599> just<00:03:22.870> put<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.379> in<00:03:23.560> here<00:03:23.829> now<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:24.790> think

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
pop I'll just put it in here now I think

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.479 
pop I'll just put it in here now I think
it<00:03:25.299> would<00:03:25.720> be<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:26.170> wise<00:03:26.560> decision<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.250> put<00:03:27.459> a

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
it would be a wise decision to put a

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:28.860 
it would be a wise decision to put a
little<00:03:27.609> bit<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.819> tape<00:03:28.000> on<00:03:28.150> here<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.569> make<00:03:28.599> sure

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
little bit of tape on here to make sure

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.690 
little bit of tape on here to make sure
the<00:03:28.989> photo<00:03:29.200> doesn't<00:03:29.440> crinkle<00:03:29.950> so<00:03:30.489> I'm<00:03:30.549> just

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
the photo doesn't crinkle so I'm just

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.110 
the photo doesn't crinkle so I'm just
going<00:03:30.849> to<00:03:30.910> tape<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.209> ends<00:03:31.540> pretty<00:03:31.720> gently
