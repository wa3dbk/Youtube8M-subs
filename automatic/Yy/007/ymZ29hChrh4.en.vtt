 portrait of the profession in the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.809

 the national territory without any 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.390
 Winning it will be produced in 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.270
 polycarbonate and will have a chip with 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.460
 ability to store information from the

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.409
 the first step in requesting the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.170
 The couple's wallet has already begun if you 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.510

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.130
 as inconsistency in the information 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.070
 with particular attention to the date of 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.920
 his registration in the old system because he 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.270

 occupation of the territory in the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.989
 construction of the human and 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.410

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.070
 both local and architects and 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.560

 greater agility security in services 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.250

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.350
 the locations and deadlines for this step 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.010
 the face of the issue of portfolios are 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.430
