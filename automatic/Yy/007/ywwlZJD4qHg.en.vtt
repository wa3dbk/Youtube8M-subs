00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.670 
these what do you call it dis users with
the<00:02:33.810> south<00:02:34.019> side<00:02:34.370> of<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.670> snoot<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.560> they<00:02:37.560> all

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
the south side of the snoot and they all

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.910 
the south side of the snoot and they all
work<00:02:37.860> together<00:02:38.599> so

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.110 

also<00:02:42.920> it's<00:02:43.099> collapsed<00:02:43.580> well<00:02:43.790> when<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.000> take

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
also it's collapsed well when you take

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.839 
also it's collapsed well when you take
this<00:02:44.269> out<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.569> can<00:02:44.720> put<00:02:44.870> this<00:02:44.989> in<00:02:45.170> your<00:02:45.260> bag<00:02:45.849> or

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
this out you can put this in your bag or

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.729 
this out you can put this in your bag or
what<00:02:47.060> not<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:47.569> you<00:02:47.659> can<00:02:47.930> take<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.409> and

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
what not and you can take this and

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.210 
what not and you can take this and
collapse<00:02:49.129> it<00:02:49.390> see<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.830> very<00:02:51.980> easy

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
collapse it see so it's very easy

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.199 
collapse it see so it's very easy
collapse<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.799> I'm<00:02:55.370> gonna<00:02:55.549> show<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:55.790> how

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
collapse and so I'm gonna show you how

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.600 
collapse and so I'm gonna show you how
my<00:02:57.129> snoot<00:02:58.129> works<00:02:58.400> just<00:02:58.940> in<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.540> second<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:01.190> as

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
my snoot works just in a second so as

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.070 
my snoot works just in a second so as
you<00:03:01.910> can<00:03:02.060> see<00:03:02.120> I'm<00:03:02.569> using<00:03:02.599> this<00:03:03.370> light<00:03:05.080> right

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
you can see I'm using this light right

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.920 
you can see I'm using this light right
here<00:03:07.269> that's<00:03:08.269> on<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:10.060> it's<00:03:11.060> shining<00:03:11.510> this

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
here that's on and it's shining this

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.979 
here that's on and it's shining this
circle<00:03:12.769> right<00:03:12.980> here<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.900> right<00:03:15.410> now<00:03:15.739> I<00:03:16.989> am

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
circle right here so right now I am

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.729 
circle right here so right now I am
going<00:03:18.410> to<00:03:18.799> be<00:03:19.010> putting<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.940> snoot<00:03:20.540> on<00:03:21.230> this

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
going to be putting a snoot on this

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.990 
going to be putting a snoot on this
place<00:03:24.739> this<00:03:25.010> on<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:27.560> we're<00:03:28.250> gonna<00:03:28.430> see<00:03:28.819> the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
place this on and we're gonna see the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.559 
place this on and we're gonna see the
results<00:03:29.260> as<00:03:32.709> sorry

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.140 

as

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.630 

a<00:03:40.239> square

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.750 

it's<00:03:47.150> hard<00:03:47.390> to<00:03:47.570> get<00:03:47.780> arms

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.600 

so<00:03:51.420> as<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:52.019> can<00:03:52.170> see<00:03:52.230> if<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:52.650> put<00:03:52.860> this<00:03:53.010> on<00:03:53.220> it

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
so as you can see if I put this on it

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.170 
so as you can see if I put this on it
does<00:03:54.300> reduce<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:58.769> light<00:03:58.980> escaping<00:03:59.909> from

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
does reduce the light escaping from

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.710 
does reduce the light escaping from
itself<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:01.319> this<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.430> as<00:04:02.670> far<00:04:02.970> as<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.209> can<00:04:03.390> put<00:04:03.599> it

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
itself so this is as far as I can put it

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.619 
itself so this is as far as I can put it
but<00:04:04.280> when<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.400> take<00:04:05.580> a<00:04:05.610> picture<00:04:05.819> it<00:04:06.269> does<00:04:06.450> not

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
but when you take a picture it does not

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.470 
but when you take a picture it does not
look<00:04:06.810> like<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:07.080> square<00:04:07.349> because<00:04:08.250> your<00:04:09.150> speed

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
look like a square because your speed

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.690 
look like a square because your speed
light<00:04:09.660> is<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:10.200> square<00:04:10.739> source<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.190> light<00:04:11.430> this

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
light is a square source of light this

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.170 
light is a square source of light this
source<00:04:12.030> of<00:04:12.269> light<00:04:12.510> in<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.930> circle<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:14.180> it's

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
source of light in the circle so it's

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.699 
source of light in the circle so it's
not<00:04:15.420> going<00:04:15.599> to<00:04:15.660> change<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:16.079> shape<00:04:16.109> of<00:04:16.650> your

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
not going to change the shape of your

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.569 
not going to change the shape of your
light<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.940> will<00:04:18.090> eventually<00:04:18.570> have<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.799> shadow

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
light you will eventually have a shadow

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.350 
light you will eventually have a shadow
of<00:04:20.820> light<00:04:21.000> casting<00:04:21.600> on<00:04:21.780> your<00:04:21.930> subject<00:04:22.470> and

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
of light casting on your subject and

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.740 
of light casting on your subject and
then<00:04:24.360> just<00:04:24.780> right<00:04:24.960> now<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.650> am<00:04:26.100> going<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.760> put<00:04:27.449> on

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
then just right now I am going to put on

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:38.960 
then just right now I am going to put on
so<00:04:30.750> great<00:04:35.120> okay<00:04:36.120> so<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.870> got<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.800> grid<00:04:38.100> on<00:04:38.639> my

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
so great okay so I got the grid on my
