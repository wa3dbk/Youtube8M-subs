00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 then 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.900
 well it him everyone knows scalzo 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.609
 so people find themselves for new 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.320
 glitch video on aden tonight by this 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.449
 once in multiplayer mode and more 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.890
 precisely partly customized with 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.119
 your friends so first of all for 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.080
 start this click you're going to have to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.930
 do the one that will allow you 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.670
 to have the survival exoplanet to know 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.890
 that this one lasts a lot more 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.870
 for a long time than multiplayer 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.010
 for that we really need so 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.300
 first of all to start this glyph 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.430
 you will have to start a game 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.200
 of exodus survival in the local part it is 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.489
 really very important and once that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.860
 you will have launched it you will choose 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.390
 the light exo once you're in 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.820
 exile and manages you will ask your 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.190
 friend who is partly deprived of him in 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.780
 multiplayer invites you once he 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.789
 invited you to do a job 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.739
 exoplanets you will do menu ps 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.989
 then cross to validate his invitation 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.720
 and that will just put you 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.729
 in its public part so partly 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.200
 taken partly private forgiveness and a 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.119
 time you are in this home 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.280
 he'll just give you the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.600
 connection you have to be the host and a 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.799
 time you will be each other every 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.140
 players who will be in the game 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.200
 private will have the glitch of exoplanets 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.520
 which lasts as in survival so thanks to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.770
 this manipulation you will be able 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.390
 have fun really well with 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.860
 your friends since you will be able 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.420
 benefit from all the outputs of 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.640
 mapor all the spots normally 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.930
 unavailable and who will be there 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.060
 available 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.770
 thanks to this big so once you're 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.390
 rendered in the middle of the map you go 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.130
 having to do all the jump series 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.570
 and double jump and exoplanets as 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.310
 buddy so here's the ch is by train 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.410
 to film it like a bg yaris 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.140
 no problem and for my part it will be 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.000
 the same thing right after that so this is it 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.560
 which is really very very simple 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.630
 since we managed to do it 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.580
 both in a row finally me it's 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.410
 really very very simple so once 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.119
 that you will be in the middle of the map 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.190
 as you could see you go 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.110
 go up on the edge alone here you are 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.910
 go jump on the double right 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.600
 dash age jump towards this edge 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.130
 black 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.479
 from there you will do a double job and 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.209
 once there you will do jobs 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.890
 exoplanets you're going forward so far 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.830
 finally up to the middle and you go 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.510
 make soda ash next to the basket from there 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.440
 you're going to stick here you'll see 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.239
 that there is a barrier that will embarrass you 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.550
 desire double jam on then there you 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.140
 go do double jam dash in the direction 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.959
 of the gray part and that there is at the top 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.370
 to the left of the mini map and so to 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.770
 from that you will be able to do 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.000
 dash jumps on all parts 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.530
 gray and there is 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.150
 as I wanted to say on the mini map 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.440
 in the top left so once you 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.880
 are there you can go 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.500
 on the gray surface and that there is in 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.660
 face for my part I'll do a little 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.549
 shift and then here is bottom right 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.410
 you see that I came out of the map 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.540
 really very simply and by this 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.610
 place you will be able to reach the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.680
 pyramid finally the top of the pyramid 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.360
 just to have fun so 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.700
 for my part I show you in big 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.130
 how to access the pyramid one way 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.440
 more complicated but still 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.820
 simple finally here it's just for the 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.110
 fun to give you a little bit more 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.910
 difficulties for those who would be 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.430
 produced expensive so that's how we could 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.560
 see him so old his exoplanet daring 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.750
 dash ears in case 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.720
 dash to the ground and then from there you go 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.000
 to reach the aramid lacquer here 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.230
 as I meant so for my part 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.079
 I'll do the same thing again 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.090
 but I will go to the other side for 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.560
 So go on the kind of micro sky 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.350
 finally barrier of soil species 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.340
 invisible that there is outside the map 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.610
 so you're going on the arm 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.500
 metallic hot soda h iso plana 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.300
 and you will you drop on 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.440
 his arms you're going to do double job and 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.010
 once there you will have more than to do 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.140
 round 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.030
 very simply to reach so 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.010
 the species of only a visit there to 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.460
 really very very far all around 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.050
 the map 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.970
 so in any case I hope this 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.250
 Video leech have enjoyed you hesitate 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.360
 not to like to comment and why not 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.890
 to share it would make me really happy 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.940
 when to me I had it again 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.620
 the glitch hack and do it hoping 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.090
 that I like it here is the case I 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.800
 thank you forward and then I you 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.270
 see you next time for more videos 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.310
 which will arrive very soon on my 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.370
 chain had skies is low and all the 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.370
 world
