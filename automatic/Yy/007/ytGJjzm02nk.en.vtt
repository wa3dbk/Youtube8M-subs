it's very close to his front door and I

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.220 
it's very close to his front door and I
built<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.460> pile<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.390> built<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.079> there

built a pile on here I built it there

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.619 
built a pile on here I built it there
because<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:02.039> want<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.640> build<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.910> gateway<00:01:03.300> here

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
because I want to build a gateway here

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.410 
because I want to build a gateway here
and<00:01:03.870> another<00:01:04.170> gateway<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.159> if<00:01:06.030> he<00:01:06.270> was

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
and another gateway here and if he was

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.230 
and another gateway here and if he was
or<00:01:07.229> even<00:01:07.590> Protoss<00:01:08.280> then<00:01:08.760> he<00:01:08.850> wouldn't<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.150> able

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
or even Protoss then he wouldn't be able

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.810 
or even Protoss then he wouldn't be able

probes<00:01:16.920> till<00:01:17.220> you're<00:01:17.369> at<00:01:17.520> tin<00:01:17.909> supply<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
probes till you're at tin supply so you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.190 
probes till you're at tin supply so you
get<00:01:18.840> ten<00:01:19.049> probes<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:20.240> in<00:01:21.240> total<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
get ten probes and in total that is and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.170 
get ten probes and in total that is and
you<00:01:22.530> put<00:01:22.770> down<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> gateway<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.820> soon<00:01:24.000> as<00:01:24.119> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
you put down a gateway as soon as you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.260 
you put down a gateway as soon as you
can<00:01:24.420> after<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:25.409> pylons<00:01:25.799> done<00:01:26.009> pylon<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.060> ten

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
nevertheless you want to chrono boost

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.009 
nevertheless you want to chrono boost
your<00:02:32.340> first<00:02:33.150> sell<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.569> as<00:02:33.900> soon<00:02:34.230> as<00:02:34.349> you<00:02:34.470> can

this<00:02:37.019> rally<00:02:37.290> point<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.620> incorrect<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.220> want

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
this rally point is incorrect you want

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.330 
this rally point is incorrect you want
them<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.879> go<00:02:39.000> there<00:02:39.180> there<00:02:39.360> we<00:02:39.450> go<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:40.340> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
them to go there there we go and the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.069 
them to go there there we go and the
reason<00:02:41.489> why<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.790> do<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.390> because<00:02:42.510> you

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
reason why you do this is because you

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.680 
reason why you do this is because you
can<00:02:43.379> get<00:02:43.500> three<00:02:43.799> zealots<00:02:44.569> relatively<00:02:45.569> early

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
can get three zealots relatively early

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.690 
can get three zealots relatively early
because<00:02:45.959> just<00:02:46.680> about<00:02:46.769> when<00:02:47.099> this<00:02:47.250> salad<00:02:47.610> is

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
because just about when this salad is

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.059 
because just about when this salad is
finished<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.810> gateway<00:02:49.200> will<00:02:49.560> be<00:02:49.680> finished

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
finished this gateway will be finished

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.729 
finished this gateway will be finished
and<00:02:50.250> you'll<00:02:50.879> be<00:02:51.030> able<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.299> get<00:02:51.709> two<00:02:52.709> more

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
and you'll be able to get two more

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.410 
and you'll be able to get two more
zealots<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.459> then<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.700> have<00:02:53.790> three<00:02:54.060> zealots

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
zealots so then you have three zealots

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.839 
zealots so then you have three zealots
you<00:02:54.540> much<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.260> continue<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.190> chrono<00:02:56.549> boost

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
you much on and continue to chrono boost

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.170 
you much on and continue to chrono boost
the<00:02:57.060> others<00:02:57.329> down<00:02:57.480> itself<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:59.180> stream

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
the others down itself and to stream

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.740 
the others down itself and to stream
them<00:03:00.359> in<00:03:00.480> your<00:03:01.640> tin<00:03:02.640> probes<00:03:03.000> or<00:03:03.390> your<00:03:03.599> nine

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
them in your tin probes or your nine

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.750 
them in your tin probes or your nine
probes<00:03:04.079> back<00:03:04.319> home<00:03:04.560> will<00:03:04.829> be<00:03:04.980> perfect<00:03:05.549> amount
