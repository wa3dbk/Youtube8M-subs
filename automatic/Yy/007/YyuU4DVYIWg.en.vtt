so just keep destroying those two

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.830 
so just keep destroying those two

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
storages and once they're destroyed

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.719 
storages and once they're destroyed
you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.379> drop<00:01:04.559> some<00:01:04.769> archers<00:01:05.100> right<00:01:05.430> near<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
you can drop some archers right near the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.010 
you can drop some archers right near the
air<00:01:05.850> defense<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.420> they're<00:01:06.750> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> go

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
air defense and they're going to go

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.780 
air defense and they're going to go
ahead<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.500> start<00:01:08.189> destroying<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.670> air

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
ahead and start destroying the air

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.539 
ahead and start destroying the air
defense<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> mortars<00:01:10.530> are<00:01:10.680> locked<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.430> on

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
defense so the mortars are locked in on

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.800 
defense so the mortars are locked in on
the<00:01:11.640> archers<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.659> they're

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
the archers but as you can see they're

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.660 
the archers but as you can see they're
not<00:01:12.900> firing<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.830> reason<00:01:14.159> being<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
not firing the reason being is the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.789 
not firing the reason being is the
cannons<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.180> destroying<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> archers<00:01:16.110> too

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
cannons are destroying the archers too

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.620 
cannons are destroying the archers too
fast<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> mortars<00:01:18.210> are<00:01:18.330> you're<00:01:18.450> locking

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
fast so the mortars are you're locking

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.420 
fast so the mortars are you're locking
on<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.350> archers<00:01:19.650> are<00:01:19.770> dying<00:01:19.979> before

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
on but then the archers are dying before

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.770 
on but then the archers are dying before
they<00:01:20.790> can<00:01:20.939> actually<00:01:21.090> go<00:01:21.330> ahead<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.570> shoot<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
they can actually go ahead and shoot a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.929 
they can actually go ahead and shoot a
mortar<00:01:22.080> shell<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.159> long<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.640> keep<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
mortar shell so as long as you keep the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.429 
mortar shell so as long as you keep the
cannons<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.420> mortars<00:01:24.570> alive<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.259> don't

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
cannons and mortars alive and you don't

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.899 
cannons and mortars alive and you don't
go<00:01:25.560> crazy<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.189> destroy<00:01:26.430> them<00:01:26.610> or<00:01:26.700> anything

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
go crazy and destroy them or anything

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.719 
go crazy and destroy them or anything
