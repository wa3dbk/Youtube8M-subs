00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
anything another another thing we were

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.770 
anything another another thing we were
also<00:03:27.540> considering<00:03:28.050> was<00:03:28.350> peanut<00:03:29.070> butter<00:03:29.780> but

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
also considering was peanut butter but

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.330 
also considering was peanut butter but
then<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:30.959> was<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.440> would<00:03:31.590> think<00:03:31.770> that<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.130> can't

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
then I was I would think that you can't

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.060 
then I was I would think that you can't
have<00:03:32.520> peanut<00:03:32.880> butter<00:03:32.910> without<00:03:33.180> jelly<00:03:33.360> and

have peanut butter without jelly and

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.350 
have peanut butter without jelly and
then<00:03:35.070> we<00:03:35.190> kind<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.459> all<00:03:35.580> gotten<00:03:35.850> an<00:03:35.970> argument

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
then we kind of all gotten an argument

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.780 
then we kind of all gotten an argument
about<00:03:36.420> what<00:03:36.630> type<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.840> jelly<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.350> would<00:03:37.470> be<00:03:37.790> you
