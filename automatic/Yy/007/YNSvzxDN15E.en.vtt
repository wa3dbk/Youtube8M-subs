00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.569 
about it it is so good but the stuff -
it's<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:01.110> greasy<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.430> would

think<00:02:02.790> normal<00:02:03.270> oil<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.240> absorbs<00:02:06.240> right

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
think normal oil is so it absorbs right

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.130

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
it doesn't just stay on the outer layer

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.970 
it doesn't just stay on the outer layer
