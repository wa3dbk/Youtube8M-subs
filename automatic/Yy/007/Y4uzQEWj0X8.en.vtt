using<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.610> Cornell<00:00:36.270> method<00:00:36.480> because<00:00:37.290> it

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
using the Cornell method because it

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.610 
using the Cornell method because it
already<00:00:38.070> was<00:00:38.910> formatted<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.020> way<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.469> I

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
applied it to concept maps because

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.719 
applied it to concept maps because
that's<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.470> worked<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.159> me<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.430> today
