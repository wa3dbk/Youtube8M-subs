00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.940 
an optic group for the online mode which
is<00:02:55.650> just<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.880> crazy<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:59.320> can<00:02:59.470> have<00:02:59.560> crews

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
is just so crazy that you can have crews

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.320 
is just so crazy that you can have crews
online<00:03:01.890> if<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:03.100> don't<00:03:03.340> know<00:03:03.580> much<00:03:03.940> about<00:03:04.000> the

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
online if you don't know much about the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.730 
online if you don't know much about the
game<00:03:04.510> or<00:03:04.780> if<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.050> don't<00:03:05.230> think<00:03:05.410> you're<00:03:05.560> going

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
game or if you don't think you're going

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.560 
game or if you don't think you're going
to<00:03:05.770> be<00:03:05.890> getting<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:07.030> should<00:03:07.330> probably

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
to be getting it you should probably

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.600 
to be getting it you should probably
rethink<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:10.230> get<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.380> anyways<00:03:12.070> even<00:03:12.400> if

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
rethink that and get it anyways even if

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.940 
rethink that and get it anyways even if
you<00:03:12.790> don't<00:03:13.030> like<00:03:13.270> Grand<00:03:13.600> Theft<00:03:13.660> Auto<00:03:13.900> Wash<00:03:14.560> I

stars made do it and then maybe I'll be
a<00:03:42.820> little<00:03:43.270> bit<00:03:43.420> more<00:03:43.540> pessimistic<00:03:43.810> about<00:03:44.290> it

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
a little bit more pessimistic about it

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.590 
a little bit more pessimistic about it

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
it and apparently that's it sounds like

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.630

really<00:04:42.850> liked<00:04:43.060> sniping<00:04:43.570> in<00:04:43.660> black<00:04:43.840> ops<00:04:44.020> when<00:04:44.230> I

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
really liked sniping in black ops when I
