hardly even hearing yourself talk when
you're<00:02:29.820> listening<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.890> really

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
you're listening to it so and it really

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.330 
you're listening to it so and it really
it<00:02:33.840> really<00:02:33.870> does<00:02:34.440> bring<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.860> into<00:02:35.100> sort<00:02:35.310> of
