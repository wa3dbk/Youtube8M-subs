00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
now I did this about three four years

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.099 
now I did this about three four years
ago<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.650> worked<00:00:19.830> really<00:00:20.039> well<00:00:20.990> what<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.080> have

gonna do is we're gonna hook up to a
ladder<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:38.460> hose<00:00:38.700> like<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.180> I've<00:00:39.600> used

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
ladder the hose like this I've used

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.799 
ladder the hose like this I've used
bungee<00:00:40.170> cords<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.680> connect<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:42.570> pole

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
bungee cords to connect it to the pole

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.770 
bungee cords to connect it to the pole
from<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.789> broom<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:46.129> I<00:00:47.129> measured<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.149> about

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
from a broom and I measured it's about

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.880 
from a broom and I measured it's about
nine<00:00:49.020> feet<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.320> didn't<00:00:49.590> measure<00:00:49.680> that

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
nine feet I didn't measure that

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.160 
nine feet I didn't measure that
carefully<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> wasp<00:00:50.760> around<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.539> this

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
carefully with the wasp around and this

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.840 
carefully with the wasp around and this
is<00:00:52.289> adjustable<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:52.949> slide<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.699> or

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
is adjustable you can slide this up or

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.590 
is adjustable you can slide this up or
down<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:55.199> use<00:00:55.379> these<00:00:55.530> clamps<00:00:55.890> as

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
down and you just use these clamps as

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.020 
down and you just use these clamps as
necessary<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:58.039> move<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.190> once<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.879> place

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
necessary to move it once it's in place

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.400 
necessary to move it once it's in place
then<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.570> go<00:01:00.660> ahead<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.960> connect<00:01:01.260> this

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
then you go ahead and you connect this

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.479 
then you go ahead and you connect this
to<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> shop<00:01:02.699> back<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.409> turn<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.680> but

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
to the shop back and turn it on but

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.859 
to the shop back and turn it on but
rather<00:01:05.610> than<00:01:05.820> turn<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.210> from<00:01:06.390> right<00:01:06.630> there

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
rather than turn it on from right there

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:07.820 
rather than turn it on from right there
what<00:01:07.020> I'm<00:01:07.110> gonna<00:01:07.260> do<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.470> I'm<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> put

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to put

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.710 
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to put
this<00:01:07.979> wire<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.640> put<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.270> underneath<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
this wire and put it underneath the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.230 
this wire and put it underneath the
garage<00:01:10.140> door<00:01:10.650> there<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.010> just<00:01:11.729> plug<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.119> in

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
garage door there and just plug it in

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.499 
garage door there and just plug it in
when<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.680> place<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.280> let's

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
when it's when it's in place so let's

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.030 
when it's when it's in place so let's
let's<00:01:15.509> see<00:01:15.720> how<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:15.990> works<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.890> sort

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
let's see how this works so this is sort

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.749 
let's see how this works so this is sort
of<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.189> before<00:01:17.549> shot<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:20.070> activity<00:01:20.640> you

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
of a before shot of the the activity you

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.240 
of a before shot of the the activity you
can<00:01:20.909> see<00:01:21.090> they're<00:01:21.240> coming<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.080> at<00:01:22.830> least<00:01:22.979> one

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
can see they're coming in at least one

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.270 
can see they're coming in at least one
per<00:01:23.460> second<00:01:23.909> pretty<00:01:24.000> good<00:01:24.350> right<00:01:25.350> there<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
per second pretty good right there and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.499 
per second pretty good right there and
this<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.580> late<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.939> season<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.420> know

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
this is late in the season so I know

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.340 
this is late in the season so I know
they<00:01:27.630> tend<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> be<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> little<00:01:28.020> bit<00:01:28.200> more

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
they tend to be a little bit more

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.319 
they tend to be a little bit more
aggressive<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.520> I'm<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.090> wearing

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
aggressive so I'm going to be wearing

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.780 
aggressive so I'm going to be wearing
