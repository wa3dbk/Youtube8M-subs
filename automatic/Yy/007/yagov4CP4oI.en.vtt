00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
to the watch let's just see what we have

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.660 
to the watch let's just see what we have
a<00:01:36.799> packaging<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:38.180> it's<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.619> USB<00:01:40.619> connector<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
a packaging here it's a USB connector to

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.990 
a packaging here it's a USB connector to
recharge<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.509> guess<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.020> charger<00:01:43.500> here<00:01:44.000> this

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
recharge I guess the charger here this

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.649 
recharge I guess the charger here this
is<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> AC<00:01:46.280> wall<00:01:47.280> adapter<00:01:47.840> for<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.899> charger<00:01:50.659> and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
is a AC wall adapter for the charger and

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.780 
is a AC wall adapter for the charger and
then<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.590> looks<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.250> unit<00:01:53.610> that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
then this looks like the unit that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.170 
then this looks like the unit that
charges<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.290> watch<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.549> from<00:01:56.880> what<00:01:57.030> I've

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
charges the the watch so from what I've

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.380 
charges the the watch so from what I've
heard<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.719> about<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.290> two<00:01:58.320> days<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
heard you get about one to two days of

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.880 
heard you get about one to two days of
use<00:02:00.390> out<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.869> watch<00:02:01.110> before<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.680> need<00:02:01.799> to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
use out of this watch before you need to

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.459 
use out of this watch before you need to
charge<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.180> heard<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.869> does<00:02:03.990> not<00:02:04.140> take

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
charge it and I heard it does not take

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.880 
charge it and I heard it does not take
that<00:02:04.710> long<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.189> charge<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.790> fully<00:02:06.680> maybe<00:02:07.680> an

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
that long to charge it fully maybe an

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.140 
that long to charge it fully maybe an
hour<00:02:08.099> or<00:02:08.310> so

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.270 

they're<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:13.170> little<00:02:13.849> instruction<00:02:14.849> booklet

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280
