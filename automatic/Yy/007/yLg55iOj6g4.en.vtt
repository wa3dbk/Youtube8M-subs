it's<00:03:50.470> kind<00:03:50.680> of<00:03:50.740> funny<00:03:50.980> because<00:03:51.190> there<00:03:51.730> are

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
it's kind of funny because there are

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.570 
it's kind of funny because there are
aspects<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:53.290> quote<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:53.860> I<00:03:53.920> am<00:03:54.130> on<00:03:54.340> board

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.880 
aspects of that quote that I am on board
with<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:55.090> think<00:03:55.240> that<00:03:55.630> what<00:03:55.930> is<00:03:56.050> masculine<00:03:56.560> and

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
with I think that what is masculine and

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.070 
with I think that what is masculine and
what<00:03:57.010> is<00:03:57.130> feminine<00:03:57.580> is<00:03:57.820> very<00:03:58.060> subjective<00:03:58.330> and

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
what is feminine is very subjective and

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.890 
what is feminine is very subjective and
very<00:03:59.350> skewed<00:03:59.800> so<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:00.670> can<00:04:01.000> understand<00:04:01.600> and

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
very skewed so I can understand and

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.080 
very skewed so I can understand and
empathize<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.890> place<00:04:03.130> where<00:04:03.580> the<00:04:03.700> statement

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
empathize the place where the statement

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.240 
empathize the place where the statement
came<00:04:04.270> from<00:04:04.510> Rhonda<00:04:05.110> has<00:04:05.320> been<00:04:05.500> criticized<00:04:06.040> a

came from Rhonda has been criticized a

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.130 
came from Rhonda has been criticized a
lot<00:04:06.280> from<00:04:06.670> what<00:04:06.850> I<00:04:06.880> can<00:04:07.000> see<00:04:07.210> for<00:04:07.690> having<00:04:07.990> a

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
lot from what I can see for having a

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.650 
lot from what I can see for having a
masculine<00:04:08.980> body<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.820> that<00:04:10.120> comes<00:04:10.390> down<00:04:10.480> to

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
masculine body and that comes down to

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.380 
masculine body and that comes down to
how<00:04:11.080> we<00:04:11.680> as<00:04:11.860> a<00:04:11.890> society<00:04:12.010> have<00:04:12.820> a<00:04:13.060> lot<00:04:13.270> of

how we as a society have a lot of

they're stupid and they need to value
themselves<00:07:14.870> more<00:07:15.610> seems<00:07:16.610> like<00:07:16.759> a<00:07:16.789> double

00:07:17.049 --> 00:07:17.059 
themselves more seems like a double

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:19.239 
themselves more seems like a double
standard<00:07:17.629> to<00:07:17.749> me<00:07:17.930> what<00:07:18.469> do<00:07:18.529> you<00:07:18.589> think<00:07:18.889> Andrew

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:19.249 
standard to me what do you think Andrew

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:22.719 
standard to me what do you think Andrew
glasses<00:07:20.110> yep<00:07:21.139> it's<00:07:21.830> totally<00:07:22.309> a<00:07:22.339> double

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:22.729 
glasses yep it's totally a double

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:25.389 
glasses yep it's totally a double
standard<00:07:23.379> that's<00:07:24.379> what<00:07:24.499> I<00:07:24.529> thought<00:07:24.860> it's

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:25.399 
standard that's what I thought it's

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:27.429 
standard that's what I thought it's
obviously<00:07:25.939> a<00:07:26.059> very<00:07:26.169> complicated<00:07:27.169> and

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:27.439 
obviously a very complicated and

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:29.799 
obviously a very complicated and
intersectional<00:07:28.279> issue<00:07:28.490> but<00:07:29.120> I<00:07:29.149> do<00:07:29.269> think<00:07:29.749> that

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:29.809 
intersectional issue but I do think that

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:31.869 
intersectional issue but I do think that
it's<00:07:30.110> important<00:07:30.589> to<00:07:30.830> talk<00:07:31.099> about<00:07:31.159> and<00:07:31.430> address

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:31.879 
it's important to talk about and address

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:33.850 
it's important to talk about and address
these<00:07:32.089> things<00:07:32.360> when<00:07:32.870> they<00:07:33.019> come<00:07:33.139> up<00:07:33.349> instead
