actually<00:01:48.220> more<00:01:48.520> like<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.700> Gregorian<00:01:49.270> chant

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
actually more like a Gregorian chant

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.620 
actually more like a Gregorian chant
it's<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.900> real<00:01:50.110> low-pitched<00:01:50.710> growling<00:01:51.340> sound

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
every morning they do this and this is

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.070 
every morning they do this and this is
because<00:01:54.159> leaves<00:01:55.090> don't<00:01:55.509> give<00:01:55.659> you<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:55.780> lot<00:01:55.990> of

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
because leaves don't give you a lot of

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.719 
because leaves don't give you a lot of
energy<00:01:56.470> so<00:01:56.740> they<00:01:56.860> don't<00:01:57.040> like<00:01:57.159> to<00:01:57.280> expend<00:01:57.610> a

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
energy so they don't like to expend a

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.039 
energy so they don't like to expend a
lot<00:01:57.759> of<00:01:57.880> energy<00:01:58.030> so<00:01:58.450> they<00:01:58.540> don't<00:01:58.720> want<00:01:58.869> to<00:01:58.930> have

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
lot of energy so they don't want to have

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.260 
lot of energy so they don't want to have
to<00:01:59.140> fight<00:01:59.380> over<00:01:59.409> their<00:01:59.770> trees<00:02:00.040> so<00:02:00.880> first<00:02:01.119> thing

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
to fight over their trees so first thing

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.550 
to fight over their trees so first thing
in<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.420> morning<00:02:01.690> they<00:02:01.780> do<00:02:01.930> this<00:02:02.110> call<00:02:02.350> it's

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
in the morning they do this call it's

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.080 
in the morning they do this call it's
usually<00:02:02.680> done<00:02:02.979> around<00:02:03.130> 4:00<00:02:03.430> a.m.<00:02:03.729> or<00:02:03.880> just

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
usually done around 4:00 a.m. or just

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.230 
usually done around 4:00 a.m. or just
before<00:02:04.210> dawn<00:02:04.509> and<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:06.159> co<00:02:06.369> allows<00:02:06.790> all<00:02:07.119> the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
before dawn and the co allows all the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.580 
before dawn and the co allows all the
other<00:02:07.390> hallows<00:02:07.690> in<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.930> area<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.259> know<00:02:08.410> where

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
other hallows in the area to know where

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.990 
other hallows in the area to know where
they're<00:02:08.769> coming<00:02:08.979> from<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.550> where<00:02:09.700> they<00:02:09.820> are

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
they're coming from and where they are

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.970 
they're coming from and where they are
and<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:11.230> they<00:02:11.320> can<00:02:11.470> avoid<00:02:11.650> each<00:02:11.830> other<00:02:13.980> these

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
and so they can avoid each other these

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.310 
and so they can avoid each other these
guys<00:02:15.280> because<00:02:15.670> they<00:02:15.820> how<00:02:16.269> they<00:02:16.540> eat<00:02:16.840> greens

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
guys because they how they eat greens

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.509 
guys because they how they eat greens
and<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:17.650> they<00:02:17.739> don't<00:02:17.890> get<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> lot<00:02:18.100> of<00:02:18.220> energy

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
and so they don't get a lot of energy

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.759 
and so they don't get a lot of energy
they<00:02:19.180> spend<00:02:19.480> most<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.840> their<00:02:19.930> time<00:02:19.989> about<00:02:20.350> 85%

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
they spend most of their time about 85%

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.840 
they spend most of their time about 85%
of<00:02:21.100> waking<00:02:21.700> time<00:02:21.940> resting<00:02:22.360> or<00:02:22.840> sleeping<00:02:23.850> and

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
of waking time resting or sleeping and

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.400 
of waking time resting or sleeping and
that<00:02:24.940> is<00:02:25.120> because<00:02:25.480> they<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:26.019> don't<00:02:26.230> they

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
that is because they just don't they

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.840 
that is because they just don't they
don't<00:02:26.680> have<00:02:26.860> energy<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.400> they<00:02:27.459> don't<00:02:27.610> have<00:02:27.730> to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
don't have energy and they don't have to

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.550 
don't have energy and they don't have to
hunt<00:02:28.030> for<00:02:28.150> their<00:02:28.269> food<00:02:28.450> they<00:02:28.930> they<00:02:29.260> get<00:02:29.380> in<00:02:29.500> a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
hunt for their food they they get in a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.900 
hunt for their food they they get in a
tree<00:02:29.769> and<00:02:29.980> they<00:02:30.069> just<00:02:30.250> eat<00:02:30.400> as<00:02:30.519> much<00:02:30.670> as<00:02:30.790> they

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
tree and they just eat as much as they

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.160 
tree and they just eat as much as they
can<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.360> then<00:02:31.480> they<00:02:31.569> spit<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.840> rest<00:02:31.989> of<00:02:32.080> the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
can and then they spit the rest of the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.910 
can and then they spit the rest of the
time<00:02:32.319> resting<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.720> these<00:02:34.840> guys<00:02:35.110> are<00:02:35.170> all<00:02:35.500> born

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
time resting so these guys are all born

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.030 
time resting so these guys are all born
gold<00:02:36.370> like<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.850> females<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:38.110> then<00:02:38.650> at<00:02:38.769> 2<00:02:38.920> and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
gold like the females and then at 2 and

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.160 
gold like the females and then at 2 and
1/2<00:02:39.160> years<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.610> age<00:02:39.760> at<00:02:40.299> sexual<00:02:40.660> maturity<00:02:40.870> the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
1/2 years of age at sexual maturity the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.550 
1/2 years of age at sexual maturity the
male's<00:02:41.350> will<00:02:41.560> turn<00:02:41.739> black<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:44.200> sounds<00:02:44.440> a

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
male's will turn black and that sounds a

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.380 
male's will turn black and that sounds a
very<00:02:44.860> good<00:02:45.040> visual<00:02:45.340> cue<00:02:45.549> for<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.850> females<00:02:46.209> to

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
very good visual cue for the females to

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.300 
very good visual cue for the females to
know<00:02:46.540> when<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.930> when<00:02:47.200> their<00:02:47.350> sons<00:02:47.620> are<00:02:47.769> old

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
know when the when their sons are old

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.430 
know when the when their sons are old
enough<00:02:48.579> and<00:02:48.790> also<00:02:49.630> for<00:02:49.870> females<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.320> are

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
enough and also for females that are

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.350 
enough and also for females that are
looking<00:02:50.799> for<00:02:50.980> mates<00:02:51.130> can<00:02:51.579> tell<00:02:51.760> when<00:02:52.000> when<00:02:52.329> a

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
looking for mates can tell when when a

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:10.110 
looking for mates can tell when when a
male<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:52.810> appropriate<00:02:53.440> for<00:02:53.620> them
