00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
old-school headlight like you're drawing

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.640 
old-school headlight like you're drawing
some<00:00:08.340> kind<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.639> muscle<00:00:08.880> car<00:00:09.150> headlight<00:00:09.650> you

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
some kind of muscle car headlight you

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.499 
some kind of muscle car headlight you
know<00:00:10.740> you're<00:00:10.889> gonna<00:00:10.980> have<00:00:11.219> your<00:00:11.509> circular

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
know you're gonna have your circular

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.600 
know you're gonna have your circular
headlight<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.170> back<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.309> gonna<00:00:14.400> be

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
headlight in the back this is gonna be

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.150 
headlight in the back this is gonna be
some<00:00:14.849> kind<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.089> bulb<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.599> then<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.920> just

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
some kind of bulb and then this is just

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.200 
some kind of bulb and then this is just
a<00:00:17.279> giant<00:00:17.520> smooth<00:00:18.260> reverse<00:00:19.970> scoop<00:00:20.970> like<00:00:21.150> a

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
a giant smooth reverse scoop like a

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.570 
a giant smooth reverse scoop like a
spoon<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.810> then<00:00:22.470> usually<00:00:23.130> there's<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.400> light

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
spoon and then usually there's a light

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.640 
spoon and then usually there's a light
texture<00:00:24.029> over<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.480> front<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.960> like<00:00:25.590> that

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
texture over the front of it like that

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.769 
texture over the front of it like that
and<00:00:26.070> then<00:00:26.609> there's<00:00:26.820> lines<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.269> go<00:00:27.359> like<00:00:27.539> this

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
and then there's lines that go like this

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.580 
and then there's lines that go like this
but<00:00:28.619> they're<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:29.330> all<00:00:30.330> equal<00:00:31.019> they're<00:00:31.410> kind

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
but they're not all equal they're kind

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.319 
but they're not all equal they're kind
of<00:00:31.710> go<00:00:31.830> at<00:00:32.369> different<00:00:32.730> points<00:00:33.770> across<00:00:34.770> these

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
of go at different points across these

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.729 
of go at different points across these
vertical<00:00:36.329> lines<00:00:36.360> all<00:00:37.170> right<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.440> that's<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
vertical lines all right so that's the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.369 
vertical lines all right so that's the
gist<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> um<00:00:38.460> what<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.000> would<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.300> first<00:00:39.570> is

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
gist of it um what I would do first is

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.740 
gist of it um what I would do first is
get<00:00:40.710> out<00:00:40.920> my<00:00:41.450> black<00:00:42.450> marker<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:44.629> just<00:00:45.629> do<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
get out my black marker and just do a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.290 
get out my black marker and just do a
quick<00:00:45.960> outline<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:49.520> top<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.969> just

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
quick outline of the top of it and just

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.970 
quick outline of the top of it and just
a<00:00:51.390> little<00:00:51.510> bit<00:00:51.719> right<00:00:51.930> there<00:00:52.140> where<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> bulb

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
a little bit right there where the bulb

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.520 
a little bit right there where the bulb
is<00:00:53.539> then<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> would<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.050> go<00:00:55.199> right<00:00:55.379> to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
is then what I would do is go right to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.650 
is then what I would do is go right to
my<00:00:55.559> chalk<00:00:57.770> hopefully<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.859> know<00:00:58.980> about<00:00:59.660> using

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
my chalk hopefully you know about using

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.660 
my chalk hopefully you know about using
chalk<00:01:01.730> in<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.830> tutorials<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.460> do

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
chalk in the in the tutorials that we do

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.330 
chalk in the in the tutorials that we do
so<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.659> ripped<00:01:06.840> some<00:01:07.020> off<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.200> my<00:01:07.500> magic

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
so I just ripped some off of my magic

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.920 
so I just ripped some off of my magic
toilet<00:01:08.520> paper<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.299> scoop<00:01:09.510> some<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.840> that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
toilet paper one to scoop some of that

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.830 
toilet paper one to scoop some of that
blue<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.159> then<00:01:11.580> remember<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.270> bottom<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
blue and then remember the bottom of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.440 
blue and then remember the bottom of
this<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.530> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.860> reflect<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.430> which<00:01:15.299> is

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
this it's going to reflect up which is

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.940 
this it's going to reflect up which is
where<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> sky<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.409> would<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:16.799> put

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
where the sky is so I would just put

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.740 
where the sky is so I would just put
some<00:01:17.159> blue<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.520> there<00:01:18.590> like<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:20.689> then<00:01:21.689> I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
some blue in there like that then I

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.679 
some blue in there like that then I
would<00:01:21.900> get<00:01:22.470> some<00:01:22.680> brown<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.479> same

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
would get some brown and do the same

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.530 
would get some brown and do the same
thing<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> other<00:01:25.380> side<00:01:26.330> reflecting<00:01:27.330> down

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
thing for the other side reflecting down

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.730 
thing for the other side reflecting down
like<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:29.420> then<00:01:30.420> kind<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> tough<00:01:31.439> part

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
like that then kind of the tough part

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.600 
like that then kind of the tough part
here<00:01:32.509> well<00:01:33.509> first<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.840> would<00:01:33.960> go<00:01:34.049> back<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
here well first I would go back and

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.230 
here well first I would go back and
erase<00:01:35.610> some<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:37.759> remember<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:39.150> gonna

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
erase some of that remember it's gonna

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.210 
erase some of that remember it's gonna
be<00:01:39.479> mostly<00:01:39.810> white<00:01:40.140> rendering<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> headlight

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
be mostly white rendering a headlight

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.880 
be mostly white rendering a headlight
it's<00:01:41.460> gonna<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.759> mostly<00:01:41.909> white<00:01:42.479> space<00:01:42.829> but<00:01:43.829> I'm

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
it's gonna be mostly white space but I'm

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.300 
it's gonna be mostly white space but I'm
gonna<00:01:43.979> go<00:01:44.130> ahead<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.310> add<00:01:45.979> just<00:01:46.979> kind<00:01:47.250> of

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
gonna go ahead and add just kind of

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.210 
gonna go ahead and add just kind of
these<00:01:47.790> lines<00:01:48.149> or<00:01:48.390> represent<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.649> horizon

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
these lines or represent the horizon

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.289 
these lines or represent the horizon
line<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:52.640> they're<00:01:53.640> gonna<00:01:53.729> look<00:01:53.909> something

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
line and they're gonna look something

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.069 
line and they're gonna look something
like<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:56.420> then<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.540> might<00:01:57.719> even<00:01:57.899> go<00:01:58.049> back

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
like this and then I might even go back

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.789 
like this and then I might even go back
and<00:01:58.469> add<00:01:59.540> get<00:02:00.540> my<00:02:00.659> black<00:02:00.899> marker<00:02:03.619> and<00:02:04.619> just

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
and add get my black marker and just

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.730 
and add get my black marker and just
throw<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.189> some<00:02:05.219> more

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
throw in some more

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.669 
throw in some more
more<00:02:07.340> of<00:02:07.460> those<00:02:07.640> references<00:02:08.410> maybe<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.500> few

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
more of those references maybe a few

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.690 
more of those references maybe a few
dots<00:02:09.860> like<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.500> think<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:12.560> could<00:02:12.710> probably

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
dots like that I think I could probably

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.070 
dots like that I think I could probably
darken<00:02:14.450> up<00:02:14.570> this<00:02:15.380> uh<00:02:16.300> this<00:02:17.300> is<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.510> prism<00:02:17.990> of

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
darken up this uh this is a prism of

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.380 
darken up this uh this is a prism of
color<00:02:18.200> stick<00:02:18.770> I<00:02:19.060> could<00:02:20.060> just<00:02:20.240> use<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:22.390> maybe

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
color stick I could just use that maybe

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.850 
color stick I could just use that maybe
just<00:02:23.600> blur<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.900> out<00:02:24.020> like<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.410> little<00:02:24.709> bit

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
just blur it out like that a little bit

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.070 
just blur it out like that a little bit
but<00:02:25.730> then<00:02:25.850> what<00:02:25.970> we've<00:02:26.120> got<00:02:26.330> are<00:02:26.480> these<00:02:26.630> these

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
but then what we've got are these these

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.610 
but then what we've got are these these
vertical<00:02:27.590> lines<00:02:27.860> with<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.110> with<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.230> texture

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
vertical lines with the with the texture

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.340 
vertical lines with the with the texture
on<00:02:30.770> them<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:31.910> would<00:02:32.180> maybe<00:02:32.330> just<00:02:32.630> bring

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
on them so I would maybe just bring

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.699 
on them so I would maybe just bring
those<00:02:33.590> back<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.890> little<00:02:34.160> bit<00:02:34.310> more<00:02:35.200> like<00:02:36.200> that

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.440 

add<00:02:39.709> those<00:02:40.070> textures<00:02:40.610> like<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:44.330> then

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
add those textures like that and then

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.410 
add those textures like that and then
bring<00:02:44.930> in<00:02:45.020> my<00:02:45.140> white<00:02:45.350> pencil<00:02:46.090> see<00:02:47.090> if<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.239> could

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
bring in my white pencil see if I could

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.340 
bring in my white pencil see if I could
blend<00:02:47.690> some<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:47.989> these<00:02:48.340> like<00:02:49.340> that<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:50.350> then

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
blend some of these like that and then

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.580 
blend some of these like that and then
it's<00:02:51.500> time<00:02:51.680> for<00:02:51.739> as<00:02:52.459> always<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.380> magic<00:02:54.380> white

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
it's time for as always the magic white

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.690 
it's time for as always the magic white
paint<00:02:55.330> mixed<00:02:56.330> 50%<00:02:56.959> with<00:02:57.140> water<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:57.860> think<00:02:58.550> we're

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
paint mixed 50% with water I think we're

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.310 
paint mixed 50% with water I think we're
going<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.880> need<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.030> little<00:02:59.239> bit<00:02:59.360> more<00:03:02.320> water

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
going to need a little bit more water

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:10.449 
going to need a little bit more water
there<00:03:05.620> so<00:03:06.620> we'll<00:03:06.770> get<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:06.950> ready<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:10.370> I'm

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
there so we'll get that ready and I'm

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.229 
there so we'll get that ready and I'm
going<00:03:10.550> to<00:03:10.610> add<00:03:11.260> pop<00:03:12.260> right<00:03:12.470> here<00:03:13.180> bringing<00:03:14.180> the

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
going to add pop right here bringing the

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.300 
going to add pop right here bringing the
pop<00:03:14.420> out<00:03:14.630> followed<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.530> horizon<00:03:16.010> line<00:03:16.160> and

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
pop out followed the horizon line and

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.360 
pop out followed the horizon line and
then<00:03:17.090> I'm<00:03:17.180> going<00:03:17.299> to<00:03:17.330> actually<00:03:17.630> let<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.840> follow

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
then I'm going to actually let it follow

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:27.000 
then I'm going to actually let it follow
some<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.400> these<00:03:22.450> horizontal<00:03:23.450> areas<00:03:25.390> like<00:03:26.390> that

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
some of these horizontal areas like that

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.320 
some of these horizontal areas like that
and<00:03:28.010> then<00:03:28.400> bring<00:03:28.580> it<00:03:28.670> around<00:03:28.790> for<00:03:29.090> some<00:03:29.239> of

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
and then bring it around for some of

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.570 
and then bring it around for some of
those<00:03:29.420> textures<00:03:29.890> so<00:03:30.890> this<00:03:31.040> time<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:31.280> would<00:03:31.430> draw

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
those textures so this time I would draw

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.560 
those textures so this time I would draw
an<00:03:31.790> antique<00:03:32.239> light<00:03:32.480> like<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.750> muscle-car<00:03:33.140> light
