00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
catch on pretty quick I mean I'm not

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.460 
catch on pretty quick I mean I'm not
they're<00:01:06.150> not<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.540> hundred<00:01:06.630> percent<00:01:06.990> there

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
they're not a hundred percent there

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.649 
they're not a hundred percent there
they're<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.220> maybe<00:01:08.880> ninety<00:01:09.450> five<00:01:09.600> percent

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
they're out maybe ninety five percent

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.969 
they're out maybe ninety five percent
right<00:01:10.470> now<00:01:11.450> letter<00:01:12.450> training<00:01:12.810> there<00:01:13.799> are

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
right now letter training there are

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.690 
right now letter training there are
times<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.610> catch<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.560> continue<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
times I catch it and I just continue to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.130 
times I catch it and I just continue to
show<00:01:18.150> them<00:01:18.390> where<00:01:18.600> they're<00:01:18.780> supposed<00:01:18.900> to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
show them where they're supposed to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.570 
show them where they're supposed to
litter<00:01:19.380> trained<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:21.320> it<00:01:22.320> takes<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.799> while<00:01:22.979> it's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
litter trained and it takes a while it's

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.510 
litter trained and it takes a while it's
not<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.210> not<00:01:24.600> overnight<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:26.100> sometimes

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
not it's not overnight you sometimes

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.609 
not it's not overnight you sometimes
rats<00:01:26.850> earn<00:01:27.090> will<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> overnight<00:01:28.259> they're

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
rats earn will do it overnight they're

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.960 
rats earn will do it overnight they're
not<00:01:28.770> stubborn<00:01:30.860> but<00:01:31.860> that's<00:01:32.040> basically<00:01:32.220> that's

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
not stubborn but that's basically that's

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.200 
not stubborn but that's basically that's
the<00:01:33.180> basics<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.780> how<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.530> um<00:01:35.030> it's<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the basics of how I do it um it's a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.569 
the basics of how I do it um it's a
little<00:01:36.479> neat<00:01:36.930> tactic<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:39.030> works<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:40.579> it's

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
little neat tactic and it works and it's

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.340 
little neat tactic and it works and it's
starting<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.970> work<00:01:42.180> Spartan<00:01:42.810> starting<00:01:43.259> to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
starting to work Spartan starting to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.940 
starting to work Spartan starting to
show<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.100> working<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:45.710> hopefully<00:01:46.710> I'll

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
show that it's working so hopefully I'll

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.569 
show that it's working so hopefully I'll
have<00:01:47.189> these<00:01:47.490> two<00:01:47.909> litter<00:01:48.180> trained<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.689> no<00:01:48.840> time

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
have these two litter trained in no time

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:57.830 
have these two litter trained in no time
um<00:01:52.220> they<00:01:53.220> are<00:01:54.140> very<00:01:55.140> stubborn<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.509> they<00:01:57.509> don't

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
um they are very stubborn and they don't

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.139 
um they are very stubborn and they don't
want<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.469> learn<00:01:59.390> now<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> but<00:02:02.790> that's<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
want to learn now so but that's the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.260 
want to learn now so but that's the
basics<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.750> litter<00:02:04.079> training<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.130> okay<00:02:05.790> thank

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
basics of litter training so okay thank

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.360 
basics of litter training so okay thank
you
