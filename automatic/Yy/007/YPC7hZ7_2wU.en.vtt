hi<00:00:16.029> this<00:00:16.090> is<00:00:16.240> the<00:00:16.420> autonomous<00:00:16.720> of<00:00:16.869> Bolander

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
hi this is the autonomous of Bolander

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.140 
hi this is the autonomous of Bolander
planet<00:00:17.470> calm<00:00:17.890> today<00:00:18.580> I<00:00:18.610> have<00:00:18.789> for<00:00:18.940> you<00:00:18.970> the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
planet calm today I have for you the

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.410 
planet calm today I have for you the
2009<00:00:19.810> air<00:00:20.110> raid<00:00:20.350> from<00:00:20.529> bo<00:00:20.740> tech<00:00:21.039> I<00:00:21.789> thought<00:00:22.270> was

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
2009 air raid from bo tech I thought was

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.750 
2009 air raid from bo tech I thought was
important<00:00:22.750> to<00:00:22.840> show<00:00:23.020> to<00:00:23.080> you<00:00:23.260> the<00:00:23.800> 2009<00:00:24.400> model

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
important to show to you the 2009 model

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.150 
important to show to you the 2009 model
the<00:00:25.420> 2010<00:00:26.080> we<00:00:26.289> will<00:00:26.410> have<00:00:26.560> shortly<00:00:26.980> but

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
the 2010 we will have shortly but

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.349 
the 2010 we will have shortly but
there's<00:00:27.490> not<00:00:27.609> much<00:00:27.760> difference<00:00:27.880> between<00:00:28.240> this

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
there's not much difference between this

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.179 
there's not much difference between this
one<00:00:28.570> and<00:00:28.600> that<00:00:28.750> one<00:00:28.869> so<00:00:29.560> I<00:00:29.590> figured<00:00:29.980> I'd<00:00:30.070> just

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
one and that one so I figured I'd just

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.099 
one and that one so I figured I'd just
show<00:00:30.400> you<00:00:30.490> this<00:00:30.640> one<00:00:30.699> and<00:00:31.210> you<00:00:31.689> actually<00:00:31.990> might

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:32.109 
show you this one and you actually might

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:33.270 
show you this one and you actually might
be<00:00:32.140> able<00:00:32.259> find<00:00:32.410> a<00:00:32.529> good<00:00:32.680> deal<00:00:32.829> on<00:00:32.950> this<00:00:33.100> right

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
be able find a good deal on this right

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.970 
be able find a good deal on this right
now<00:00:33.309> because<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:34.000> 2010's<00:00:34.660> are<00:00:34.750> coming<00:00:34.989> out<00:00:35.110> so

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
now because the 2010's are coming out so

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.340 
now because the 2010's are coming out so
I<00:00:36.010> might<00:00:36.489> be<00:00:36.520> worth<00:00:36.760> picking<00:00:37.000> up<00:00:37.210> for<00:00:37.480> you

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
I might be worth picking up for you

they<00:01:06.130> called<00:01:06.369> the<00:01:06.490> velvet<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:07.090> it<00:01:07.509> feels<00:01:07.749> like

00:01:07.949 --> 00:01:07.959 
they called the velvet and it feels like

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:09.510

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
actually really neat and you can feel it

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.160 
actually really neat and you can feel it
like<00:01:12.240> pretty<00:01:13.240> much<00:01:13.270> all<00:01:13.539> over<00:01:13.749> the<00:01:13.869> whole<00:01:13.990> body

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
like pretty much all over the whole body

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.550 
like pretty much all over the whole body
of<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.439> riser<00:01:15.009> and<00:01:15.899> it<00:01:16.899> actually<00:01:17.049> makes<00:01:17.349> for<00:01:17.529> a

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
of the riser and it actually makes for a

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.249 
of the riser and it actually makes for a
really<00:01:17.679> nice<00:01:18.509> grip<00:01:19.509> when<00:01:19.899> you're<00:01:19.990> trying<00:01:20.200> to

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
really nice grip when you're trying to

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.760 
really nice grip when you're trying to
hold<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.529> bow<00:01:20.679> I<00:01:22.170> wanted<00:01:23.170> to<00:01:23.229> show<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.529> site<00:01:23.740> a

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
hold the bow I wanted to show the site a

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.230 
hold the bow I wanted to show the site a
little<00:01:23.979> bit<00:01:24.189> because<00:01:24.340> if<00:01:24.579> there's<00:01:24.819> something

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
little bit because if there's something

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.480 
little bit because if there's something
out<00:01:25.359> it<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:25.539> wanted<00:01:25.810> to<00:01:25.929> show<00:01:26.170> off<00:01:26.380> here<00:01:26.709> on<00:01:27.189> this

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
out it I wanted to show off here on this

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.279 
out it I wanted to show off here on this
light<00:01:27.789> actually<00:01:28.509> it<00:01:28.569> has<00:01:28.659> a<00:01:28.779> magnet<00:01:29.259> that

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
light actually it has a magnet that

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.499 
light actually it has a magnet that
holds<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.799> and<00:01:29.889> it<00:01:29.950> comes<00:01:30.099> right<00:01:30.219> off<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.479> I

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
holds it and it comes right off so I

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.429 
holds it and it comes right off so I
thought<00:01:31.539> that<00:01:31.779> was<00:01:31.840> pretty<00:01:32.079> unique<00:01:32.409> because

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
thought that was pretty unique because

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.109 
thought that was pretty unique because
these<00:01:33.099> little<00:01:33.310> magnets<00:01:33.609> are<00:01:33.759> going<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:33.939> hold

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
these little magnets are going to hold

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.089 
these little magnets are going to hold
it<00:01:34.240> on<00:01:34.359> and<00:01:34.959> you<00:01:35.169> could<00:01:35.289> put<00:01:35.439> it<00:01:35.469> on<00:01:35.649> over<00:01:35.799> the

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:36.099 
it on and you could put it on over the

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:37.949 
it on and you could put it on over the
cap<00:01:36.700> here<00:01:36.999> and<00:01:37.209> then<00:01:37.299> just<00:01:37.479> turn<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.749> light<00:01:37.929> on

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:37.959 
cap here and then just turn the light on

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:40.800 
cap here and then just turn the light on
and<00:01:38.649> then<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:38.859> get<00:01:38.979> your<00:01:39.130> light<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.630> they're

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
and then you get your light and they're

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.969 
and then you get your light and they're
they're<00:01:41.409> pretty<00:01:41.439> bright<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:43.709> well<00:01:44.709> anyhow

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
they're pretty bright and well anyhow

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.459 
they're pretty bright and well anyhow
when<00:01:45.369> you're<00:01:45.520> hunting<00:01:45.779> you<00:01:46.779> know<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.229> would

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
when you're hunting you know I would

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.080 
when you're hunting you know I would
recommend<00:01:47.859> popping<00:01:48.219> this<00:01:48.340> off<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.789> put<00:01:48.819> it<00:01:48.999> in

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
recommend popping this off and put it in

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.269 
recommend popping this off and put it in
a<00:01:49.179> zipper<00:01:49.539> or<00:01:49.569> your<00:01:49.929> pocket<00:01:50.380> because<00:01:50.679> this

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:51.279 
a zipper or your pocket because this

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:53.039 
a zipper or your pocket because this
this<00:01:51.609> will<00:01:51.880> come<00:01:52.060> off<00:01:52.239> for<00:01:52.450> sure<00:01:52.659> if<00:01:52.779> you<00:01:52.869> hit<00:01:53.020> a

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
this will come off for sure if you hit a

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.899 
this will come off for sure if you hit a
branch<00:01:53.259> there's<00:01:54.009> really<00:01:54.130> nothing<00:01:54.459> to<00:01:54.489> stop<00:01:54.759> it

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
branch there's really nothing to stop it

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.929 
branch there's really nothing to stop it
from<00:01:54.999> just<00:01:55.299> hitting<00:01:56.139> and<00:01:56.319> falling<00:01:56.679> so<00:01:57.309> I<00:01:57.639> think

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
from just hitting and falling so I think

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.969 
from just hitting and falling so I think
