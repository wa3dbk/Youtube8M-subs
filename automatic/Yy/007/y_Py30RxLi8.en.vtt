 resolution of 1024 x 768 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.330
 it works better in this too 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.609
 Price class for example when google 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.610
 nexus 7 for 189 euros 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.140
 The further equipment is great on 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.760
 upper edge is the camera lens 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.350
 Pictures are with 2 megapixels 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.920
 recorded for video chats that is enough 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.050
 all 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.570
 The housing is nine millimeters 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.040
 pretty flat located on the side 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.320
 yourself the power button and the same 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.969
 including the volume bet on the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.520
 upper edge sits the headphone output 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.640
 the micro usb connection for charging 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.890
 slot for memory cards 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.360
 an infrared sensor which the lifetab for 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.090
 Remote control power and the speaker 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.609
 The microphone has medion at the bottom 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.379
 built-in edge 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.470
 the back of the lifetab consists of 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.299
 Metal at the top sits a reset button 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.470
 and also the built-in 5 megapixels 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.299
 Camera for snapshots 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.619
 also there are the once again 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.600
 Designation all connections 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.009
 thanks to the metal case that feels 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.810
 lifetab very high quality 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.210
 the display is not state 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.000
 of the art you can also see everyone 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.520
 fingerprint the built-in quad core 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.600
 processor with 1 6 gigahertz ensures 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.180
 a liquid operation of the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.740
 Android tablets have additional menus 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.340
 appear through short vision about the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.229
 screen 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.970
 on the left is shown for example which 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.680
 music is played and hides right 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.110
 the quick start menu with important 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.670
 Features will be all apps 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.880
 clearly presented how to do it 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.979
 stop by google operating system knows about 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.020
 the lifetab is the android version 4.4 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.640
 So kitkat installed medium has on 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.409
 the lifetab a few exclusive apps 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.909
 pre-installed, for example, live 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.549
 player for playing music and 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.640
 videos and to view images that 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.540
 menu of application is very simple 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.460
 Unfortunately, the app does not 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.500
 automatically the pieces of music I do 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.830
 previously by usb directly on the tablet 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.540
 I have to transfer the albums first 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.060
 awkward in the depths of memory 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.860
 search 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.130
 before I can play it and that 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.810
 annoying that this is easier 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.060
 shows for example the free google 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.530
 app play music 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.750
 If I become the state immediately all 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.130
 saved everything and I saved 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.130
 I can choose my music directly 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.099
 to play videos is about the live 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.900
 player just as awkward 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.430
 Once again I have to do that 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.239
 find the right folder and then the 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.130
 select movie 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.120
 Here is then again the relative 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.640
 low resolution of the display 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.319
 obviously and also with the live 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.319
 Player has certainly not medion 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.060
 glorious that they are around 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.680
 tablet is exclusively for aldi 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.720
 is available you can see the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.970
 preinstalled applications so takes 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.260
 a widget with current offers of the 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.510
 discounters a large part of 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.190
 displays a 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.650
 besides there is one with media togo 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.870
 mediathek with video podcast an app for 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.620
 the media online shop and more aldi 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.970
 offers of course still standards 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.470
 like skype ebay and a virus scanner 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.130
 A closer look is worth the app 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.650
 softmaker this is a 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.209
 full office package even if it 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.890
 it looks like it's just starting out 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.880
 I can easily use the home computer with it 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.040
 write texts 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.600
 and also use the swype function 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.739
 with which I wipe words through 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.870
 The keyboard disc is quite amusing 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.130
 the pre-installed app sign pad with 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.989
 the pictures can paint 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.540
 For that we stand different pens and 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.739
 Brush in many colors available 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.060
 Unfortunately, the line thickness can not be 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.019
 but change for a few sketches 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.010
 It is especially enough for children to be there 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.720
 to have your pleasure 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.510
 especially as you see the pictures with colorful stickers 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.160
 can beautify even further 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.440
 medion's lifetab is a solid one 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.970
 android device for beginners the low 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.230
 However, price can not be over the moderate 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.420
 hide display 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.859
 and the preinstalled software is 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.260
 not only largely unnecessary 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.260
 but in some cases annoying
