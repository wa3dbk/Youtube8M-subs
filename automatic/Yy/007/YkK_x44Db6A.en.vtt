00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
freaking myself out of it because I

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.180 
freaking myself out of it because I
slightly<00:04:30.240> look<00:04:30.660> like<00:04:30.960> that<00:04:31.169> yellow<00:04:31.440> glob<00:04:31.890> guy

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190

from<00:04:32.520> Sin<00:04:32.790> City

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
from Sin City

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.409 
from Sin City
so<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.560> weighed<00:04:34.890> about<00:04:34.919> 10<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.490> 15<00:04:35.850> minutes<00:04:36.180> for

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
so I weighed about 10 to 15 minutes for

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.080 
so I weighed about 10 to 15 minutes for
the<00:04:36.540> mask<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:37.200> dry<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:37.820> honestly<00:04:38.820> I<00:04:38.850> don't

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
the mask to dry and honestly I don't

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.240 
the mask to dry and honestly I don't
like<00:04:39.510> to<00:04:39.660> let<00:04:39.780> it<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:40.050> dry<00:04:40.260> completely<00:04:40.800> because

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
like to let it to dry completely because

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.310 
like to let it to dry completely because
it<00:04:41.280> causes<00:04:41.640> more<00:04:42.150> dryness<00:04:42.480> to<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.900> skin<00:04:43.169> and

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
it causes more dryness to the skin and

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.550 
it causes more dryness to the skin and
it<00:04:43.980> kind<00:04:44.160> of<00:04:44.190> makes<00:04:44.370> my<00:04:44.490> face<00:04:44.700> edge<00:04:45.530> now<00:04:46.530> I

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
it kind of makes my face edge now I

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.650
