00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
plugin so right there and then I have my

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.180 
plugin so right there and then I have my
bow<00:03:21.820> if<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.300> shoot<00:03:22.690> right<00:03:23.170> now<00:03:23.320> it's<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.650> bug<00:03:23.920> so

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
bow if I shoot right now it's a bug so

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.250 
bow if I shoot right now it's a bug so
it<00:03:24.250> won't<00:03:24.430> actually<00:03:24.580> explode<00:03:25.269> but<00:03:25.690> if<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:25.959> find

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
a mob and shoot it it will explode so

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.860 
a mob and shoot it it will explode so
let's<00:03:28.810> spawn<00:03:29.440> some<00:03:30.430> spiders<00:03:31.120> here<00:03:31.390> right<00:03:31.630> here

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
didn't follow so they didn't die but let

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:44.509 
didn't follow so they didn't die but let
me<00:03:44.050> try<00:03:44.200> again

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
me try again

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.190 
me try again
die<00:03:45.519> Oh<00:03:45.820> get<00:03:46.480> away<00:03:46.570> from<00:03:46.690> me<00:03:46.900> Oh

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.990

regular bow now if you want to know how

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.560 
regular bow now if you want to know how
to<00:04:14.470> craft<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:15.069> this<00:04:15.430> is<00:04:15.610> how<00:04:15.790> so<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.269> need<00:04:16.419> to

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
to craft it this is how so you need to

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.750 
to craft it this is how so you need to
tnt's<00:04:17.049> on<00:04:17.320> both<00:04:17.590> sides<00:04:17.889> one<00:04:18.220> Flint<00:04:18.519> in<00:04:18.669> the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
tnt's on both sides one Flint in the

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.400 
tnt's on both sides one Flint in the
