except<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.420> I'm<00:00:30.539> doing<00:00:30.779> whip<00:00:30.960> back<00:00:31.170> I'd<00:00:31.980> do

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
except really I'm doing whip back I'd do

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.040 
except really I'm doing whip back I'd do
it<00:00:32.250> maybe<00:00:32.399> split<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.329> up<00:00:33.450> throw<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.870> up

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
it maybe split it up throw it up

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.420 
it maybe split it up throw it up
straight<00:00:34.350> up<00:00:34.410> there<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:34.920> anything<00:00:35.309> to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
straight up there it's like anything to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.790 
straight up there it's like anything to
do<00:00:35.550> quads<00:00:35.960> whole<00:00:36.960> percent<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.380> get<00:00:37.440> into<00:00:37.590> him

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
do quads whole percent you get into him

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.799 
do quads whole percent you get into him
he's<00:00:37.950> right<00:00:38.070> after<00:00:38.579> him<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.210> again<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.420> snapper

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
he's right after him is again a snapper

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.560 
he's right after him is again a snapper
so<00:00:40.129> if<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.250> undo<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.640> way<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.390> do

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
so if you undo it that way then you do

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.240 
so if you undo it that way then you do
quite<00:00:42.809> some<00:00:42.960> ham<00:00:43.110> use<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.559> give<00:00:43.710> up<00:00:43.860> next<00:00:44.100> time

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
quite some ham use to give up next time

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.440 
quite some ham use to give up next time
with<00:00:44.370> your<00:00:44.489> legs<00:00:44.670> still<00:00:44.879> here<00:00:45.059> meat<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.360> then

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
with your legs still here meat and then

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.180 
with your legs still here meat and then
chords<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.140> give<00:00:46.920> them<00:00:47.010> equal

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
chords just so you give them equal

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.680 
chords just so you give them equal
hundred<00:00:47.579> percent<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.030> no<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.420> told<00:00:48.570> you

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
hundred percent but no if I told you

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
hundred percent but no if I told you
that<00:00:48.719> point<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.140> want<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.350> get<00:00:49.469> out<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.649> the
