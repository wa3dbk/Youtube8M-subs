00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.360
 Hi, details of the woman person the video 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.190
 today to present my new fluence 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.750
 that long that I had already announced 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.810
 in other videos 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.520
 this is the model of the rpg the show too 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.800
 came in the black box with all that 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.340
 that you already know that comes in finley and is the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.020
 model ptw 0 22 coincidentally the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.309
 same model of the first row as 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.410
 I used it in life 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.690
 if you vote there in the first video of the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.690
 channel three years ago I 'm using 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.789
 this same model but this time 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.570
 I decided to customize is not a template 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:52.170
 stock so it comes with one if the top is 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.179
 What I'm finding about this hair 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.640
 Actually , I'm not used to this. 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.640
 As you know, I 'm not accustomed to 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.519
 long hair always short hair 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.680
 It's and I decided to buy more hair. 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.659
 long because I wanted the truth more or 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.189
 less at shoulder height 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.229
 But it turned out that I had to have asked for more 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.290
 long anyway they have sent 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.520
 which I ordered I ordered one with 20 and the company 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.579
 show sent me one with 22 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 taking that hair out of the box 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.750
 It does not seem to be this long, but I will. 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.219
 get up for you 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.170
 he curled it passes here it almost arrives 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:41.729
 at waist height what are you 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.810
 looking behind him is more he is more 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.369
 long still 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:51.630
 he comes there at the waist quietly 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.100
 so it flat is it's very long 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.929
 of course you have to do some 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.729
 thing because I left with nothing it does not 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.439
 definitely have me cutting the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.159
 compliance or not now nor in 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.980
 I doubt I'll have to do some 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.440
 layers a light peaked 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.120
 time here in front definitely I 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.010
 I have to do something because it's a 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.990
 very long movie 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.870
 then it's kind of disproportionate 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.350
 but overall it is a very beautiful hair and 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.880
 have a shine is 100% human hair and 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.160
 Then I'll read the specifications for 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.880
 you who do not I forget at last is 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.630
 model pdw 0 22 as I commented the color is 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.290
 a baby who is dark brown he has 22 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.730
 indices that equals more or less 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:48.840
 60cm is the texture if what the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:53.070
 density is 100% 120% field little more 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.650
 volume so it will go to models with 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.780
 top five I'd rather see 120% 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:03.210
 is the construction line is natural is the 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.410
 color of the law is transparent I like 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.300
 quite and the construction is touch is a baby 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.040
 that it has a relation of 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.459
 ear to ear that is one of my 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.150
 few favorites and it comes with if the top 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.860
 ten by 10 centimeters and the top that 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.140
 Silk films that have 10 by 10 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.770
 centimeters and it helps in finishing 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.540
 so that it is a more natural line 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.390
 As you can see I'm finding this 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.670
 top a little too light 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.470
 I think my others had their 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.989
 touch a little darker I do not know can 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.430
 be impression maybe also that the hair 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.910
 it's much darker 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.970
 despite being a baby he seems very 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.280
 black so in the light of now when I 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.410
 I go in the sunlight she has a little bit 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.560
 a little lighter like this 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:57.110
 So you can see that it's not black, and it's not black. 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.340
 dark brown good no more I'm so 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.989
 quite impressed with the amount 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:07.920
 of hair is with the softness of the hair as 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:10.050
 finally how he held the bunches 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.920
 The only thing I did, I used mine. 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.709
 baby liss, this is the one here 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.639
 super easy just wrap your hair in it 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.770
 I left about 10 seconds and it 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.110
 grateful curls I left in mine 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.500
 Styrofoam's head 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.600
 so one night to another right 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.720
 I did last night and only came back now to 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.300
 make the video is me too soon 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.700
 that I learned and finished the curls I 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:43.050
 I sprinkled a little spray fixative 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.500
 that this worker that I like 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.389
 quite and is not much is not just a 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.229
 because if not the hair stays 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:54.660
 hard and I did not do anything else good 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.970
 super soft super long that is more than 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.360
 I can talk if I know I have not had much 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.180
 the drop wires in the beginning when the logo 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.070
 people buy influence is quite normal to 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.260
 people have a little yarn drop and 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.130
 said he did not have but definitely 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.169
 I need to put a fringe on it 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.450
 It's very very heavy so I 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.320
 cutting or not I'll have to put 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.380
 a fringe 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.470
 well this is what I've done several revisions 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.870

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.640

 about alopecia areata which is what disease 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.620

 I will not decide to cut 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.389
 I wanted in addition to the cut I wanted to speak 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:31.910

 A while ago I'll put it to you. 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:41.660
 and I wish I wanted him to stay 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:43.850
 with that color it 's because, right? 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.470
 I think it's a little too dark a 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.470
 too little too heavy 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.900
 but look textures and wonderful for him 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.419
 It is much too heavy for those who like 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:58.840
 super ocean hair 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:58.840
 this is a kiss until the next video
