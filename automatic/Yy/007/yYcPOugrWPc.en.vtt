00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 was if the time when big car was 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.350
 synonymous with a lumpy barge in the 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.630
 streets a transatlantic drinker right? 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.179
 the ford fusion we are today joined to 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.190
 flex technology and it showed that gives 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.619
 have a luxury car without leaving half 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.260
 of salary at the gas station 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.420
 surprise was what happened when 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.619
 discovered the consumption of ford fusion 2.5 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.750
 flex 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.180
 of course it's not a popular one but it 's 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.939
 equal to or better than several cds snows 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.939
 private piraí and even some compact 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.800
 for each one of those with exchange 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.500
 automatic and all stewardships 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.250
 the averages of 5.6 kilometers per liter 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.320
 of ethanol and 7.8 km of beautiful 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.230
 home the lille we got in our room 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.440
 city ​​military test circuit is 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.780
 dissipated are largely responsible impulse 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.730
 so it is the mechanical assembly that 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.460
 proved to be very efficient 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.009
 starts with the flex engine developed for 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.640
 Brazil, both with ethanol and with 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:13.009
 if you give me power and torque 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.680
 enough to drag the nearly 1,600 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.960
 pounds of beans with ease and 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.750
 everything is well managed by the exchange 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.539
 automatic six - speed with exchanges 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.990
 smooth and fast results in good 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:29.210
 acceleration and speed recovery 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.390
 that in addition to the automatic 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.369
 normal or sport to do them 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.259
 sequentially on this button next to the 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.149
 band 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.310
 although the ford execution commitment is 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.020
 equal with both fuels 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.280
 as it has more power and torque when 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.200
 is with ethanol 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.869
 we feel that performance is also 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.599
 better but still good with more 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.209
 or less because it is the cheapest version the 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:55.610
 fusion 2.5 flex no longer has some 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:58.069
 refinements in relation to titanic with 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.060
 mandetta your case rolling a match for 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.220
 button half 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.220
 even though it is well equipped 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.350
 and when the subject is security also 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.960
 do not let the ball fall 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.710
 plus clear abs have three belts 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.200
 points and head restraints for all 18 is 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.450
 the rest the tradition of the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.330
 fusion when it comes to marriage with 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.000
 good materials and spacious bonuses 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.640
 eternally takes five adults and has a 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.900
 good trunk but going here in the middle 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.720
 of the rear seat 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.580
 the pilot emphasized the seat backrest 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.580
 and the end of the console 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.290
 despite the low profile tires and 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.250
 transfer some vibrations inside 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.870
 Of car 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.840
 the independent suspension in the four 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.690
 wheels ensures a comfortable ride and 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.550
 Question stability remains the default 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.830
 son john the curves very well just lets 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.440
 lowing to be more careful in 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.960
 springs and entrances to garages because 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.450
 front the middle rascón with ease 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.360
 Hard to dislike it, but the best. 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.720
 is that it also has excellent relationship 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.820
 cost benefit of the segment or 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.040
 Who needs a car of this size? 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.040
 It's complicated to choose another one. 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.330
 It is even for 97 thousand nine hundred and ninety 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.879
 It is difficult to find the car with 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.920
 both comfort and equipped as ford 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.260
 fusion 2.5 flex 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.690
 the only options are the sunroof that 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.209
 cost 4 mil and pearly white paint 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.489
 thousand reais to have more technology 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.840
 shipped and minima 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.930
 You'll have to jump to the version 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.830
 titanium with 2.0 turbo engine and that part 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.319
 1990 or the top of the line then 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:20.180
 titanium oil drive with traction on the four 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:23.870
 wheels and sunroof series for 119 1990 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.600
 let's go to the notes it starts well with 28 c 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.110
 improvement for 10 in safety is still good 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.580
 with over 38 without stability finish 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.030
 and internal space 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:39.400
 the worst was the trunk set but it ends 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.400
 with a good 10 in terms of cost benefit
