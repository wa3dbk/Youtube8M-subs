how to prepare rolled chocolate using a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.550 
how to prepare rolled chocolate using a
hexagon<00:00:26.760> cutter<00:00:27.029> begin<00:00:27.720> by<00:00:27.869> cutting<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.349> same

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
hexagon cutter begin by cutting the same

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.380 
hexagon cutter begin by cutting the same
shape<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.310> all<00:00:29.460> three<00:00:29.699> colors<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.150> rolled

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
shape out of all three colors of rolled

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:44.450 
shape out of all three colors of rolled
modeling<00:00:30.840> chocolate

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.780 

then<00:00:45.300> cut<00:00:46.050> each<00:00:46.230> hexagon<00:00:46.740> into<00:00:47.250> three<00:00:47.520> pieces

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
then cut each hexagon into three pieces

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.570 
then cut each hexagon into three pieces
to<00:00:48.210> make<00:00:48.390> three<00:00:48.720> equal<00:00:49.110> sized<00:00:49.290> diamonds<00:00:50.010> now

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
to make three equal sized diamonds now

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.100 
to make three equal sized diamonds now
if<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.850> happen<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.330> a<00:00:51.390> diamond<00:00:51.690> cutter

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
if you happen to have a diamond cutter

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.870 
if you happen to have a diamond cutter
that<00:00:52.410> works<00:00:52.650> for<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:52.980> design<00:00:53.310> go<00:00:53.520> ahead<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
that works for this design go ahead and

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.210 
that works for this design go ahead and
use<00:00:54.060> it<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.720> problem<00:00:55.080> is<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.620> most<00:00:55.800> diamond

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
use it the problem is that most diamond

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.680 
use it the problem is that most diamond
cutters<00:00:56.489> aren't<00:00:56.670> quite<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.060> the<00:00:57.239> right<00:00:57.270> shape

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
cutters aren't quite in the right shape

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.020 
cutters aren't quite in the right shape
to<00:00:57.750> make<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.170> work<00:00:58.380> but<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.130> hexagon<00:00:59.760> works

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
to make it work but the hexagon works

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.420 
to make it work but the hexagon works
the<00:01:00.629> trick<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.290> use<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> opposite<00:01:02.160> point

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the trick is to use the opposite point

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.910 
the trick is to use the opposite point
as<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.730> guide<00:01:03.120> align<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> first<00:01:04.140> two<00:01:04.320> cuts<00:01:04.650> in

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
as a guide align the first two cuts in

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.859 
as a guide align the first two cuts in
the<00:01:05.280> direction<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.850> their<00:01:05.970> opposite<00:01:06.450> points

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the direction of their opposite points

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.560 
the direction of their opposite points
then<00:01:07.440> cut<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:07.920> remainder<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.400> half<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.330> way

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
then cut the remainder in half that way

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.800 
then cut the remainder in half that way
the<00:01:09.869> diamond<00:01:10.260> should<00:01:10.410> come<00:01:10.680> out<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.979> same

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
the diamond should come out the same

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.540 
the diamond should come out the same
ready<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.960> pieces<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.440> a<00:01:13.470> sheet<00:01:13.770> pan<00:01:13.800> so<00:01:14.520> that

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
ready the pieces on a sheet pan so that

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.280 
ready the pieces on a sheet pan so that
they<00:01:14.820> are<00:01:14.910> all<00:01:15.090> lined<00:01:15.330> up<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:15.720> each<00:01:15.869> hexagon

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
they are all lined up with each hexagon

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.650 
they are all lined up with each hexagon
containing<00:01:17.009> all<00:01:17.190> three<00:01:17.490> colors<00:01:17.910> some<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
containing all three colors some of the
