00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.460
 there would be there is no case there are any 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.710
 free spaces in this case there you 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.910
 do to configure now and so 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.730
 on the other hand attention it will remove 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.899

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.870
 the discution you copied on the map 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.859
 memory 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.260
 once you've done that we get 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.700
 found on the pc directly a course 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.369
 can be found on the pc so I plugged in 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.960
 my usb key I started the horizon so 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.400
 if you go to games you are looking for 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.840
 your backup that I made you 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.540
 copy then you go to the tab 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.650
 game modders looking for gta iv 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.750
 when he's here you do ps 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.250
 is there you go look for the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.770
 backup shoes effect download our 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.520
 half on the desktop here you open it 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.630
 and so you are going to make max value arm 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.729
 money to limit unlimited life for max 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.780
 the armor does not work I'll put it 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.750
 to 100 to see if it works because 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.310
 I do not know but sliced armor 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.620
 but the max is like I do not have 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.500
 of armed I put it to you 100 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.150
 change all your weapons if you want 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.990

 aulas rpg that the ammo it does not work 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.700
 no longer very well I believe that when we 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.130
 put more than max does not it works 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.290
 it's not the normal thing, I'm going 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.840
 try for example to put 50 grenade 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.560
 to see it work but hey and she 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.640

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.489
 the click control was doubleclick 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.900

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.640
 do that on the three islands that you have 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.170

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.810
 There you go 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.340
