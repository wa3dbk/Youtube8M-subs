00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
good enough we keep reminding the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.020 
good enough we keep reminding the
chairman<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.740> bit<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.189> money<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.669> be<00:00:32.759> spent

there<00:00:33.239> they've<00:00:34.200> been<00:00:34.320> unlucky<00:00:34.559> here<00:00:34.920> of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
there they've been unlucky here of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.740 
there they've been unlucky here of
course<00:00:35.219> because<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.790> pitch<00:00:36.000> didn't<00:00:36.450> quite

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
course because the pitch didn't quite

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.290 
course because the pitch didn't quite
work<00:00:36.930> out<00:00:37.200> as<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.829> promised<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.340> think<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.149> it's

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
work out as was promised I think so it's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.440 
work out as was promised I think so it's
a<00:00:39.390> relay<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.520> relay<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.180> never

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
a relay and in that relay and it's never

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.060 
a relay and in that relay and it's never
going<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.719> perfect

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
going to be perfect

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.889 
going to be perfect
I've<00:00:44.489> played<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.850> relayed<00:00:45.180> pictures<00:00:45.570> before

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
I've played on relayed pictures before

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.869 
I've played on relayed pictures before
in<00:00:46.020> Cup<00:00:46.200> finals<00:00:46.649> actually<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.129> remember

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
in Cup finals actually I remember

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.389 
in Cup finals actually I remember
playing<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.570> cardiff<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.739> pitch<00:00:50.250> was

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
playing and the cardiff and pitch was

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.970 
playing and the cardiff and pitch was
relayed<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.199> never<00:00:52.199> they're<00:00:52.379> quite<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.620> same

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
relayed and never they're quite the same

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.020 
relayed and never they're quite the same
so<00:00:53.579> foot<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:55.129> some<00:00:56.129> areas<00:00:56.520> grow<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> little<00:00:56.879> bit

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
so foot in some areas grow a little bit

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.830 
so foot in some areas grow a little bit
quicker<00:00:57.210> than<00:00:57.300> others

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
quicker than others

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.709 
quicker than others
all<00:00:58.440> that's<00:00:58.649> what's<00:00:58.920> tough<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.910> know<00:00:59.940> for

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
all that's what's tough but you know for

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.299 
all that's what's tough but you know for
our<00:01:00.780> fan<00:01:00.989> sitting<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.649> looks<00:01:01.829> great<00:01:02.070> it

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
our fan sitting up it looks great it

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.270 
our fan sitting up it looks great it
looks<00:01:02.460> good<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:03.480> us<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:04.500> perfect<00:01:04.920> but

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
looks good but for us not perfect but

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.440 
looks good but for us not perfect but
more<00:01:05.430> difficult<00:01:05.760> for<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> waste<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.270> there

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
more difficult for the waste like there

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.570 
more difficult for the waste like there
were<00:01:06.540> yeah<00:01:06.960> absolutely<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> slight

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
were yeah absolutely so it is a slight

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.429 
were yeah absolutely so it is a slight
advantage<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.240> have<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.510> say<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.110> gives<00:01:10.260> us<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
advantage you have to say it gives us a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.160 
advantage you have to say it gives us a
chance<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.979> sort<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.250> hopefully<00:01:12.080> get<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> little

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
chance to sort of hopefully get a little

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.750 
chance to sort of hopefully get a little
angle<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.830> wouldn't<00:01:14.070> think<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.430> by<00:01:14.640> our

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
angle you wouldn't think that by our

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.840 
angle you wouldn't think that by our
home<00:01:14.939> form<00:01:15.270> because<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.659> all<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.640> we<00:01:17.640> need
