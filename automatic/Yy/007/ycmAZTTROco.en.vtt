00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
finally let's talk about ERCP

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.340 
finally let's talk about ERCP
you

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
you

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.900

CP<00:02:13.740> is<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.950> procedure<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.430> can<00:02:14.670> identify

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
CP is a procedure that can identify

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.450 
CP is a procedure that can identify
blockages<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.050> biliary<00:02:16.350> tract<00:02:16.800> from

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
blockages of the biliary tract from

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.670 
blockages of the biliary tract from
stone<00:02:17.790> worms<00:02:18.000> or<00:02:18.180> masses<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.810> then<00:02:19.260> open<00:02:19.590> up

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
stone worms or masses and then open up

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.070 
stone worms or masses and then open up
these<00:02:19.830> blockages<00:02:20.390> before<00:02:21.390> obtaining<00:02:21.510> an<00:02:21.810> ERCP

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
these blockages before obtaining an ERCP

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.200 
these blockages before obtaining an ERCP
you<00:02:22.500> need<00:02:22.770> an<00:02:22.980> ultrasound<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.730> identify<00:02:24.150> the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
you need an ultrasound to identify the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.540 
you need an ultrasound to identify the
location<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.990> likely<00:02:25.830> cause<00:02:26.130> for<00:02:26.160> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
location and likely cause for the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.510 
location and likely cause for the
obstruction<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:27.990> why<00:02:28.560> before<00:02:28.830> doing<00:02:29.220> any

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
obstruction this is why before doing any

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.130 
obstruction this is why before doing any
intervention<00:02:30.180> we<00:02:30.300> generally<00:02:30.630> obtained<00:02:30.990> a

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
intervention we generally obtained a

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.260 
intervention we generally obtained a
right<00:02:31.320> upper<00:02:31.590> quadrant<00:02:31.950> ultrasound<00:02:32.270> given

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
right upper quadrant ultrasound given

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.140 
right upper quadrant ultrasound given
its<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.630> cheap<00:02:34.610> non-interventional<00:02:35.610> test<00:02:35.910> that

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
its a cheap non-interventional test that

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.790 
its a cheap non-interventional test that
can<00:02:36.240> provide<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.450> great<00:02:36.780> deal<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:37.110> information

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
can provide a great deal of information

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.770 
can provide a great deal of information
so<00:02:38.580> really<00:02:38.790> when<00:02:38.940> anyone<00:02:39.270> presents<00:02:39.660> with

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
so really when anyone presents with

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.420 
so really when anyone presents with
jaundice<00:02:40.050> we<00:02:40.410> generally<00:02:40.740> know<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.250> Billy

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
jaundice we generally know the Billy

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.880 
jaundice we generally know the Billy
tract<00:02:41.760> or<00:02:41.880> liver<00:02:42.210> is<00:02:42.480> being<00:02:43.020> affected<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.530> some

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
tract or liver is being affected in some

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.800 
tract or liver is being affected in some
way<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.880> first<00:02:44.910> step<00:02:45.210> is<00:02:45.300> almost<00:02:45.540> always

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
way so the first step is almost always

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.990 
way so the first step is almost always
to<00:02:46.230> obtain<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.650> write-up<00:02:47.040> quad<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.460> elders<00:02:47.850> now

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
to obtain a write-up quad and elders now

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.700 
to obtain a write-up quad and elders now
now<00:02:48.750> let's<00:02:48.960> talk<00:02:49.020> about<00:02:49.080> how<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.320> interpret

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
now let's talk about how to interpret

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.190 
now let's talk about how to interpret
abnormal<00:02:50.550> liver<00:02:50.700> function<00:02:50.790> tests<00:02:51.510> if<00:02:52.140> a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
abnormal liver function tests if a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.960 
abnormal liver function tests if a
patient<00:02:52.530> has<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.680> trans<00:02:52.980> ammonite<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.790> is

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
patient has a trans ammonite is that is

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.830 
patient has a trans ammonite is that is
an<00:02:54.360> elevated<00:02:54.870> ast<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.470> alt<00:02:55.910> we<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.360> determine

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
an elevated ast and alt we to determine

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.750 
an elevated ast and alt we to determine
if<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.140> patient<00:02:58.290> has<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.800> cholestatic

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
if the patient has a cholestatic

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.930 
if the patient has a cholestatic
or<00:02:59.880> non<00:03:00.300> cholestatic<00:03:00.960> liver<00:03:01.320> pattern

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
or non cholestatic liver pattern

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.860 
or non cholestatic liver pattern
cholestatic<00:03:02.940> means<00:03:03.300> that<00:03:03.570> there<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.720> an

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
cholestatic means that there is an

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.550 
cholestatic means that there is an
obstruction<00:03:04.260> either<00:03:04.680> from<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.100> gallstone<00:03:05.480> mass

stricture or inflammation non-coal
static<00:03:10.680> generally<00:03:11.040> indicates<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.490> process

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
static generally indicates a process

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.300 
static generally indicates a process
that<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.210> affecting<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.780> liver<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.320> not<00:03:14.010> the

that is affecting the liver and not the
biliary<00:03:14.610> tract<00:03:15.000> so<00:03:15.630> let's<00:03:15.750> briefly<00:03:15.960> review

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
biliary tract so let's briefly review

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.860 
biliary tract so let's briefly review

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
which empties into the duodenum when

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.440 
which empties into the duodenum when
there's<00:03:28.950> an<00:03:29.070> obstruction<00:03:29.370> in<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.850> common

lead into a TransAm and is due to backup

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.340 
lead into a TransAm and is due to backup
and<00:03:35.490> you<00:03:35.550> may<00:03:35.790> also<00:03:36.090> get<00:03:36.660> an<00:03:36.870> elevated

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
and you may also get an elevated

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.740 
and you may also get an elevated
alkaline<00:03:37.650> phosphatase<00:03:38.450> now<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.510> biggest

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
alkaline phosphatase now the biggest

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.480 
alkaline phosphatase now the biggest
question<00:03:40.200> is<00:03:40.290> how<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.860> differentiate<00:03:41.310> between

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
question is how to differentiate between

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.300 
question is how to differentiate between
a<00:03:41.940> non<00:03:42.300> cholestatic<00:03:42.960> and<00:03:43.320> cholestatic<00:03:43.980> liver

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
a non cholestatic and cholestatic liver

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.460 
a non cholestatic and cholestatic liver
pattern<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:45.600> differentiate<00:03:45.990> between<00:03:46.170> these

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
pattern to differentiate between these

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.720 
pattern to differentiate between these
patterns<00:03:46.920> look<00:03:47.130> at<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.340> alkaline

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
patterns look at the alkaline

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.810 
patterns look at the alkaline
phosphatase<00:03:48.360> if<00:03:48.630> a<00:03:49.350> alkaline<00:03:49.920> phosphatase<00:03:50.610> is

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
phosphatase if a alkaline phosphatase is

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.580 
phosphatase if a alkaline phosphatase is
significantly<00:03:51.450> higher<00:03:51.720> than<00:03:51.750> levels<00:03:52.440> of

higher than the transaminases with
jaundice<00:04:46.390> so<00:04:47.110> this<00:04:47.200> indicates<00:04:47.560> a<00:04:47.950> cholestatic

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
jaundice so this indicates a cholestatic

remember<00:04:49.870> jaundice<00:04:50.770> workup<00:04:51.160> almost<00:04:51.460> always

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
remember jaundice workup almost always

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.310 
remember jaundice workup almost always
begins<00:04:52.120> with<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.480> right<00:04:52.690> upper<00:04:52.960> quadrant
