the best weapons in the game and it
would<00:03:15.850> have<00:03:15.970> been<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.150> good<00:03:16.360> alternatives<00:03:16.959> to

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
would have been a good alternatives to

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.349 
would have been a good alternatives to

my recommendations of attachments they
might<00:03:59.380> want<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.560> go<00:03:59.739> for<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.299> mentioned<00:04:01.299> that

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450

main drawback of the sky hate in black

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.940 
main drawback of the sky hate in black
ops<00:04:03.310> 2<00:04:03.400> is<00:04:03.760> that<00:04:03.940> quite<00:04:04.180> pronounced<00:04:04.750> recoil<00:04:05.200> if

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
ops 2 is that quite pronounced recoil if
