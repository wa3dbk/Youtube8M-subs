mind when training fire-making and on

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.959 
mind when training fire-making and on
that<00:00:43.440> note<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.860> also<00:00:44.129> important<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.670> know

that note it's also important to know
that<00:00:45.450> if<00:00:45.629> your<00:00:45.870> fire-making<00:00:46.230> level<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.890> high

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
that if your fire-making level is high

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160 
that if your fire-making level is high
enough<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.550> you're<00:00:48.120> quick<00:00:48.360> enough<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.629> can

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
enough and you're quick enough you can

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.049 
enough and you're quick enough you can
automatically<00:00:49.890> burn<00:00:50.280> another<00:00:50.730> log

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
automatically burn another log

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.209 
automatically burn another log
immediately<00:00:51.840> after<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.320> burn<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.620> first<00:00:52.980> log

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
immediately after you burn the first log

immediately after you burn the first log
in<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.730> video<00:00:54.059> i'm<00:00:54.210> showing<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.629> an<00:00:54.690> example

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
in this video i'm showing you an example

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.690 
in this video i'm showing you an example
of<00:00:55.199> this

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.689 

alright<00:01:02.690> let's<00:01:03.050> talk<00:01:03.200> about<00:01:03.290> logotypes<00:01:03.950> the

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
alright let's talk about logotypes the

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.760 
alright let's talk about logotypes the
first<00:01:04.970> log<00:01:05.210> you<00:01:05.360> can<00:01:05.510> burn<00:01:05.720> is<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.230> normal<00:01:06.590> log

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
first log you can burn is the normal log

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.040 
first log you can burn is the normal log
I<00:01:07.040> suggest<00:01:07.700> going<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.180> level<00:01:08.420> 20<00:01:08.720> with<00:01:08.840> these

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
I suggest going to level 20 with these

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.120 
I suggest going to level 20 with these
at<00:01:09.460> 32<00:01:10.460> GP<00:01:10.850> each<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.360> giving<00:01:11.750> 40<00:01:12.110> XP<00:01:12.530> each<00:01:12.770> log

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
at 32 GP each and giving 40 XP each log

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.150 
at 32 GP each and giving 40 XP each log
you'll<00:01:13.790> need<00:01:13.940> 112<00:01:14.780> logs<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.380> get<00:01:15.470> to<00:01:15.650> level<00:01:15.770> 20

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
you'll need 112 logs to get to level 20

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.340 
you'll need 112 logs to get to level 20
it<00:01:16.610> should<00:01:16.970> only<00:01:17.150> cost<00:01:18.760> 3584<00:01:19.760> GP<00:01:20.320> personally<00:01:21.320> I

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
just over 24 million I think by now it's

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.840 
just over 24 million I think by now it's

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850

obvious that using item boosts is a good
idea<00:05:18.930> now<00:05:19.930> I'd<00:05:20.080> give<00:05:20.380> this<00:05:20.410> method<00:05:20.920> of<00:05:21.010> three

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
idea now I'd give this method of three

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.120 
idea now I'd give this method of three
out<00:05:21.310> of<00:05:21.400> five<00:05:21.580> mostly<00:05:22.090> because<00:05:22.240> of<00:05:22.390> the<00:05:22.570> cost

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
out of five mostly because of the cost

out of five mostly because of the cost
compared<00:05:24.130> to<00:05:24.250> maples<00:05:24.640> I<00:05:24.880> think<00:05:25.210> that<00:05:25.330> a

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
compared to maples I think that a

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.940 
compared to maples I think that a
thirty-three<00:05:25.900> percent<00:05:26.050> increase<00:05:26.560> in<00:05:26.710> speed

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
five percent increase in cost you may be

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:32.159 
there's one method that i should mention
what<00:07:29.619> it<00:07:29.710> involves<00:07:30.339> is<00:07:30.550> going<00:07:31.059> west<00:07:31.389> halfway

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:32.169 
what it involves is going west halfway

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:34.079 
what it involves is going west halfway
through<00:07:32.499> your<00:07:32.529> inventory<00:07:33.129> and<00:07:33.369> then<00:07:33.879> going

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:34.089 
through your inventory and then going

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:36.749 
through your inventory and then going
east<00:07:34.569> the<00:07:34.990> other<00:07:35.169> hat<00:07:35.610> unfortunately<00:07:36.610> this

00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:36.759 
east the other hat unfortunately this

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:38.339 
east the other hat unfortunately this
involves<00:07:37.119> a<00:07:37.149> lot<00:07:37.300> of<00:07:37.330> manual<00:07:37.719> clicking<00:07:38.169> and

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:38.349 
involves a lot of manual clicking and

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:40.559 
involves a lot of manual clicking and
it's<00:07:38.499> easy<00:07:38.740> to<00:07:38.889> get<00:07:38.979> messed<00:07:39.249> up<00:07:39.399> but<00:07:40.210> this<00:07:40.389> can

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:40.569 
it's easy to get messed up but this can

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:42.149 
it's easy to get messed up but this can
speed<00:07:40.809> up<00:07:40.839> your<00:07:40.990> training<00:07:41.199> time<00:07:41.469> considerably

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:42.159 
speed up your training time considerably

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:44.010 
speed up your training time considerably
because<00:07:42.490> the<00:07:42.699> places<00:07:43.089> you<00:07:43.210> closer<00:07:43.509> back<00:07:43.869> to

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:44.020 
because the places you closer back to

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.709 
because the places you closer back to
where<00:07:44.139> you<00:07:44.229> started<00:07:45.180> well<00:07:46.180> that<00:07:46.419> pretty<00:07:46.569> much

00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:46.719 
where you started well that pretty much

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:48.869 
where you started well that pretty much
sums<00:07:47.020> up<00:07:47.169> the<00:07:47.319> fire<00:07:47.499> making<00:07:47.710> skill<00:07:48.099> of<00:07:48.249> course

00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 
sums up the fire making skill of course

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:50.850 
sums up the fire making skill of course
there<00:07:49.240> are<00:07:49.360> a<00:07:49.419> few<00:07:49.659> other<00:07:49.869> ways<00:07:50.050> to<00:07:50.229> train<00:07:50.469> such

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:50.860 
there are a few other ways to train such

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.859 
there are a few other ways to train such
as<00:07:51.039> lighting<00:07:51.189> orbs<00:07:51.999> in<00:07:52.180> the<00:07:52.300> dorkish<00:07:52.689> and

00:07:52.859 --> 00:07:52.869 
as lighting orbs in the dorkish and

00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:55.739 
as lighting orbs in the dorkish and
caves<00:07:53.169> however<00:07:54.129> for<00:07:54.249> practical<00:07:54.969> purposes<00:07:54.999> I

caves however for practical purposes I

00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:57.600
