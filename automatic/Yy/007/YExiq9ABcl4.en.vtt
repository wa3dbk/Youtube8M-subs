00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
on it and uh I'm just pulling the motor

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.170 
on it and uh I'm just pulling the motor
out<00:00:17.850> even<00:00:18.119> though<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.330> still<00:00:18.539> runs<00:00:18.750> good<00:00:19.020> and

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
out even though it still runs good and

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.359 
out even though it still runs good and
it's<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:22.010> like<00:00:23.010> kind<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.220> like<00:00:23.310> a

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
it's just a like kind of like a

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.920 
it's just a like kind of like a
short-term<00:00:23.760> project<00:00:24.060> I'm<00:00:24.539> gonna<00:00:24.630> get<00:00:24.840> it

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
short-term project I'm gonna get it

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.540 
short-term project I'm gonna get it
running<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.260> driving<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.160> probably

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
running and driving and then probably

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.339 
running and driving and then probably
drive<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> way<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.330> put<00:00:27.689> my<00:00:28.109> torque

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
drive it the way it is put my torque

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.009 
drive it the way it is put my torque
thrust<00:00:28.619> wheels<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.490> uh<00:00:29.869> eating<00:00:30.869> them

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
thrust wheels on it and uh eating them

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.260 
thrust wheels on it and uh eating them
like<00:00:31.260> eventually<00:00:31.890> later<00:00:32.130> down<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.550> road<00:00:33.059> you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
like eventually later down the road you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.840 
like eventually later down the road you
know<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.420> la<00:00:33.780> like<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.649> put<00:00:35.070> my<00:00:35.160> lowering<00:00:35.550> kit<00:00:35.670> on

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
know a la like I put my lowering kit on

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.540 
know a la like I put my lowering kit on
and<00:00:36.120> stuff<00:00:36.469> but<00:00:37.469> anyway<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.280> motor

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and stuff but anyway this is the motor

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.000 
and stuff but anyway this is the motor

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.649 
hooked up real quick just to rig it up
my<00:02:19.709> sub<00:02:19.980> box<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.430> got<00:02:20.549> two<00:02:20.730> twelves<00:02:21.150> back<00:02:21.360> there

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
my sub box I got two twelves back there

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.809 
my sub box I got two twelves back there
they're<00:02:21.959> pretty<00:02:22.110> cheap<00:02:22.230> subs<00:02:22.739> but<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:23.250> took<00:02:23.579> my

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
they're pretty cheap subs but I took my

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.429 
they're pretty cheap subs but I took my
head<00:02:23.939> lying<00:02:24.150> around<00:02:24.299> cuz<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:24.780> was<00:02:24.870> real<00:02:25.049> ugly

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
head lying around cuz it was real ugly

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.339 
head lying around cuz it was real ugly
so<00:02:25.950> I'll<00:02:26.549> probably<00:02:26.700> get<00:02:26.909> that<00:02:27.060> redone<00:02:27.390> painted

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
so I'll probably get that redone painted

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.339 
so I'll probably get that redone painted
by<00:02:28.560> my<00:02:29.189> dash<00:02:29.909> trim<00:02:30.239> here<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.810> most

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
by my dash trim here and most

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.640 
by my dash trim here and most

importantly I swapped the old gauge

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.349 
importantly I swapped the old gauge

cluster rabbit with the white bars to a
needle<00:02:36.720> cluster<00:02:37.109> and<00:02:37.409> I<00:02:37.769> put<00:02:38.010> red<00:02:38.189> LEDs<00:02:38.670> in

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
there and it looks sick there's my head

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.780
