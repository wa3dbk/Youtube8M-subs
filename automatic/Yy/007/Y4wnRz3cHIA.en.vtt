00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
because these are really the only dark

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.830 
because these are really the only dark
spots<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.850> they've<00:02:00.030> lighten<00:02:00.630> up

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
spots that I have and they've lighten up

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.819 
spots that I have and they've lighten up
a<00:02:01.049> lot<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.650> lot<00:02:02.299> so<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.720> foundation<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.530> use

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
a lot a lot so the foundation that I use

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.620 
a lot a lot so the foundation that I use
it'll<00:02:05.159> cover<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.909> don't<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.450> use

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
it'll cover this so I don't have to use

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.419 
it'll cover this so I don't have to use
concealer<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.979> want<00:02:08.159> to<00:02:08.250> use

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
concealer but if you want to use

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.759 
concealer but if you want to use
