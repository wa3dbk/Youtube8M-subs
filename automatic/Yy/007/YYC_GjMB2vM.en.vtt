when he was talking to UM the magazine

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.889 
when he was talking to UM the magazine
on<00:01:35.079> stuff<00:01:35.319> they<00:01:35.740> said<00:01:36.039> that<00:01:36.459> this<00:01:36.759> is<00:01:36.939> if<00:01:37.479> it's

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
on stuff they said that this is if it's

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.419 
on stuff they said that this is if it's
not<00:01:38.139> for<00:01:38.380> sure<00:01:38.409> in<00:01:38.679> on<00:01:38.770> stuff<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:39.069> don't<00:01:39.130> think

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
not for sure in on stuff I don't think

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.249 
not for sure in on stuff I don't think
they<00:01:39.579> really<00:01:39.939> like<00:01:40.329> Nintendo<00:01:40.959> too<00:01:41.109> much

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
they really like Nintendo too much

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.989 
they really like Nintendo too much
because<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.799> what<00:01:41.920> they<00:01:42.039> potatoes<00:01:42.579> done<00:01:42.789> to

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:42.999 
because of what they potatoes done to

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:45.090 
because of what they potatoes done to
you<00:01:43.450> know<00:01:43.569> mantra<00:01:43.899> rising<00:01:44.229> videos<00:01:44.529> and<00:01:45.009> doing

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
you know mantra rising videos and doing

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.349 
you know mantra rising videos and doing
all<00:01:45.249> stuff<00:01:45.459> I<00:01:45.579> don't<00:01:45.789> think<00:01:46.029> they<00:01:46.090> were<00:01:46.179> like

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
all stuff I don't think they were like

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:47.699 
all stuff I don't think they were like
the<00:01:46.539> fact<00:01:46.719> that<00:01:46.840> they're<00:01:47.079> in<00:01:47.200> that<00:01:47.229> territory

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
the fact that they're in that territory

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:49.410 
the fact that they're in that territory
so<00:01:48.159> I<00:01:48.189> mean<00:01:48.429> there<00:01:48.670> are<00:01:48.819> going<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.270> different

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
so I mean there are going a different
