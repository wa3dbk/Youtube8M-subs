00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 good morning to everyone is always talas 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.339
 28 and welcome the powerful concepts that 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.899
 the heading which is referred to as new releases 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.400
 film 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.320
 you will think but this is cut off 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.830
 beard yes because he records this video 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.070
 Wednesday, March 12 you will see it on 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.690
 then Monday or Tuesday thereafter between 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.189
 a little less than a week but while 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.689
 directors I'm getting ready for a weekend 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.939
 because on Friday and Sunday I'll be at 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.800
 carlton iss in milan in cosplay by hot 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.109
 with as cloisters that makes the snake and the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.609
 his girlfriend who will be meryl and saturday 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.140
 instead recite my parts for skype o 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.759
 clicks therefore radar is not that he could 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.540
 resembling Jesus here was an episode 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.620
 other 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.239
 I did that cut everything with some 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.070
 day in advance they took advantage for 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.450
 make a shift that you will see in one 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.100
 of my next videos but now notice 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.100
 to the cziano immediately acronym 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.090
 so first start want to specify 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.530
 one thing about chat there that in so many me 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.120
 they asked why you don't talk more than 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.449
 a movie for each episode 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.949
 no because the ciak league serves precisely 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.379
 to have my say on particular ends 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.030
 coming soon 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.770
 Well, when I have needed to feelings 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.649
 that movie I'll link to the slots there that 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.960
 relative to make a comparison between mine 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.909
 reaction before it came out and after that 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.220
 movie came out so it's an experience 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.479
 that I'd like to try 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.520
 write where you think about it 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.649
 this second episode we see a little 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.530
 then in so many times asked today 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.910
 I want to talk about is a movie that is already 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.530
 full controversial to get out 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.320
 I'm talking about the amazing spider man 2 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.179
 the power of electro the leaving the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.039
 title that I want to say are the months on 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.679
 no of calls leasing spa rider 2 the 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.170
 power the uncle electro madonna tests 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.759
 leaving that then to me 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.679
 you know the first of months and spider is me 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.380
 loved you all know that I 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.750
 liked more than spiders and not kidneys 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.479
 I want to create flame 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.700
 it is my opinion for many reasons that 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.229
 I have been explaining for two years now that I liked it 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.659
 more, however, this carried out with the 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.390
 comic for a question that falls within 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.060
 more than my trucks the cine comic ho 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.600
 fidiweb preferred this second film 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.670
 always managed by marc webb anyway 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.920
 let's say he inspired me on paper 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.959
 quite anyway I had noticed that 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.430
 the bases had been laid and first for 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.260
 a solid story that was between d'union 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.600
 throughout the trilogy 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.090
 I was very curious to know which one 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.850
 it would have been villas and then we had them 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.380
 commented a lot of news about is the gect 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.810
 they pay for it on more pictures and images 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.220
 I jumped to those more and if the 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.930
 official trailer 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.450
 a few months ago then a few weeks ago it is 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.200
 then another one came out of these 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.920
 trailer 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.810
 sincerely enthusiasm 6 slightly 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.310
 diluted or I am still waiting for it 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.410
 very curious but I no longer have enthusiasm 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.200
 primitive because I fear the effect 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.350
 spiderman 3 or in the trailer you see 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.630
 clearly harry osborn 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.650
 then it is probably from what it is 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:03.800
 understands to play the role of what 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.450
 which spider called green goblin that 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.640
 evening if I'm not mistaken but you can get into one 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.200
 green goblin bullshit and the point name of 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.430
 goblin abroad but us with greens 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.860
 goblin we mean punto harry osborn 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:19.160
 when in fact we say that 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.380
 it happens to the father but here it seems that there 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.209
 both before he and the internet between the covers 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.790
 young then there will be chris cooper who knows 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.890
 this is the real goblin here too 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.080
 tipping can be interesting between 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.990
 the other and is Indian will play a 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.959
 harry osborn el andrew of chronic al 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.790
 flight was also the character who 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.330
 let's see the film throughout the video 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.850
 gigantic metallic video clip on never 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.650
 however he is an actor as frankly not 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.380
 sorry even if he had this 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.950
 try the beauvais we will see, however, at 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.900
 beyond that we see that there was indeed era 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.190
 its the goal balls in or green goblin 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.110
 if you prefer 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.940
 correct in this mistake because 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.870
 maybe then I'm wrong with 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.130
 these productions 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.160
 we care a lot, then there is elector 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.540
 I'm afraid the soup is not too clear 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.580
 if not deliberately because there was placed the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.290
 production here is in spa raitre that goes 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:20.900
 put flint marco venom the costume 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:22.400
 fact is that peter parker bad green 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.930
 goblin sum should be put too much meat a 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.790
 fire and the result is what everyone 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.850
 we know 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:32.140
 all this all these enemies too 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.640
 if it is rumored that rino will be alone it is one 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.860
 sort of cameo interpreted if not 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.180
 I am wrong to know what Paul is saying 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.789
 why put so much on the fire 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.740
 but put a fucking villas as you 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.450
 done in the first month of expansion that 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.520
 there was only lizza because he liked it not 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.060
 this is another matter but if acea 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.740
 you have fox cousins ​​who are visually well-off 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.150
 learn from a certain impact because of 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.950
 put it all then of course I talk 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.690
 based on images of rumors 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.780
 etc. do not speak 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.580
 having seen the film that this is mine 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.440
 initial impression however frankly me 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.030
 I hope there isn't that sort of 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.130
 destructive domino effect that already 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.630
 we saw why spiderman anyway 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:13.250
 The most loved superheroes is not super 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:16.190
 heroes who boast to a bad reeds well 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.590
 fed so you can do 120 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.240
 movies without ever changing bad bodies 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.130
 it even seems that he arrived want 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.890
 insert because then they will want to put the 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.260
 claims 6 of the third I don't know there 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.840
 are rumors that these are 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.560
 will meet the necessary death already in 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.970
 this movie you will not win by what 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.830
 it was my enthusiasm I don't know anymore 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.780
 I really know what to expect 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.120
 expect me because in the first web movie 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.860
 he seemed to know what 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.620
 doing with this there are movies from everything 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.990
 what has been known so far 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:50.110
 honestly I can't say I don't know 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:53.500
 say why it seems to me that maybe we are 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.479
 still making the mistake of putting so much 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.490
 grada fuoco then maybe the web will be in 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.620
 able to handle everything without it 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.260
 cavalar and this cowardly rather than 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.270
 the other will succeed in developing the variety 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.520
 between but because maybe then the events 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.860
 relating to ri osbourne in his father 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.360
 ha or scopece between will be a side dish 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.740
 who will prepare the real clash e 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.120
 just the third film because maybe in 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.710
 this film want to focus on 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.750
 recto and then the whole story that 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.389
 involves peter la's parents 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.400
 they will totally develop the third ego 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.680
 I sincerely hope it is so and I hope 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.440
 that the sensations he communicated to me 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.400
 the player or the trailer and all that 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.010
 that there was an actor in the battle 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.110
 advertising is not correct I hope 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.030
 really to be amazed on 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.370
 screen is to find a story that 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.100
 however it may be interesting to many e 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.440
 they might find it senseless to realize 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.780
 a video quote a movie like gods 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.520
 spiderman months objecting that it is but up 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.840
 what circus you expect no I am 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.580
 a fan of the genre are 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.710
 also passionate about comics for which 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.099
 when he sees a comic cine me 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:56.260
 I always hope he is interested 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:57.460
 well so i don't care that it is a 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.870
 commercial film no because I think that 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.960
 business purposes can safely 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.370
 still be well made to have the 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.050
 resonance that you put is not that if a 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.729
 commercial film is not enough then no 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.380
 I have to talk about this 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:10.599
 notice that they want to want it 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.490
 speak for this reason and to create 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:13.810
 a usual area of discussion 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.610
 under this video the one after i 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.020
 ask yourself what do you expect 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.940
 put it back in two 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.680
 you like it and want to go and see 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.180
 hope it's beautiful 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.740
 according to me it is a cagata there is not 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.620
 like first you won't go see it vi 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.599
 I ask politely if you want to 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:32.260
 discuss below to say it without though 

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:34.900
 start the usual war on those 

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.400
 eleonora mancino not bring anything 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.530
 these wars here everyone can say 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.140
 own but no need to argue 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.850
 so this chatree ends here let me 

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:46.560
 know your opinion no see 

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.560
 the next episode hello everyone
