00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:35.763
We are big fans of the VW "R" products

00:00:35.763 --> 00:00:37.836
they make cars that are practical

00:00:37.836 --> 00:00:38.905
fast

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:40.811
you can use them when it's wet

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:42.789
like today

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.745
a couple of weeks ago

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:46.837
we filmed the Touareg R50

00:00:46.837 --> 00:00:49.159
and as Max said in that review

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.977
there's another rare "R"

00:00:50.977 --> 00:00:52.894
the Passat R36

00:00:52.894 --> 00:00:54.895
and that's what were driving today

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:11.714
As you can see

00:01:11.714 --> 00:01:13.599
we've also brought an R32 with us

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:14.795
we thought it'd be fun

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:18.959
because we have filmed all the VW "R" cars now

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:24.574
we already did a full review of the R32

00:01:24.574 --> 00:01:27.116
but this one has a supersprint exhaust

00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:28.962
and a muffler delete

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:31.472
so it sounds amazing now

00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:54.517
they're two lovely brothers

00:01:54.517 --> 00:01:58.533
the R32 has a 3.2 V6 with 250HP

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.985
the Passat, being the big brother

00:02:00.985 --> 00:02:04.648
has a 3.6 V6 with 300HP

00:02:04.648 --> 00:02:07.763
we drove the CC with the same engine

00:02:07.763 --> 00:02:12.211
but you immediately notice

00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:14.562
that in this car, it's a bit more present

00:02:14.562 --> 00:02:16.540
it sounds raw

00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:33.203
Both cars are also modified

00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:37.282
this one has huge wheels

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:40.897
the R32 as well, but these are bigger

00:02:40.897 --> 00:02:43.463
very skinny tires fitted

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:47.226
and you'd think that it wouldn't work

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:48.614
on a wet day like this

00:02:48.614 --> 00:02:50.523
that's true, the tires don't grip very well

00:02:50.523 --> 00:02:55.732
but the 4motion ensures high corner speeds

00:02:55.732 --> 00:02:56.967
you feel that it starts sliding

00:02:56.967 --> 00:02:58.817
but the 4-wheel drive corrects it

00:03:54.937 --> 00:03:56.494
the "R" department of VW

00:04:01.984 --> 00:04:02.384
spent a lot of time developing this car

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.239
it made its debut on the Frankfurt show

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.340
and it took a year before it was introduced

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.318
because they couldn't get this car

00:04:10.318 --> 00:04:12.701
to handle properly

00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:14.457
so they took their time

00:04:14.457 --> 00:04:16.499
and you really feel that

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:18.376
it's well balanced

00:04:18.376 --> 00:04:20.075
the V6 in the front is quite heavy

00:04:20.075 --> 00:04:22.362
and it's quite heavy to begin with

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:23.895
they had to compensate for that

00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:26.000
with different springs and dampers

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.510
wheels and tyres

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.765
and they've done a great job

00:05:06.294 --> 00:05:09.024
this really is a grown-up R32

00:05:09.024 --> 00:05:11.750
the R32 is louder, more playful

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.916
this can be calmer after you're done

00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:17.390
it's more modest

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.708
but very special

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:20.374
the car enthousiast will recognize it

00:05:20.374 --> 00:05:22.786
and will realize that it's a rare sight

00:05:22.786 --> 00:05:24.862
because it is very rare

00:05:24.862 --> 00:05:27.646
this is the only one for sale in the Netherlands

00:05:27.646 --> 00:05:30.064
at Arjan van Houtum in Boekel (NL)

00:05:30.064 --> 00:05:33.544
they have a great selection of VAG products

00:05:42.674 --> 00:05:43.866
This one on the inside..

00:05:46.023 --> 00:05:47.495
it has done 120.000 km

00:05:47.495 --> 00:05:49.511
and it looks like new

00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:50.949
also on the outside

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:51.958
that is something you want

00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.530
when buying such a rare car

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.759
you want it to be in tip top shape

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.495
go see them in Boekel(NL) if you're interested

00:06:11.723 --> 00:06:14.233
it has been a great day

00:06:14.233 --> 00:06:18.035
passat R36 and that R32 with supersprint

00:06:18.035 --> 00:06:21.447
which you hear coming from 3 km away

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:25.091
and what a great department

00:06:25.091 --> 00:06:27.372
especially when they used these V6 engines

00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:32.422
it's a piece of VW history

00:06:32.422 --> 00:06:38.411
and it's fantastic
