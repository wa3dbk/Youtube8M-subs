Poppy and I've got some dreams knitters
pride<00:00:34.290> needles<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.570> we're<00:00:36.570> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> get

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
pride needles and we're going to get

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.900 
pride needles and we're going to get
started<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.010> benefits<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.579> using<00:00:38.700> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
started so the benefits of using a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.170 
started so the benefits of using a
stretchy<00:00:39.180> cast<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.840> are<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:41.160> obviously<00:00:41.879> it's

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
stretchy cast on are that obviously it's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.150 
stretchy cast on are that obviously it's
elastic<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.530> want<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:43.980> something

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
elastic and you want that in something

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.850 
elastic and you want that in something
that's<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:45.809> over<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.050> heel<00:00:46.530> and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
that's going to be going over a heel and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.160 
that's going to be going over a heel and
then<00:00:47.039> trying<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.460> hug<00:00:47.610> your<00:00:47.789> leg<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:49.050> also

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
then trying to hug your leg and it also

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.600 
then trying to hug your leg and it also
works<00:00:49.469> with<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.649> lot<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.890> different<00:00:50.370> stitch

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
works with a lot of different stitch

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.810 
works with a lot of different stitch
patterns<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:52.129> it's<00:00:53.129> good<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.550> couple

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
patterns so it's good to have a couple

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.279 
patterns so it's good to have a couple
of<00:00:54.000> these<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.449> actually<00:00:54.750> good<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.110> lot

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
of these this is actually good for a lot

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.549 
of these this is actually good for a lot
of<00:00:55.440> projects<00:00:55.800> other<00:00:55.949> than<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.460> socks<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
of projects other than just socks so to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.830 
of projects other than just socks so to
get<00:00:58.680> started<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.190> most<00:00:59.430> cast<00:00:59.670> ons<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.120> need

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
get started with most cast ons you need

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.290 
get started with most cast ons you need
a<00:01:00.960> slip<00:01:01.379> knot<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:03.180> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
a slip knot and I have what I like to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.200 
a slip knot and I have what I like to
call<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.899> pretzel<00:01:04.439> method<00:01:04.920> where<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.030> make

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
call the pretzel method where you make

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.480 
call the pretzel method where you make
loops<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:07.080> kind<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.500> look<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:07.680> pretzels

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
loops that kind of look like pretzels

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.240 
loops that kind of look like pretzels
as<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.970> see<00:01:09.210> take<00:01:10.170> your<00:01:10.350> needle<00:01:10.530> insert

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
as you can see take your needle insert

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.710 
as you can see take your needle insert
it<00:01:11.400> above<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:12.030> piece<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.510> loop

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
it above this piece of the loop

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.560 
it above this piece of the loop
underneath<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.070> then<00:01:14.400> pull<00:01:14.640> tight<00:01:14.850> both

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
underneath here and then pull tight both

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.890 
underneath here and then pull tight both
ends<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.310> important<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> note<00:01:18.060> when<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
ends so it's important to note when you

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.899 
ends so it's important to note when you
are<00:01:18.930> doing<00:01:19.350> your<00:01:19.619> stretchy<00:01:20.130> cast<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
are doing your stretchy cast on with the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.880 
are doing your stretchy cast on with the
long<00:01:21.060> tail<00:01:21.330> method<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:22.500> you're<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
long tail method that you're going to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.539 
long tail method that you're going to
want<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> very<00:01:24.090> long<00:01:24.450> tail<00:01:25.549> because

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
want to have a very long tail because

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.010 
want to have a very long tail because
it's<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> eat<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.330> lot<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.840> as

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
it's going to eat up a lot of this as

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.490 
it's going to eat up a lot of this as
you<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:28.380> your<00:01:28.530> cast<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:30.229> even<00:01:31.229> sometimes

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
you do your cast on and even sometimes

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920 
you do your cast on and even sometimes
when<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.220> try<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.670> estimate<00:01:32.970> what<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> think<00:01:33.810> is

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
when I try and estimate what I think is

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.080 
when I try and estimate what I think is
a<00:01:33.960> good<00:01:34.170> amount<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.740> run<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.369> before<00:01:35.759> I'm<00:01:35.880> done

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
a good amount I run out before I'm done

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.810 
a good amount I run out before I'm done
casting<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.200> try<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.130> more<00:01:38.430> than<00:01:38.700> you

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
casting on so try to do more than you

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.700 
casting on so try to do more than you
think<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.180> necessary<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.020> then<00:01:40.290> do<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> little

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
think is necessary and then do a little

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.690 
think is necessary and then do a little
bit<00:01:40.860> more<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:42.180> we're<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.659> started

bit more so we're going to get started

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.760 
bit more so we're going to get started
by<00:01:44.700> taking<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.810> tail<00:01:46.290> end<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.710> your

that's<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.450> working<00:01:51.810> end<00:01:51.930> okay<00:01:52.759> now<00:01:53.759> you're

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
that's the working end okay now you're

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.490 
that's the working end okay now you're
going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.090> take<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.540> needle<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.259> go

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
going to take this needle and go

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.389 
going to take this needle and go
underneath<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.610> loop<00:01:56.790> that's<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.210> your<00:01:57.360> thumb

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
underneath the loop that's on your thumb

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.959 
underneath the loop that's on your thumb
bring<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.579> loop<00:01:59.820> over<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.670> loop<00:02:02.670> that's<00:02:02.820> on

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
bring that loop over the loop that's on

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.810 
bring that loop over the loop that's on
the<00:02:03.090> index<00:02:03.360> finger<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:04.369> there<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.460> go

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the index finger and there you go

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.589 
the index finger and there you go
just<00:02:06.210> pull<00:02:06.450> your<00:02:06.570> ends<00:02:06.930> very<00:02:07.740> simple<00:02:08.569> well<00:02:09.569> I

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
just pull your ends very simple well I

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.479 
just pull your ends very simple well I
say<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.560> was<00:02:10.679> actually<00:02:10.860> really<00:02:11.340> hard

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
say that but it was actually really hard

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.740 
say that but it was actually really hard
for<00:02:11.730> me<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.910> learn<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.420> we'll<00:02:12.569> do<00:02:12.720> it

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
for me to learn this so we'll do it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.550 
for me to learn this so we'll do it
again

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
again

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.080 
again
okay<00:02:15.170> reach<00:02:16.170> under<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.890> into<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.670> loop<00:02:17.880> on

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
okay reach under and into the loop on

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.089 
okay reach under and into the loop on
the<00:02:18.180> left<00:02:18.420> thumb<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.470> now<00:02:19.590> you've<00:02:19.739> got<00:02:19.920> that

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
the left thumb so now you've got that

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.040 
the left thumb so now you've got that
now<00:02:22.400> bring<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.540> through<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.720> loop<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.020> just

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
now bring that through the loop you just

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:32.390 
now bring that through the loop you just
created<00:02:26.420> one<00:02:27.420> more<00:02:28.080> time<00:02:30.650> reach<00:02:31.650> under<00:02:32.099> and

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
created one more time reach under and

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.759 
created one more time reach under and
into<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:32.970> loop<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.450> left<00:02:33.660> thumb<00:02:33.930> pull<00:02:34.590> it

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
into the loop on the left thumb pull it

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.960 
into the loop on the left thumb pull it
up<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:37.019> then<00:02:37.470> bring<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.430> loop<00:02:38.610> that's<00:02:38.819> on

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
up and then bring the loop that's on

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.400 
up and then bring the loop that's on
your<00:02:39.120> index<00:02:39.390> finger<00:02:39.720> through<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.110> loop<00:02:40.260> you

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
your index finger through the loop you

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.750 
your index finger through the loop you
just<00:02:40.440> created<00:02:40.650> with<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.430> thumb<00:02:41.610> loop<00:02:43.760> and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
just created with the thumb loop and

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.820 
just created with the thumb loop and
that<00:02:45.269> shadow<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.690> just<00:02:45.959> saw<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:46.380> my<00:02:46.590> cat
