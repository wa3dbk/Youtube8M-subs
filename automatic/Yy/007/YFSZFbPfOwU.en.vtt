00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.900
 very good children welcome to one 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.640
 after mainquÃ© the faith 1.9 as you see 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.410
 we have a video that has left us 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.810
 money with the tweet you want in 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.490
 screen that is basically a joke in 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.200
 the one that says they're perfectly fine 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.300
 and well balanced as you are seeing 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.670
 this skeleton is the same as we saw the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.470
 another day in the other gif that is also 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.080
 it is true but in this case as 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.910
 you see the bow has it lowered some 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.400
 they even shoot but he was the colossus 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.320
 of 3 lowered in this case it was like already 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.750
 tensed in this case are still 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.300
 not sheltered things or is it supposed that the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.250
 bow is going to look like it tenses when the 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.480
 that the dow I ended up shooting in addition 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.550
 it's also there for us it depends 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.710
 that this will not happen obviously but 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.020
 it could possibly happen because at 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.579
 it can be an enchantment of the 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.250
 arch that allows you to have a 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.010
 machine gun basically could be is 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.440
 very possible because if you could you can 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.020
 with motorcycles because they are elements of that 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.040
 Maybe maybe who knows, I do not expect that 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.960
 because you found a skeleton of 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.460
 sahagun arc of those that in this case 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.990
 I'm seeing that it does not seem to be 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.060
 delighted, take it out safely, take a boom 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.470
 but imagine that it is an enchantment and 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.270
 it still has not put the 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.759
 Decanting effect and 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.560
 equity a thousand things could happen no but 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.539
 It is also one of the things that is not 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.219
 he wants to teach we will say this morning 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.619
 just so we can see that now the 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.570
 the arch is lowered the arch will start 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.939
 tense when he finishes fixing 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.560
 and that basically has changed a little bit 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.780
 it came from the tweet because basically it's a 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.280
 foolishness teach it but basically a 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.649
 couple of previous tweets what's going 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.659
 saying is that the mode in 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.610
 the one that we use the objects is worth 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.229
 this case the objects begin to be 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.060
 entities although they remain in 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.759
 our hand or something like that and that of that 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.739
 way it will fix a bus that is the 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.179
 from when you ate one thing for example 

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:54.069
 an apple that ate two times 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.709
 Well, that would be a bug that would only come 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.420
 with that and apart from the bow that tells you 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.670
 also when I'm going to use it 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.049
 skeleton et cetera not then good by 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.209
 I'm pretty good and the truth is that 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.579
 It is a change that money has gone 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.769
 come here to this and then we will see another 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:12.340
 little thing that is from search vale in which 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:14.270
 they ask him if they are also going to 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.640
 let say 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.280
 to edit the attributes that the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.170
 spells on weapons and so on in 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.580
 the secondary weapons to the modes and 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.200
 you know I will explain a little why 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.030
 says this is true even though explaining a 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.460
 little bit bad but good or good I'm going to 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.230
 explain well what you mean in this 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.600
 what happens is that when we have a weapon 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.770
 in the hand or we have the same basically 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.910
 a weapon in your hands is worth you know that 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.220
 the weapon may have different 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.930
 effects may be that it has a blow or that 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.180
 have such not then what is 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.270
 refers is if you have two weapons and you have 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.600
 hit or two in one and push three in another 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.220
 when hitting with one happens the respect to 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.230
 the time because they affect both at the same 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.670
 player while he has that weapon 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.370
 put in the hand then I would like 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.800
 I would like to say this that maybe a 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.140
 same weapon could have both effects 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.030
 having the two weapons put to it 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.890
 time in hand and this is something that 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.570
 assumes that it is being modified so that 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.630
 do not pass either in the players nor 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.090
 in the modes it's ok and then we have another 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.830
 little thing that I do not know if I have around here I have 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.170
 what are you looking for that would be this other 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.060
 over here go to what found that good 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.920
 It is a picture that also left us the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.640
 another day in the last exposes the one that dares 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.190
 that just 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.860
 minutes later this photo but 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.100
 It's practically nothing new 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.630
 since the admonished could have the 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.990
 objects in each hand in this case then 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.140
 what he did was teach that in the mox 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.390
 They can also have several objects 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.370
 in several hands, not, for example, this 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.920
 skeleton that has an iron sword 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.860
 and at the same time it also has a poppy 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.900
 tulip better said in the other then 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.000
 this means that for example 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.739
 skeletons can come to appear with 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.810
 several different objects in the hand 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.180
 it might be an art a sword or 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.950
 a sword and another thing or a sword and a 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.260
 shield imagine skeletons with sword and 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.510
 shield follow them and in the cane but good 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.500
 this is the pillage of vouchers guys from 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.019
 moment then this is what we have 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.130
 I hope you've been a lot see you 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.560
 in the next video let's hope that 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.860
 let's have more is therefore and even 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.860
 musicians
