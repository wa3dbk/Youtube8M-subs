you just pull it out so I'm going to

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.470 
you just pull it out so I'm going to
pick<00:03:09.380> it<00:03:09.470> out<00:03:10.390> as<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.630> see<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:12.940> my<00:03:13.940> old<00:03:14.239> water

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
pick it out as you see that my old water

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.660 
pick it out as you see that my old water
heater<00:03:14.599> is<00:03:15.080> 57<00:03:15.799> inches<00:03:16.100> tall<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.560> new<00:03:18.799> one

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
heater is 57 inches tall and the new one

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.319 
heater is 57 inches tall and the new one
is<00:03:19.910> about<00:03:20.150> 50<00:03:21.079> inches<00:03:21.590> tall<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:22.670> we<00:03:22.880> got<00:03:23.120> a

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
is about 50 inches tall so we got a

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.660 
is about 50 inches tall so we got a
problem

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
problem

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.080 
problem
so<00:03:25.670> as<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.480> DIY<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.489> just<00:03:28.489> wanted<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:28.880> share

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
so as the DIY I just wanted to share

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.849 
so as the DIY I just wanted to share
with<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.299> you<00:03:29.720> can<00:03:30.560> do<00:03:31.190> things<00:03:31.519> yourself<00:03:32.859> you

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
with you you can do things yourself you

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.170 
with you you can do things yourself you
don't<00:03:34.069> have<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.519> be<00:03:34.640> really<00:03:34.910> handy<00:03:35.090> man<00:03:36.010> you

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
don't have to be really handy man you

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.220 
don't have to be really handy man you
definitely<00:03:38.180> have<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.420> have<00:03:38.600> a<00:03:38.720> knowledge<00:03:38.959> of

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
definitely have to have a knowledge of

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.770 
definitely have to have a knowledge of
for<00:03:39.560> gas<00:03:39.859> by<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.280> printer<00:03:40.760> if<00:03:41.000> you're<00:03:41.359> working

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
for gas by a printer if you're working

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.289 
for gas by a printer if you're working
the<00:03:41.930> gas<00:03:42.139> you<00:03:42.889> just<00:03:43.130> don't<00:03:43.430> want<00:03:43.700> into<00:03:43.910> safety

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
the gas you just don't want into safety

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.530 
the gas you just don't want into safety
is<00:03:44.359> the<00:03:44.480> number<00:03:44.720> one<00:03:44.750> priority<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:47.180> don't

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
is the number one priority so you don't

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.569 
is the number one priority so you don't
want<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.170> do<00:03:48.319> any<00:03:48.590> shortcut<00:03:49.130> with<00:03:49.370> the

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
want it to do any shortcut with the

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.750 
want it to do any shortcut with the
electrical<00:03:50.180> or<00:03:50.480> gas<00:03:50.769> so<00:03:51.769> those<00:03:52.100> are<00:03:52.280> safeties

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
electrical or gas so those are safeties

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.780 
electrical or gas so those are safeties
are<00:03:52.970> always<00:03:53.660> should<00:03:54.440> be<00:03:54.650> on<00:03:54.859> the<00:03:55.069> top<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.609> the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
are always should be on the top of the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.840 
are always should be on the top of the
list<00:03:56.000> before<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:57.049> work<00:03:57.410> on<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:58.069> these

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
list before you work on it and these

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.210 
list before you work on it and these
things<00:03:59.180> aren't<00:03:59.420> sharing<00:03:59.720> with<00:04:00.019> you<00:04:00.170> that<00:04:00.560> the

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
things aren't sharing with you that the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.430 
things aren't sharing with you that the
people's<00:04:01.609> like<00:04:01.850> me<00:04:02.120> who<00:04:02.450> needs<00:04:02.720> a<00:04:02.959> head<00:04:03.139> start

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
people's like me who needs a head start

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.460 
people's like me who needs a head start
and<00:04:03.709> they<00:04:03.920> can<00:04:04.130> work<00:04:04.370> them<00:04:04.639> solve<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:06.200> in<00:04:06.319> this

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
and they can work them solve so in this

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.650 
and they can work them solve so in this
case<00:04:06.739> I<00:04:06.980> got<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.190> big<00:04:07.430> difference<00:04:08.299> of<00:04:08.480> six

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
case I got a big difference of six

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.040 
case I got a big difference of six
inches<00:04:08.840> gap<00:04:09.200> so<00:04:09.680> what<00:04:09.829> I<00:04:09.859> did

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
inches gap so what I did

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.830 
inches gap so what I did
I<00:04:12.080> had<00:04:12.800> existing<00:04:13.460> frame<00:04:13.760> I<00:04:14.120> built<00:04:14.690> another

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
I had existing frame I built another

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.340 
I had existing frame I built another
frame<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:15.770> put<00:04:16.160> a<00:04:16.190> 2x4<00:04:16.430> on<00:04:17.060> this<00:04:17.270> side<00:04:17.480> 2x4<00:04:18.200> on

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
frame I put a 2x4 on this side 2x4 on

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.700 
frame I put a 2x4 on this side 2x4 on
that<00:04:18.530> side<00:04:18.830> I<00:04:19.209> put<00:04:21.940> my<00:04:22.940> plywood<00:04:23.270> up<00:04:23.630> here<00:04:23.990> then

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
that side I put my plywood up here then

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.260 
that side I put my plywood up here then
I<00:04:24.830> put<00:04:25.010> another<00:04:25.040> piece<00:04:25.520> then<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:26.030> put<00:04:26.240> another

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
I put another piece then I put another

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.850 
I put another piece then I put another
solid<00:04:27.760> these<00:04:28.760> now<00:04:29.330> is<00:04:29.510> a<00:04:29.540> stable<00:04:30.110> up<00:04:30.230> here<00:04:30.530> and

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
solid these now is a stable up here and

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.060 
solid these now is a stable up here and
still<00:04:31.460> I'm<00:04:31.730> lagging<00:04:32.120> out<00:04:32.450> difference<00:04:33.410> about

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
still I'm lagging out difference about

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.580 
still I'm lagging out difference about
one<00:04:34.280> inch<00:04:34.810> so<00:04:35.810> what<00:04:35.990> I'm<00:04:36.080> going<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.290> be<00:04:36.410> using

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
one inch so what I'm going to be using

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.100 
one inch so what I'm going to be using

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
things are aligned my water heater is

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.300 
things are aligned my water heater is
aligned<00:04:55.250> to<00:04:55.460> my<00:04:55.640> pipe<00:04:55.940> lines<00:04:56.450> once<00:04:57.350> I<00:04:57.590> put

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
aligned to my pipe lines once I put

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.230 
aligned to my pipe lines once I put
those<00:04:58.550> up<00:04:59.500> joints<00:05:00.500> back<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:01.490> important<00:05:02.000> part

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569 
going to put these on my coupling and

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.359 
going to put these on my coupling and
once<00:06:43.569> I<00:06:43.719> put<00:06:43.899> this<00:06:44.050> on<00:06:44.289> I'm<00:06:44.559> going<00:06:44.800> to<00:06:44.919> start<00:06:45.219> it

00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:45.369

before<00:06:45.909> I<00:06:46.180> start<00:06:46.599> it<00:06:47.009> again<00:06:48.009> safety<00:06:48.699> is<00:06:48.909> number

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
before I start it again safety is number

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.409 
before I start it again safety is number
one<00:06:49.389> priority<00:06:49.599> on<00:06:50.319> easy<00:06:51.009> steps<00:06:51.399> so<00:06:52.059> you<00:06:52.089> have

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
one priority on easy steps so you have

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:55.949
