the<00:01:47.070> music<00:01:47.369> industry<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.970> think<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.600> of

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the music industry I think it is of

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.660 
the music industry I think it is of
course<00:01:49.079> like<00:01:49.290> pretty<00:01:49.530> standard<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> think

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
course like pretty standard but I think

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.630 
course like pretty standard but I think
I<00:01:50.790> think<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.270> try<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.630> sound<00:01:52.409> unique<00:01:52.979> you

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
I think if you try to sound unique you

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.429 
I think if you try to sound unique you
can<00:01:53.790> always<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.240> adapt<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.020> sounds

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
can always like adapt to the sounds

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.139 
can always like adapt to the sounds
which<00:01:55.619> are<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:55.860> popular<00:01:56.729> right<00:01:56.939> now<00:01:56.969> but

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
which are like popular right now but

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.929 
which are like popular right now but
give<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.750> your<00:01:57.960> own<00:01:58.049> twist<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.740> work<00:01:59.640> hard

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939

just like like always look look at look

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.709 
just like like always look look at look
at<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> tracks<00:02:02.520> what<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.000> think<00:02:03.299> sounds<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
at the tracks what you think sounds the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.749 
at the tracks what you think sounds the
best<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.259> try<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.920> come<00:02:05.189> as<00:02:05.340> close<00:02:05.490> as

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
best and try to come as close as

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.910 
best and try to come as close as
possible<00:02:05.820> that's<00:02:06.479> how<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.689> tried<00:02:07.079> I've<00:02:07.890> tried

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
possible that's how we tried I've tried

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.919 
possible that's how we tried I've tried
to<00:02:08.250> do<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.819> still<00:02:08.970> try<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.270> do

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
to do it and still try to do

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.110 
to do it and still try to do
right<00:02:10.349> now<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.799> think<00:02:11.189> that<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.670> would<00:02:12.090> really

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
right now I think that that would really

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.369 
right now I think that that would really
work<00:02:13.159> nothing<00:02:14.159> to<00:02:14.840> compare<00:02:15.840> yourself<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
work nothing to compare yourself to the

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.860 
work nothing to compare yourself to the
best<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.920> then<00:02:17.099> try<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.459> know<00:02:18.299> try<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:18.629> match

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
best and then try to know try to match

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.979 
best and then try to know try to match
that<00:02:18.900> as<00:02:19.200> well<00:02:19.379> as<00:02:19.500> possible<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.819> after<00:02:21.540> all

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989
