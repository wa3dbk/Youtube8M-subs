is<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.649> they're<00:01:58.829> very<00:01:58.860> tight<00:01:59.579> they<00:02:00.420> look

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
is that they're very tight they look

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.120

loose<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.890> they're<00:02:02.070> not<00:02:02.219> really<00:02:02.280> stretch
