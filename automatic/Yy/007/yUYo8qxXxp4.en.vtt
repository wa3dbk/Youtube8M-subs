00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
hard I barely made it through this part

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
made it to its kind of weird like

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.020 
made it to its kind of weird like
sometimes<00:01:04.290> let<00:01:04.470> us<00:01:04.559> get<00:01:04.739> unloaded<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> like

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
sometimes let us get unloaded on it like

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.160 
sometimes let us get unloaded on it like
he's<00:01:06.630> kind<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.520> flaky<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.670> acts<00:01:09.479> randomly

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
he's kind of flaky and acts randomly

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.050 
he's kind of flaky and acts randomly
like<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> human<00:01:10.680> would<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.549> seems<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:11.909> but

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
like a human would it seems like but

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.289 
like a human would it seems like but
that's<00:01:12.390> not<00:01:12.540> coming<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.930> yet<00:01:13.110> huh<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.799> uh<00:01:17.299> in

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that's not coming up yet huh so uh in

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.730 
that's not coming up yet huh so uh in
the<00:01:18.360> previous<00:01:18.659> videos<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.259> talked<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> lot<00:01:19.680> about

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the previous videos I talked a lot about

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.060 
the previous videos I talked a lot about
the<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.869> kind<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.080> ammo<00:01:22.380> types<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.950> I'm

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the the kind of ammo types that I'm

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.850 
the the kind of ammo types that I'm
wanting<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.880> use<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.320> first<00:01:25.590> couple

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
wanting to use and for that first couple

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.440 
wanting to use and for that first couple
missions<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.369> still<00:01:26.640> think<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.850> using<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
missions I still think that using the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.840 
missions I still think that using the
flame<00:01:27.869> ammo<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.799> incendiary<00:01:29.100> ammo<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
flame ammo the incendiary ammo is the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.490 
flame ammo the incendiary ammo is the
best<00:01:30.000> way<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.930> because<00:01:31.229> they<00:01:31.380> have

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
best way to go just because they have

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.910 
best way to go just because they have
regenerating<00:01:32.070> health<00:01:32.869> but<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.079> lot<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.829> people

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
regenerating health but a lot of people

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.819 
regenerating health but a lot of people
really<00:01:35.400> recommended<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.270> cryo<00:01:37.140> ammo<00:01:37.619> for

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
really recommended the cryo ammo for

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.649 
really recommended the cryo ammo for
when<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.280> later<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> game<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
when you get later in the game and the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.749 
when you get later in the game and the
team<00:01:40.170> cryo<00:01:40.619> whammo<00:01:41.009> specifically<00:01:41.579> because

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
team cryo whammo specifically because

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.440 
team cryo whammo specifically because
what<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.030> does<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.540> freezes<00:01:43.430> everybody

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
what that does is that freezes everybody

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.399 
what that does is that freezes everybody
like<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> couple<00:01:46.320> shots<00:01:46.350> into<00:01:46.799> him

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
like if you get a couple shots into him

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.399 
like if you get a couple shots into him
they<00:01:49.369> freeze<00:01:50.329> and<00:01:50.689> then<00:01:50.810> like<00:01:51.020> one<00:01:51.200> or<00:01:51.319> two

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
they freeze and then like one or two

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.010 
they freeze and then like one or two
more<00:01:51.530> shots<00:01:51.770> will<00:01:52.100> destroy<00:01:52.729> them<00:01:52.999> just<00:01:53.929> like

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
more shots will destroy them just like

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.700 
more shots will destroy them just like
shattering<00:01:54.530> cool<00:01:55.219> and<00:01:55.939> when<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:57.409> get<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.619> the

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
shattering cool and when you get to the

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.319 
shattering cool and when you get to the
fourth<00:01:57.950> level<00:01:58.189> of<00:01:58.399> that<00:01:58.549> you<00:01:58.819> have<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.030> option

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
fourth level of that you have the option

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.179 
fourth level of that you have the option
to<00:01:59.390> have<00:01:59.509> it<00:01:59.659> do<00:01:59.810> more<00:02:00.079> damage<00:02:00.319> or<00:02:00.710> have

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
to have it do more damage or have

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.219 
to have it do more damage or have

as far as i could tell this is not
really<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.299> the<00:02:29.360> game<00:02:29.750> well<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.799> take<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.250> back

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
really in the game well I take that back

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.710 
really in the game well I take that back
it<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.730> in<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:31.970> game<00:02:32.150> now<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.510> started

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
it is in the game now that I started

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.030 
it is in the game now that I started
looking<00:02:32.870> for<00:02:33.200> but<00:02:33.379> I<00:02:33.410> didn't<00:02:33.620> really<00:02:33.709> read

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
looking for but I didn't really read

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.990 
looking for but I didn't really read
enough<00:02:34.280> into<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.730> my<00:02:35.000> first<00:02:35.269> time<00:02:35.420> through<00:02:35.690> to

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
enough into it my first time through to

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.670 
enough into it my first time through to
understand<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.180> but<00:02:38.390> different<00:02:39.079> weapons<00:02:39.440> do

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
understand it but different weapons do

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.030 
understand it but different weapons do
different<00:02:40.129> amounts<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.489> damage<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:42.040> different

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
different amounts of damage to different

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.390 
different amounts of damage to different
parts<00:02:43.629> two<00:02:44.629> different<00:02:44.930> types<00:02:45.079> of<00:02:45.260> health<00:02:45.530> so

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
parts two different types of health so

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.890 
parts two different types of health so
you<00:02:47.209> can<00:02:47.390> see<00:02:47.599> these<00:02:47.810> guys<00:02:48.019> have<00:02:48.260> shields<00:02:49.900> and

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
you can see these guys have shields and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.520 
you can see these guys have shields and
then<00:02:51.680> there's<00:02:51.859> also<00:02:51.970> armor<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.230> barrier<00:02:54.230> and

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
then there's also armor and barrier and

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.970 
then there's also armor and barrier and
health<00:02:56.049> okay<00:02:57.049> so<00:02:57.109> they<00:02:57.349> can<00:02:57.470> have<00:02:57.560> like<00:02:57.709> four

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
health okay so they can have like four

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.390 
health okay so they can have like four
layers<00:02:58.370> of<00:02:58.880> health<00:02:59.299> stacked<00:03:00.190> if<00:03:01.190> you're

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
layers of health stacked if you're

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.170 
layers of health stacked if you're
playing<00:03:01.609> a<00:03:01.730> soldier<00:03:02.440> use<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.470> shotgun<00:03:04.220> or<00:03:04.700> an

barriers<00:03:09.340> use<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.370> pistol<00:03:10.790> or<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.209> sniper

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
barriers use a pistol or a sniper

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.360 
barriers use a pistol or a sniper
against<00:03:13.069> armor<00:03:14.799> and<00:03:15.799> then<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.040> different

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
against armor and then the different

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.000 
against armor and then the different
types<00:03:16.579> of<00:03:16.730> ammo<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:17.299> can<00:03:17.450> use<00:03:17.630> also<00:03:18.010> or

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
types of ammo that you can use also or

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.039 
types of ammo that you can use also or
more<00:03:19.459> effective<00:03:19.970> or<00:03:20.090> less<00:03:20.269> effective<00:03:20.720> versus

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
I'm not sure I i know that some enemies

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.120 
I'm not sure I i know that some enemies
can<00:03:38.690> use<00:03:38.930> like<00:03:39.169> they<00:03:39.500> have<00:03:39.680> their<00:03:39.799> own<00:03:39.859> special

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
powers that will let them regenerate

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.780 
powers that will let them regenerate
shields<00:03:41.959> um<00:03:42.370> but<00:03:43.370> they<00:03:43.489> don't<00:03:43.669> just

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
shields um but they don't just

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.350 
shields um but they don't just

enemies<00:03:53.370> will<00:03:53.850> regenerate<00:03:54.150> health<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.750> don't

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
enemies will regenerate health I don't

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.900 
enemies will regenerate health I don't
know<00:03:55.680> it's<00:03:56.100> all<00:03:56.250> different<00:03:56.430> throughout<00:03:56.790> the

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
know it's all different throughout the

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.130 
know it's all different throughout the
game<00:03:57.030> okay<00:03:57.750> but<00:03:58.350> um<00:03:59.540> yeah<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.570> found<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:00.870> really

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
game okay but um yeah I found a really

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.930 
game okay but um yeah I found a really
it's<00:04:01.410> it's<00:04:01.710> kind<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.310> complicated<00:04:02.490> when<00:04:02.880> you

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
it's it's kind of complicated when you

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.280 
it's it's kind of complicated when you
first<00:04:03.150> look<00:04:03.360> at<00:04:03.480> it<00:04:03.540> but<00:04:03.720> there's<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:03.960> really

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
first look at it but there's a really

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.640 
first look at it but there's a really
good<00:04:05.090> table<00:04:06.090> laying<00:04:06.510> out<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.410> amount<00:04:07.590> of

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
good table laying out the amount of

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.590 
good table laying out the amount of
damage<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.010> every<00:04:08.310> weapon<00:04:08.430> does<00:04:08.790> they're

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
damage that every weapon does they're

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.690 
damage that every weapon does they're
like<00:04:09.990> bonuses<00:04:10.440> versus<00:04:11.070> different<00:04:11.400> kinds<00:04:11.610> of

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
like bonuses versus different kinds of

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.290 
like bonuses versus different kinds of
armor<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.600> all<00:04:12.660> that<00:04:12.810> kind<00:04:13.020> of<00:04:13.050> stuff<00:04:14.209> for<00:04:15.209> all

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
the different it's hard to explain but

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.800 
the different it's hard to explain but
I'm<00:04:20.730> on<00:04:21.329> game<00:04:21.989> fa<00:04:22.290> ques<00:04:23.480> there's<00:04:24.480> just<00:04:24.660> it's

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
just a large image that kind of lays out

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.850 
just a large image that kind of lays out
every<00:04:27.780> single<00:04:27.930> weapon<00:04:28.200> in<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.500> game<00:04:28.650> and

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
every single weapon in the game and

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:38.080 
every single weapon in the game and
explains<00:04:29.820> it<00:04:29.940> all<00:04:30.030> really<00:04:30.240> well<00:04:31.250> nice<00:04:35.000> yeah<00:04:36.000> so

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
explains it all really well nice yeah so

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
explains it all really well nice yeah so
basically<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.480> whole<00:04:39.570> point<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:40.080> is

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
basically the whole point of that is

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.040 
basically the whole point of that is
that<00:04:42.890> you<00:04:44.210> later<00:04:45.210> on<00:04:45.300> there's<00:04:45.810> going<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:46.020> be

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
that you later on there's going to be

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.940 
that you later on there's going to be
points<00:04:46.530> where<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:47.160> need<00:04:47.430> to<00:04:48.650> kill<00:04:49.650> more

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
points where you need to kill more

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.100 
points where you need to kill more
efficiently<00:04:50.570> because<00:04:51.570> it'll<00:04:51.870> just<00:04:51.990> be<00:04:52.080> a

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
efficiently because it'll just be a

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.800 
efficiently because it'll just be a
bunch<00:04:52.350> of<00:04:52.470> guys<00:04:52.530> rushing<00:04:53.070> you<00:04:53.220> or<00:04:53.660> there<00:04:54.660> will

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
bunch of guys rushing you or there will

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:02.780 
bunch of guys rushing you or there will
be<00:05:00.590> just<00:05:01.590> points<00:05:01.950> where<00:05:02.130> you<00:05:02.340> have<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:02.610> kill

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
be just points where you have to kill

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.200 
be just points where you have to kill
pastor<00:05:03.030> I<00:05:03.390> guess<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:04.850> even<00:05:05.850> though<00:05:05.970> you<00:05:06.030> might

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
pastor I guess and even though you might

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.990 
pastor I guess and even though you might
be<00:05:06.390> able<00:05:06.479> to<00:05:06.630> hold<00:05:06.750> off<00:05:06.990> on<00:05:07.020> your<00:05:07.380> own<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:08.000> ammo

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
be able to hold off on your own and ammo

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.490 
be able to hold off on your own and ammo
might<00:05:09.180> not<00:05:09.330> be<00:05:09.450> an<00:05:09.570> issue<00:05:09.690> just<00:05:09.900> need<00:05:10.200> to<00:05:10.320> kill

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
might not be an issue just need to kill

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.219 
might not be an issue just need to kill
faster<00:05:10.740> um<00:05:11.479> which<00:05:12.479> I<00:05:12.600> didn't<00:05:12.840> really<00:05:12.930> do<00:05:13.200> on

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
faster um which I didn't really do on

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:18.200 
faster um which I didn't really do on
this<00:05:13.560> up<00:05:14.400> until<00:05:14.790> the<00:05:15.390> next<00:05:16.850> acquiring<00:05:17.850> mission

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
this up until the next acquiring mission

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.719 
this up until the next acquiring mission
so<00:05:18.930> right<00:05:19.140> now<00:05:19.169> that<00:05:19.590> big<00:05:19.890> mech<00:05:20.160> is<00:05:20.370> shooting

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
so right now that big mech is shooting

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.250 
so right now that big mech is shooting
all<00:05:20.850> the<00:05:20.880> other<00:05:21.120> guys<00:05:21.360> because<00:05:21.660> I<00:05:21.780> hacked<00:05:22.080> him

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
all the other guys because I hacked him

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.490 
all the other guys because I hacked him
before<00:05:22.620> nice

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.740
