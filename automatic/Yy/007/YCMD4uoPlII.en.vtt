drak it's about 140 years old that's

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.630 
drak it's about 140 years old that's
what<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.500> game<00:00:14.990> came<00:00:15.990> from<00:00:16.200> it's<00:00:16.950> a<00:00:17.100> bed<00:00:17.430> over

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
what the game came from it's a bed over

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.800 
what the game came from it's a bed over
to<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.790> side<00:00:17.970> like<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.240> because<00:00:18.690> they

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
to the side like that because they

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.810 
to the side like that because they
played<00:00:19.529> indoors<00:00:19.860> again<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.279> balls<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:20.760> a

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
played indoors again the balls in a

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.269 
played indoors again the balls in a
floor<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.360> they<00:00:21.480> thought<00:00:21.950> they'd<00:00:22.950> keep<00:00:23.160> it

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
floor so they thought they'd keep it

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.950 
floor so they thought they'd keep it
from<00:00:23.400> banging<00:00:23.790> into<00:00:24.000> those<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.540> walls<00:00:24.750> and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
from banging into those the walls and

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.839 
from banging into those the walls and
floors<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.500> also<00:00:25.740> they<00:00:25.920> used<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.310> lot<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.580> slice

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
floors and also they used a lot of slice

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.429 
floors and also they used a lot of slice
so<00:00:27.210> they<00:00:27.329> thought<00:00:27.509> by<00:00:27.720> expanding<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.320> head

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
so they thought by expanding the head

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.220 
so they thought by expanding the head
side<00:00:28.650> over<00:00:28.860> that<00:00:29.009> way<00:00:29.220> they<00:00:29.820> get<00:00:29.970> more<00:00:30.239> surface

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
side over that way they get more surface

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.670 
side over that way they get more surface
straight<00:00:32.220> surface<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.820> ball<00:00:32.970> the<00:00:33.680> it's

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
straight surface on the ball the it's

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.200 
straight surface on the ball the it's
got<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> knotted<00:00:35.250> string<00:00:35.520> pattern<00:00:35.910> which<00:00:36.060> was

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
got a knotted string pattern which was

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.710 
got a knotted string pattern which was
not<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.290> much<00:00:37.470> for<00:00:37.649> temperature<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.570> keep<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
not so much for temperature but keep the

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.660 
not so much for temperature but keep the
main<00:00:40.079> strings<00:00:40.380> taught<00:00:40.710> because<00:00:41.309> they<00:00:41.489> didn't

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
main strings taught because they didn't

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.049 
main strings taught because they didn't
have<00:00:41.760> tensioners<00:00:42.300> like<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.929> have<00:00:43.079> now<00:00:43.289> and

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
have tensioners like we have now and

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.509 
have tensioners like we have now and
it's<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.239> one-piece<00:00:45.719> ash<00:00:46.079> bent<00:00:46.739> 15<00:00:47.160> frame

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
it's a one-piece ash bent 15 frame

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.259 
it's a one-piece ash bent 15 frame
they'd<00:00:48.210> put<00:00:48.449> in<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:49.309> boiler<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.579> boil<00:00:51.179> it

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
they'd put in a boiler and boil it

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.090 
they'd put in a boiler and boil it
actually<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:51.899> bring<00:00:52.500> out<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.800> what

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
actually and then bring out that what

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.009 
actually and then bring out that what
they<00:00:53.190> called<00:00:53.370> sticks<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.300> then<00:00:54.539> wrap<00:00:54.870> them

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
they called sticks and then wrap them

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:05.780 
they called sticks and then wrap them
around<00:00:55.109> a<00:00:55.410> mold<00:01:04.220> well<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> game<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.610> tennis

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
around a mold well the game of tennis

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.870
