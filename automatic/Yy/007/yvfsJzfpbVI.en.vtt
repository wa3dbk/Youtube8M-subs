 urania astronomy and astronautics newsletter edited by the institute

 national astrophysicist

 pinu remote past jupiter if perhaps ate a fearsome rival face and the 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.390
 conclusion reached by a group of researchers who simulated al 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.309
 computer stages of planet formation in our solar system 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:29.639
 among the objectives to understand why jupiter even though it is the largest planet 

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:34.809
 gaseous of the system we have solid core all in all small compared to 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.260
 that of his neighbor Saturn 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.420
 the simulations started by assuming that at the beginning of his training 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.499
 about 4 billion years ago 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:46.530
 Jupiter, I was a rocky body 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.970
 with its attraction plants have attracted if the gas ec at the time 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.100
 employment in the surrounding regions 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.210
 until it became a huge gas giant with a solid core in the middle 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.449
 but during this growth phase 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.579
 Jupiter would have suffered the impact with another rocky body 10 times the size 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.560
 our planet the body in less than 1 hour would have sunk into his 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.840
 gazzo atmosphere use sina collide with the core I love most of the core yes 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.060
 it would thus be pulverized by dispersing sinergas or overlying 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.189
 this is why the solid heart of Jupiter is smaller than that of 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.670
 Saturn 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.100
 from underlined as this scenario if result of a horse simulation only 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.380
 one of the possible explanations 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.530
 but if things really went that way 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.380
 then Jupiter would have swallowed a rival of his 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.130
 without flight, the other rocky planet would have become his own 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.409
 once a gas giant in full struggle to become the greatest man 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.490
 good star that emits more energy than in theory if it can afford 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.840
 this is the discovery of the still orbiting telescope that he left of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.400
 astronomers putty 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.380
 the protagonist euronova is a small star but white dwarf 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.120
 come back to me we could define that much bigger star as explosive one 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.060
 red giant me2 revolve around the lance in a very narrow orbit and la

 periodically it happens that the gas formed by accumulating yes et i sent

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:37.239
 made the phenomenon certainly energetic but up to now not 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.189
 he believed he could even produce gamma radiation 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.819
 characteristic of the most catastrophic events in the universe 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.689
 hypothesis and that the magnetic field of the white hand environmental conditions 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.179
 highly energetic particles emitted during the explosion 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:56.499
 before they could free themselves they would reach speeds close to 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:58.829
 those of light 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.189
 once the drink would have clashed with other particles that of the wind 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.650
 stellar of the red giant this clash would have given rise to the rays 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.400
 range and tested by stopping the discovery require a revision of the theories 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.400
 at 9 o'clock 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:20.809
 if a background lights contact to say yes that our computer has discovered the 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:23.989
 stella pulsar we could think of a joke 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.980
 and perhaps the American Corbin spouses really thought so even though they are 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.090
 offline 262000 volunteers who have joined the einstein program here 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:40.239
 participating in the program means nothing more than installing a software e 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.639
 let it run a little like a screen sever every time 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.919
 we leave our computer on but unused 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.459
 in the specific case and software was analyzing the data of radio observations 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.729
 performed with the antennas of the observatory diares i bought in 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:04:00.079
 Puerto Rican was able to recognize the pulsating signals related to 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.329
 this particular type of star 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.420
 it is the first time that an astronomical object is discovered through 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.549
 this system of computer volunteers 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.400
 and with this it is all from the editorial staff of urania a good continuation 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.510
