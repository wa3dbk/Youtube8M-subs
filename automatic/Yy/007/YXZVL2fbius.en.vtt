and underneath that you can see there's

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.990 
and underneath that you can see there's
a<00:01:19.110> torch<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.740> illuminate<00:01:20.340> whatever<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.729> happen

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
a torch to illuminate whatever I happen

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.640 
a torch to illuminate whatever I happen
to<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.119> doing<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> time<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.140> chest<00:01:22.439> which

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
to be doing the time and a chest which

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.620 
to be doing the time and a chest which
has<00:01:22.799> nothing<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.159> at<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> moment<00:01:23.580> but<00:01:24.450> you

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
has nothing in at the moment but you

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.390 
has nothing in at the moment but you
could<00:01:24.810> put<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.500> whatever<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.009> want<00:01:26.189> and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
could put in it whatever you want and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.130 
could put in it whatever you want and
then<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.790> close<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.659> back<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:27.900> again

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
then just close it back up again

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
then just close it back up again
afterwards<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.159> no<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:29.460> knows<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.909> it's

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
afterwards so no one knows that it's

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.080 
afterwards so no one knows that it's
there<00:01:30.979> now<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.130> worked<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.400> lot<00:01:32.520> bit<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.790> sand

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
there now this worked a lot bit of sand

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.880 
there now this worked a lot bit of sand
because<00:01:33.630> as<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.930> know<00:01:33.960> grass<00:01:34.290> needs<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.619> grow

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
because as you know grass needs to grow

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.859 
because as you know grass needs to grow
so<00:01:35.430> if<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> look<00:01:35.970> I've<00:01:36.240> marked<00:01:36.689> that

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
so if we have a look I've marked that

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.179 
so if we have a look I've marked that
spot<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.350> another<00:01:37.590> block<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.860> sand<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.159> top

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
spot with another block of sand on top

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and to the passerby on it above you know

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.190 
and to the passerby on it above you know
a<00:01:41.280> full<00:01:41.640> beach<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.509> not<00:01:42.659> going<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:42.990> as

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
a full beach it's not going to be as

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.310 
a full beach it's not going to be as
noticeable<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.670> also<00:01:44.820> see<00:01:45.180> smoke<00:01:46.140> on

noticeable but you can also see smoke on
at<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.500> top<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.890> occasionally<00:01:48.320> we<00:01:49.320> wait

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
at the top of it occasionally we wait

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.859 
at the top of it occasionally we wait
patiently<00:01:49.890> see<00:01:50.220> comes<00:01:50.490> out<00:01:50.610> there<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.810> you

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
need to be careful with that problem but

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.109 
need to be careful with that problem but
let's<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.780> quick<00:01:54.960> look<00:01:54.990> inside<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:56.119> we

let's have a quick look inside and we

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.930 
let's have a quick look inside and we
have<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.630> staircase<00:01:58.759> now<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.820> staircase

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.030 

leads<00:02:03.780> down<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.380> there's<00:02:04.590> nothing<00:02:04.710> actually

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
leads down and there's nothing actually
down<00:02:05.340> here<00:02:05.540> what<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.690> there<00:02:07.490> no<00:02:08.490> there<00:02:08.790> isn't

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060

nothing<00:02:12.540> about<00:02:12.690> here<00:02:12.960> no<00:02:13.560> grief<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:13.860> going<00:02:14.010> to

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
nothing about here no grief is going to

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.580 
nothing about here no grief is going to
find<00:02:14.250> anything<00:02:14.610> down<00:02:14.730> there<00:02:14.970> but<00:02:15.570> because<00:02:16.530> I

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
find anything down there but because I

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.610 
find anything down there but because I
put<00:02:16.860> anything<00:02:17.130> down<00:02:17.280> there<00:02:17.550> yet<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:19.410> see

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
put anything down there yet but you see

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.540 
put anything down there yet but you see
the<00:02:19.770> idea<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:20.550> how<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.730> hide<00:02:20.970> things<00:02:21.180> like<00:02:21.390> that

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
the idea of how to hide things like that

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
the idea of how to hide things like that
now<00:02:23.550> another<00:02:23.730> method<00:02:24.060> I'm<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.360> show<00:02:24.510> you

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570

now another method I'm going to show you
like<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.230> showed<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.950> relies<00:02:26.790> on<00:02:26.820> a

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
like I showed you that relies on a

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.700 
like I showed you that relies on a
marker<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.570> actual<00:02:27.900> terrain<00:02:28.110> but<00:02:28.380> here

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
marker in the actual terrain but here

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.440 
marker in the actual terrain but here
you<00:02:29.190> want<00:02:29.340> me<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.550> pick<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> marker<00:02:30.120> very<00:02:30.270> easily

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
you want me to pick a marker very easily

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.570 
you want me to pick a marker very easily
so<00:02:30.660> mark<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.740> area<00:02:31.920> with<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.100> flower<00:02:32.310> for

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
so mark the area with a flower for

we walk straight to hear tada now this

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.720 
we walk straight to hear tada now this
is<00:03:07.230> another<00:03:07.530> method<00:03:07.770> of<00:03:07.980> hiding<00:03:08.340> things<00:03:08.550> I

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
is another method of hiding things I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.270 
is another method of hiding things I
showed<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.420> I've<00:03:09.570> come<00:03:09.780> across<00:03:09.930> for<00:03:10.830> example

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
showed that I've come across for example

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.449 
showed that I've come across for example
we<00:03:11.550> have<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:12.950> room<00:03:13.950> in<00:03:14.040> here<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.310> there's<00:03:14.430> a

so<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:16.530> could<00:03:16.650> be<00:03:16.680> valuable<00:03:16.830> they<00:03:17.310> open<00:03:17.520> the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
so it could be valuable they open the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.820 
so it could be valuable they open the
door<00:03:17.730> cuz<00:03:18.000> rest<00:03:18.720> don't<00:03:18.810> read<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.290> lot<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.650> people

actual location the hidden stuff is
through<00:03:37.380> here<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.519> see<00:03:41.670> what<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.850> mean<00:03:41.880> you

through here so you see what I mean you

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.120

leavin a smoke coming too because people

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.720 
leavin a smoke coming too because people
find<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.430> they<00:04:14.610> find<00:04:14.880> us<00:04:15.030> hit<00:04:15.240> the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
find it and they find us hit the

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.810 
find it and they find us hit the
the<00:04:15.909> bait<00:04:16.090> of<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.389> decoy<00:04:17.229> room<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:17.769> then<00:04:18.579> on

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
the bait of the decoy room and then on

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.129 
the bait of the decoy room and then on
the<00:04:18.940> way<00:04:19.060> they<00:04:19.299> leave<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.510> door<00:04:19.690> open<00:04:19.720> so<00:04:20.109> I

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
the way they leave the door open so I

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.020 
the way they leave the door open so I
know<00:04:20.260> okay<00:04:20.680> someone's<00:04:20.979> being<00:04:21.160> here<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.579> then

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
know okay someone's being here and then

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.969 
know okay someone's being here and then
I<00:04:22.120> leave<00:04:22.389> it<00:04:22.570> without<00:04:23.139> the<00:04:23.380> torch<00:04:23.590> underneath

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
I leave it without the torch underneath

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.290 
I leave it without the torch underneath
it<00:04:24.100> next<00:04:24.280> time<00:04:24.660> so<00:04:25.660> I<00:04:26.610> know<00:04:27.610> this<00:04:27.940> stuff<00:04:28.180> in

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
it next time so I know this stuff in

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.610 
it next time so I know this stuff in
there<00:04:28.479> but<00:04:28.510> no<00:04:28.690> one<00:04:28.810> else<00:04:28.960> does<00:04:29.139> right<00:04:29.380> now<00:04:29.560> the

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
there but no one else does right now the

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.560 
there but no one else does right now the
second<00:04:30.040> one<00:04:30.419> over<00:04:31.419> here<00:04:33.389> exactly<00:04:34.389> same

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
second one over here exactly same

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.469 
second one over here exactly same
principle<00:04:34.900> for<00:04:34.990> hiding<00:04:35.169> it<00:04:35.350> now<00:04:36.150> in<00:04:37.150> this<00:04:37.240> room

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
principle for hiding it now in this room

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.770 
principle for hiding it now in this room
there<00:04:37.510> are<00:04:37.720> numerous<00:04:38.610> hidden<00:04:41.460> chests<00:04:42.660> you<00:04:43.660> can

there are numerous hidden chests you can

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.150 
there are numerous hidden chests you can
hide<00:04:43.900> anything<00:04:44.139> you<00:04:44.290> want<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.530> middle<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:44.979> save

hide anything you want a middle I save
it<00:04:45.280> I<00:04:45.370> don't<00:04:45.580> know<00:04:45.610> you<00:04:45.699> this<00:04:46.000> could<00:04:46.180> be<00:04:46.300> like<00:04:46.419> a

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
it I don't know you this could be like a

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.150 
it I don't know you this could be like a
decoy<00:04:46.810> base<00:04:47.080> you<00:04:47.260> could<00:04:47.380> have<00:04:47.470> a<00:04:47.500> craft<00:04:47.830> bench

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
decoy base you could have a craft bench

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.040 
decoy base you could have a craft bench
and<00:04:48.430> I<00:04:48.490> chest<00:04:48.760> amid<00:04:49.150> all<00:04:49.270> some<00:04:49.570> basic<00:04:49.930> stuff

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
and I chest amid all some basic stuff

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.590 
and I chest amid all some basic stuff
and<00:04:50.440> maybe<00:04:50.560> a<00:04:50.650> furnace<00:04:51.070> if<00:04:51.220> you<00:04:51.310> wanted<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.760> but

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
you can hide hidden chests pretty much

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.810 
you can hide hidden chests pretty much
anywhere<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:05.830> want<00:05:06.070> but<00:05:06.220> all<00:05:06.340> you<00:05:06.460> need<00:05:06.639> to<00:05:06.699> do

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
is leave a space above them so you can

of a perfect hidden room and I initially

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:25.329 
of a perfect hidden room and I initially
started<00:07:22.579> building<00:07:23.239> it<00:07:23.360> to<00:07:24.339> replicate

00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:25.339 
started building it to replicate

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:26.979 
started building it to replicate
something<00:07:25.519> I<00:07:25.729> had<00:07:25.909> on<00:07:26.029> my<00:07:26.059> own<00:07:26.269> pvp<00:07:26.749> server

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:26.989 
something I had on my own pvp server

00:07:26.989 --> 00:07:29.669 
something I had on my own pvp server
with<00:07:27.169> a<00:07:27.199> very<00:07:27.439> innovative<00:07:28.069> way<00:07:28.849> of<00:07:28.879> hiding<00:07:29.179> it

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:29.679 
with a very innovative way of hiding it

00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:31.989 
with a very innovative way of hiding it
but<00:07:30.679> it<00:07:30.829> just<00:07:30.860> sort<00:07:31.189> of<00:07:31.279> spiraled<00:07:31.879> out<00:07:31.939> of

00:07:31.989 --> 00:07:31.999 
but it just sort of spiraled out of

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:34.059 
but it just sort of spiraled out of
control<00:07:32.119> and<00:07:32.419> I<00:07:32.659> started<00:07:32.959> adding<00:07:33.379> features<00:07:33.589> to

00:07:34.059 --> 00:07:34.069 
control and I started adding features to

control and I started adding features to
it<00:07:34.219> and<00:07:34.369> perfect<00:07:35.169> alterations<00:07:36.169> things<00:07:36.559> that<00:07:36.709> I
