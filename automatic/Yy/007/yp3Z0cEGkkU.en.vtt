how's it going everyone and welcome to

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.919 
how's it going everyone and welcome to
my<00:00:02.040> course<00:00:02.310> on<00:00:02.490> jQuery<00:00:02.879> where<00:00:03.540> we're<00:00:03.720> going<00:00:03.870> to

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
my course on jQuery where we're going to

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.260 
my course on jQuery where we're going to
cover<00:00:04.110> all<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.589> jQuery<00:00:05.009> basics<00:00:05.430> starting

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
cover all of the jQuery basics starting

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.880 
cover all of the jQuery basics starting
from<00:00:06.450> how<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.690> include<00:00:07.049> jQuery<00:00:07.379> in<00:00:07.529> your<00:00:07.649> pages

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
from how to include jQuery in your pages

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.830 
from how to include jQuery in your pages
and<00:00:08.280> then<00:00:08.760> going<00:00:09.030> all<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.300> way<00:00:09.360> up<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.660> using

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
and then going all the way up to using

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.540 
and then going all the way up to using
plugins<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.679> even<00:00:10.920> developing<00:00:11.370> our<00:00:11.519> own

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
plugins and even developing our own

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.089 
plugins and even developing our own
plugins<00:00:12.049> so<00:00:13.049> first<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.410> all<00:00:13.500> why<00:00:13.799> should<00:00:13.830> you

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
plugins so first of all why should you

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.279 
plugins so first of all why should you
use<00:00:14.130> jQuery<00:00:14.700> well<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.630> main<00:00:15.780> reason<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.170> use

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
use jQuery well the main reason to use

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.019 
use jQuery well the main reason to use
jQuery<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.250> going<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.430> simplify<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
jQuery is it's going to simplify the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.540 
jQuery is it's going to simplify the
process<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.720> including<00:00:19.710> JavaScript<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.430> our

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
process of including JavaScript in our

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.240 
process of including JavaScript in our
websites<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.660> many<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.410> common<00:00:22.859> tasks

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
websites so many of the common tasks

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.620 
websites so many of the common tasks
you'll<00:00:23.369> need<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.609> do<00:00:23.730> with<00:00:23.850> JavaScript<00:00:24.029> you

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
you'll need to do with JavaScript you

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.170 
you'll need to do with JavaScript you
can<00:00:25.050> do<00:00:25.199> them<00:00:25.350> easier<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:26.820> do<00:00:27.029> them

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
can do them easier and you can do them

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.990 
can do them easier and you can do them
faster<00:00:27.720> using<00:00:28.619> jQuery<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.490> that's<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.849> main

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
faster using jQuery so that's the main

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.089 
faster using jQuery so that's the main
reason<00:00:30.179> for<00:00:30.390> doing<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.380> also<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.800> lot<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
reason for doing it and also a lot of

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.979 
reason for doing it and also a lot of
things<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.450> do<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:33.750> JavaScript

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
things that you can do with JavaScript

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.680 
things that you can do with JavaScript
are<00:00:34.500> quite<00:00:34.980> difficult<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:36.030> we're<00:00:36.510> using

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
are quite difficult but if we're using

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.299 
are quite difficult but if we're using
the<00:00:37.050> jQuery<00:00:37.500> library<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the jQuery library it's going to be a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.970 
the jQuery library it's going to be a
lot<00:00:38.550> easier<00:00:38.930> such<00:00:39.930> as<00:00:40.110> manipulating<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.770> DOM

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
lot easier such as manipulating the DOM

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.850 
lot easier such as manipulating the DOM
and<00:00:41.219> using<00:00:41.730> Ajax<00:00:42.230> so<00:00:43.230> that's<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> main<00:00:43.710> reason

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and using Ajax so that's the main reason

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.010 
and using Ajax so that's the main reason
to<00:00:44.070> use<00:00:44.190> jQuery<00:00:44.579> now<00:00:45.180> one<00:00:45.510> thing<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.870> keep<00:00:45.960> in

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
to use jQuery now one thing to keep in

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.959 
to use jQuery now one thing to keep in
mind<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.680> jQuery<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.219> JavaScript<00:00:47.399> are

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
mind is that jQuery and JavaScript are

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.260 
mind is that jQuery and JavaScript are
not<00:00:48.629> different<00:00:48.930> programming<00:00:49.500> languages

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
not different programming languages

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.150 
not different programming languages
jQuery<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.449> all<00:00:51.690> JavaScript<00:00:52.140> it's<00:00:52.620> totally

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
jQuery is all JavaScript it's totally

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.310 
jQuery is all JavaScript it's totally
written<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.489> JavaScript<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.170> an

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
written in JavaScript but it is an

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.869 
written in JavaScript but it is an
abstraction<00:00:55.829> layer<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.370> top<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.699> JavaScript

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
abstraction layer on top of JavaScript

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.819 
abstraction layer on top of JavaScript
and<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.960> going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> make<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.649> lot<00:00:58.800> easier

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
and it's going to make it a lot easier

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.069 
and it's going to make it a lot easier
for<00:00:59.190> us<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.820> include<00:01:00.180> JavaScript<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:00.960> our

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
for us to include JavaScript in our

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.200 
for us to include JavaScript in our
websites<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:02.370> I'd<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.730> show<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.910> in

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
websites what I'd like to show you in

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.030 
websites what I'd like to show you in
this<00:01:03.329> first<00:01:03.570> tutorial<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.260> two<00:01:04.710> different

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
this first tutorial is two different

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.039 
this first tutorial is two different
ways<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.489> how<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.790> include<00:01:06.119> jQuery<00:01:06.689> into<00:01:06.930> your

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
ways on how to include jQuery into your

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.320 
ways on how to include jQuery into your
website<00:01:07.439> now<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.729> an<00:01:08.880> internet

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
website now if you have an internet

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.760 
website now if you have an internet
connection<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:09.869> you're<00:01:09.990> developing<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
connection when you're developing and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.230 
connection when you're developing and
you'll<00:01:11.250> always<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.729> an<00:01:11.850> internet

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
you'll always have an internet

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.570 
you'll always have an internet
connection<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:13.229> easiest<00:01:13.500> way<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.340> go

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
connection the easiest way is just to go

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.780 
connection the easiest way is just to go
to<00:01:14.640> Google<00:01:15.240> CDN<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.220> go<00:01:17.640> into

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.420 
inside the document but placing it
before<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.259> ending<00:01:40.530> body<00:01:40.740> tag<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.250> best

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
before the ending body tag is the best

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.460 
before the ending body tag is the best
place<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.750> going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> give<00:01:43.229> people

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
place because it's going to give people

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.770 
place because it's going to give people
the<00:01:43.890> appearance<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.610> your<00:01:44.820> page<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.299> loading

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the appearance that your page is loading

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.350 
the appearance that your page is loading
faster<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.979> only<00:01:47.220> downside<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.700> doing<00:01:48.270> it

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
faster the only downside to doing it

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.700 
faster the only downside to doing it
this<00:01:48.509> way<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.720> if<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.229> don't<00:01:49.439> have<00:01:49.590> an

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
this way is if you don't have an

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.039 
this way is if you don't have an
internet<00:01:50.100> connection<00:01:50.149> then<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.540> jQuery

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
internet connection then this jQuery

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.230 
internet connection then this jQuery
file<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.710> won't<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:53.040> able<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.549> be<00:01:53.700> accessed

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
file here won't be able to be accessed

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.539 
file here won't be able to be accessed
so<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.020> other<00:01:55.140> way<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.649> go<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.979> jQuery

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
so the other way is to go to jQuery

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.120 
so the other way is to go to jQuery
website<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.990> download<00:01:58.200> jQuery<00:01:58.860> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
website and just download jQuery and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.770 
website and just download jQuery and
then<00:01:59.610> you'll<00:01:59.759> just<00:01:59.969> want<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.329> change<00:02:00.600> this

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
then you'll just want to change this

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.010 
then you'll just want to change this
source<00:02:01.079> here<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.219> it's<00:02:02.369> pointing<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
source here so that it's pointing to the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.319 
source here so that it's pointing to the
JavaScript<00:02:04.560> file<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:05.369> your<00:02:05.610> local<00:02:05.790> computer

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
JavaScript file on your local computer

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.710 
JavaScript file on your local computer
one<00:02:07.290> thing<00:02:07.500> I'll<00:02:07.619> mention<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.640> I'm<00:02:09.390> using

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
one thing I'll mention is that I'm using

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.770 
one thing I'll mention is that I'm using
xampp<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.950> course<00:02:11.270> which<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.450> server

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
xampp in this course which is a server

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.250 
xampp in this course which is a server
bundle

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
bundle

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.309 
bundle
now<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.650> isn't<00:02:13.950> necessary<00:02:14.519> to<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:16.140> use

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
now this isn't necessary to to use

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.830 
now this isn't necessary to to use
JavaScript<00:02:17.040> or<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.400> use<00:02:17.519> jQuery<00:02:17.909> but<00:02:18.540> in

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
JavaScript or to use jQuery but in

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.500 
JavaScript or to use jQuery but in
future<00:02:19.200> lessons<00:02:19.379> we<00:02:19.769> might<00:02:20.010> be<00:02:20.190> doing<00:02:20.510> ajax

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
future lessons we might be doing ajax

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.970 
future lessons we might be doing ajax
and<00:02:21.720> we<00:02:21.810> might<00:02:22.019> be<00:02:22.049> doing<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.500> with<00:02:22.650> PHP

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
and we might be doing that with PHP

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.000 
and we might be doing that with PHP
files<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:24.870> just<00:02:25.019> handy<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.799> be

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
files so it's just handy to be

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.270 
files so it's just handy to be
developing<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.959> on<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:28.019> server<00:02:28.620> bundle<00:02:29.069> such

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
developing this on a server bundle such

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.930 
developing this on a server bundle such
as<00:02:29.430> zamp

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
as zamp

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.920 
as zamp
because<00:02:30.480> if<00:02:30.780> later<00:02:31.410> on<00:02:31.650> we<00:02:31.860> decide<00:02:32.250> we<00:02:32.430> want<00:02:32.610> to

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
because if later on we decide we want to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.690 
because if later on we decide we want to
have<00:02:33.930> our<00:02:33.959> JavaScript<00:02:34.650> interacting<00:02:35.220> with<00:02:35.370> PHP

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
have our JavaScript interacting with PHP

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.580 
have our JavaScript interacting with PHP
then<00:02:36.480> we're<00:02:36.720> going<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.870> be<00:02:37.019> able<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.200> do<00:02:37.410> that

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
then we're going to be able to do that

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.350 
then we're going to be able to do that
because<00:02:37.860> we're<00:02:38.160> working<00:02:38.519> on<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.640> server<00:02:38.910> bundle

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
because we're working on a server bundle

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.369 
because we're working on a server bundle
that's<00:02:40.400> supporting<00:02:41.400> PHP<00:02:41.879> so<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.840> suggest<00:02:43.260> if

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
that's supporting PHP so I suggest if

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.440 
that's supporting PHP so I suggest if
you<00:02:43.470> don't<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:43.829> this<00:02:43.980> installed<00:02:44.459> install

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
you don't have this installed install

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.500 
you don't have this installed install
xampp<00:02:45.870> or<00:02:46.140> if<00:02:46.230> you're<00:02:46.410> on<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.590> Mac<00:02:47.150> install<00:02:48.150> MAMP

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
xampp or if you're on a Mac install MAMP

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.330 
xampp or if you're on a Mac install MAMP
that's<00:02:49.049> ma<00:02:49.650> MP<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:51.739> that's<00:02:52.739> basically<00:02:53.220> all

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
that's ma MP and that's basically all

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.839 
that's ma MP and that's basically all
you<00:02:53.519> need<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.879> do<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.629> order<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.930> run<00:02:55.440> PHP<00:02:55.849> but

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
you need to do in order to run PHP but

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.670 
you need to do in order to run PHP but
for<00:02:57.120> now<00:02:57.239> this<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.660> all<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.870> need<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.230> do<00:02:58.410> and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
for now this is all you need to do and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.970 
for now this is all you need to do and
see<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.430> next<00:02:59.640> lesson
