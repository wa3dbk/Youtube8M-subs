00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.400
 paradise its ideal soil its conditions 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.139
 of ideal humidity our plants 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.640
 they reach a few sizes here of trees 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.440
 that the family here is comfortable 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.440
 it is like at home 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.480
 it is a plant that blooms when all 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.550
 this network is null 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.060
 When it comes to winter is a photo of 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.950
 winter is a flower that is born from his daughter 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.990
 and father is me 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:40.680
 From September to May there are varieties 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.680
 you always have them there 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.930
 because the camellia is very rooted in the 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.660
 culture our Galician culture is a 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.449
 symbol of galicia in all places and 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.519
 you find 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.070
 these trees and one of the things that 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.850
 I think it 's more important of this term 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.850
 are the trees 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.850
 a visitor when a garden arrives 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.180
 has to go discovering it by its passage 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.840
 it's something that is really going to make you 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.840
 to return 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.460
 and each visit you will find one thing 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.530
 new a new sensation are the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.530
 botanical gardens of galicia 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.050
 and just as we have lovers of 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.660
 horticulture of magnolias the camellia 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.440
 she is the queen of the queens of 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.440
 winter bloom 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.030
 painters photographers poets any 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.979
 person that any inspired and we are 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.460
 many person who knows the qualities 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.460
 hooks up 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.720
 but the acting power of the camellia 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.010
 it's very special is that they create true 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.950
 addicts 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.950
 it's amazing and I do not know the explanation 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.819
 the painting is a love at first sight and 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.819
 Camellia is love at first sight
