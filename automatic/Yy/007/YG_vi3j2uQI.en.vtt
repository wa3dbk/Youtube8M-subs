00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
money but but the prize is so great that

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.640 
money but but the prize is so great that
they're<00:02:23.420> prepared<00:02:23.600> to<00:02:23.900> lose<00:02:24.110> money<00:02:24.350> because

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
they're prepared to lose money because

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.309 
they're prepared to lose money because
if<00:02:25.069> they<00:02:25.220> make<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.459> to<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.880> Premier<00:02:26.239> League

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
if they make it to the Premier League

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.710 
if they make it to the Premier League
but<00:02:27.319> then<00:02:27.500> it's<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:28.069> know<00:02:28.190> it's<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:29.390> really

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
but then it's you know it's it's really

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.680 
but then it's you know it's it's really
jackpot<00:02:30.410> time

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.840 

well<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.320> think<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:37.010> Financial<00:02:37.490> Fair<00:02:37.640> Play

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
well I think the Financial Fair Play

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.610 
well I think the Financial Fair Play
will<00:02:38.120> will<00:02:38.420> help<00:02:38.630> enormously<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.260> think<00:02:39.500> it

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
will will help enormously I think it

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.350 
will will help enormously I think it
will<00:02:39.980> stop<00:02:40.340> people<00:02:40.730> making<00:02:41.630> enormous<00:02:41.900> losses

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
will stop people making enormous losses

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.090 
will stop people making enormous losses
but<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:44.990> know<00:02:45.080> there<00:02:45.230> is<00:02:45.260> always<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.650> risk<00:02:45.980> when

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
but you know there is always a risk when

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.850 
but you know there is always a risk when
the<00:02:46.370> prize<00:02:46.640> is<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:46.970> great<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:48.260> people<00:02:48.440> will

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
the prize is so great that people will

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.130 
the prize is so great that people will
do<00:02:49.010> anything<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.670> get<00:02:50.270> there<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.690> perhaps

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
do anything to get there and perhaps

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.100 
do anything to get there and perhaps
lose<00:02:51.980> any<00:02:52.280> any<00:02:52.610> sense<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.210> financial<00:02:53.510> control

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
lose any any sense of financial control

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.340 
lose any any sense of financial control
in<00:02:54.770> their<00:02:55.100> desperate<00:02:55.490> efforts<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.940> get<00:02:56.120> there

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
in their desperate efforts to get there

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.650 
in their desperate efforts to get there
but<00:02:57.350> unfortunately<00:02:58.160> I<00:02:59.060> don't<00:02:59.240> think<00:02:59.420> the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
but unfortunately I don't think the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.570 
but unfortunately I don't think the
situation<00:03:00.260> will<00:03:00.410> change<00:03:00.440> in<00:03:01.040> terms<00:03:01.310> of<00:03:01.460> the

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
situation will change in terms of the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.950 
situation will change in terms of the
rich<00:03:01.730> clubs<00:03:02.000> are<00:03:02.210> going<00:03:02.360> to<00:03:02.420> get<00:03:02.540> richer<00:03:02.930> and

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
rich clubs are going to get richer and

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.660 
rich clubs are going to get richer and
the<00:03:03.650> poor<00:03:03.740> are<00:03:03.950> clubs<00:03:04.250> are<00:03:04.370> going<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.550> get

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
the poor are clubs are going to get

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.110 
the poor are clubs are going to get
poorer<00:03:04.970> so<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.020> desire<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.010> be<00:03:07.670> with<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.940> big

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
poorer so the desire to be with the big

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.860 
poorer so the desire to be with the big
boys<00:03:08.270> that<00:03:08.510> can<00:03:08.840> only<00:03:08.960> only<00:03:09.560> increase

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.710 

we<00:03:15.590> worked<00:03:16.280> out<00:03:16.459> that<00:03:16.700> our<00:03:17.120> income<00:03:17.540> as<00:03:17.690> a

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
we worked out that our income as a

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.530 
we worked out that our income as a
Championship<00:03:18.560> club<00:03:18.590> was<00:03:18.980> about<00:03:19.250> 13<00:03:20.000> million<00:03:20.420> a

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
Championship club was about 13 million a

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.809 
Championship club was about 13 million a
year<00:03:20.569> and<00:03:20.959> our<00:03:21.319> income<00:03:21.799> as<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:21.980> premier<00:03:22.580> league

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
year and our income as a premier league

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.649 
year and our income as a premier league
club<00:03:23.060> will<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:23.299> be<00:03:23.450> about<00:03:23.599> 83<00:03:24.290> million<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.860> year

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
club will it be about 83 million a year

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.059 
club will it be about 83 million a year
and<00:03:26.659> those<00:03:26.840> that's<00:03:27.110> a<00:03:27.200> fairly<00:03:27.409> conservative

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
and those that's a fairly conservative

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.990 
and those that's a fairly conservative
estimate<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:29.709> it<00:03:30.709> does<00:03:30.950> change<00:03:31.220> things<00:03:31.340> it

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
estimate so it does change things it

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.970 
estimate so it does change things it
means<00:03:32.299> that<00:03:32.540> we've<00:03:32.659> got<00:03:32.690> money<00:03:33.409> to<00:03:33.500> spend<00:03:33.650> on

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
means that we've got money to spend on

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.319 
means that we've got money to spend on
the<00:03:34.099> infrastructure<00:03:34.370> of<00:03:34.909> the<00:03:35.090> club

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
the infrastructure of the club

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.089 
the infrastructure of the club
particularly<00:03:36.140> on<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.349> stadium<00:03:36.620> which<00:03:36.950> is

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
particularly on the stadium which is

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.940 
particularly on the stadium which is
desperately<00:03:37.700> in<00:03:37.760> need<00:03:37.849> of<00:03:38.799> modernizing<00:03:39.799> and

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
desperately in need of modernizing and

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.680 
desperately in need of modernizing and
when<00:03:40.340> we've<00:03:40.459> got<00:03:40.610> one<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:40.879> oldest<00:03:41.209> stands

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
when we've got one of the oldest stands

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.020 
when we've got one of the oldest stands
in<00:03:41.810> football<00:03:42.799> our<00:03:43.040> main<00:03:43.190> stan<00:03:43.519> was<00:03:43.700> built<00:03:43.879> in

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
in football our main stan was built in

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.600 
in football our main stan was built in
nineteen<00:03:44.060> twenty<00:03:44.750> four<00:03:45.019> and<00:03:45.290> I<00:03:46.250> think<00:03:46.489> it's

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
nineteen twenty four and I think it's

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.910 
nineteen twenty four and I think it's
days<00:03:46.849> are<00:03:47.150> numbered<00:03:47.599> but<00:03:48.590> but<00:03:48.829> the

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
days are numbered but but the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.710 
days are numbered but but the
Premiership<00:03:49.370> money<00:03:49.940> perhaps<00:03:50.209> you<00:03:50.540> know<00:03:50.660> the

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
Premiership money perhaps you know the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.910 
Premiership money perhaps you know the
most<00:03:50.989> important<00:03:51.500> thing<00:03:51.620> about<00:03:51.709> the

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
most important thing about the

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.250 
most important thing about the
Premiership<00:03:52.310> money<00:03:52.489> is<00:03:52.879> we<00:03:53.060> can<00:03:53.269> we<00:03:53.930> can<00:03:54.109> give

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
Premiership money is we can we can give
