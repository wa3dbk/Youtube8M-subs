00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.760 
this is your Brady material it's really
made<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.909> nice<00:01:51.090> stuff<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.560> really

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
made of nice stuff I like it it's really

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.649 
made of nice stuff I like it it's really
thin<00:01:53.130> too<00:01:53.430> there's<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.729> lot<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:53.970> braided<00:01:54.329> cables

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
thin too there's a lot of braided cables

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.959 
thin too there's a lot of braided cables
out<00:01:54.750> there<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.439> are<00:01:55.470> pretty<00:01:55.860> thick<00:01:56.340> this

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
out there that are pretty thick this

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.670 
out there that are pretty thick this
one's<00:01:57.240> thin<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.899> don't<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.320> really

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
one's thin so you don't have this really

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.130 
one's thin so you don't have this really
bulky<00:01:59.250> cable<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.880> mess<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.299> some<00:02:00.930> other

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
bulky cable to mess with some other

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.510 
bulky cable to mess with some other
reasons<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.590> might<00:02:01.770> want<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.280> look<00:02:02.399> into

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
reasons that you might want to look into

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.249 
reasons that you might want to look into
getting<00:02:02.790> something<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
getting something like this is that the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.950 
getting something like this is that the
durability<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> lot<00:02:05.520> more<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.659> kind<00:02:06.840> of

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
durability is a lot more on this kind of

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.350 
durability is a lot more on this kind of
cable<00:02:07.350> versus<00:02:07.890> just<00:02:08.729> some<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.970> those<00:02:09.060> cheap

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
cable versus just some of those cheap

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.880 
cable versus just some of those cheap
ones<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.869> see<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.229> maybe<00:02:10.470> even<00:02:10.709> come

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
ones that you see that maybe even come

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.340 
ones that you see that maybe even come
with<00:02:10.920> your<00:02:11.129> phone<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.640> know<00:02:12.030> with<00:02:12.599> iPhones

even some Samsung devices you get those

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.300 
even some Samsung devices you get those
white<00:02:15.810> cables<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.530> they<00:02:16.710> just<00:02:16.890> end<00:02:17.160> up

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
white cables and they just end up

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.220 
white cables and they just end up

you<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.930> reason<00:02:40.230> why<00:02:40.320> that's<00:02:40.560> important<00:02:41.100> to

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
you the reason why that's important to

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.770 
you the reason why that's important to
have<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.700> kind<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:41.940> starting<00:02:42.270> material<00:02:42.330> is

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
have that kind of starting material is

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.930 
have that kind of starting material is
because<00:02:43.080> when<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.320> plug<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.790> know

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
because when you plug this in you know

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.380 
because when you plug this in you know
just<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:46.380> everyday<00:02:46.770> life<00:02:47.100> happens<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:47.880> you

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
just just everyday life happens so you

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.690 
just just everyday life happens so you
know<00:02:48.540> this<00:02:48.690> could<00:02:48.750> definitely<00:02:49.140> come<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.190> bend

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
know this could definitely come to bend

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.400 
know this could definitely come to bend
or<00:02:50.970> something<00:02:51.360> like<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.990> it's<00:02:52.230> not

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
or something like that and it's not

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.050 
or something like that and it's not
going<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.650> break<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.280> that's<00:02:53.550> what's<00:02:53.760> really

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
going to break so that's what's really

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.060 
going to break so that's what's really
cool<00:02:54.240> about<00:02:54.300> that<00:02:54.660> kind<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.900> material<00:02:55.320> is<00:02:55.470> that

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
cool about that kind of material is that

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.220 
cool about that kind of material is that
if<00:02:56.310> you're<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.880> have<00:02:57.510> been<00:02:57.660> rough<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:58.110> your
