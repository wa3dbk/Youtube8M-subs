and my bet my rear end is sliding out on

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.509 
and my bet my rear end is sliding out on
certain<00:03:36.450> corners<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.380> according<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.220> them<00:03:38.370> is

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
certain corners and according to them is

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.940 
certain corners and according to them is
because<00:03:38.639> of<00:03:38.730> my<00:03:38.880> rear<00:03:39.030> shock<00:03:39.269> so<00:03:39.630> i<00:03:39.870> ordered<00:03:40.650> in
