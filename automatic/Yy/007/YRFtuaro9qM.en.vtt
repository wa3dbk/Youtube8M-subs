00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.550
 of energy and then to the quick return of the 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.470
 rhythm of the blow that's fucking positive 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.210

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.970
 my pace but in the climb I 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.610
 managed to keep the pace down 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.470
