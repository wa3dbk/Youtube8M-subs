00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
and not necessarily a curriculum so it

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.080 
and not necessarily a curriculum so it
allows<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.920> flexibility<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.640> teach<00:02:53.910> what<00:02:54.060> we

were supposed to teach with inside the
province<00:02:55.680> but<00:02:56.190> it's<00:02:56.310> not<00:02:56.489> it's<00:02:56.730> what<00:02:56.970> we<00:02:57.090> teach

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
province but it's not it's what we teach

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.300 
province but it's not it's what we teach
it's<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.600> way<00:02:57.750> we<00:02:57.900> teach<00:02:58.080> one<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.100> really

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
it's the way we teach one of the really

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.979 
it's the way we teach one of the really
important<00:02:59.640> things<00:02:59.670> about<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.120> IB<00:03:00.390> program<00:03:00.420> is

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
important things about the IB program is

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.509 
important things about the IB program is
it<00:03:01.170> allows<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.560> students<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.920> really<00:03:02.220> connect

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
it allows the students to really connect

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.030 
it allows the students to really connect
to<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.730> outside<00:03:03.000> world<00:03:03.180> instead<00:03:04.050> of<00:03:04.110> learning

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
to the outside world instead of learning

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.740 
to the outside world instead of learning
about<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.250> subject<00:03:05.519> in<00:03:05.760> isolation<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.630> they

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
about a subject in isolation so they

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.870 
about a subject in isolation so they
take<00:03:06.870> social<00:03:07.290> or<00:03:07.410> science<00:03:07.830> in<00:03:08.220> class<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.760> that

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
take social or science in class and that

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.640 
take social or science in class and that
door<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.180> closed<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:10.049> allows<00:03:10.260> them<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.530> learn

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
door is closed that allows them to learn

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.259 
door is closed that allows them to learn
how<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:11.010> science<00:03:11.340> connects<00:03:11.700> themselves<00:03:12.180> to

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
how it's science connects themselves to

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.090 
how it's science connects themselves to
the<00:03:12.360> real<00:03:12.510> world<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.170> there<00:03:13.410> are<00:03:13.440> really<00:03:13.769> just

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
the real world and there are really just

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.100 
the real world and there are really just
three<00:03:14.190> fundamental<00:03:15.030> concepts<00:03:15.450> holistic

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
three fundamental concepts holistic

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.750 
three fundamental concepts holistic
learning<00:03:16.290> helping<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.100> students<00:03:17.459> realize

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
learning helping the students realize

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.830 
learning helping the students realize
that<00:03:18.120> there's<00:03:18.269> connections<00:03:18.510> between

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
that there's connections between

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.860 
that there's connections between
subjects<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.980> outside<00:03:20.280> world

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
subjects and the outside world

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.990 
subjects and the outside world
communication<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.920> also<00:03:23.310> intercultural

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
communication and also intercultural

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.090 
communication and also intercultural
awareness<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:24.870> why<00:03:25.019> would<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.200> student<00:03:25.440> choose

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
awareness so why would a student choose

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.830 
awareness so why would a student choose
to<00:03:26.430> take<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:27.120> subject<00:03:27.540> they're<00:03:27.660> already

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
to take the subject they're already

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.539 
to take the subject they're already
going<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.080> be<00:03:28.140> taking<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.709> IB<00:03:29.130> program

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
going to be taking in the IB program

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.220 
going to be taking in the IB program
versus<00:03:29.910> just<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.209> regular<00:03:30.390> curricula

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
versus just the regular curricula

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.570 
versus just the regular curricula
just<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.069> they<00:03:32.310> have<00:03:32.459> that

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
just so that they have that

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.070 
just so that they have that
intercultural<00:03:33.180> awareness<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.750> they're<00:03:33.840> also

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
intercultural awareness and they're also

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.050 
intercultural awareness and they're also
assessed<00:03:34.470> because<00:03:34.860> there's<00:03:35.010> 3,000<00:03:35.790> Ivy

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
assessed because there's 3,000 Ivy

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.729 
assessed because there's 3,000 Ivy
schools<00:03:36.360> around<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.690> world<00:03:36.959> well<00:03:37.319> so<00:03:37.560> there
