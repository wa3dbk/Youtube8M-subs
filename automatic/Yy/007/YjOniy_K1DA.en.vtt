00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
actually play your wii games but that

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.810 
actually play your wii games but that
does<00:01:08.880> take<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> quite<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.630> bit<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.049> coding<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
does take a quite a bit of coding and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.580 
does take a quite a bit of coding and
reverse<00:01:11.820> engineering<00:01:12.450> which<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.140> probably

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
reverse engineering which it is probably

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.289 
reverse engineering which it is probably
having<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.159> giving<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.580> 10<00:01:14.700> no<00:01:14.820> problems

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
having on giving in 10 no problems

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.700 
having on giving in 10 no problems
that's<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.810> reason<00:01:16.049> why<00:01:16.080> they<00:01:16.229> added<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
that's the reason why they added but the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.410 
that's the reason why they added but the
fact<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.100> could<00:01:17.250> add<00:01:17.400> off<00:01:17.640> TV<00:01:18.000> play<00:01:18.030> in

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
fact that you could add off TV play in

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.039 
fact that you could add off TV play in
for<00:01:18.990> wii<00:01:19.140> games<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.100> good<00:01:20.700> next<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:21.720> fix<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
for wii games is good next they fix the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.390 
for wii games is good next they fix the
surround<00:01:22.380> sound<00:01:22.470> issues<00:01:22.920> now<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.250> is
