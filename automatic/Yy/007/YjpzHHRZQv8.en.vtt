something<00:00:49.620> that's<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.950> right<00:00:50.129> there<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
something that's the right there the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.840 
something that's the right there the
right<00:00:50.640> thing<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.530> when<00:00:52.800> does<00:00:53.070> carb<00:00:53.489> loading

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
right thing so when does carb loading

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.139 
right thing so when does carb loading
work<00:00:55.100> exercise<00:00:56.100> bouts<00:00:56.399> longer<00:00:56.850> than<00:00:57.000> two

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
work exercise bouts longer than two

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.660 
work exercise bouts longer than two
hours<00:00:57.410> as<00:00:58.410> when<00:00:58.620> carb<00:00:58.890> loading<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> factor

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
hours as when carb loading is a factor

hours as when carb loading is a factor
if<00:00:59.789> it's<00:00:59.940> shorter<00:01:00.300> than<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:00.870> isn't<00:01:01.079> even

you're thinking the best suggestion for

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.530 
you're thinking the best suggestion for
carb<00:01:34.860> loading<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.220> I've<00:01:35.340> come<00:01:35.970> across<00:01:36.090> is

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
carb loading that I've come across is

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.710 
carb loading that I've come across is
the<00:01:36.840> Sherman<00:01:37.320> costal<00:01:37.939> regiment<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.600> you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the Sherman costal regiment and if you

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.960 
the Sherman costal regiment and if you
see<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.439> actually<00:01:40.829> goes<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.430> goes<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.729> week

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970

one<00:01:50.939> through<00:01:51.180> three<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.600> they're<00:01:51.750> eating<00:01:51.960> a

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
one through three here they're eating a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.319 
one through three here they're eating a
low<00:01:52.259> level<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.799> carbohydrates<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.610> then<00:01:54.119> day

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
low level of carbohydrates and then day

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.959 
low level of carbohydrates and then day
four<00:01:54.899> five<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.259> six<00:01:55.470> they're<00:01:55.920> eating<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.340> huge

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
four five and six they're eating a huge

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.690 
four five and six they're eating a huge
amount<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:58.100> carbohydrates<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.610> they're

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
amount of carbohydrates so they're

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.840 
amount of carbohydrates so they're
eating<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.000> ton<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:01.100> carbs<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> idea<00:02:02.700> is

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
eating a ton of carbs so the idea is

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.520 
eating a ton of carbs so the idea is
here<00:02:03.030> your<00:02:03.210> star<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.600> your<00:02:03.750> body<00:02:03.930> for<00:02:04.200> carbs

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
here your star of your body for carbs

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.530 
here your star of your body for carbs
then<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.159> give<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.549> bunch<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.360> put

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
then you give it a bunch that it can put

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.180 
then you give it a bunch that it can put
into<00:02:06.659> storage<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.380> then<00:02:07.890> for<00:02:08.099> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
into storage and then for the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.889 
into storage and then for the
competition<00:02:08.700> you'll<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.940> ready<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.690> was<00:02:09.720> a

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
competition you'll be ready and it was a

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.449 
competition you'll be ready and it was a
taper<00:02:10.140> down<00:02:10.379> your<00:02:10.500> exercise<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.190> get<00:02:11.280> ready

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
taper down your exercise to get ready

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.190 
taper down your exercise to get ready
for<00:02:11.640> that

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
for that

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.090 
for that
now<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.950> is

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
now this is

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.160 
now this is
good<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.550> how<00:02:14.580> car<00:02:14.850> voting<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.270> done<00:02:15.480> my

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
good this is how car voting is done my

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.540 
good this is how car voting is done my
wife<00:02:16.380> actually<00:02:16.560> used<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:16.950> method<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.340> run<00:02:17.520> a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550

marathon and had some much better energy
and<00:02:20.220> she<00:02:20.400> thought<00:02:20.520> she<00:02:20.760> would<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:22.700> for<00:02:23.700> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
and she thought she would but for the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.370 
and she thought she would but for the
most<00:02:23.910> part<00:02:24.120> you're<00:02:24.240> probably<00:02:24.510> not<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:25.110> kind

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
athlete maybe you're this kind of

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.400 
athlete maybe you're this kind of
athlete<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:36.450> what<00:02:36.690> do<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.810> do<00:02:36.960> if<00:02:37.140> you're<00:02:37.290> one

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
athlete so what do you do if you're one

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.110 
athlete so what do you do if you're one
of<00:02:37.530> these<00:02:37.620> athletes<00:02:40.040> well<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.700> eat<00:02:41.910> normal<00:02:42.950> ok

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
of these athletes well you eat normal ok

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.880 
of these athletes well you eat normal ok
so<00:02:45.120> instead<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.080> trying<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.380> carb-load<00:02:46.710> her

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
so instead of trying to carb-load her

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.180 
so instead of trying to carb-load her
and<00:02:47.010> like<00:02:47.130> eat<00:02:47.310> normal<00:02:48.110> but<00:02:49.110> maybe<00:02:49.290> not<00:02:49.590> normal

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
and like eat normal but maybe not normal

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.540 
and like eat normal but maybe not normal
maybe<00:02:51.470> because<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.680> depends<00:02:53.100> on<00:02:53.250> what<00:02:53.430> your

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
maybe because it depends on what your

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.240 
maybe because it depends on what your
normal<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:54.060> if<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:54.570> is<00:02:54.780> your<00:02:54.990> normal<00:02:55.250> then

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
normal is if this is your normal then

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.690 
normal is if this is your normal then
