00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.110
 very good all soles welcome a 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.380
 new video a new tutorial this time 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.599
 is a very simple tutorial that several me 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.180
 you have asked that you have seen in me 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.850
 survival series 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.910
 and nothing as you see to see now is a 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.770
 very easy to build 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.869
 and it requires many materials what 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.930
 it is required is a little bit of 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.890
 iron but it was a books of lighting 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.290
 or bojan solved the 1.7 yes and my 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.150
 I'm going to show you these are like 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.740
 you can see here are 60 tall blocks 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.020
 and nothing depending on the following way 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.180
 here you have the mythical thing that would 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.700
 any to climb 60 blocks the 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.970
 stairs that as you can see take me 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.770
 a lot of time and this time we can 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.620
 save it because little by little if we have 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.090
 to climb all this height 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.860
 constantly in the end they end up being 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:01.370
 many minutes in total and they are minutes 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.070
 that we miss going to mine for 60 minutes 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.390
 more to be playing so nothing good 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.160
 can fly up already because I'm 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.600
 tired good to come down again what 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.590
 same 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:16.640
 low casualties and good 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.350
 - youtube and good I have built 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.229
 this thing that goes up very fast as you see 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.720
 see now it went like this 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.940
 we put here below this and we keep 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:31.320
 clicked the right click 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.330
 and as you can see, I went up very fast and 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.950
 to go down, we throw nothing but 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.390
 quiet that not good 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.240
 when you put that water here, the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.429
 fall if you want or with the test in 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.770
 We are going to climb up here, I believe 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.200
 that climb is faster than the other 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.869
 way that flying but good now for 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.119
 the moment to tear it from scratch 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.929
 and I'm going to throw away you're going to see that I'm not going to 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.929
 spend not a heart 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.420
 and the genius as you see I have no position 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.520
 nothing weird not that this does not have tricks the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.550
 fall resists the water resists you 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.140
 the fall so let's go I'll teach you to 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.390
 build it 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.930
 and nothing will I catch the materials that 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.940
 they are coming I am going to put a moment in 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.910
 there we are 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:26.660
 come I feel carts are going to need 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.660
 ground rails for example and stairs 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.340
 so nothing this would be the next 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.819
 way let's put for example a 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.819
 staircase here 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.819
 another here for example good this 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.200
 you will have to do it in survival and 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.379
 logically doing it in creative is a 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.720
 nonsense so nothing is all stairs 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.720
 just like I did at the beginning 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.269
 Well I'm going to build it just like that because 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.650
 if it's not going to happen to me here all day and 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.870
 is the same thing you have to go up 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.890
 a little bit and it goes like this 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.370
 Oh, and you take that, come up, you put 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.370
 land 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.360
 there we are coming more up is 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.090
 say now not now we will have to 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.770
 place you are going to remove all this you put 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.950
 there 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.200
 a rail 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.060
 and a trolley 6 up calm 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.040
 it will not be so 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.040
 there is another one for example I know 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.490
 well a little messy the creative but 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:33.880
 good is the easiest in his rival 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.950
 and that's this ladder 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.130
 that ladder so that not so you can 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.320
 put the rail and that and so on with everyone 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.610
 then what you have to do is good 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.670
 end up 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.670
 and down somehow 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.850
 and from below you have to remove the 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.740
 ground horn 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.780
 there we are, only the trolley would be left 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.630
 because the rail where the wagon was 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.450
 when removing the earth fell climbing here 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.310
 You are at the same inside the trolley 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.700
 you remove and keep doing that and so 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.540
 bump 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.480
 traverse the wall to nothing and so everything 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.670
 up and good 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.590
 to download the only thing you have to do 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.590
 it is underneath everything to catch a poster 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.310
 and put it here let's put 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.950
 hit like 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.700
 take a bucket of water and in the block that 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.550
 is on top of poster that would be 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.430
 this one throw the water and now if we 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.230
 we throw we would already be resetting the 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.630
 fall is worth it because it is a block of water 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.790
 the one in the air then we 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.450
 resists fall fall 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.450
 let's go there 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.099
 and it's that easy 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.520
 so nothing kids a tutorial 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:58.440
 pretty short but cool 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.180
 and as you can see you can do the 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.310
 height that you want good minecraft has 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.630
 height limits but good I already 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.430
 You understand, it can also be done to 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.280
 down in case you want to go down to your 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.940
 mines or anything and nothing kids
