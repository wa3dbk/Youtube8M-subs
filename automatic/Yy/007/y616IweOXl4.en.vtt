00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.399
 Background is definitely going on 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.210
 my gameplay a sprengkommando 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.800

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.230
 I have the pons on the top left again 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.180
 war and the class set with it 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.040
 you can look at the norm lust 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.080
 but we have come to the 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.430
 theme a million euros for the winner 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.410
 of the championship tournament 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.720
 There are different possibilities 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.550
 First, eight of the best qualify 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.360
 teams from the league can 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.180

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.670
 eight teams of call of duty elite eight 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.130
 teams from the esl and 8 from others 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.989
 For example, the information on the platforms csl 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.280
 how you can qualify 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.409
 you can easily find it on the page 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.750
 www.zeit.de goes or simply works 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.070
 google there could also find it there 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.170
 just sl 1 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.880
 if then you are on the side of esl 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.200
 then you already see the currency of 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.090
 1 million euros 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.380
 there you can just pets and 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.420
 read everything to you 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.729
 Now we come to the hooks 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.710
 First of all, it's an xbox 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.560
 Players are for pc and playstation 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.060
 Unfortunately , this goal is not something for players 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.920
 I think it's a pity 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.750
 because in my opinion , I turn 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.030
 also made many millions with it 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.920
 playstation players and pc players themselves 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.400
 bought the game and why only one 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.820
 game 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.530
 a tournament for xbox secondly is a 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.420
 So team have a team with us 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.530
 been playing together for a long time 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.170
 to win 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.890
 I would recommend you if you still 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.479
 no team just goes to the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.740
 There you can find www.tuv.com 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.229
 also for the medicis service 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.450
 register or find a team so 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.070
 if you have found a team now xbox 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.210

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.010
 the qualification 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.630

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.260
 a platform like xbox and 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.150
 the other platform behind pending 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.840
 because then they would have in my opinion 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.030
 also only 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.860
 to bring out for xbox game around 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.920
