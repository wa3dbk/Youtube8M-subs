00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.699
 ten years 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.340
 the star already feels the weight of the age to 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.289
 circumvent the situation and keep the title 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.269
 people decided to play what they please 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.060
 the consumer is the pocket 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.490
 so astra 2010 has won several 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.110
 standard equipment and is still 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.320
 segment of the alloy wheels.

 already the 2.0 engine beckham that has 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.320
 more power with him the star yet 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.049
 better especially when stocked 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.630
 with alcohol because he delivers seven horses to 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.630
 more and does not disappoint with gasoline 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.500
 the neighborhood of botafogo x allows retakes 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.600
 speed without criticism 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.700
 you will not have been reducing so much 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.610
 even when loaded 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.610
 although coconut consumption improved in the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.790
 our circuit averaged 5.7 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.280
 kilometers per liter of alcohol and 8.2 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.930
 kilometers per liter of gasoline for the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.390
 direct side is the same 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.950
 accommodates four adults with comfort and one 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.680
 tight fifth in the middle of the bench 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.690
 rear is the finish does not charm 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.630
 also does not disappoint 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.760
 the trunk has good 370 liters of 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.340

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.640
 as optional 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.640
 this is too much trouble 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.980
 in everything and beyond everything there is more 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.620
 I bought the handicapped and precise direction 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.489
 the function is still good right 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.010
 stability 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.830
 anyway the taste of climbing and provide 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.410
 comfort when turning means with this 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.200
 new cost - effective for sure 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.319
 it will hold the segment folder to 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.900
 This track has nothing to sell. 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.790
 was a study of gm to see if it pleased 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.480
 did not please
