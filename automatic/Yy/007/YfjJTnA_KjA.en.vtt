we're going to seen these two pieces of
crochet<00:00:20.050> together<00:00:21.150> working<00:00:22.150> across<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:23.170> ends

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
crochet together working across the ends

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.760 
crochet together working across the ends
of<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:23.770> rows<00:00:24.040> of<00:00:24.430> each<00:00:24.970> of<00:00:25.300> the<00:00:25.450> pieces<00:00:25.770> this

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
of the rows of each of the pieces this

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.570 
of the rows of each of the pieces this
can<00:00:27.070> be<00:00:27.189> used<00:00:28.020> when<00:00:29.020> you<00:00:29.050> make<00:00:29.500> garments<00:00:30.340> or

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.430 
worked in rows on the Afghans but the
first<00:00:36.610> way<00:00:37.449> that<00:00:37.480> we're<00:00:38.020> going<00:00:38.199> to<00:00:38.260> show<00:00:38.410> you

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
first way that we're going to show you

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.150 
first way that we're going to show you
will<00:00:39.250> be<00:00:40.440> just<00:00:41.440> regular<00:00:41.680> whip<00:00:42.160> stitch<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
will be just regular whip stitch and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.850 
will be just regular whip stitch and
what<00:00:45.160> you<00:00:45.309> do<00:00:45.519> is<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:49.559> wrong<00:00:50.559> sides

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
what you do is with the wrong sides

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.310 
what you do is with the wrong sides
together<00:00:51.479> you're<00:00:52.479> going<00:00:52.720> to<00:00:53.080> work<00:00:53.739> through

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
together you're going to work through

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.920 
together you're going to work through
the<00:00:56.320> loops<00:00:56.589> on<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.400> sides<00:00:57.670> now<00:00:58.210> it's<00:00:58.780> not

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
the loops on the sides now it's not

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.810 
the loops on the sides now it's not
going<00:00:59.199> to<00:00:59.290> be<00:00:59.379> like<00:00:59.589> loops<00:00:59.920> at<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.220> top<00:01:00.339> of

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
going to be like loops at the top of

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.369 
going to be like loops at the top of
stitches<00:01:01.330> they're<00:01:01.540> just<00:01:01.750> going<00:01:02.019> to<00:01:02.110> be<00:01:02.229> the

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
stitches they're just going to be the

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.369 
stitches they're just going to be the
loops<00:01:02.650> that<00:01:02.860> are<00:01:03.489> formed<00:01:04.299> when<00:01:04.989> you<00:01:05.140> make<00:01:05.350> a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
loops that are formed when you make a

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.859 
loops that are formed when you make a
stitch<00:01:05.799> just<00:01:06.299> these<00:01:07.299> loops<00:01:07.750> here<00:01:08.549> normally

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
stitch just these loops here normally

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.789 
stitch just these loops here normally
you<00:01:10.869> would<00:01:11.310> leave<00:01:12.310> an<00:01:12.490> extra<00:01:12.700> long<00:01:13.210> end<00:01:13.810> that's

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
you would leave an extra long end that's

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.219 
you would leave an extra long end that's
one<00:01:15.310> less<00:01:15.549> end<00:01:16.000> that<00:01:16.270> you<00:01:16.450> would<00:01:16.600> have<00:01:16.810> to

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
one less end that you would have to

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.830 
one less end that you would have to
weave<00:01:17.560> in<00:01:18.070> if<00:01:18.369> you<00:01:18.880> leave<00:01:19.270> them<00:01:19.450> long<00:01:19.689> enough

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
weave in if you leave them long enough

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.560 
weave in if you leave them long enough
into<00:01:20.289> work<00:01:20.680> you're<00:01:20.920> seen<00:01:21.280> I<00:01:21.640> would<00:01:22.149> normally

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
into work you're seen I would normally

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
so with whip stitch of the end of the

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.690 
so with whip stitch of the end of the
rows<00:01:39.219> you<00:01:40.000> go<00:01:40.210> through<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.780> first<00:01:40.990> stitch

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.270 
stitches don't get distorted or the same
will<00:02:23.200> pull<00:02:24.160> pucker<00:02:24.790> down<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.930> you'll<00:02:26.769> get<00:02:26.980> an

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
will pull pucker down and you'll get an

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.620 
will pull pucker down and you'll get an
odd<00:02:27.489> look<00:02:28.120> along<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:29.440> edge<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.519> you<00:02:31.390> won't

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
odd look along that edge and you won't

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.520 
odd look along that edge and you won't
go<00:02:31.870> from<00:02:33.930> one<00:02:34.930> edge<00:02:36.540> all<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.600> way<00:02:37.870> up<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.410> the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
go from one edge all the way up to the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.840 
go from one edge all the way up to the
next<00:02:38.769> edge<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.730> let<00:02:42.910> me<00:02:43.030> flatten<00:02:44.019> it<00:02:44.140> out<00:02:44.260> here

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
next edge and let me flatten it out here

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.729 
next edge and let me flatten it out here
this<00:02:45.850> is<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.510> right<00:02:46.780> side<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.930> if<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.530> was

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
this is the right side and if it was

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.640 
this is the right side and if it was
done<00:02:50.980> in<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.310> green<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:52.810> would<00:02:52.989> not<00:02:53.170> show<00:02:53.440> all

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
done in the green it would not show all

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.519 
done in the green it would not show all
that<00:02:53.920> very<00:02:54.130> much
