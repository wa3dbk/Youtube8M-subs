00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.259
 Of course I will not go with a review 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.150
 is a monkey what to do but in the new 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.550
 age movie directed with who is 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.170
 has humanity that is immune to it 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.010
 virus which occurred in the previous part 1 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.869
 Scattered 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.400
 entrenched in a kind of own set-up 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.130
 ford it looks nice 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.660
 only logically the power will be on 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.490
 run out of a given moment and yes they 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.040
 need electricity somewhere 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.230
 and that can or a place and that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.120
 is the then in a nearby area 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.820
 Only this area is occupied to you 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.800
 namely because of that has such a ceasar the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.020
 the leader of these monkeys is humanity 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.489
 allow to fix the then and will 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.590
 everyone then you have a happy life 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.239
 further lead or something for which everyone 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.770
 lead a happy life for the rest 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.600
 or is the distrust of each other so 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.399
 large and the pleuris breaks out 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.399
 you see it in the planet of the apes 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.820
 party 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.219
 you speak the caesar 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.070
 black sheep a white tie gala 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.980
 Oh 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.960
 in 1968 the first came to the planet of the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.159
 apes film from only these monkeys were 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.880
 of course not with the computer 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.369
 animated but they were in an approach 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.439
 the looks and runs on him anyway 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.170
 The budget of this one movie is estimated at 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.730
 has unimpeded $ 78 million and 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.530
 comparison that grab what I just have none 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.959
 Yes you would with that amount 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.450
 around 3 million 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.519
 that is a lot 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.379
 the sequel to the prints that has 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.769
 has already been announced and will 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.450
 expected to be on July 28, 2016 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.069
 are in the cinema 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.170
 then the plant or animal has a lot 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.090
 epic moments of which the strongest in 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.590
 the beginning are just so full of you 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.299
 just sit down for those 200 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.610
 and the light comes with the rest of it 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.319
 the film because the opening scene appealed to me 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.329
 a bit reminiscent of that of gladiator ' 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.920
 film directed o'reilly shot in which 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.390
 jumps a bulb through a mystery 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.459
 and then the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.319
 yes i know how hell breaks loose how that 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.180
 then the planet of the apes it out 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.670
 you see it must check yourself and 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.530
 maybe you recognize it too 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.569
 very sorry it is where the monkeys are 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.400
 live in a kind of trees that is so 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.540
 epic who would also like to just order 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.090
 backyard 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.459
 that probably goes but also something else 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.900
 a lot of fat is maybe what 's that 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.359
 monkeys are animated with 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.150
 see computer technology yes it is so cool 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.519
 I did yes it's just hats off 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.709
 the door and the circus and also the people 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.940
 who have already arranged that it is 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.440
 so far 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.540
 and where you need the lot just for that 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.220
 already checking and whatever I recommend 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.840
 is that your rising is planned or that really 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.459
 if the part for this still goes for it 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.280
 check because then you understand the 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.780
 frustration and people get much better 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.359
 also many back a link to the previous one 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.350
 share with james franco in the lead role yes 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.660
 and then you also understand the emotional 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.340
 want the one film that I incidentally want two 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.380
 customers think have one 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.110
 it is necessary to complete the story 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.640
 and two it does ensure that 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.710
 the process of the story in the film 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.270
 what found in a delay but 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.880
 none none the less 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.500
 then him that has four names and strong 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.660
 then you should definitely watch me because from 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.700
 Thursday is now in the cinema 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.960
