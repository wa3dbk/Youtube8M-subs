00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
millions of years and all I can say it's

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:04.450 
millions of years and all I can say it's
awesome<00:01:53.710> that<00:01:54.930> job

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.149 

like<00:02:05.090> its<00:02:05.270> namesake<00:02:05.590> most<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.770> walls<00:02:06.979> are

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
like its namesake most of the walls are

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.029 
like its namesake most of the walls are
quite<00:02:07.430> narrow<00:02:08.200> then<00:02:09.200> there's<00:02:09.440> places<00:02:09.709> where

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
quite narrow then there's places where

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:22.820 
quite narrow then there's places where
it<00:02:10.130> opens<00:02:10.280> up<00:02:10.640> into<00:02:10.880> spacious<00:02:11.450> alcoves
