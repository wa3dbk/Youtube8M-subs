00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
fully-formed and there's more seed up to

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.800 
fully-formed and there's more seed up to
this<00:04:36.980> tourist<00:04:37.490> ammeter<00:04:37.940> is<00:04:38.090> at<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.360> bottom<00:04:38.720> of

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
this tourist ammeter is at the bottom of

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.030 
this tourist ammeter is at the bottom of
course<00:04:38.960> that's<00:04:39.140> where<00:04:39.320> it's<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.530> hottest<00:04:39.710> too

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
course that's where it's the hottest too

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.100 
course that's where it's the hottest too
right<00:04:40.430> so<00:04:40.970> be<00:04:41.150> careful<00:04:41.510> wear<00:04:41.630> gloves<00:04:41.870> when

right so be careful wear gloves when

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.780 
right so be careful wear gloves when
you're<00:04:42.170> doing<00:04:42.440> that<00:04:42.620> but<00:04:43.340> you<00:04:43.460> can<00:04:43.610> harvest

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
you're doing that but you can harvest

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.130 
you're doing that but you can harvest
the<00:04:43.970> seed<00:04:44.120> you<00:04:44.150> could<00:04:44.390> take<00:04:44.600> them<00:04:44.720> out<00:04:44.840> now<00:04:44.870> in

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
the seed you could take them out now in

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.300 
the seed you could take them out now in
storm<00:04:45.380> but<00:04:45.530> it's<00:04:45.620> a<00:04:45.680> simple<00:04:45.980> thing<00:04:46.070> to<00:04:46.130> do<00:04:46.250> is

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
storm but it's a simple thing to do is

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.010 
storm but it's a simple thing to do is
let<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.490> pods<00:04:46.730> dry<00:04:47.090> then<00:04:47.390> just<00:04:47.600> crumble<00:04:47.960> them

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
let the pods dry then just crumble them

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.000 
let the pods dry then just crumble them
up<00:04:48.190> as<00:04:49.190> you<00:04:49.430> said<00:04:49.640> wearing<00:04:49.970> rubber<00:04:50.180> gloves<00:04:50.300> and

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
up as you said wearing rubber gloves and

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.890 
up as you said wearing rubber gloves and
then<00:04:52.010> separate<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:53.060> seed<00:04:53.330> from<00:04:53.540> the<00:04:53.600> chaff

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
then separate the seed from the chaff

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.900 
then separate the seed from the chaff
right<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:54.680> then<00:04:55.010> you<00:04:55.130> can<00:04:55.160> store<00:04:55.550> them<00:04:55.700> again

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
right and then you can store them again

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.030 
right and then you can store them again
in<00:04:56.150> a<00:04:56.270> cool<00:04:56.540> and<00:04:56.780> dry<00:04:56.870> place<00:04:57.260> until<00:04:57.920> you're

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
in a cool and dry place until you're
