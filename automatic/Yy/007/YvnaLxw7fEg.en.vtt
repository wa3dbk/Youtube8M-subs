for this so I thought I'd do it's really

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.480 
for this so I thought I'd do it's really
simple<00:00:06.960> it's<00:00:07.140> how<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.319> make<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.919> bootable<00:00:08.280> USB

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
simple it's how to make a bootable USB

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.450 
simple it's how to make a bootable USB
device<00:00:09.480> so<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.840> got<00:00:10.019> my<00:00:10.170> USB<00:00:10.590> drive<00:00:10.980> here<00:00:11.280> it's

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
device so I got my USB drive here it's

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.330 
device so I got my USB drive here it's
super<00:00:11.730> tiny<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.719> me<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.290> bootable<00:00:13.799> for

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
super tiny so to me this bootable for

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.450 
super tiny so to me this bootable for
Ubuntu<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.780> it's<00:00:15.870> gonna<00:00:15.960> be<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.139> bunch<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.460> 12.04

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
Ubuntu so it's gonna be a bunch of 12.04

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.550 
Ubuntu so it's gonna be a bunch of 12.04
so<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.449> way<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.630> can<00:00:18.840> either<00:00:19.109> install

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
so it's that way you can either install

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.859 
so it's that way you can either install
a<00:00:19.710> bunch<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.070> 12.04<00:00:20.910> or<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.420> could<00:00:21.570> run<00:00:21.720> it

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
a bunch of 12.04 or you could run it

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.090 
a bunch of 12.04 or you could run it
live<00:00:22.109> which<00:00:22.410> means<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.740> don't<00:00:22.859> have<00:00:23.010> to

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
live which means you don't have to

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.380 
live which means you don't have to
install<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.730> still<00:00:23.939> use<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.210> full

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
install but you can still use the full

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.120 
install but you can still use the full
desktop<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.109> won't<00:00:25.289> make<00:00:25.439> any<00:00:25.619> changes<00:00:26.010> to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
desktop and it won't make any changes to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.200 
desktop and it won't make any changes to
your<00:00:26.160> hard<00:00:26.400> drive<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.580> it's<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> great<00:00:27.029> way<00:00:27.180> to

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
your hard drive so it's a great way to

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.849 
your hard drive so it's a great way to
just<00:00:27.480> test<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> bunch<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.529> before

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
just test out a bunch of before

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.080 
just test out a bunch of before
installing<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:29.519> you're<00:00:29.640> kind<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.000> the

installing and if you're kind of on the
fence<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.689> great<00:00:30.840> way<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.960> test<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.380> out

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
fence it's a great way to test it out

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.010
