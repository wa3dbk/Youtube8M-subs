00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.399
 today I bring you a very simple recipe 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.170
 to enjoy as a couple this is a 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.170
 Almond flan with a hint of lemon 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.450
 also although we can buy it already 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.680
 prepared let's make the candy 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.680
 I hope you like it 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.120
 We preheat the oven with heat only 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.490
 down to 160 degrees 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.369
 we put water in the oven tray 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.320
 It is a recipe with few ingredients if 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.090
 you want you can double or triple the 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.510
 amounts for you to come out a plan more 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.510
 big 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.350
 in a bowl we are going to mix all the 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.760
 ingredients first we will place the 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.760
 eggs and we will beat them 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.890
 we mix the milk with the cookies for 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.890
 that they soften 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.090
 then we add the sugar 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.130
 and the ground almond 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.130
 i 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.870
 we add the lemon zest this 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.350
 will give a lot of aroma 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:30.060
 and finally the cookies with the milk 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.060
 remove and reserve 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.450
 for the candy we're just going to 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.770
 need two ingredients that are the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.770
 sugar and water 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.280
 We put a saucepan on the fire with the sugar and 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:53.100
 the water 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.780
 and stir for the sugar to be 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.900
 dissolve but once it starts to 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.850
 bubbling we will not touch it anymore 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.310
 we will leave untouched until it is 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.740
 golden I know it does not look golden in the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.660
 image but really was much more 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.630
 of what you see and at that moment what 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.670
 we put in the flanera 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.620
 we wait a few seconds and we put 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.650
 our mixture of flan 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.930
 I baked him 15 minutes just heat 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.560
 down and then I added another 10 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.900
 minutes with heat up and down 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.150
 if you do not know if it's done by clicking 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.500
 a stick and if it comes out clean is that 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.650
 is 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.480
 as you can see is a very simple recipe very 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.060
 easy to do in which only 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.550
 we mix the ingredients and we already get 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.350
 a delicious flan that can do it 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.960
 any one at a time and that is going to 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.220
 Delight and you will see a kiss and 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.220
