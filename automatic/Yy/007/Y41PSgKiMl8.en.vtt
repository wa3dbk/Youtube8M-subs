00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
it's a vehicle of this vintage you got

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.190 
it's a vehicle of this vintage you got
your<00:02:59.870> standard<00:03:00.519> 90s<00:03:01.519> GM<00:03:01.940> interior<00:03:02.480> full<00:03:03.080> of

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
hard plastics and it's pretty horrible

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.080 
hard plastics and it's pretty horrible
if<00:03:06.049> you<00:03:06.140> ask<00:03:06.290> me<00:03:06.530> it's<00:03:06.829> not<00:03:06.950> very<00:03:07.010> good

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
if you ask me it's not very good

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
but you know what Corvettes are

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.170 
but you know what Corvettes are
inexpensive<00:03:11.380> relatively<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.700> want<00:03:14.030> a

now<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.360> zo6<00:03:25.990> replaced<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:27.490> c4s<00:03:28.000> dr1<00:03:28.360> is<00:03:28.690> the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
now the zo6 replaced the c4s dr1 is the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.750 
now the zo6 replaced the c4s dr1 is the
king<00:03:29.020> of<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.200> hill<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:30.040> was<00:03:30.160> faster<00:03:30.640> in

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
king of the hill and it was faster in

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.750

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
the exception of top speed but this was

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.920 
the exception of top speed but this was
track-oriented<00:03:36.490> that<00:03:36.760> was<00:03:36.880> more<00:03:37.090> TT<00:03:37.480> top

agree with I think it should have been a
little<00:04:26.760> bit<00:04:26.940> more<00:04:26.970> actually<00:04:27.570> they<00:04:28.050> only<00:04:28.200> did

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
little bit more actually they only did

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.860 
little bit more actually they only did

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
brake pad upgrade but they didn't do a

full brake upgrade over the standard c5

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.090 
full brake upgrade over the standard c5
and<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.510> lot<00:04:33.720> of<00:04:33.810> owners<00:04:34.110> have<00:04:34.260> had<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.680> change

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
and a lot of owners have had to change

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.100 
and a lot of owners have had to change
that<00:04:35.340> out<00:04:35.400> if<00:04:36.030> they<00:04:36.300> want<00:04:36.450> to<00:04:36.540> actually<00:04:36.690> track

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
now GM used the fixture of coupe variant

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.270 
now GM used the fixture of coupe variant
for<00:04:47.349> the<00:04:47.379> zo6

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
for the zo6

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.189 
for the zo6
it<00:04:48.639> was<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:48.879> lightest<00:04:49.240> version<00:04:49.599> of<00:04:49.720> GM<00:04:49.960> had

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
it was the lightest version of GM had

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.070 
it was the lightest version of GM had

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
just over 3,100 pounds you have revised

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.249

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
the act of handling setup did was it

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.999 
the act of handling setup did was it
check<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.180> steering<00:05:10.479> angle<00:05:10.720> yaw<00:05:11.440> rate<00:05:11.770> and

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
check the steering angle yaw rate and

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.159 
check the steering angle yaw rate and
lateral<00:05:12.460> acceleration<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.449> that's<00:05:13.870> how<00:05:14.050> they

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
lateral acceleration and that's how they

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.659 
lateral acceleration and that's how they
used<00:05:14.199> it<00:05:14.500> for<00:05:14.560> competitive<00:05:15.099> driving<00:05:15.490> mode

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
used it for competitive driving mode
