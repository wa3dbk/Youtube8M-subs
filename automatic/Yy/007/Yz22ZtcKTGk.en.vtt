00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.090
 the pictures as is here is my skin 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.340
 here what about the winter that is with my 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.650
 I wanted to do a little more funny is not 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.330
 comb and you have to do me for 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.280
 twitter can fit so many thanks here in 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.900
 actually there was a skeleton and it's good 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.270
 it's very good here there were some hands 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.760
 there are mine that I put here in the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.130
 four little ones put spain woyzeck and 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.170
 comes with this is the cool effect 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.820
 here I skin again and as you see there 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.500
 enough custom pictures 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.420
 some had to repeat us because if 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.650
 I did not fit the whole table with a 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.830
 who letters give is so cool here I put 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.140
 I do not know my face is something funny here such 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.940
 so much we are not going to see the importance of 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.010
 this pack text as this is everything 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.160
 it's been all transparent because I 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.470
 like that because that's how it was more than pvp 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.640
 and that's my style and well yes we're going 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.050
 we open the table of grace here 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.170
 we will find my name is first 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.700
 character and my beautiful skin and good then 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.610
 here you put the crack theory it seems that the 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.680
 object over my face and good here 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.469
 we go to which chest doubt one's chest 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.329
 the first chest and how my face comes out with 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.760
 the sword and if we go to the double crossing of 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.829
 jazz would do everything everything 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.689
 well here puts in my name is it finished 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.420
 to do and the skin that if I remember well 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:29.730
 he made me a greeting for you are you 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.379
 still watching my videos that I did not 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.120
 it's been a long time since we spoke to see if 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.159
 we speak someday and good that you have 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.659
 fear of frogs here let's see how 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.909
 is the chests is not very good either 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.420
 to do a moment this when a model 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:44.400
 0 and we're going to put on and like spain 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.230
 in the crafter esp / mini coffee because if not 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.299
 it does not fit everything and you see who and everything 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.639
 transparent as I like it and good 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.579
 let's start eat you let's see a 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:55.739
 little the particles to have because 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.030
 I take one of the particles that has 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.280
 this text so that I liked 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.950
 much how you see here will come particles 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.659
 in the triangles triangles so it's 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.879
 so cool of Paraguay I like it like 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.909
 this is how you see the particles 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.470
 triangles triangles minus those of 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.870
 poison that I remember well 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.250
 these are different I think they are 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.250
 different like that 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.950
 to see if the instance is also 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.870
 different as it is they are like little stars 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.910
 They are not triangles and I liked them 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.740
 You see here, all my who is that 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.140
 I think it gives a very cool touch 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.840
 all the two drawings in the chests of 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.970
 soon that special hitchhiking to not everything 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.640
 you would be responsible you are going to catch and you see three 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.010
 corners that motivate at least no and good 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.600
 let's see how you see here are all 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.970
 the swords changed that I liked 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.860
 a lot we are going to leave this and I liked 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.410
 much this type of swords as you see is 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.910
 as pvp and let's see how you see here the 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.220
 of gold is to say lilac and golden here the 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.780
 stone rents iron and that of 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.630
 diamond these swords I liked 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.280
 I suppose that the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.410
 that I really liked the war is 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.520
 very cool here as is the armor and other 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.170
 thing I also liked a lot is 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.290
 the arc but we'll see the armor is 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.450
 the one of the moto a pack or facebook is good 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.370
 a mix of football and different 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.150
 textures packs and I liked it has 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.519
 liked 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.889
 here the books are like this and the ndr 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.389
 so it is very cool as you see and what 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.389
 nice is that it's very nice to see we're going 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.720
 it does not matter we cut ourselves to the chest 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.250
 perfect and here we already take the 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.259
 armor these are that right now we 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.349
 they are interested but the arch looks how cool it is 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:40.240
 a black bow like that is black and it changes 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.969
 of color like the peace button we go at random 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.339
 and we can give that horse 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:47.769
 I'm sorry little horse but you have to 

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:50.799
 die for what you eat the bow is very 

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:54.490
 well wood died died the little horse 

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:59.009
 died that little horse also 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.539
 delays that you die 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.479
 I say goodbye as you see the arch is 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:06.310
 very well I liked the arch and 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.400
 the stars that I like a lot because 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:13.820
 if now we do like that first set 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.920
 more or less is day and also the sun 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.320
 it's like it's very real it's very real it's very 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.920
 real and good, there's not much more in 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.480
 take this that is the golden apple that 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.100
 It is also very cool and as you can see 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.860
 the particles are also triangles 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:31.100
 but this time it's like saying 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.110
 danger danger this with if you do not get 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.560
 with this one that has something very small on it 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.840
 And it's dangerous 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.520
 the exclamation point is not very good 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.910
 very cool I loved this texture 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.530
