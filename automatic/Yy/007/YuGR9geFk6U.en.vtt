00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello friends welcome you to 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.710
 my channel today I would like to 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.470
 talk about how you can quickly 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.360
 align the wire Well this 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.870
 one doctor wire goes on rings 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.579
 so if you need to align it then 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.179
 it certainly makes up a lot 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:24.230
 hand problems i'm almost impossible 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:27.839
 money to perfect condition align 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.439
 that is , you have to apply such 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:35.160
 extra money here I thought 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:41.250
 one of them is this 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:46.050
 from wolf 70 there are two bearings not 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:52.499
 must rotate and move one 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.140
 there is press down the moving roller then 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:59.659
 I have it between those 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.590
 bearings watch this way you can 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:08.550
 there leave our stocking and 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:13.710
 produce broach but i will speed up the process 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:16.320
 now you should see for yourself you know what 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.170
 we do press it all drives our 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.890
 setting we take a curve wire here 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.890
 you can see shenolt 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:31.860
 twisted take a screwdriver 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:34.140
 insert our wire then only 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.670
 tearing up 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.219
 pinch between our fingers from 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.490
 bearings so tighten immediately 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.490
 under can suppress so sensitive and 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.490
 stretching 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.750
 as we see god the phrase on ejection but it 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.750
 almost perfectly flat 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.540
 on the sly 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.380
 I really liked this method 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.920
 such products need to do such here 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.130
 Fedorovna and pond and then use 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.390
 further hands of course it is not 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.390
 it seems possible 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.090
 what places are you rolling in 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:51.600
 bearings and this happens here 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:54.590
 alignment here it is practically 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.840
 perfectly flat 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.620
 thank you all for your attention 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.739
 watched this video subscribe 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.220
 there are still many interesting things to come 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.220
 see you soon
