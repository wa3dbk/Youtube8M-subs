00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 voice and video over the internet today is something 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.430
 even because the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.189
 Internet users are not satisfied with any 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.010
 thing has healing of the image of something of everything 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.990
 it's a thing there the 30s understood that the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.820
 patron was with opash pains of a 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.740
 recording a video on the internet with the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.199
 internet channel and will show you that 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.060
 there was even tampon look 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.189
 it's no secret to anyone that the internet 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.210
 stands out when it comes to videos 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.980
 creative 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.199
 It was if the time they pick up a camera 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.359
 recording was something innovative 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.920
 today the thing is super professional until 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.170
 because it is a requirement of Internet users 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.790
 also grew that there are people winning 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.000
 money with it 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.930
 moreover very g is an example of the port 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.550
 funds 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.680
 in less than a year on the network already 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.120
 exceeded the mark of 2 million 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.370
 channel subscribers 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.890
 videos have an average of 3 million 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.530
 views and today the back door 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.079
 already has a team of 30 people and 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.940
 a three-story building as headquarters 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.789
 and there are people who are chasing after 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.949
 its slice in this cake is the case of the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.890
 people have sex the agent is in 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.310
 scenery here because then why do people 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.470
 is now recording one of the most 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.570
 intense and tense of a regular guy but 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.880
 the holidays we do series the series a 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.820
 scene that I would say defines the web series 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.770
 that until then came episodes with 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.110
 humor jokes and now the business 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.610
 is serious and because when you had this 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.470
 idea to start making videos 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.270
 why post on the internet 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.759
 first because I think the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.829
 internet is an open channel, right? 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.009
 Who wants to do what they want to do? 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.259
 can put there but I think also by 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.270
 the issue of reaching an audience 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.640
 a little more universal and not 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.520
 simply focus on the city or the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.130
 state and beyond the team 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.190
 the improvised scenario but here 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.770
 It's not the house of the mother joana. 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.940
 taken very seriously we dedicate ourselves 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.190
 totally for this professionally 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.110
 with the schedule schedule to follow the 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.110
 actor takes a whistle if he arrives late 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.990
 what is rolling now it is an essay 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.030
 of the scene has lasted more or less 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.190
 hour and a half they need to hit everybody 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.080
 the points to start recording there 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:18.950
 My master is so simple to make video 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:21.020
 and we have already seen that it 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.500
 casting was the second part 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.020
 now 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.690
 Now they're getting ready for us. 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.830
 getting into the picture even now is with the sound 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.870
 What am I going to do? 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.750
 the direction I'm going to do it twice 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.080
 do photography and now it's time to 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.360
 current even direct and thus has 15 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.270
 tanks and various plans then to whom 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.160
 do not know a scene makes us once and 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.680
 to be ready to step on 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.330
 the actors themselves as they can to make 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.220
 It all goes well with improvisation. 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.990
 people are here in a factory and such 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.490
 various machines and actresses one 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.340

 everyone is very excited that it's a 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.660
 heavy week requires quite a lot of 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.070
 also of all the actors involved 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.020
 I said that the professional business wants 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.120
 It 's even blood in here as it is. 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.480

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.970
 little sugar and gelatin 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.709
 I did not understand very well he was personal 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.590
 that did but in the end the result is good 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:36.680
