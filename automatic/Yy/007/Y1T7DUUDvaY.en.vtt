a Rocky Mountain textured g10 handle and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.500 
a Rocky Mountain textured g10 handle and
the<00:01:28.860> grip<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:30.200> amazing<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.560> knife

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
the grip is just amazing on this knife

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.620 
the grip is just amazing on this knife
see<00:01:33.510> you<00:01:34.080> this<00:01:34.320> large<00:01:35.130> aggressive<00:01:35.730> jumping<00:01:36.480> on

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
see you this large aggressive jumping on

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.080 
see you this large aggressive jumping on
the<00:01:36.840> back<00:01:37.080> where<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.650> would<00:01:38.160> put<00:01:38.580> your<00:01:38.640> thumb

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the back where you would put your thumb

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.280 
the back where you would put your thumb
at<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.890> I<00:01:40.890> mean<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.580> fits<00:01:42.030> great<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
at and I mean just fits great in the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.140 
at and I mean just fits great in the
handle<00:01:43.680> they've<00:01:43.860> even<00:01:44.070> put<00:01:44.370> a<00:01:44.430> little<00:01:44.640> jimping

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
handle they've even put a little jimping

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.899 
handle they've even put a little jimping
on<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.540> back<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.380> think<00:01:46.800> that's<00:01:46.980> to<00:01:47.700> catch

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
on the back here I think that's to catch

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.990 
on the back here I think that's to catch
your<00:01:48.180> palm<00:01:48.420> when<00:01:48.750> you're<00:01:48.900> holding<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:50.000> it's

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
your palm when you're holding it it's

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.330 
your palm when you're holding it it's
got<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> bit<00:01:51.570> driver<00:01:51.930> here<00:01:52.350> built<00:01:52.890> into<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
got a bit driver here built into the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.300 
got a bit driver here built into the
handle<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.850> does<00:01:54.120> not<00:01:54.390> come<00:01:54.780> with<00:01:54.810> any

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
handle it does not come with any

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.010 
handle it does not come with any
included<00:01:56.310> bits<00:01:56.670> but<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.240> should<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.720> fit

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
included bits but it should just fit

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.140 
included bits but it should just fit
your<00:01:58.260> standard<00:01:58.800> quarter<00:01:59.159> inch<00:01:59.430> drive<00:01:59.760> hex

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
your standard quarter inch drive hex

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.130 
your standard quarter inch drive hex
bits<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:02.060> suppose<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.570> there<00:02:03.780> are<00:02:03.810> some

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
bits I suppose that there are some

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.540 
bits I suppose that there are some
people<00:02:04.320> who<00:02:04.620> would<00:02:04.770> find<00:02:05.010> that<00:02:05.280> feature

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
people who would find that feature

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.300 
people who would find that feature
really<00:02:06.240> neat<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.960> think<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:08.039> cool<00:02:08.280> that

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
really neat I think it's cool that

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.880 
really neat I think it's cool that
they've<00:02:08.640> done<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.649> although<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.679> think

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
they've done that although I think

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.520 
they've done that although I think
that'd<00:02:11.250> probably<00:02:11.459> be<00:02:11.879> more<00:02:12.120> useful<00:02:12.659> for<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.989> lot

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that'd probably be more useful for a lot

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.020 
that'd probably be more useful for a lot
