00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
reviewing the newly introduced infrared

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.870 
reviewing the newly introduced infrared
colorway<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.410> infrared<00:00:19.680> 23<00:00:20.369> black<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
colorway this is infrared 23 black and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.250 
colorway this is infrared 23 black and
infra<00:00:21.150> red<00:00:21.210> 23<00:00:21.720> those<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.170> official

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
infra red 23 those are the official

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.500 
infra red 23 those are the official
color<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:22.859> its<00:00:23.460> up<00:00:23.670> actually<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.300> pretty

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
color with its up actually a pretty

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.599 
color with its up actually a pretty
bright<00:00:24.750> shoe<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.230> lot<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.070> people<00:00:26.279> like<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.430> call

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
bright shoe a lot of people like to call

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.509 
bright shoe a lot of people like to call
use<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> Toros<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:27.680> it's<00:00:28.680> kind<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.279> hard<00:00:29.490> to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
use the Toros but it's kind of hard to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.780 
use the Toros but it's kind of hard to
classify<00:00:30.029> them<00:00:30.179> as<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> Toro<00:00:30.630> when<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:32.189> shoe<00:00:32.489> is

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
classify them as a Toro when the shoe is

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.410 
classify them as a Toro when the shoe is
actually<00:00:33.149> infrared<00:00:33.870> 23<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:36.030> infrared

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
actually infrared 23 so the infrared

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.940 
actually infrared 23 so the infrared
color<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.870> often<00:00:37.290> linked<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.100> white<00:00:39.950> white

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
color is often linked to the white white

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.069 
color is often linked to the white white
an<00:00:41.100> infrared<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.670> black<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.120> infrared<00:00:42.480> pair

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
an infrared and black and infrared pair

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.020 
an infrared and black and infrared pair
and<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.649> time<00:00:43.920> Jordan<00:00:44.489> Brand<00:00:44.610> wanted<00:00:44.910> to

and this time Jordan Brand wanted to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.209 
and this time Jordan Brand wanted to
take<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.960> infrared<00:00:46.350> colorway<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.950> new

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
take the infrared colorway to a new

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.139 
take the infrared colorway to a new
level<00:00:48.410> with<00:00:49.410> pretty<00:00:49.950> much<00:00:50.160> an<00:00:50.309> all<00:00:50.550> over<00:00:50.579> and
