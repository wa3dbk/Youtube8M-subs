00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.470
 when you want, we start 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.500
 of colo javi victory was achieved but 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.500
 it was not possible to avoid the descent 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.020
 If the truth is that 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.620
 It's a very sad day for me 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.590
 professionally and personally 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.920
 I am very sorry 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.640
 the team today 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.660
 this extended 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.360
 and good as you comment despite the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.829
 victory the results have not been given 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.920
 neither did we depend on us 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.030
 themselves and it was one of the possibilities 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.090
 that could be given 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.549
 but good at the moment the truth 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.250
 is that any analysis that can 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.400
 make the match of the situation from 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.130
 then he does not have any 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.159
 relevance given especially the situation 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.840
 in which at this time there is the 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.929
 team is the club and we are all 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.369
 I'm sorry I'm deeply sorry 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:26.390
 I deeply regret the situation to which 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.380
 we have arrived and I wish from the heart that 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.630
 the sooner osasuna is back 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.130
 employed and that's what Javier has not 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.740
 it depends on yourself in the last day 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.270
 that you do your homework but you had to 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.000
 expect other results that today 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.170
 unfortunately we have been given yes yes 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.300
 this has been the result of the party 's 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.090
 today 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.340
 has been the result of a series of results 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.040
 previous ones in which we have not 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.170
 got 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.810
 the necessary points to get to this 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.720
 end a little more relaxed and when 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.930
 it seemed that we were very close we have not 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.820
 been able to add what is necessary and 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.640
 we have arrived at this topic day 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.880
 very needy and especially needy 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.110
 of other results from other equipment and 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.980
 depend on other teams because the truth 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.010
 he always has these risks 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.040
 arrival you said you wanted or believed 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.420
 can get more performance from this 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.830
 same template local players 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.110
 seen from one to the other silently 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.640
 first days you think you've 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.410
 got them to walk more 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.780
 sports performance 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.350
 well now yes when I took the team 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.570
 we were last in these moments then 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.230
 we have descended beyond entering 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.230
 that situation or not 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.500
 I think we have not been at our level 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:51.980
 for to avoid relegation I think it's 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.470
 true that we do not have many more 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.990
 virtues that other teams and much more 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.790
 quality nor many equal much more 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.280
 capacity that other teams have 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.900
 tried but it has not been possible I think 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.940
 that we have let escape in certain 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.610
 moments of the season our 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.830
 opportunity not in the end that already in the 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.440
 final because everyone squeezes all the 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.420
 world is a little nears its 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.280
 level and we who at certain times 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.739
 Well, we've been even the same 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.540
 above we have not been able to 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.560
 get to the end depending on us 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.480
 I do not know if he has been able or not 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.880
 get more performance what I do know that 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.260
 I try my best and it's worth it 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.050
 it remains to me that after all the effort 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.030
 we have not achieved the goal if you have 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.100
 penis or in regards to you 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.440
 like to continue next year sounds 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.530
 to try everything for the first in 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.720
 these moments 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.010
 no valuations of that kind are applicable and 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.810
 I think that 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.409
 we are at a very sad time to 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.150
 and all have to think from 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.590
 tomorrow what is best for the club to 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.200
 everyone 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.760
 with the 3-0 of the atletico madrid seemed 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.200
 that the state the relationship had almost 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.040
 seven points that has happened since 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.040
 then so far 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:09.630
 in the end it is what I have told you we have not 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.630
 been able to maintain a regularity 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.320
 to compete and draw points where 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.120
 I really think we should have 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.699
 taken out in this second round 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.120
 and we are running out of options and I think that 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.919
 little by little the teams have gone as I have 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.479
 said before competing at your level or 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.120
 approaching their level teams that have 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.460
 state below 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.139
 have been approaching their level and 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.289
 we have gone, I think 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.439
 getting worse we have been lowering our 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.439
 level 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.110
 and looking back and from that 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.460
 match against Atletico Madrid will 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.750
 regrets of any of the decisions 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.750
 that you have taken from then until today 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.000
 I do not know exactly what you can do 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.100
 refer in example the party of the other 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.160
 day against espanyol is good 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.160
 tie 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.159
 well we have always competed to 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.069
 for the victory and we have not been 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:15.139
 able we have let escape not the other 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.699
 day the other day we had removed the 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.759
 hand of sergio garcÃ­a because the same thing 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.169
 had changed the penalty or if in matches 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.400
 previous we would have been able to 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.280
 keep a result here central 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.050
 valencia 10 in that move because water is 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.509
 would have changed does not make much sense 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.000
 for me to look back when we know 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:35.150
 or we believe that we have tried to 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.610
 maximum that we have not been able to but it 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.219
 has tried that's why I was repenting of 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.979
 something not so good one always feels 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:44.840
 guilty and look back and try to 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.279
 analyze things and change things 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.310
 because that is how logically I would pretend 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:50.810
 change the final outcome but in each 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.090
 moment decisions are made that one 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.500
 believes that they are the best for the team 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.919
 and with that intention they have always been 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.569
 with the best desire and with a great 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:01.879
 professionalism trying things 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:03.520
 were the best possible that has shown 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:05.889
 assured 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.319
 in which the internal state would be influenced 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.729
 of the club where the sunat is located 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:13.599
 or was not comfortable the staff has 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.659
 worked as it should work good at 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.360
 end any valuation of that type 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:22.090
 may sound like an excuse right now 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.169
 we have not been able to get the 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.150
 points that were at stake 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.759
 in the environment in which we were 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.340
 when I came on the fourth day 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:32.470
 we were last I already knew in what 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.240
 situation could find the club the 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.069
 difficulties that there were and what it cost me 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.530
 my work what it has cost me 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:40.960
 work I know what it cost me but 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.880
 it's some situations that were there 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.319
 that adapt to what there is and take 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.840
 match that is my performance and day of 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:51.460
 today the team has descended for that reason 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:53.050
 I feel today because it is very sad that it is the 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.000
 judge and now the amateur who is leaving 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.130
 home that he has wanted until the end in 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.350
 that it was possible to be saved and see that the 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.140
 team is in second 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:05.290
 and I do not know I do not have words to 

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.630
 explain what the thunder feels no no 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.810
 no no I'm not sorry 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:14.320
 I can not understand how people are 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:17.409
 hoping I applaud the team 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.739
 no no no no no i do not know what to tell you 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:24.759
 it should be noted that there is arias valuation 

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:27.129
 of a little of your work this year already what 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:30.869
 will you do 

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:30.869
 thanks until your
