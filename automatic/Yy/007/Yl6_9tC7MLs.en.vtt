00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
cool but not so much that it's going to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.859

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.990 
tend to lean a little bit cooler I do
think<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.039> is<00:02:09.129> going<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.369> be<00:02:09.459> flattering<00:02:09.819> on

think this is going to be flattering on

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.660 
think this is going to be flattering on
a<00:02:10.030> wide<00:02:10.420> variety<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:11.050> skin<00:02:11.620> tones<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.489> think

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
a wide variety of skin tones and I think

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.400 
a wide variety of skin tones and I think
it'd<00:02:12.760> be<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.879> great<00:02:13.150> gift<00:02:13.599> to<00:02:13.720> give<00:02:13.810> if<00:02:14.200> not

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
wish list this year there is a smaller

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.990 
wish list this year there is a smaller
palette<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.569> contains<00:02:20.140> 12<00:02:20.980> shadows<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:21.610> less

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
palette it contains 12 shadows so less

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.670 
palette it contains 12 shadows so less
than<00:02:22.030> half<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.720> number<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.230> shadows<00:02:23.530> in<00:02:23.560> this

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
than half the number of shadows in this

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.030 
than half the number of shadows in this
palette<00:02:24.099> but<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.400> retails<00:02:24.849> for<00:02:25.590> $36<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:26.860> if

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
palette but it retails for $36 so if

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.259 
palette but it retails for $36 so if
your<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:27.819> don't<00:02:28.030> think<00:02:28.180> they're

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
your and I don't think they're

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.910 
your and I don't think they're
completely<00:02:28.690> unique<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:29.200> haven't<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.739> don't

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
completely unique I haven't I don't

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.470 
completely unique I haven't I don't
actually<00:02:30.250> own<00:02:30.549> the<00:02:30.700> smaller<00:02:30.940> palette<00:02:31.299> but<00:02:31.420> if

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
actually own the smaller palette but if

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.360 
actually own the smaller palette but if
you<00:02:31.569> look<00:02:31.750> at<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.930> two<00:02:32.079> side-by-side<00:02:32.370> they're

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
you look at the two side-by-side they're

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.620 
you look at the two side-by-side they're
local<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.940> looks<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.239> there<00:02:34.420> are<00:02:34.480> some

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
local it looks like there are some

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.720 
local it looks like there are some
slight<00:02:34.989> variations<00:02:35.620> between<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:36.069> shades<00:02:36.370> but

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
slight variations between the shades but

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.789 
slight variations between the shades but
overall<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.660> color<00:02:37.900> palette<00:02:38.319> looks<00:02:38.470> very

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
overall the color palette looks very

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.670 
overall the color palette looks very
similar<00:02:39.220> like<00:02:39.579> you<00:02:39.700> could<00:02:39.880> do<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.269> very<00:02:40.780> very

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
similar like you could do a very very

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.430 
similar like you could do a very very
similar<00:02:42.010> looks<00:02:42.430> with<00:02:42.670> each<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:43.750> when

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
similar looks with each and so when

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.860 
similar looks with each and so when
picking<00:02:45.250> one<00:02:45.640> over<00:02:45.849> the<00:02:45.940> other<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.239> would<00:02:46.599> say

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
picking one over the other I would say

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.170 
picking one over the other I would say
splurge<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.190> get<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.519> larger<00:02:48.849> palette

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
splurge and get the larger palette

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.369 
splurge and get the larger palette
because<00:02:49.269> you're<00:02:49.510> going<00:02:49.629> to<00:02:49.690> get<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.049> much

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
because you're going to get that much

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.350 
because you're going to get that much
that<00:02:50.709> many<00:02:50.890> more<00:02:51.099> shadows<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.819> play<00:02:52.090> with

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
that many more shadows to play with

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.300 
that many more shadows to play with
whereas<00:02:53.079> you<00:02:53.319> get<00:02:53.500> less<00:02:53.829> than<00:02:54.040> half<00:02:54.160> the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
whereas you get less than half the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.199 
whereas you get less than half the
shadows<00:02:54.730> at<00:02:54.970> over<00:02:55.599> half<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.470> cost<00:02:56.769> so<00:02:57.519> that

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
shadows at over half the cost so that

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.670 
shadows at over half the cost so that
just<00:02:58.360> makes<00:02:58.480> most<00:02:58.660> sense<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.959> me<00:02:59.140> plus<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.590> an

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
just makes most sense to me plus is an

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.530 
just makes most sense to me plus is an
amazing<00:03:00.220> palette<00:03:00.430> definitely<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:00.970> grapevine

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540
