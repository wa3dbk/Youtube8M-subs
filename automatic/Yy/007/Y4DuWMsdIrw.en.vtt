00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.480
 hello welcome to a new video 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.760
 tutorial with google good in this 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.390
 I'll bring you a half gameplay 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.470
 half download of a game 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.750
 I've seen that video games of 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.180
 trucks that I climb are quite successful 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.669
 and many people ask me for new games 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.040
 change in your album here I bring you one 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.989
 I'm going to teach a little how it is for 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.589
 me in my opinion is the best game of 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.589
 roads there 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.940
 well let's create a new profile here 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.940
 and we selected it 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.000
 I personally like this is 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.000
 here 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.080
 let's give here to drive 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.270
 let's go here is the truck we have sight 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.060
 from all angles of the truck and here 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.220
 I'm going to make some changes 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.090
 in him 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.090
 to use it 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.930
 here it just puts a keyboard I'm going to put the 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.899
 keyboard mouse and here I'm going to configure 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.620
 the buttons so that it works like me 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.250
 like 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.790
 once we have this we are going to leave and 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.640
 We have here as we see the mouse 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.680
 move what are the controls 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.680
 and well let's go to the inside view 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:09.190
 and we are going to start the engine 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:12.510
 and let's go out but putting them 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.510
 the mirrors to see 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.350
 while we are if we want to change 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.650
 sight we can also do it 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.650
 as we see changes of no problem 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.939
 but good 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.760
 it's not very good because you can 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:36.109
 control with the mouse and there are a lot 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:39.400
 of places to go and many types of 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.400
 driving trucks 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.350
 as we see here there are all mountains there 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.460
 another that is more of being desert another of 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.480
 snow is very good 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.819
 and then I'll leave the Inca 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.680
 where you can download it and I'm going to 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.860
 leave on my blog in the new blog that I've 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.860
 fact 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.420
 I would like you to visit 6 For 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.069
 there I will go up a bit of everything 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.930
 upload reviews 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.549
 links to programs that have seemed to me 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.380
 interesting channel recommendations 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.850
 all a little bit I'm going to upload it there 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.850
 and I hope you visit more 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.460
 as we see the game is pretty good 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.280
 sorry oil jerks or a little bit of the 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.930
 because I'm with the laptop and I do not know why 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.230
 which ultimately sends a little bad this 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.230
 game 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.000
 I do not understand 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.700
 because he has an intel i7 and a card 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.129
 graphics of 2 gigas pretty good 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.129
 but it works pretty well 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.290
 then if you want, I will also expose the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.060
 my computer requirements 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.519
 so that you more or less know and if you can 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.209
 play yours because yes because no 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.209
 consumes a lot 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.530
 I just collided with the one in the back 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.540
 good here in one thing that we have said 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.479
 if we press the m button, the 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.220
 map and if we press the f1 button I think that 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.650
 is the full map appears where 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.200
 we have to go there appears the little circle 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.940
 that's where we have to go 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.940
 As I see, I'm going in a good way 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.060
 and good 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.670
 to follow 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.320
 I'm going to make the journey until I arrive 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.320
 that you see how it is more or less 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:48.099
 once you are going to levels like 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:50.439
 you have seen this truck is quite 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:53.349
 small once you see passing levels 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:55.119
 you are coupling trailers and power 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:57.009
 get to have up to five trailers in 

00:04:55.119 --> 00:05:00.339
 a truck and it's pretty fun 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:03.480
 handle those trailers because to do 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:06.560
 the curves you have to have enough 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.560
 pretty technical 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.699
 this game is fun 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.039
 I play the truth many times and it is 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.539
 the best truck game that 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.539
 found by internet 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.900
 as we see we the difficult to control 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.350
 because I just stepped on brake or anything 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.350
 Y 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:06.900
 and it goes well I do not leave or anything I do not 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.900
 collided with none of that comes in front 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.990
 and can even be overtaking without 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.990
 get out and touch you 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.320
 well let's go on the map we have 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.550
 on the right 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.550
 is there to the goal near 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:31.800
 good is always to complete missions type 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.800
 are you carrying a load a site 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.750
 not only that quite active that we brake 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.750
 a little bit we are not going to get 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:47.349
 we have to be working 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.620
 and as there is the little symbol where 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.350
 we have to make the delivery 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.210
 fernando fernando braking braking 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.229
 altogether 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.229
 and we are going to people 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.930
 here as he gives us the mission data 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.960
 what we have done and the points obtained 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.539
 in which we will continue 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.410
 let us another other type of truck 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:15.410
 different transmission 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:21.630
 as we see here unlocks a stop 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.880
 that is this 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.460
 we go to this drawer and here we see 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.560
 that we have two more missions with channels 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.660
 different and the tours as they look 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.310
 here on the map are also different 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.680
 Well, I'm going to leave you as I have 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:38.460
 said the link to my blog and on the blog 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:41.690
 will be the download of the game 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.690
 and I hope you liked it
