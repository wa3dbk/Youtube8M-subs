00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hi, those people who always have 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.089
 a reason to say that things do not 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.040
 they work out for her 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.010
 the merchant of the husband's chief of 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.500
 wife of the boyfriend's mother 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.690
 who and what surrounds it but 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.359
 it's never her fault 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.150
 Do you know people like that? I know them. 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.580
 Hills is that person who always dreams 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.640
 with things but never when 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.260
 someone criticizes her said ah does not understand 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.090
 do not understand my potential 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.070
 when people go there and do the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.020
 things she means she said 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.329
 ah but of course because I have a plan 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.120
 b transiting everyone pulling me but 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.570
 It was your son, who is the mother that I do not know? 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.090
 who has both this and support in that and the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.829
 person always finds an excuse for the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.250
 your business failure you are 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.870
 failed at the bottom of things 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.739
 They are bad for you. 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.870
 well done my friend you do not go after 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.879
 of things you keep complaining where 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.890
 You 're you, you 've never been anything but from there. 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.710
 You're always aiming for a place where 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.960
 you could be because you always get 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.880
 You think better than the situation of you 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.979
 It's my good situation that you're bad. 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.880
 it's probably because you too are 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.040
 bad 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.200
 play that occurred sometimes the person 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.810
 whether a promotion dreams of a position 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.360
 It's crazy to go somewhere but where 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.189
 this she does not deserve 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.700
 her a job and talking about the potential 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.350
 From her to another area she lives 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.829
 Excuses for not going beyond the obvious 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.390
 then the others around are promoted have 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.750
 your dreams come true 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.820
 and it is behind and clear the fate of the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.740
 azar in the shadow of the card janitor who 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.720
 he was not beaten but never made 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.729
 next you do not lose money you are in 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.439
 Mud failure can never be 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.570
 better than you think it is 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.570
 achieve a function that you think 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.570
 deserve maybe you do not deserve it 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.790
 when people are good it does not matter 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.159
 where they are whatever the function 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.619
 Where is the work, are they going to get along? 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.930
 if they do, they are moved by a 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.090
 something greater than the circumstances 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.500
 reached the bottom of the well and 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.270
 a prominent place 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.680
 people who do not care if you do not have 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.510
 formal education 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.510
 ideal family if you do not have a 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.319
 perfect companion they go there and do 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.680

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.060

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.579

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.450

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:35.370

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.260
 which is the recognition that you both 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.120
 would you like 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.989
 most people are on the same day 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.939
 they deserve 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.129
 is the effort made by the 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.319
 effort to stop doing what you 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.659
 is believer believe in god that things 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.659
 do not conspire around you and you will 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.549

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.650

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.930

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.069
 made the least effort in the part that 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.019
 I could not 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.819
 before changing to god than the universe 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.280
