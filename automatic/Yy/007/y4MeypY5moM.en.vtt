00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
works really well is you walk and you

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.479 
works really well is you walk and you
stop<00:02:06.929> and<00:02:07.929> you<00:02:07.960> walk<00:02:08.259> 50<00:02:08.739> yards<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.280> then<00:02:09.369> you

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
stop and you walk 50 yards and then you

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.490 
stop and you walk 50 yards and then you
stop<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:11.010> invariably<00:02:12.900> as<00:02:13.900> soon<00:02:14.110> as<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.290> take

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
stop and invariably as soon as you take

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.520 
stop and invariably as soon as you take
