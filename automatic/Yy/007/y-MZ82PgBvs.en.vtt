00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and as you can see the base of the Mana

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.819 
and as you can see the base of the Mana
Party<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.850> base<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> tripod<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.050> really

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
white so this is much more stabilized in

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.330

has another one which is not the same

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640 
has another one which is not the same
thing<00:02:27.090> as<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.510> vember<00:02:27.930> lavon's<00:02:28.230> member<00:02:28.530> the

thing as the vember lavon's member the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.979 
thing as the vember lavon's member the
ones<00:02:28.830> are<00:02:29.010> much<00:02:29.160> more<00:02:29.370> popular<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.030> there's

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
ones are much more popular and there's

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.900 
ones are much more popular and there's
one<00:02:31.170> thing<00:02:31.290> about<00:02:31.410> them<00:02:31.860> I'm<00:02:32.610> talking<00:02:32.760> about

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
one thing about them I'm talking about

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.030 
one thing about them I'm talking about
the<00:02:33.150> vim<00:02:33.330> burly<00:02:33.540> ones<00:02:33.750> they're<00:02:34.470> really

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
the vim burly ones they're really

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.930 
the vim burly ones they're really
expensive<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:36.600> have<00:02:37.230> seen<00:02:37.500> ones<00:02:37.790> starting<00:02:38.790> from

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
expensive I have seen ones starting from

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.320 
expensive I have seen ones starting from
five<00:02:39.270> hundred<00:02:39.300> dollars<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.819> this<00:02:41.819> costs

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
five hundred dollars and this costs

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.800 
five hundred dollars and this costs
around<00:02:43.099> 180<00:02:44.239> dollars<00:02:46.550> it's<00:02:47.550> like<00:02:47.790> one<00:02:48.660> third

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
around 180 dollars it's like one third

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.009 
around 180 dollars it's like one third
of<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.140> price<00:02:49.350> almost<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:51.810> does<00:02:51.989> a

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
of the price almost and it does a

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.720 
of the price almost and it does a
fantastic<00:02:52.319> job<00:02:52.799> because<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.489> has<00:02:53.700> a

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
fantastic job because it has a

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.610 
fantastic job because it has a
counterweight<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.319> can<00:02:55.470> actually

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
counterweight and you can actually

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.229 
counterweight and you can actually
adjust<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.970> friction<00:02:57.510> by<00:02:57.810> twisting<00:02:58.319> these

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
adjust the friction by twisting these

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.000 
adjust the friction by twisting these
you<00:03:00.239> can<00:03:00.450> arrange<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.959> friction<00:03:01.500> which<00:03:01.830> is

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
you can arrange the friction which is

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.250 
you can arrange the friction which is
actually<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.660> reaction<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.900> as<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.140> can

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
actually the reaction to it as you can

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.259 
actually the reaction to it as you can
see<00:03:04.319> it's<00:03:04.560> really<00:03:04.920> tight<00:03:05.340> right<00:03:05.610> now<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.850> cannot

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
see it's really tight right now I cannot

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.509 
see it's really tight right now I cannot
move<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.540> up<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.900> down

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
move it up and down

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.600 
move it up and down
it<00:03:09.239> also<00:03:09.480> has<00:03:09.810> locks<00:03:10.140> too<00:03:10.709> if<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.370> want<00:03:11.549> to

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
it also has locks too if you want to

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.309 
it also has locks too if you want to
make<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.910> totally<00:03:12.060> stable<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:12.810> photo<00:03:13.080> for

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
make it totally stable so photo for

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.380 
make it totally stable so photo for
photography<00:03:13.830> let's<00:03:14.430> say<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.700> want<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.180> take<00:03:15.360> a

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
photography let's say you want to take a

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.809 
photography let's say you want to take a
landscape<00:03:15.930> picture<00:03:16.290> there's<00:03:16.830> locks<00:03:17.220> in<00:03:17.459> here

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
landscape picture there's locks in here

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.370 
landscape picture there's locks in here
one<00:03:18.359> of<00:03:18.390> them<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:18.900> here

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
one of them is in here

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.460 
one of them is in here
and<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:20.670> other<00:03:20.850> one<00:03:21.120> is<00:03:21.829> right<00:03:22.829> in<00:03:23.070> here<00:03:24.470> so

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
and the other one is right in here so

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.620 
and the other one is right in here so
once<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.220> lock<00:03:26.430> once<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.180> lock<00:03:27.359> them<00:03:27.540> in

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
once you lock once you lock them in

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.699 
once you lock once you lock them in
place<00:03:27.690> you're<00:03:28.049> going<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.290> be<00:03:28.410> good<00:03:28.560> for

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
place you're going to be good for

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.960 
place you're going to be good for
photography<00:03:29.220> but<00:03:29.400> then<00:03:29.609> you're<00:03:29.730> doing

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
photography but then you're doing

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.180 
photography but then you're doing
videography<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.720> will<00:03:30.900> need<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.410> tilt<00:03:31.920> and

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
videography you will need to tilt and

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.599 
videography you will need to tilt and
pan<00:03:32.390> which<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:33.420> crucial<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.410> once<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.400> have

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
pan which is crucial and once you have

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.110 
pan which is crucial and once you have
heavy<00:03:36.150> gear<00:03:36.630> on<00:03:36.870> top<00:03:37.200> of<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.609> it<00:03:38.609> is<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.820> very

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
heavy gear on top of it it is a very

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.470 
heavy gear on top of it it is a very
welcome<00:03:39.540> addition<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.989> have<00:03:41.480> friction

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
welcome addition to have friction

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.530 
welcome addition to have friction
control<00:03:42.690> system<00:03:43.970> plus<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.239> has<00:03:45.480> a

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
control system plus it has a

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.840 
control system plus it has a
counterweight<00:03:46.079> which<00:03:46.620> is<00:03:46.769> around<00:03:47.100> I<00:03:47.370> think<00:03:47.609> 4

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
counterweight which is around I think 4

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.990 
counterweight which is around I think 4
and<00:03:47.940> 1/2<00:03:48.000> kgs<00:03:48.600> so<00:03:49.290> once<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.940> leave<00:03:50.940> a

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
and 1/2 kgs so once you leave a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.509 
and 1/2 kgs so once you leave a
telephoto<00:03:51.540> on<00:03:51.810> this<00:03:52.049> let's<00:03:52.709> say<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:52.950> forgot

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
telephoto on this let's say you forgot

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.500 
telephoto on this let's say you forgot
to<00:03:54.380> tighten<00:03:55.380> this<00:03:55.680> up<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.220> it's<00:03:56.489> all<00:03:56.730> loose

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
to tighten this up and it's all loose

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.630 
to tighten this up and it's all loose
for<00:03:58.260> example<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:58.620> forgot<00:03:58.950> it<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.370> left

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
for example you forgot it and you left

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.620 
for example you forgot it and you left
your<00:03:59.850> lens<00:04:00.090> your<00:04:00.720> lens<00:04:01.019> is<00:04:01.200> going<00:04:01.350> to<00:04:01.560> slowly

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
your lens your lens is going to slowly

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.080 
your lens your lens is going to slowly
go<00:04:03.630> down<00:04:04.160> so<00:04:05.160> this<00:04:05.370> is<00:04:05.430> going<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:06.620> protect<00:04:07.620> your

go down so this is going to protect your
expensive<00:04:09.090> lens<00:04:09.690> that's<00:04:10.290> why<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:11.310> counter

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
expensive lens that's why the counter

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.420 
expensive lens that's why the counter
balance<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.950> counterweight<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:15.450> know<00:04:16.430> video

with the friction control you can easily
pan<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:37.020> tilt<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:37.680> also<00:04:38.370> you<00:04:38.460> can<00:04:38.580> take<00:04:38.790> this

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
pan and tilt and also you can take this

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.370 
pan and tilt and also you can take this
thing<00:04:39.300> out<00:04:39.560> right<00:04:40.560> here<00:04:41.930> especially<00:04:42.930> when<00:04:43.230> you

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
thing out right here especially when you

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.530 
thing out right here especially when you
are<00:04:43.470> using<00:04:43.620> a<00:04:43.770> teller<00:04:44.010> lens<00:04:44.340> this<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.060> coming

ever buy a ball hat especially for
wildlife<00:05:41.940> photography<00:05:42.539> when<00:05:42.720> you<00:05:42.840> need<00:05:43.200> to

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
wildlife photography when you need to

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.670 
wildlife photography when you need to
use<00:05:43.530> telephoto<00:05:44.130> lenses<00:05:44.550> heavy<00:05:44.820> lenses

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
use telephoto lenses heavy lenses

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.150 
use telephoto lenses heavy lenses
because<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:47.580> ball<00:05:47.820> hat<00:05:48.060> is<00:05:48.210> going<00:05:48.450> to<00:05:48.660> wobble

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
because the ball hat is going to wobble

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.180 
because the ball hat is going to wobble
because<00:05:50.160> of<00:05:50.310> the<00:05:50.430> weight<00:05:50.580> of<00:05:50.729> the<00:05:50.850> lens<00:05:51.060> and

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
because of the weight of the lens and

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.150 
because of the weight of the lens and
since<00:05:53.900> this<00:05:54.900> doesn't<00:05:55.320> move<00:05:55.470> all<00:05:55.650> around<00:05:55.800> like

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
since this doesn't move all around like

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.480 
since this doesn't move all around like
a<00:05:56.220> ball<00:05:56.490> hat<00:05:56.930> it<00:05:57.930> just<00:05:58.229> moves<00:05:58.470> up<00:05:58.950> and<00:05:59.250> down<00:05:59.370> and

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
a ball hat it just moves up and down and

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.909 
a ball hat it just moves up and down and
to<00:05:59.880> the<00:06:00.000> sides<00:06:00.240> this<00:06:00.960> is<00:06:01.139> going<00:06:01.410> to<00:06:01.530> be<00:06:01.620> real

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
to the sides this is going to be real
