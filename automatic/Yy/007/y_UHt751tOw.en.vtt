sketchup<00:00:06.690> 7<00:00:07.849> so<00:00:10.160> when<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.250> get<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.670> can

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
sketchup 7 so when you get in you can

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.180 
sketchup 7 so when you get in you can
delete<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.210> person<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:15.199> get<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.830> set<00:00:17.160> up

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
delete this person and get this set up

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.900 
delete this person and get this set up
how<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.490> want<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:18.000> how<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:18.900> want<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.289> be

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.000 

ok<00:00:23.910> now<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.869> can<00:00:24.930> if<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.680> want<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.890> make<00:00:25.980> a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
ok now you can if you want to make a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.400 
ok now you can if you want to make a
cone<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.550> take<00:00:26.760> your<00:00:26.849> circle<00:00:27.240> tool<00:00:27.420> click

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
cone you can take your circle tool click

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.950 
cone you can take your circle tool click
once<00:00:28.650> drag<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.760> out<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> radius<00:00:30.510> and

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
once drag it out to the radius and

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.049 
once drag it out to the radius and
radius<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.439> half<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.800> diameter<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
radius is half of the diameter the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.340 
radius is half of the diameter the
diameter<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.660> all<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> way<00:00:34.050> across<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
diameter is all the way across the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
diameter is all the way across the
circle<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.469> for<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.559> radius<00:00:37.920> I'm<00:00:38.190> going<00:00:38.309> to

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
circle so for the radius I'm going to

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.729 
circle so for the radius I'm going to
make<00:00:38.489> my<00:00:38.670> radius<00:00:39.180> 5<00:00:39.390> feet<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.899> if<00:00:40.020> diameters<00:00:40.500> 10

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
make my radius 5 feet so if diameters 10

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.819 
make my radius 5 feet so if diameters 10
feet<00:00:41.300> then<00:00:42.300> I'm<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.230> want<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.500> take<00:00:43.710> my

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
feet then I'm going to want to take my

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.510 
feet then I'm going to want to take my
pencil<00:00:44.070> tool<00:00:45.829> draw<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.920> line<00:00:47.129> across<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
pencil tool draw a line across the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.069 
pencil tool draw a line across the
middle<00:00:50.239> middle<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.390> my<00:00:51.480> circle<00:00:53.719> like<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.899> so

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
middle middle of my circle like that so

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.979 
middle middle of my circle like that so
you<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.320> midpoint<00:00:55.559> too<00:00:56.750> now<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.930> a

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
you have a midpoint too now you have a

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.139 
you have a midpoint too now you have a
midpoint<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.559> draw<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:59.010> line<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.940> goes<00:00:59.969> up

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
midpoint to draw your line that goes up

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.990 
midpoint to draw your line that goes up
so<00:01:00.780> take<00:01:00.960> your<00:01:01.050> pencil<00:01:01.230> tool<00:01:01.500> again<00:01:01.850> draw<00:01:02.850> up

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
so take your pencil tool again draw up

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.420 
so take your pencil tool again draw up
the<00:01:03.120> blue<00:01:03.300> axis<00:01:03.719> help<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> blacks<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.159> as<00:01:05.280> high

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
the blue axis help the blacks is as high

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.330 
the blue axis help the blacks is as high
as<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.610> want<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:07.040> I'll<00:01:08.040> make<00:01:08.130> mine

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
as you want it to be and I'll make mine

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.020 
as you want it to be and I'll make mine
