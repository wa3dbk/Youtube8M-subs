00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.660
 and now in this video we will install the 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.990
 rom blue room or broke as they want 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.490
 tell a living rom only 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.740
 that is modified has an aspect 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.990
 pretty good and besides that is 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.339
 pretty fluid good if you want 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:28.820
 install breaks to stay watching the 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:31.310
 good video the requirements for this rom 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.710
 are the same as always comments gts of 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.629
 some custom recovery and then in this 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.550
 case we are going to use carli whose link is 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.289
 the description as well as the war 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.989
 mode if they prefer to use that 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:44.510
 although I recommend more karl and here 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.090
 let's get our recovery as a 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:52.150
 do the corresponding whites 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.150
 in this case factory reset english 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.750
 and now we 're going to web cache 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.880
 after the last one that is web given my 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.580
 home 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.920
 and then the next thing that would be is 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.140
 just install development in this 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.910
 case let's give it in install here in the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.750
 first option that says joe shipp from 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.280
 indicate also how I do not have a card 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.890
 I will do it from memory 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.600
 internal if you have sd card what 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.110
 they will put in the first one if not what 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.480
 they have here where it says internet sd 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.310
 in my case it will be this and we look for the 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.940
 corresponding rom in this case is the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.840
 rom could and well we are going to install the 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.580
 we see that it does not have a installer 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.729
 aroma has a simple normal installer 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.370
 like any sip in this case you have to 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.140
 wait for it not to install 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.030
 good when finished installing us 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.730
 will thank you that we have installed 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.400
 this rom the following would be you can 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.340
 make a program and obviously 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.770
 start our phone remember the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.360
 first start is the longest so it is 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.960
 Do not worry if you have not started 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.370
 then fast is normal in this case it's going to 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.710
 jump this animation boot I want to 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:10.440
 corresponding to the rome is a rom 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.440
 a rom a bitch animation well 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.280
 and well then the usual in a rom or in 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.930
 a system already installed again as 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.600
 will welcome us which I have 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.240
 skipped since it's pretty tedious to be 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.460
 seeing this so it is that it has already been 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.890
 this the installation of this rom like 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.740
 I said it's a pretty good rom because it's 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.290
 very fluid is also one of those that I 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.540
 I really liked the only thing that did not 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.790
 liked it was that the icons are very 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.410
 small I think the density of 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.200
 I do not remember what it was like, it was something like that with 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.989
 Screen density is very small 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.709
 for a 4-inch screen and how 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.910
 that does not feel very good because it 's the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.650
 only drawback I've had with 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.720
 that rom from here to there is a rom 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.860
 pretty good so if you want more 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.600
 break this device 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.350
 subscribe to this channel that I say goodbye 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.920
