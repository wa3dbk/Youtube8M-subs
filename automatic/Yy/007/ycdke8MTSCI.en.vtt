00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
can be all used up if we use too much

minutes<00:00:53.430> don't<00:00:53.940> forget<00:00:54.329> turn<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.230> light<00:00:55.440> off

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
minutes don't forget turn the light off

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.340 
minutes don't forget turn the light off
and<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> sunny<00:00:56.789> day<00:00:56.879> why<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:57.629> open<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and on a sunny day why not open the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.740 
and on a sunny day why not open the
curtains<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.399> use<00:00:59.670> natural<00:01:00.239> light<00:01:00.449> it's

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
curtains and just use natural light it's

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.399 
curtains and just use natural light it's
simple<00:01:01.699> take<00:01:02.699> out<00:01:02.940> incandescent<00:01:03.449> lightbulbs

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
simple take out incandescent lightbulbs

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.800 
simple take out incandescent lightbulbs
and<00:01:04.650> switch<00:01:05.010> them<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.400> compact<00:01:05.909> fluorescent

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
and switch them to compact fluorescent

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.609 
and switch them to compact fluorescent
bulbs<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:07.830> use<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> lot<00:01:08.580> less<00:01:08.939> energy<00:01:09.619> just

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
bulbs these use a lot less energy just

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.070 
bulbs these use a lot less energy just
turn<00:01:11.010> off<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.369> TV<00:01:11.580> when<00:01:12.000> you're<00:01:12.299> not<00:01:12.540> watching

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
turn off the TV when you're not watching

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.800 
turn off the TV when you're not watching
it<00:01:13.200> turn<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.100> heating<00:01:14.340> down<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.479> cold

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
it turn the heating down if it's cold

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.649 
it turn the heating down if it's cold
wear<00:01:16.200> more<00:01:16.439> clothes<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.250> when<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.880> hot<00:01:17.970> try

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
wear more clothes and when it's hot try

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.109 
wear more clothes and when it's hot try
using<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.140> fan<00:01:19.409> when<00:01:20.040> you're<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.369> using<00:01:20.729> them

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
using a fan when you're not using them

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.899 
using a fan when you're not using them
why<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.960> unplug<00:01:22.500> some<00:01:22.799> machines<00:01:23.250> like

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
why not unplug some machines like

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.170 
why not unplug some machines like
computers<00:01:24.290> TVs<00:01:25.290> radios<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.280> video<00:01:26.850> game
