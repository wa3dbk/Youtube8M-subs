you<00:00:15.210> realize<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:15.570> how<00:00:15.719> bright<00:00:16.049> they

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
you realize just how bright they

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.810 
you realize just how bright they
actually<00:00:16.500> are<00:00:16.650> when<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.250> was<00:00:17.369> testing<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.730> out

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
actually are when I was testing it out

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.240 
actually are when I was testing it out
last<00:00:18.119> night<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.840> really<00:00:19.590> video<00:00:19.859> I'll<00:00:20.010> see<00:00:20.160> how

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
last night I really video I'll see how

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
video the last night and the garage with

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.550 
video the last night and the garage with
just<00:00:26.849> those<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.180> us<00:00:27.330> quite<00:00:27.599> quite<00:00:28.050> able<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.349> see

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
just those on us quite quite able to see

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.160 
just those on us quite quite able to see
everything<00:00:29.160> around<00:00:29.310> me<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.670> quite<00:00:29.910> amazing

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
everything around me is quite amazing

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.080 
everything around me is quite amazing
and<00:00:31.170> then<00:00:31.380> draw<00:00:31.679> like<00:00:31.949> sort<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.460> know<00:00:32.489> Two

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
and then draw like sort of you know Two

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.370 
and then draw like sort of you know Two
and<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.270> Half<00:00:33.300> watts<00:00:33.690> or<00:00:33.899> something<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.320> that

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and a Half watts or something like that

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.840 
and a Half watts or something like that
so<00:00:34.910> yeah<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.059> great<00:00:37.160> and<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.460> rigged<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.760> a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
so yeah it's great and I rigged up a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.420 
so yeah it's great and I rigged up a
little<00:00:39.059> switch<00:00:39.950> for<00:00:40.950> them<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:42.020> so<00:00:43.020> I'm<00:00:43.430> on

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
little switch for them here so I'm on

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.619 
little switch for them here so I'm on
and<00:00:44.610> off<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:46.160> that's<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.760> power<00:00:48.000> comes<00:00:48.329> to

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and off and that's the power comes to

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.369 
and off and that's the power comes to
this<00:00:48.829> from<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:51.360> headlight<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.930> don't<00:00:52.170> want<00:00:52.320> to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
this from the headlight I don't want to

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.319 
this from the headlight I don't want to
actually<00:00:52.469> attack<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.890> wiring<00:00:53.430> underneath

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
actually attack the wiring underneath

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.670 
actually attack the wiring underneath
the<00:00:54.539> tank<00:00:54.780> because<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.199> looks<00:00:55.350> pretty<00:00:55.469> archaic

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the tank because it looks pretty archaic

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.630 
the tank because it looks pretty archaic
and<00:00:56.329> pretty<00:00:57.329> difficult<00:00:57.989> as<00:00:58.410> well<00:00:58.620> that's<00:00:59.219> I

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and pretty difficult as well that's I

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.520 
and pretty difficult as well that's I
couldn't<00:01:00.059> figure<00:01:00.210> any<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.570> out<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.440> just

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
couldn't figure any of it out so I just

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.670 
couldn't figure any of it out so I just
connected<00:01:02.340> my<00:01:02.809> positive<00:01:03.809> power<00:01:04.110> wire<00:01:04.409> for

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
connected my positive power wire for

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.429 
connected my positive power wire for
these<00:01:04.799> little<00:01:05.100> lights<00:01:05.600> enter<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> pilot<00:01:07.290> lamp

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
these little lights enter the pilot lamp

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.740 
these little lights enter the pilot lamp
and<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> headlight<00:01:09.060> hear<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.600> pilot

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and in the headlight hear the pilot

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.840 
and in the headlight hear the pilot
lamps<00:01:10.110> positive<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.619> well<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.520> wherever<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
lamps positive as well so wherever the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.570 
lamps positive as well so wherever the
pilot<00:01:12.630> lights<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.990> these<00:01:13.439> lights<00:01:13.680> will<00:01:13.770> go<00:01:13.950> but

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
pilot lights on these lights will go but

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.429 
pilot lights on these lights will go but
in<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.760> key<00:01:14.909> off<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.420> goes<00:01:15.630> off<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.200> does<00:01:16.320> my

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
in the key off this goes off so does my

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.179 
in the key off this goes off so does my
lights<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:18.080> for<00:01:19.080> safety<00:01:19.439> six<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.830> forget

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
lights so just for safety six I forget

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.420 
lights so just for safety six I forget
then<00:01:20.549> leave<00:01:20.759> things<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.060> all<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> time<00:01:22.430> so

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
then leave things on all the time so

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.570 
then leave things on all the time so
that's<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.729> switch<00:01:24.030> for<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:25.549> wares<00:01:26.549> to

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
that's the switch for the wares to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.510 
that's the switch for the wares to
switch<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.210> LED<00:01:27.990> lights<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.350> front

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
switch for the LED lights on the front

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.920 
switch for the LED lights on the front
this<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> power<00:01:29.970> switch<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.659> that

to<00:01:50.250> sort<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.460> drain<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> battery

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
to sort of drain the battery

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.819 
to sort of drain the battery
accidentally<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.259> when<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.409> switched<00:01:52.649> at

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
accidentally because when I switched at

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.660 
accidentally because when I switched at
all<00:01:52.950> mr.<00:01:53.220> transform<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:53.820> under<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.240> and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
all mr. transform or under here and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.639 
all mr. transform or under here and
which<00:01:56.670> converts<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:57.630> 4.5<00:01:58.020> volts<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.500> good

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
which converts so it's 4.5 volts a good

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.270 
which converts so it's 4.5 volts a good
