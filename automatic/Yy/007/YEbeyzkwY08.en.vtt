 suicidal is amazing and apart it gives us 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.170
 a lot of information about the movie 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.609
 to get started 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.430
 we discovered that these characters are 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.890
 imprisoned in belvis and that amanda 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.380
 waller controls them to save the world 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 then the accompanying background music 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.579
 to all the trailer or visual material 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.649
 that they presented to us is from the vikings 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.079
 that is called to be of joe I started 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.899
 a joke that is a child or a mister 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.239
 for the joker that we see briefly in 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.070
 this material torturing someone who 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.899
 we do not know margot robbie is 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.760
 sensational as harley quinn we can 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.489
 see in your cell that is very much like 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.559
 Anibal hanging from the ceiling very stylish yes 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.859
 we were watching a show of a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.989
 circus and I loved that feeling that we 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.780
 left aside that character is very sweet and 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.979
 at the same time he is very very crazy 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.570
 we see how he interacts with others 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.450
 characters as ordered 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.820
 the boomerang captain we also got to 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.590
 see will smith in fact rappelling 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.910
 in a building and commanding the group 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.770
 while facing a group of 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.660
 soldiers that way we see all the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.520
 characters of suites 4 in this material 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.260
 visual for me the best in the scene 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.030
 where batman comes out on the surface of the 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.520
 Joker's carriage while Harley Quinn 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.070
 for driving and he tells the joker 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.070
 I hope you have insurance and the grand finale 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.670
 del teaser shows us jared leto as 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.259
 the joke saying I'm not going to kill them 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.909
 I'm just going to hurt them a lot 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.700
 much 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.049
 well I do not remember if it would be like that but 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.119
 for dramatic effect of what we are 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.649
 doing but that was pretty good with 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.270
 this ended the video actually this 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.979
 panel was quite brief simply 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.299
 they were there to present this 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.890
 visual material but we will be very 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.250
 Pending is for when the study 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.079
 I launched it to do a broader analysis of 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.240
 the things that we observed in the 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.579
 very poor quality versions that go 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.349
 circulating on the web subscribe you 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.560
 property to keep you informed of what 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.640
 most outstanding of the comedian in 2015 and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.349

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.150

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.470

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.000
 this and all that is necessary is that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.000
 we know each other so you decide 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.280
 or big 8 ball I ask you for third 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.550
 if we are going to be able to see a movie 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.340
 where batman dengue the death of robin and 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.849
 I killed the joker 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.849
 and the response of the big 8 ball 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.390
 I can not predict now 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.400
 the 8 ball is never wrong 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.750
 if possible, not for me 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.750
 no no
