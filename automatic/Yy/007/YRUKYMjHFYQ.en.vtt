00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
of the beauties of the job is how

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.620 
of the beauties of the job is how
different<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.489> be<00:00:32.640> from<00:00:32.850> day<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> day<00:00:33.210> the

zero<00:00:43.800> level<00:00:44.129> maths<00:00:44.309> was<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> ratio<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
zero level maths was a ratio and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.900 
zero level maths was a ratio and
proportion<00:00:45.620> they've<00:00:46.620> done<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> past<00:00:47.039> but

what these are now about is

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200 
what these are now about is
problem-solving<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.579> we've<00:00:50.700> got<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> recipe

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
problem-solving so we've got a recipe

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.600 
problem-solving so we've got a recipe
for<00:00:51.480> example<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.079> where<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.039> four<00:00:53.190> four<00:00:53.370> in

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
for example here where it's four four in

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.670 
for example here where it's four four in
plum<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.239> then<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> question<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.350> asking

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
plum and then the question is asking

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
plum and then the question is asking
them<00:00:55.800> how<00:00:56.010> much<00:00:56.190> would<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.370> need<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:56.610> 10<00:00:56.879> and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
them how much would you need for 10 and

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.869 
them how much would you need for 10 and
sometimes<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.960> need<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.170> do<00:00:58.260> these<00:00:58.379> anyway

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
sometimes you need to do these anyway

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.920 
sometimes you need to do these anyway
you<00:00:59.879> don't<00:01:00.030> have<00:01:00.180> your<00:01:00.270> calculator<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.809> your

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930

pocket I always loved math I did a math

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.080 
pocket I always loved math I did a math
degree<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.100> was<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.460> something<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.909> had

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090

at the Institute in London and I've
absolutely<00:01:12.900> loved<00:01:13.530> every<00:01:13.830> minute<00:01:14.100> since<00:01:14.280> I

absolutely loved every minute since I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.940 
absolutely loved every minute since I
think<00:01:15.780> maths<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.380> those<00:01:16.470> subjects

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
think maths is one of those subjects

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.830 
think maths is one of those subjects
where<00:01:17.100> lots<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.430> fear<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.880> they<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.479> lack

of confidence I'm talking about the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.700 
of confidence I'm talking about the
students<00:01:20.850> who<00:01:21.000> often<00:01:21.570> saves<00:01:21.960> me<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.140> can't<00:01:22.500> do

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
students who often saves me I can't do

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.340 
students who often saves me I can't do
maths<00:01:23.040> I'm<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:24.150> know<00:01:24.270> I'm<00:01:24.600> rubbish<00:01:24.990> at<00:01:25.140> maths

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
maths I'm you know I'm rubbish at maths

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.560 
maths I'm you know I'm rubbish at maths
and<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:26.159> changing<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.140> perspective<00:01:29.570> it's

a year nine booster maths class and the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.370 
a year nine booster maths class and the
idea<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.270> class<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.720> they<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.960> extra

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
idea of this class is they have extra

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.710 
idea of this class is they have extra
lessons<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.890> top<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.369> their<00:01:35.820> normal<00:01:36.060> massacres

the school that means she qualified or
she<00:03:06.780> did<00:03:06.900> one<00:03:07.079> year<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.319> teaching<00:03:07.470> last<00:03:07.859> year

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
she did one year of teaching last year

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.400 
she did one year of teaching last year
and<00:03:08.430> now<00:03:08.940> she's<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.239> newly<00:03:09.660> qualified<00:03:09.810> teacher

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
and now she's a newly qualified teacher

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.259 
and now she's a newly qualified teacher
which<00:03:10.769> means<00:03:11.010> she<00:03:11.160> has<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.579> meet<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.090> certain

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
which means she has to meet the certain

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.150 
which means she has to meet the certain

standards by the end of this academic

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.479 
standards by the end of this academic
year<00:03:14.549> so<00:03:14.970> every<00:03:15.630> term<00:03:15.870> we<00:03:16.260> review<00:03:16.709> targets<00:03:17.220> and

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
year so every term we review targets and

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.629 
year so every term we review targets and
it<00:03:17.579> or<00:03:17.730> review<00:03:18.239> progress<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:19.200> agree<00:03:19.859> targets

is<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.180> easier<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:21.780> work<00:03:21.930> with<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.079> really<00:03:22.500> long

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
is it easier to work with a really long

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.229 
is it easier to work with a really long
piece<00:03:22.920> of<00:03:22.950> string<00:03:23.340> or<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.519> really<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:24.209> know

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
piece of string or a really you know

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.160 
piece of string or a really you know
much<00:03:24.450> smaller<00:03:24.810> one

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.319 
much smaller one
it's<00:03:25.410> year<00:03:25.650> eight<00:03:25.829> top<00:03:26.100> set<00:03:26.340> maths<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:27.120> what

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
it's year eight top set maths and what

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.720 
it's year eight top set maths and what
we're<00:03:27.480> exploring<00:03:27.720> today<00:03:28.079> is<00:03:28.560> loci<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.579> what

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
we're exploring today is loci so what

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.319 
we're exploring today is loci so what
shapes<00:03:30.060> are<00:03:30.359> produced<00:03:30.720> we<00:03:31.680> have<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:31.950> rule<00:03:32.730> now

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
shapes are produced we have to rule now

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.090 
shapes are produced we have to rule now
again<00:03:33.989> this<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.380> something<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.769> they<00:03:34.950> need

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
again this is something that they need

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.280 
again this is something that they need
to<00:03:35.130> experience<00:03:35.639> for<00:03:36.030> themselves<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:37.079> that's

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
to experience for themselves so that's

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
to experience for themselves so that's
why<00:03:37.440> I've<00:03:37.530> got<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.709> mouse<00:03:37.889> here<00:03:38.100> at<00:03:38.220> the

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
why I've got the mouse here at the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.050 
why I've got the mouse here at the
moment<00:03:38.760> making<00:03:39.150> decisions

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
the day now it's a after a full teaching

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.470 
the day now it's a after a full teaching
day<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.340> know<00:03:56.670> there<00:03:56.819> is<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> moment<00:03:57.300> where<00:03:57.390> you

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
day you know there is a moment where you

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.020 
day you know there is a moment where you
go<00:03:57.599> that's<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.739> gone<00:03:59.010> time<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.819> start

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
go that's it gone time to start

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.610 
go that's it gone time to start
preparing<00:04:00.150> for<00:04:00.569> tomorrow<00:04:00.989> another<00:04:01.349> full

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
preparing for tomorrow another full

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.750 
preparing for tomorrow another full
teaching<00:04:02.069> day<00:04:03.650> reflecting<00:04:04.650> now<00:04:04.860> on<00:04:05.160> how<00:04:05.580> those

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
teaching day reflecting now on how those

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.820 
teaching day reflecting now on how those
lessons<00:04:06.150> went<00:04:06.390> what<00:04:06.930> would<00:04:07.050> I<00:04:07.140> do<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.500> improve

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
lessons went what would I do to improve

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.280 
lessons went what would I do to improve
next<00:04:08.130> time<00:04:08.310> which<00:04:09.000> students<00:04:09.690> did<00:04:09.900> get<00:04:10.110> it

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
next time which students did get it

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.229 
next time which students did get it
didn't<00:04:10.560> get<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.950> could<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:11.580> do<00:04:11.640> it<00:04:11.910> better<00:04:12.060> next

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
didn't get it could I do it better next

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.360 
didn't get it could I do it better next
time<00:04:12.660> so<00:04:13.019> it's<00:04:13.200> always<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.590> reflective<00:04:14.190> process

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
time so it's always a reflective process

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.019 
time so it's always a reflective process
always<00:04:14.880> trying<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.540> improve
