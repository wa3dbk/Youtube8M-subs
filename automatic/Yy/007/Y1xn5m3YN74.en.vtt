00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.870
 hello, I'm a school teacher helder 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.670
 absurd professor of physics and today we 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.450
 Let's learn how to make the camera dark. 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:23.369
 to make the camera dark is we will have 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:28.170
 use scissors a ruler one 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:32.789
 fighting some kind of tape one 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.329
 paper shoe box or a 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:38.879
 silk sheet and paperboard 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.800
 The first step you need is your 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.690
 shoe box 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.530
 You'll remove the lens you 're going to take. 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.789
 the lens breaking the air here to 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.010
 break and ciara 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.870
 you can pick up a pair of scissors 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.379
 or even make with the hand 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.820
 you will break so that you alone 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:06.640
 stay with the lens so I'm going to break it 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.470
 It's a very easy break. 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.050
 lens and with water 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.810
 The size of the lens depends on the 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.150
 your box if it 's a very large box 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.869
 you can use a large lens like 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.840
 That 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.000
 this is a little bit smaller box with 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.990
 This group walks here, we can use 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.540
 a lens also not that big 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.420
 to mount the dark camera you go 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.610
 put the lens on one side and the other 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.220
 you will have a future where the 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.640
 image will be designed to make a 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.270
 lens bore first thing you catch 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.460
 brand lens 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.070
 on the box with a pen an artist 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.039
 will only cause the circumference of the 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.710
 mind is set that the conference was 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.289
 mind just to have a pattern there to 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.789
 people to make a hole a thing 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:06.700
 important is you determine which is the 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.880
 height that the lens will penetrate your 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.350
 home is very simple just you pick up 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:19.329
 source of light and moving the 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.400
 until the light source appears there. 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.610
 with a well defined image 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.180
 so this is more or less how far is 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.680
 that the lens will stay in the house 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.680
 I'm going to make an approximate measure. 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.709
 now I already know the equivalent size 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.350
 Can you stay here in the box loaned the 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.070
 paste the lens straight on the kaka 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.920
 I'm going to make a straw, I'm going to cut it 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:52.299
 here a straw of about 3 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.420
 centimeters to wrap the lens going 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:58.310
 stay a tub that I can climb 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.610
 and get off at the house 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.550
 I already have my club here and that's it 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.459
 What I'm going to need to learn this 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.950
 lens inside the tube you can do 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:18.360
 both on the bright side and the side 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:22.200
 Matte your shift will be like this 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.880
 the lens one end and the other 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.620
 end of the free pipe is now the 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.090
 last step practically our camera 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.730
 It's ready 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:40.590
 we'll cut where we made the 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:43.290
 brand we already made it got a 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.370
 face of machine in machine 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.630
 photographic 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:04:01.110
 now on the other side know on the reality is 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:04:04.769
 in front I'm going to cut another side of a 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.739
 side you have the lens and the other side 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.380
 You got a hole so we made the 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:18.380
 image designed here in the background the people 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:21.359
 will need to put on a paper that is 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.510
 transparent how to cut it here you 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.880
 can cut with an excess not 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.740
 need to have no concern there 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:36.979
 paper size will glue this paper 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.979
 vegetable here in the back of the house 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:46.660
 and then you put only the camera lens 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:50.440
 dark is ready and this camera dark 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:55.210
 She's going to give an image of what's out there. 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:58.360
 Why this happens is the light that comes 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.760
 by the front of the camera she 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.250
 spreads straight to your camera 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.620
 It is cuter you can play pa 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.100
 this is our dark camera with 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.100
 milk
