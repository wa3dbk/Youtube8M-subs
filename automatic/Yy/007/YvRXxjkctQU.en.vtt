00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.810
 you're fine thank you good when you 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.460
 you feel physically for this ideal of 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:16.760
 wrestling 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:18.950
 excited to be part of the first world 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.560
 and waiting for 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.800
 this event is a success so that it 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.960
 can continue this presenting a channel 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.570
 because it means to dispute this world 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.040
 be one of the top stars that go 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:40.920
 to represent Mexico is an honor to be able to 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.920
 represent that Sunday in power 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.470
 once I can represent mexico in 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.470
 all the countries that presented me 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.520
 I personally have a buyer 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.120
 Mexican wrestling if it's the best 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.350
 of the world in my heart feed and I know 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.350
 that many people think the same 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.280
 unfortunately we do not have 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.039
 we have rivals that we do not think 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.590
 excited for this world but like 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:20.280
 we know that you experienced a difficult time 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.709
 when the elephant roballo accounts how 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.259
 it was that process of assimilating it up to 

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:27.590
 be able to return to the ring to delight the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.590
 fans 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:35.550
 It has been a process because it has not yet 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.200
 I think a moment will come where 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:43.119
 where can I continue my normal life 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.119
 they have a movie they hit me there 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.119
 he reflected 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.310
 I see photos of your name 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.130
 and everything that comes to me normally comes 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.470
 happens that night 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.060
 firefighter 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.060
 what has given me a lot of strength 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.230
 starting with the words of encouragement from 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.230
 the family 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.480
 the mother of the sisters to guide me 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.870
 to be able to move forward 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.189
 my career that I could 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.200
 basically it was like a blessing of 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:30.510
 god so that I would go ahead so that 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.000
 not let this 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.680
 to do what it has cost me 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.290
 work 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.290
 this and I would like to understand from what 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.130
 unfortunately it was an accident 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.200
 it could have happened to anyone as 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.020
 you lived that night inside 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.220
 of the rhythm we are pointing the things that 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.930
 you thought 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.550
 everything happened so fast there was no there was no 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.200
 time of 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.200
 to reflect all 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.550
 all step 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.049
 as I think I should have 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.620
 happened or be with respect to the 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.230
 medical attention to this try to do 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.500
 that Peter will react to finish the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.920
 immediately fight this to take it to 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.319
 hospital immediately all within the 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.740
 ring became eternal after seeing it 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:33.700
 on video everything happened very fast then 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:38.430
 but it is difficult to try to dodge the 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.430
 destination when you have it already marked 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.330
 and then unfortunately we ask for one 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.910
 to one of the greats within this 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.090
 sport that will miss you 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.070
 immensely good some message that 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.370
 you want to give the fans that already 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.990
 They are eager to see the palace as 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.840
 I just want to thank you for 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:06.700
 So much support during 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:09.489

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.400

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.470

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.660
 wrestling for the first time presents 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.230
 in weather 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.150
 and let's wait now what 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.510
 take us victory that night of 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.270
 toast that would be my thesis Alberto del 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.060
 pattern a mystery server and power 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.330
 lift that introduction all the way up to 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.909
 support 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.159
 the saying that has always been known that 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.060
 Mexican wrestling is the best 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.010
 world 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.290
 and if that victory happens that way 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.889
 night of that victory now dedicated 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.889

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.139
