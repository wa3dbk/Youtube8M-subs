this<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.900> Robert<00:00:01.230> Taylor<00:00:01.260> of<00:00:01.770> Taylor<00:00:02.040> pump

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
this is Robert Taylor of Taylor pump

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.130 
this is Robert Taylor of Taylor pump
awell<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:02.879> these<00:00:03.090> are<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.419> parts<00:00:03.659> of<00:00:03.929> the

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
awell and these are the parts of the

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.070 
awell and these are the parts of the
normal<00:00:04.500> well<00:00:04.710> system<00:00:05.120> this<00:00:06.120> here<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.660> the

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
normal well system this here is the

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.129 
normal well system this here is the
control<00:00:07.379> box<00:00:07.710> it<00:00:08.010> makes<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.730> pump<00:00:09.510> start<00:00:09.900> and

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
control box it makes the pump start and

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.190 
control box it makes the pump start and
run<00:00:10.849> the<00:00:11.849> water<00:00:12.090> comes<00:00:12.389> up<00:00:12.599> goes<00:00:12.929> through<00:00:13.170> a

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
run the water comes up goes through a

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.770 
run the water comes up goes through a
check<00:00:13.530> valve<00:00:13.559> at<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.160> bottom<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.299> right

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
check valve at the bottom of the right

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.040 
check valve at the bottom of the right
here<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.220> pressure<00:00:17.520> switch<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.180> then

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
here this is a pressure switch and then

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.290 
here this is a pressure switch and then
the<00:00:19.080> water<00:00:19.320> comes<00:00:19.590> into<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.310> tank

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
the water comes into the tank

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.040 
the water comes into the tank
thus<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.560> tank<00:00:22.920> here<00:00:23.160> has<00:00:23.519> air<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> top<00:00:24.330> to

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
thus the tank here has air on the top to

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.439 
thus the tank here has air on the top to
create<00:00:25.230> pressure<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.760> has<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
create pressure and then it has the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.140 
create pressure and then it has the
water<00:00:27.630> at<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> bottom<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.650> pumps<00:00:29.609> up<00:00:29.910> it

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
water at the bottom as it pumps up it

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.659 
water at the bottom as it pumps up it
builds<00:00:30.599> up<00:00:30.779> pressure<00:00:30.810> when<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.859> gets<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.250> sixty

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
builds up pressure when it gets to sixty

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.229 
builds up pressure when it gets to sixty
pounds

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
pounds

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.280 
pounds
the<00:00:33.989> switch<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:35.300> satisfied<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.809> turns<00:00:37.050> it

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
the switch is satisfied and it turns it

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.660 
the switch is satisfied and it turns it
turns<00:00:37.800> off<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.040> pump

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
turns off the pump

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.119 
turns off the pump
then<00:00:39.120> when<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.480> gets<00:00:39.540> down<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> 40<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.860> switch

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
then when it gets down to 40 the switch

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.060 
then when it gets down to 40 the switch
starts<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.700> again<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.649> continues<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.829> pump

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
starts it again and continues to pump

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.529 
starts it again and continues to pump
until<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:45.030> tank<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.570> pressurized<00:00:46.289> again

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.330 

inside<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.690> pressure<00:00:51.870> switch<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.860> bunch<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
inside the pressure switch is a bunch of

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.510 
inside the pressure switch is a bunch of
wires<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:54.300> 230<00:00:54.989> volts<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:56.129> unless<00:00:56.370> you

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
wires and it's 230 volts so unless you

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.430 
wires and it's 230 volts so unless you
really<00:00:56.730> know<00:00:57.000> what<00:00:57.030> you're<00:00:57.270> doing<00:00:57.629> don't<00:00:58.050> open

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
really know what you're doing don't open

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.990 
really know what you're doing don't open
it

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.970 
it
alright<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.379> said<00:01:01.440> that's<00:01:01.739> what

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
alright and like I said that's what

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.340 
alright and like I said that's what
gives<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> power<00:01:02.640> after<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.719> says<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.229> get

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
gives it the power after it says to get

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.820 
gives it the power after it says to get
the<00:01:04.559> power<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:06.420> sends<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> control<00:01:07.590> box

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the power it sends it to the control box

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.270 
the power it sends it to the control box
and<00:01:08.810> then<00:01:09.810> oh<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.500> one's<00:01:10.710> dirty<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.159> got

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and then oh this one's dirty we got

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.539 
and then oh this one's dirty we got
clean<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.220> wires

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
clean this is in this one the the wires

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.640 
clean this is in this one the the wires
hooked<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.420> then<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> wires<00:01:16.110> go<00:01:16.409> down

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
hooked to it and then the wires go down

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.700 
hooked to it and then the wires go down
into<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.270> well<00:01:18.450> through<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.110> pipe<00:01:19.409> right

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
into the well through that pipe right

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.940 
into the well through that pipe right
there<00:01:21.049> I'll<00:01:22.049> leave<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.350> off<00:01:22.619> because<00:01:22.740> we're

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
there I'll leave that off because we're

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.370 
there I'll leave that off because we're
going<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> clean<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.420> said<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:25.140> is

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
going to clean that like I said this is

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.070 
going to clean that like I said this is
your<00:01:25.500> pressure<00:01:25.860> tank<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.900> everything<00:01:27.900> it's

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
your pressure tank and everything it's

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.719 
your pressure tank and everything it's
got<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> place<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> top<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.189> fill<00:01:29.400> with<00:01:29.490> air

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
got a place on the top to fill with air

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.640 
got a place on the top to fill with air
just<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.720> got<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.079> doesn't<00:01:31.409> mean<00:01:31.530> to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
just because it's got it doesn't mean to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.620 
just because it's got it doesn't mean to
put<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> lot<00:01:32.070> air<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.579> or<00:01:32.670> take<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:32.939> out<00:01:33.119> it's

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
put a lot air in it or take it out it's

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.800 
put a lot air in it or take it out it's
got<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.680> got<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:35.100> 35<00:01:35.790> pounds<00:01:36.360> when

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
got to be it's got to be 35 pounds when

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.219 
got to be it's got to be 35 pounds when
there's<00:01:36.990> no<00:01:37.200> water<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.860> at<00:01:38.070> all<00:01:38.750> all<00:01:39.750> right
