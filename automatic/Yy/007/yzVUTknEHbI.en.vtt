will settle at the bottom and you can

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.460 
will settle at the bottom and you can
see<00:02:24.650> see<00:02:25.370> what<00:02:25.489> I<00:02:25.519> mean<00:02:25.760> here<00:02:29.230> I'm<00:02:30.230> going<00:02:30.349> to

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
see see what I mean here I'm going to

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.990 
see see what I mean here I'm going to
slow<00:02:30.769> it<00:02:30.890> down<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.099> little<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:31.549> it<00:02:31.610> doesn't<00:02:31.880> take

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
slow it down a little so it doesn't take

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:51.460 
slow it down a little so it doesn't take
as<00:02:32.150> much<00:02:32.180> time

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.460 

so<00:02:52.040> now<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.790> can<00:02:53.000> see<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:54.110> can<00:02:54.230> see<00:02:54.380> it

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
so now you can see you can see it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.080 
so now you can see you can see it
stopped<00:02:54.800> settled<00:02:55.310> right<00:02:55.430> there<00:02:55.640> if<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.820> spin

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
stopped settled right there if I spin

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.580 
stopped settled right there if I spin
the<00:02:56.210> rim<00:02:56.360> again<00:02:56.660> it<00:02:56.780> will<00:02:56.840> do<00:02:56.990> the<00:02:57.110> same<00:02:57.140> thing

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
the rim again it will do the same thing

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.590 
the rim again it will do the same thing
and<00:02:57.740> settle<00:02:58.010> at<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.130> same<00:02:58.430> same<00:02:59.000> spot<00:02:59.330> so<00:02:59.570> I

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
and settle at the same same spot so I

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.980 
and settle at the same same spot so I
know<00:02:59.720> that<00:02:59.990> that's<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:01.250> heavy<00:03:01.750> part<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.840> my

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
know that that's a the heavy part of my

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.730 
know that that's a the heavy part of my
rim<00:03:03.230> is<00:03:03.380> at<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.590> bottom<00:03:05.110> once<00:03:06.110> we<00:03:06.260> know<00:03:06.530> the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
rim is at the bottom once we know the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.370 
rim is at the bottom once we know the
heaviest<00:03:07.340> part<00:03:07.700> of<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.850> rim<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.840> opposite

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
heaviest part of the rim the opposite

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.930 
heaviest part of the rim the opposite
edge<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.710> the<00:03:09.800> rim<00:03:09.980> will<00:03:10.190> be<00:03:10.310> our<00:03:10.460> lightest

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
edge of the rim will be our lightest

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.700 
edge of the rim will be our lightest
part<00:03:11.750> of<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.900> rim<00:03:12.050> I'm<00:03:12.230> going<00:03:12.380> to<00:03:12.440> mark<00:03:12.650> that

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
part of the rim I'm going to mark that

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.260 
part of the rim I'm going to mark that
with<00:03:12.980> tape<00:03:13.220> because<00:03:13.670> that's<00:03:13.850> where<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.090> need<00:03:14.150> to

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
with tape because that's where I need to

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:22.810 
with tape because that's where I need to
add<00:03:14.390> my<00:03:14.750> ways<00:03:21.040> then<00:03:22.040> I'm<00:03:22.160> going<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.310> start<00:03:22.640> off

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
add my ways then I'm going to start off

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.350 
add my ways then I'm going to start off
and<00:03:23.270> take<00:03:23.720> my<00:03:23.900> painters<00:03:24.680> tape<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.250> add<00:03:25.610> six

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
and take my painters tape and add six

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:39.309 
and take my painters tape and add six
weights<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.990> the<00:03:27.110> tire<00:03:28.870> and

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.880 

see<00:03:40.319> if<00:03:40.409> that<00:03:40.590> works<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:41.069> balance<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.519> tire<00:03:42.890> with

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
see if that works to balance a tire with

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.690 
see if that works to balance a tire with
the<00:03:44.010> weights<00:03:44.220> on<00:03:44.459> there<00:03:44.700> rotate<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.329> tire<00:03:46.700> 90

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
the weights on there rotate the tire 90

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.640 
the weights on there rotate the tire 90
degrees<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.450> see<00:03:48.659> if<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.900> heavier<00:03:49.230> parts

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
degrees and see if the heavier parts

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.550 
degrees and see if the heavier parts
still<00:03:49.890> outweighs<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:51.230> weights<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.379> just

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
still outweighs the weights you just

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.059 
still outweighs the weights you just
added<00:03:52.950> which<00:03:53.099> it<00:03:53.280> does<00:03:53.489> so<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.790> need<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.090> add<00:03:54.209> I

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
added which it does so I need to add I

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.259 
added which it does so I need to add I
need<00:03:56.069> to<00:03:56.189> add<00:03:56.310> seven<00:03:56.790> weights<00:03:59.000> now<00:04:00.000> I've<00:04:00.120> got

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
need to add seven weights now I've got

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.479 
need to add seven weights now I've got
seven<00:04:00.720> weights<00:04:00.930> on<00:04:01.200> there<00:04:01.470> rotate<00:04:02.159> the<00:04:02.310> tire

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
seven weights on there rotate the tire

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.550 
seven weights on there rotate the tire
90<00:04:02.849> degrees<00:04:03.180> see<00:04:03.510> if<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.689> heavy<00:04:03.900> parts<00:04:04.290> still

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
90 degrees see if the heavy parts still

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.509 
90 degrees see if the heavy parts still
outweighs<00:04:04.890> it<00:04:06.769> which<00:04:07.769> it<00:04:07.950> does<00:04:08.189> slightly<00:04:10.489> so<00:04:11.489> I

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
outweighs it which it does slightly so I

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.670 
outweighs it which it does slightly so I
need<00:04:11.909> to<00:04:12.060> add<00:04:12.239> another<00:04:12.690> weight<00:04:13.230> so<00:04:13.409> I'll<00:04:13.530> go

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
need to add another weight so I'll go

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.170 
need to add another weight so I'll go
for<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:14.629> eight<00:04:15.629> weights<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.139> it<00:04:16.970> now<00:04:17.970> with

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
for that eight weights to it now with

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.150 
for that eight weights to it now with
eight<00:04:18.389> weights<00:04:18.660> on<00:04:18.900> there<00:04:19.199> rotate<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:19.949> tire

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
eight weights on there rotate the tire

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.700 
eight weights on there rotate the tire
90<00:04:20.489> degrees<00:04:20.850> if<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.299> heavy<00:04:21.479> part<00:04:21.870> of<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.500> rim

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
90 degrees if the heavy part of the rim

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:31.600 
90 degrees if the heavy part of the rim
still<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.130> weighs<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:27.680> that's<00:04:28.680> really<00:04:29.130> close

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.740 

yeah<00:04:32.610> that's<00:04:32.789> really<00:04:33.030> close<00:04:33.300> if<00:04:33.479> I<00:04:33.570> added

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
yeah that's really close if I added

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.510 
yeah that's really close if I added
another<00:04:33.990> weight<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.740> weights<00:04:34.949> would<00:04:35.130> be<00:04:35.310> too

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
another weight the weights would be too

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.499 
another weight the weights would be too
much<00:04:35.699> and<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:38.520> weights<00:04:38.699> that<00:04:38.849> I<00:04:38.910> add<00:04:39.150> within

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
much and the weights that I add within

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.300 
much and the weights that I add within
outweigh<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.080> heavy<00:04:40.320> heavy<00:04:40.650> part<00:04:40.919> of<00:04:41.039> the<00:04:41.130> rim

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
outweigh the heavy heavy part of the rim

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.920 
outweigh the heavy heavy part of the rim
but<00:04:41.610> that's<00:04:41.849> really<00:04:42.180> close<00:04:42.360> that's<00:04:42.630> as<00:04:42.750> close

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
but that's really close that's as close

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.930 
but that's really close that's as close
as<00:04:43.139> you<00:04:43.229> can<00:04:43.380> get<00:04:43.530> it<00:04:46.460> but<00:04:47.460> that's<00:04:47.669> what<00:04:47.820> you

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
as you can get it but that's what you

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.260 
as you can get it but that's what you
want<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.720> static<00:04:49.080> balance<00:04:49.410> of<00:04:49.530> rim<00:04:50.270> that's

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
want to static balance of rim that's

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.670 
want to static balance of rim that's
what<00:04:51.510> you're<00:04:51.660> looking<00:04:51.990> for<00:04:52.260> is<00:04:52.380> when<00:04:52.560> you

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
what you're looking for is when you

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.710 
what you're looking for is when you
rotate<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.220> rim<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:53.610> stop<00:04:53.880> it<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.389> stays

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
rotate the rim and stop it it stays

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:08.900 
rotate the rim and stop it it stays
still<00:04:55.610> or<00:04:56.610> very<00:04:56.880> close<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.210> staying<00:04:58.110> still

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.570 

yeah<00:05:09.480> so<00:05:09.690> that's<00:05:09.840> perfect<00:05:13.160> since<00:05:14.160> I<00:05:14.250> have<00:05:14.430> to

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
yeah so that's perfect since I have to

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.370 
yeah so that's perfect since I have to
add<00:05:14.730> so<00:05:15.090> many<00:05:15.210> weights<00:05:15.540> I<00:05:15.780> have<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:16.020> add<00:05:16.140> eight

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
add so many weights I have to add eight

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.050 
add so many weights I have to add eight
weeks<00:05:16.620> to<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:16.890> rim<00:05:17.160> I'm<00:05:17.310> going<00:05:17.460> to<00:05:17.520> divide<00:05:17.820> it

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
weeks to the rim I'm going to divide it

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.080 
weeks to the rim I'm going to divide it
and<00:05:18.210> put<00:05:18.950> four<00:05:19.950> weights<00:05:20.160> on<00:05:20.370> one<00:05:20.400> side<00:05:20.850> and

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
and put four weights on one side and

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:30.900 
and put four weights on one side and
four<00:05:21.270> weights<00:05:21.480> on<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.810> other

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.050 

also<00:05:31.630> before<00:05:31.990> you<00:05:32.280> apply<00:05:33.280> the<00:05:33.310> weights<00:05:33.700> to<00:05:33.850> the

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
also before you apply the weights to the

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.760 
also before you apply the weights to the
