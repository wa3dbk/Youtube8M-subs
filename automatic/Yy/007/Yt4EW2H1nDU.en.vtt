00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.960
 hello to all here I expose you the 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.920
 monty worries so I have a vehicle for 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.469
 do not quote it concretely so here is a 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.929
 cap cap pretty friendly the problem 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.490
 is that these cars at this price they 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.890
 have thought to put the bluetooth but 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.720
 only to call me what 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.070
 I do not care the phone I have nothing to 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.199
 do what I care about it 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.260
 especially send music music 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.300
 videos all you want via bluetouff 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.180
 in the car only the car does not 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.850
 does not do so for those I thought about 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.190
 such a solution it looks like what you 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.670
 think do not hesitate here I have so 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.460
 bought a bluetooth audio receiver 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.160
 it's a home appliance it 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.930
 works on 5 volts 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.510
 so for those I cut his cable 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.910
 that's it for connecting it to the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.399
 car I took a charger turns on 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.440
 cigar album product from elsewhere 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.210
 it is 5 volts and not 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.579
 delay 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.269
 of nonsense and then we will of course 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.909
 an iphone to us so here we are in the 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.860
 car that still has 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.790
 a jack is the minimum 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.659
 at mercedes so here is simply 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:24.140
 plug in the jack 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:25.940
 behind ocak plug the sector so 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.580
 I showed you earlier that 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.660
 you will be careful to cut like a 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:36.190
 wild besides hop there so the most 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.190
 with the most 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:51.950
 the least with the least I invite you 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:02:03.890
 of course to isolate all that we 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:07.120
 plug contact on the car so we 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.120
 will search the bluetooth 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.080
 So here we see the bluetooth 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.640
 mercedes below but hey he does not know 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.530
 not do so hop here we connect 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.530
 just here it is already 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.050
 connected we put ourselves in a voice 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.430
 Auxiliaries for the jack 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.470
 of course that's it and so that's it 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.780
 connected in two seconds it's done 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.780
 so we can at his 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.990
 and 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.410
 we can mount the volume of the car 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.209
 or the phone directly choose its 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.069
 music in two seconds 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.630

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.670

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.150
