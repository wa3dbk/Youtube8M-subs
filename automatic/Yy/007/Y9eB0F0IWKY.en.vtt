00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.980 

this<00:00:20.160> time<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.760> don't<00:00:20.850> unconscious<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.750> actually

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
this time I don't unconscious I actually

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.470 
this time I don't unconscious I actually
leave<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.529> all<00:00:22.650> crunched<00:00:23.400> up<00:00:23.520> and<00:00:23.790> I<00:00:24.000> sew<00:00:24.270> right

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
leave it all crunched up and I sew right

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.940 
leave it all crunched up and I sew right
through<00:00:24.540> it<00:00:24.840> like<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:24.990> said<00:00:25.170> before<00:00:25.710> with<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
through it like I said before with the

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.730 
through it like I said before with the
mesh<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.369> can<00:00:26.580> do<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:27.509> actually<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
mesh that you can do it actually it's a

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.200 
mesh that you can do it actually it's a
little<00:00:29.009> bit<00:00:29.130> thicker<00:00:29.430> but<00:00:29.550> it's<00:00:29.849> still<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
little bit thicker but it's still the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.210 
little bit thicker but it's still the
machine<00:00:30.540> goes<00:00:30.720> right<00:00:30.990> through<00:00:31.020> it<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.070> adds

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
machine goes right through it so it adds

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.760 
machine goes right through it so it adds
a<00:00:32.430> whole<00:00:32.460> different<00:00:33.120> textural<00:00:33.600> look<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.320> to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
a whole different textural look to it to

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.299 
a whole different textural look to it to
your<00:00:34.920> pieces<00:00:35.629> this<00:00:36.629> one<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.260> again<00:00:38.040> I've

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
your pieces this one here again I've

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.180 
your pieces this one here again I've
taken<00:00:38.580> the<00:00:39.330> small<00:00:39.989> amounts<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.800> copper

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
taken the small amounts of the copper

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.939 
taken the small amounts of the copper
foil<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.790> sewn<00:00:42.360> them<00:00:42.540> again<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> want<00:00:43.650> to<00:00:43.739> point

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
foil and sewn them again I want to point

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.220 
foil and sewn them again I want to point
out<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.430> organza<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.449> is<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> effect<00:00:46.019> where

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
out the organza this is the effect where

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.130 
out the organza this is the effect where
you<00:00:46.260> burn<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.860> organza<00:00:47.250> out<00:00:48.140> afterwards

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you burn the organza out afterwards

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.530 
you burn the organza out afterwards
which<00:00:49.739> creates<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.309> real<00:00:50.520> nice<00:00:50.730> organic<00:00:51.120> look

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
which creates a real nice organic look

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.619 
which creates a real nice organic look
so<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.559> looks<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:52.980> piece

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
so I really like the looks of this piece

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.959 
so I really like the looks of this piece
and<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.899> talked<00:00:55.500> about<00:00:55.680> how<00:00:56.040> you<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.430> use<00:00:56.640> this

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
and we talked about how you can use this

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.360 
and we talked about how you can use this
these<00:00:57.629> copper<00:00:58.110> foil<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.980> all<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.250> these

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
these copper foil and all of these

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.569 
these copper foil and all of these
techniques<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.149> different<00:01:01.050> types<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.579> surface

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
techniques on different types of surface

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.060 
techniques on different types of surface
design<00:01:03.199> again<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.410> one<00:01:04.649> I've<00:01:04.770> taken

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
design again this one I've taken

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.700 
design again this one I've taken
canvases<00:01:05.940> and<00:01:06.180> I've<00:01:06.810> actually<00:01:07.259> painted<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
canvases and I've actually painted the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.100 
canvases and I've actually painted the
canvas<00:01:08.190> and<00:01:08.430> then<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.119> took<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.509> copper<00:01:09.840> foil

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
canvas and then I took the copper foil

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.290 
canvas and then I took the copper foil
and<00:01:10.289> this<00:01:10.410> time<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.770> wove<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.190> so<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.670> wove<00:01:12.180> it

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
and this time I wove it so I wove it

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.690 
and this time I wove it so I wove it
together<00:01:12.630> making<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.560> little<00:01:13.800> grid<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.340> use

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
together making a little grid and use

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.490 
together making a little grid and use
that<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.390> focal<00:01:15.750> point<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.140> my<00:01:16.289> little

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
that for the focal point on my little

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.440 
that for the focal point on my little
book<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.100> again<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.880> piece<00:01:18.119> same

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
start out with the bare copper foil you

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.990 
start out with the bare copper foil you
can<00:01:29.430> use<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.240> way<00:01:30.390> or<00:01:31.790> again

kind of a dark look kind of an aged look
to<00:01:59.409> your<00:01:59.530> copper<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.630> like<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:01.960> said<00:02:02.200> before<00:02:02.350> I

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
to your copper and like I said before I

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.789 
to your copper and like I said before I
always<00:02:02.799> make<00:02:03.009> sure<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:05.229> crunch<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.590> end

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
always make sure that you crunch the end

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.639 
always make sure that you crunch the end
of<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:05.979> pliers<00:02:07.050> so<00:02:08.050> even<00:02:08.349> that's<00:02:08.500> a<00:02:08.619> little

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
of the pliers so even that's a little

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.589 
of the pliers so even that's a little
wet<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.069> can<00:02:09.250> still<00:02:09.459> see<00:02:09.670> this<00:02:10.119> can<00:02:10.270> be<00:02:10.420> kind

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
wet you can still see this can be kind

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.960 
wet you can still see this can be kind
of<00:02:10.660> a<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.200> dark<00:02:11.530> shade<00:02:11.890> to<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.220> it's<00:02:12.819> gonna

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
of a just a dark shade to it it's gonna

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.330 
of a just a dark shade to it it's gonna
give<00:02:13.209> it<00:02:13.239> a<00:02:13.390> nice<00:02:13.569> aged<00:02:13.989> look<00:02:14.319> it's<00:02:14.709> a<00:02:14.860> similar

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
give it a nice aged look it's a similar

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.000 
give it a nice aged look it's a similar
to<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.730> liver<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.300> sulfur<00:02:16.360> but<00:02:17.349> it<00:02:17.530> still<00:02:17.830> has

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
to the liver of sulfur but it still has

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.770 
to the liver of sulfur but it still has
more<00:02:18.190> Brown<00:02:18.550> tones<00:02:18.910> than<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.390> does<00:02:19.540> those

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
more Brown tones than it does those

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.280 
more Brown tones than it does those
purples<00:02:20.260> now<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.730> can<00:02:21.940> also<00:02:22.090> really<00:02:22.720> distress

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
purples now you can also really distress

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:44.000 
purples now you can also really distress
the<00:02:23.470> copper<00:02:23.830> foil<00:02:24.190> like<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.580> did<00:02:24.760> with<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.060> mesh

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.440 

and<00:02:45.010> again<00:02:45.400> you're<00:02:45.670> going<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.879> get<00:02:46.090> some

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
and again you're going to get some

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.009 
and again you're going to get some
really<00:02:46.810> great<00:02:47.019> burnt<00:02:47.319> edges<00:02:48.689> like<00:02:49.689> I<00:02:49.810> showed

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
really great burnt edges like I showed

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.949 
really great burnt edges like I showed
you<00:02:50.079> before<00:02:50.200> them<00:02:50.620> now<00:02:51.549> as<00:02:51.969> you<00:02:52.269> can<00:02:52.420> see<00:02:52.659> it's

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
you before them now as you can see it's

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.959 
you before them now as you can see it's
got<00:02:53.139> a<00:02:53.170> little<00:02:53.349> bit<00:02:53.499> of<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.769> fire<00:02:54.189> scale<00:02:54.579> to<00:02:54.819> it

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:54.969 
got a little bit of a fire scale to it

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.989 
got a little bit of a fire scale to it
so<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.329> you<00:02:55.510> can<00:02:55.689> actually<00:02:55.870> take<00:02:56.230> some<00:02:56.499> of<00:02:56.530> that

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:56.999 
so it you can actually take some of that

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:00.599 
so it you can actually take some of that
some<00:02:57.999> of<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.439> darkness<00:02:59.439> off<00:02:59.859> let<00:03:00.219> me<00:03:00.250> take<00:03:00.489> my

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
we can do to this so you can do this

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.110 
we can do to this so you can do this
technique<00:03:05.439> with<00:03:05.500> either<00:03:05.889> the<00:03:06.129> copper<00:03:06.489> foil<00:03:06.760> or

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
technique with either the copper foil or

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.819 
technique with either the copper foil or
with<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.480> liver<00:03:07.689> of<00:03:07.810> sulfur<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.500> like<00:03:08.680> we

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
with the liver of sulfur so like we

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.440 
with the liver of sulfur so like we
talked<00:03:09.040> about<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.280> liver<00:03:09.549> of<00:03:09.669> sulfur<00:03:09.730> just

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
talked about the liver of sulfur just

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.869 
talked about the liver of sulfur just
take<00:03:10.659> it<00:03:10.810> through<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.049> bath<00:03:11.230> rly<00:03:11.650> put<00:03:12.639> on<00:03:12.760> the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
can just just sort of a random and

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.209 
can just just sort of a random and
what's<00:03:25.419> kind<00:03:25.719> of<00:03:25.810> fun<00:03:26.049> is<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.739> texture

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:27.219 
what's kind of fun is that the texture

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.869 
what's kind of fun is that the texture
on<00:03:27.250> my<00:03:27.489> actually<00:03:28.150> on<00:03:28.269> my<00:03:29.549> canvas<00:03:30.549> here<00:03:30.790> has

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
on my actually on my canvas here has

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.490 
on my actually on my canvas here has
come<00:03:31.060> out<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:31.569> you<00:03:31.659> can<00:03:31.900> actually<00:03:31.930> do<00:03:32.469> rubbings

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
come out so you can actually do rubbings

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.080 
come out so you can actually do rubbings
to<00:03:35.500> get<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.680> whole<00:03:35.859> different<00:03:36.219> look<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.639> can

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
to get a whole different look you can

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.209 
to get a whole different look you can
see<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.389> nice<00:03:37.540> shine<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.019> I<00:03:38.079> get<00:03:38.349> so<00:03:38.829> this<00:03:38.980> is

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:39.219 
see the nice shine that I get so this is

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.610 
see the nice shine that I get so this is
a<00:03:39.250> is<00:03:39.639> this<00:03:39.819> is<00:03:39.969> a<00:03:40.000> real<00:03:40.419> real<00:03:40.750> real<00:03:40.780> easy<00:03:41.260> easy

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
a is this is a real real real easy easy

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.569 
a is this is a real real real easy easy
easy<00:03:41.769> technique<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:43.060> begin<00:03:43.359> with
