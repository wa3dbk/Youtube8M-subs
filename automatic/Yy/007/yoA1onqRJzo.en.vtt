00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.100
 half of the inhabitants of Novosibirsk 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.010
 agglomeration spends on the road to the place 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.529
 work or study more than an hour hello 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.460
 Alexey Mazur themselves conducted a study 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.040
 scholars mgu 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.710
 Institute of Economics Academy of Sciences they 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.869
 interviewed a thousand people revealed that 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.239
 less than half an hour before work can 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.480
 reach only 15 percent of respondents 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.650
 38 percent of the road goes away from half an hour 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.879
 up to an hour the rest get an hour or more 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.530
 I must say that the study hit 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.180
 residents of different settlements 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.030
 some of which are distant from 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.739
 Novosibirsk 90 kilometers therefore 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.960
 most popular means of transport 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.629
 there were electric trains and where there is no 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.860
 electric trains in the minibus investigator 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.079
 were interested in social 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.340
 the health of the respondents turned out 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.379
 what a blowjob whole is happy with life 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.180
 residents of remote settlements 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.729
 which is from Novosibirsk on 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.619
 distance from 60 to 90 kilometers 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.110
 they are not only complaining about transport 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.990
 problems but lack of opportunity for 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.220
 work at the place of residence 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.020
 when i ride on our 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.680
 areas and drew attention to a clear 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.750
 regularity 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.570
 the closer to Novosibirsk populated 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.189
 the point is the better our people live with him 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.049
 agriculture can no longer 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.600
 ensure the employment of rural people and 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.850
 it's not just in his folder although she 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.890
 sometimes catastrophic where 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.630
 agriculture stops but 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.840
 requires far fewer workers than 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.189
 Soviet time here are people going to the city where 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.040
 there is trade and no 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.659
 industry but so how to sell housing 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.000
 in the village and buy at least something in return 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.630
 the city is almost impossible many 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.710
 every day go back 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.750
 research itself is nothing new 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.759
 discovered the problem known for a long time 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.340
 extinction force on the one hand and 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.560
 transport problems with other these 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.329
 problems are interconnected will be with us 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.460
 good fast inexpensive transportation a 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.950
 also comfortable reliable and often 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.600
 walking would have improved dozens of lives 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.299
 settlements around novosibirsk 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.040
 their residents would become available and work in 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.590
 city and visiting cultural 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.079
 events and would also say goodbye sales 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.239
 rural produce is a problem for everyone 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.099
 known and understandable now i would like to 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.069
 remind us of the city and the region 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.870
 there is an election campaign set 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.720
 candidate parties are fighting deputies 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.430
 mandates and that's what we are amazing 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.400
 do not hear any suggestions for a solution 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.370
 all known problems where the question 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.890
 who would break spears such as white 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.349
 for the construction of the fourth bridge from the times 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.760
 on the construction of the metro and blue for 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.819
 to save money and buy 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.560
 more electric trains but the feeling 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.470
 that a problem exists in one world 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.430
 and the election in some other and binds 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.099
 their one day 1 5 years by the way about the weather and 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.750
 it unfortunately I finish you not 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.950
 fix any election program 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.950
 goodbye
