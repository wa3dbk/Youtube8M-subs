00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
it that's less black but I think this is

it that's less black but I think this is
just<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.080> perfect<00:01:46.409> combo<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.159> yellow<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.610> all

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
just a perfect combo the yellow with all

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.890 
just a perfect combo the yellow with all
the<00:01:47.760> little<00:01:47.909> black<00:01:48.150> and<00:01:48.210> carbon<00:01:48.659> fiber

exhausts<00:01:52.250> looks<00:01:53.250> bad

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.800 

so<00:02:19.190> we<00:02:19.310> got<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.670> call<00:02:19.879> that<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.239> hurricane<00:02:20.510> is
