00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 and I attend the plateau of France télé achat with a jean-michel des 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.340
 summer talk about it in the Angolan enclave 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.399
 so let's fix questerre 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:12.579
 the dangerous vigil says it's a little fruit that comes from the owners 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.429
 interests of the Himalayan plateaus very precisely 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.019
 it's an absolutely fabulous fruit goji I think you already had 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.990
 to hear about it a bit if you read or listen to anything that is a bit 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.859
 pitiful not much it becomes very fashionable and we now understand 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.210
 Why 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.350
 for the multi 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.529
 it is something that excessively rich in distributing and especially slowed down 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.890
 west and your body will tell you thank you that still a little bit so michel 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.930
 can you explain a little bit of a head elsewhere in talking about it 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.730
 m what exactly are the antioxidants 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.850
 so antioxidants is something that 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.490
 against free radicals antioxidants oxis stripped yes rusty start of 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.500
 aging 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.150
 but one can be human at a given moment so oxidizes where he lives he stands 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.650
 tired of wrinkles pains et cetera et cetera 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.430
 and what does that are free radicals and free radicals 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.850
 they must be stopped free radicals to embarrassed 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.619
 it is an electron to anatole so to feed an electron 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.700
 and when samantha an electron it goes crazy it's like a ball of 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.609
 ping-pong that strikes all the parishes while the walls of 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.469
 cell and that the abyss salisu his new life 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:19.930
 so do not lend to limit the practices to the books 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.930
 and that's what the goty does because idy it contains a lot of 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.520
 half guittat 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.290
 trace minerals even topo also polysaccharides including 4 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.290
 polysaccharides that are absolutely 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.710
 unico rungis and that come in synergy for us among others boosted by 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.400
 immune defense of the body and especially and above all make sticking cells 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.720
 renew because you want more vitamins and so on but 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.140
 especially help him very very rich an antioxidant and certainly the most 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.790
 rich could have been in a home today 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.110
 alas its part alan tieger cellular aging and that's 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.610
 especially for that we talk about it a lot more coherent started to 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.250
 consume the logo of the site we see it especially at the level of t1 but also at 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.480
 level of his skin from this crisis and then at the same time that the very very 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.670
 rich he gives you tonus face parker kids find themselves 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.269
 it makes your sense purer it's very very effective it acts on the vision c 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.019
 but would react go it's very very complete the goji his degrees to 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.800
 the total absence you take this little bottle yes 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.030
 and every morning 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.160
 agen you take a spoon and goji that you put in a glass of water and 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.080
 you'll see that every morning awesome I know you'll see it's 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.509
 delicious young people 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:31.499
 but at 5 5% here it is to note there it feels very very good but of value 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:35.979
 a tablespoon of bacon and you'll see that every morning agen and you 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:39.129
 are constant you were not jumping one day another it must be 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.309
 regular in the cure 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.719
 this woman with a mischievous head is delicious 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.120
 at the drilling stop at michelle allaire recapitulative attack this 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.799
 time it is really really complete 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.540
 when she did and did good, it's finally quite logical 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.420
 yes to health yes 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.720
 and the galley for the immune defenses absolutely not finally 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.510
 and will strengthen vacancies in other cases 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.349
 and not only does it strengthen immune defenses and do good 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.060
 at the blood level liver level of vision said it 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.609
 and the elected complete free radicals and western rentiers and that's where he goes 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.319
 promote the new cellular renewal very effective at the level of t1 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.849
 derivatives thing like that 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.430
 it really really slows cellular aging and I will 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.129
 spoke earlier about magazines that pollute all alone everywhere 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.799
 in the floors so madonna britney spears this year I more than by that 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.459
 and that's true why he even says that it's good for the 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.209
 first libido it's a bit like kkr she does well 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.049
 but here she is 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.540
 and I wanted to add a little thing about the goal I know you're going to do 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.099
 good to your body yes but in addition you will do a good action because 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.489
 that the answer happens we worked in partnership with a 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.369
 association called seeds of the future 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:47.259
 and who has for the president of veronique jannot at his very creation 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:51.089
 well and that this association comes into effect to serve forgiveness to the children 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.599
 children's education and ideas 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.069
 at home or away and all displaced children as a rule 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.149
 so that's true 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:01.269
 a passion for our career and in action for the children of the earth 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.829
 so here it's true if you want to go for a ride on the rear bumper 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:06.559
 writing
