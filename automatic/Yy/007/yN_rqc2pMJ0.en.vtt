00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.119 
and those two going they're kind of hard
to<00:02:56.840> put<00:02:57.049> them<00:02:57.140> in<00:02:57.370> tight<00:02:58.370> area<00:02:59.500> but<00:03:00.500> oh<00:03:03.129> so

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
to put them in tight area but oh so

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.729 
to put them in tight area but oh so
here's<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.819> I<00:03:05.480> guess<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.019> need<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.349> put<00:03:06.650> them

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
here's that I guess I need to put them

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.000 
here's that I guess I need to put them
straight<00:03:06.980> if<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.400> want<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.760> be<00:03:08.110> cool<00:03:12.010> there

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
and then this goes in here back goes

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.839 
and then this goes in here back goes
pretty<00:03:23.480> far<00:03:23.720> yep<00:03:24.319> and<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:25.280> go<00:03:25.519> off<00:03:25.640> you're

unless<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:30.950> have<00:03:31.099> a<00:03:31.129> refill<00:03:31.280> kit<00:03:31.609> but<00:03:32.090> there's

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
unless you have a refill kit but there's

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.490 
unless you have a refill kit but there's
one<00:03:32.510> problem<00:03:32.569> with<00:03:33.109> it<00:03:33.290> because<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.950> arms<00:03:34.909> are

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
one problem with it because the arms are

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.960 
one problem with it because the arms are
they<00:03:36.500> have<00:03:36.769> space<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.430> run<00:03:37.609> right<00:03:37.639> through

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
they have space that run right through

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.930 
they have space that run right through
there's<00:03:38.359> no<00:03:38.540> end<00:03:38.900> wool<00:03:39.530> so<00:03:40.340> sometimes<00:03:40.790> when

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
there's no end wool so sometimes when

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.740 
there's no end wool so sometimes when
you<00:03:41.060> put<00:03:41.239> them<00:03:41.329> in<00:03:41.450> they<00:03:42.200> go<00:03:42.440> in<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.920> then<00:03:43.750> they

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
you put them in they go in and then they

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.649 
you put them in they go in and then they
might<00:03:45.019> go<00:03:45.230> in<00:03:45.379> all<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.530> way<00:03:45.680> like<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.730> if

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
might go in all the way like that and if

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.030 
might go in all the way like that and if
you<00:03:47.750> push<00:03:47.989> it<00:03:48.109> in<00:03:48.230> too<00:03:48.349> far<00:03:48.709> they're<00:03:48.859> going<00:03:48.980> to

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
you push it in too far they're going to

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.970 
you push it in too far they're going to
fall<00:03:49.310> right<00:03:49.340> out<00:03:49.670> just<00:03:50.319> like<00:03:51.319> that<00:03:51.440> so<00:03:51.859> I'll

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
fall right out just like that so I'll

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.410 
fall right out just like that so I'll
just<00:03:52.040> pop<00:03:52.459> right<00:03:52.489> out<00:03:52.670> so<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.000> don't<00:03:53.060> want<00:03:53.359> to

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
just pop right out so you don't want to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.750 
just pop right out so you don't want to
put<00:03:53.540> them<00:03:53.599> in<00:03:53.750> too<00:03:53.959> far<00:03:54.200> just<00:03:54.709> enough<00:03:55.099> so<00:03:55.730> that

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
put them in too far just enough so that

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.199 
put them in too far just enough so that
they're<00:03:56.030> at<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.269> halfway<00:03:56.450> mark<00:03:56.690> like<00:03:57.379> so<00:03:57.620> and

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
they're at the halfway mark like so and

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.270 
they're at the halfway mark like so and
that's<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.480> darts<00:03:59.810> they're<00:04:00.709> not<00:04:00.889> it's<00:04:01.129> not

that's the darts they're not it's not

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.280 
that's the darts they're not it's not
the<00:04:01.430> best<00:04:01.669> way<00:04:01.879> to<00:04:01.940> store<00:04:02.180> darts<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.660> find<00:04:03.139> that

then<00:05:15.849> you<00:05:16.060> can<00:05:16.240> start<00:05:16.419> our<00:05:16.599> to<00:05:16.750> that<00:05:16.930> yeah<00:05:17.650> I

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
then you can start our to that yeah I

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.879 
then you can start our to that yeah I
have<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.539> retaliator<00:05:20.020> for<00:05:20.379> grip<00:05:20.530> that<00:05:20.680> comes

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
have the retaliator for grip that comes

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.570 
have the retaliator for grip that comes
to<00:05:21.039> retaliate<00:05:21.490> ER<00:05:21.550> and<00:05:22.169> the<00:05:23.169> pig<00:05:23.349> crush<00:05:23.680> now<00:05:24.400> it

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
to retaliate ER and the pig crush now it

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.610 
to retaliate ER and the pig crush now it
looks<00:05:24.729> like<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.419> tactical<00:05:25.930> rail<00:05:26.110> is<00:05:26.349> a<00:05:26.380> lot

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
looks like the tactical rail is a lot

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.760 
looks like the tactical rail is a lot
smoother<00:05:27.310> and<00:05:27.460> it<00:05:27.550> doesn't<00:05:27.759> have<00:05:27.849> the<00:05:27.909> rigid

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
smoother and it doesn't have the rigid

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.339 
smoother and it doesn't have the rigid
areas<00:05:29.789> on<00:05:30.789> the<00:05:30.970> side<00:05:31.180> so<00:05:31.659> I'm<00:05:31.840> going<00:05:31.870> to<00:05:32.020> see<00:05:32.169> if

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
areas on the side so I'm going to see if

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.980 
areas on the side so I'm going to see if
the<00:05:32.620> end<00:05:32.949> striking<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.030> products<00:05:34.599> fit<00:05:34.840> on

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
the end striking the products fit on

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.670 
the end striking the products fit on
there<00:05:35.139> and<00:05:35.349> they<00:05:35.710> do<00:05:35.770> fit<00:05:36.280> on<00:05:36.490> nice<00:05:37.000> and<00:05:37.210> fine

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
there and they do fit on nice and fine

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.610 
there and they do fit on nice and fine
so<00:05:38.680> it's<00:05:38.860> not<00:05:38.979> the<00:05:39.750> they<00:05:40.750> did<00:05:40.930> not<00:05:41.050> design<00:05:41.500> the

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
so it's not the they did not design the

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.240 
so it's not the they did not design the
tactical<00:05:42.069> rail<00:05:42.190> just<00:05:42.699> for<00:05:42.969> the<00:05:43.569> rebelled

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
tactical rail just for the rebelled

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
tactical rail just for the rebelled
products<00:05:45.250> so<00:05:45.400> that<00:05:45.430> works<00:05:45.789> pretty<00:05:46.180> well<00:05:48.270> it's

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
products so that works pretty well it's

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.089 
products so that works pretty well it's
really<00:05:49.780> smooth<00:05:50.139> so<00:05:50.500> that<00:05:50.530> kind<00:05:50.860> of<00:05:50.919> might<00:05:51.069> have

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
really smooth so that kind of might have

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.399 
really smooth so that kind of might have
upset<00:05:51.310> some<00:05:51.759> people<00:05:51.879> because<00:05:52.750> i<00:05:52.870> thought<00:05:53.050> the

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409 
upset some people because i thought the

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.580 
upset some people because i thought the
n-strike<00:05:53.710> line<00:05:54.360> was<00:05:55.360> rigid<00:05:56.080> and<00:05:56.229> that<00:05:56.409> might

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
n-strike line was rigid and that might

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.439 
n-strike line was rigid and that might
be<00:05:56.710> a<00:05:56.740> signals<00:05:57.190> to<00:05:57.310> say<00:05:57.460> don't<00:05:57.669> use<00:05:57.880> these<00:05:58.090> this

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
be a signals to say don't use these this

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.279 
be a signals to say don't use these this
is<00:05:58.599> a<00:05:58.630> gun<00:05:58.900> that<00:05:58.930> requires<00:05:59.860> flat<00:06:00.219> ones<00:06:01.289> the

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
is a gun that requires flat ones the

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.700 
is a gun that requires flat ones the
handle<00:06:02.740> right<00:06:02.979> here<00:06:03.039> has<00:06:04.050> some<00:06:05.050> really<00:06:05.289> kind

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
handle right here has some really kind

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.260 
handle right here has some really kind
of<00:06:05.770> weird<00:06:05.979> walls<00:06:08.130> what<00:06:09.130> kind<00:06:09.849> of<00:06:09.909> like<00:06:10.029> the

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
of weird walls what kind of like the

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.189 
of weird walls what kind of like the
design<00:06:10.930> and<00:06:11.229> it's<00:06:12.069> like<00:06:12.190> a<00:06:12.219> plus<00:06:12.580> a<00:06:12.880> bar<00:06:13.870> has

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
design and it's like a plus a bar has

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.249 
design and it's like a plus a bar has
three<00:06:14.830> four<00:06:15.509> bars<00:06:16.509> that<00:06:16.840> kind<00:06:17.020> of<00:06:17.080> come<00:06:17.229> out

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:17.259 
three four bars that kind of come out
