00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
the design after one of their many

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.679 
the design after one of their many
different<00:00:28.080> tactical<00:00:28.439> vests<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.060> I<00:00:30.060> picked

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
different tactical vests and I picked

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.780 
different tactical vests and I picked
this<00:00:30.840> vest<00:00:31.170> because<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.949> didn't<00:00:32.520> want<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
this vest because I didn't want the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.180 
this vest because I didn't want the
standard<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.540> know<00:00:33.570> full<00:00:34.260> Molly<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
standard you know full Molly have to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.280 
standard you know full Molly have to
customize<00:00:35.610> everything<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.660> actually<00:00:36.930> came

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
customize everything it actually came

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.410 
customize everything it actually came
with<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.620> built-in<00:00:38.190> admin<00:00:38.579> pouch<00:00:38.760> type<00:00:39.180> thing

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
with a built-in admin pouch type thing

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.139 
with a built-in admin pouch type thing
and<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:40.170> thought<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.739> sleek<00:00:41.309> body<00:00:41.850> armor

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
and I thought that the sleek body armor

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.490 
and I thought that the sleek body armor
design<00:00:42.300> look<00:00:42.540> really<00:00:42.809> cool<00:00:42.960> would<00:00:43.230> kind<00:00:43.469> of

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
design look really cool would kind of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.619 
design look really cool would kind of
distinguish<00:00:43.890> me<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.190> battlefield<00:00:44.629> but

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
distinguish me on the battlefield but

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.910 
distinguish me on the battlefield but
really<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:45.960> was<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.289> personal<00:00:46.649> taste

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
really it was just a personal taste

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.459 
really it was just a personal taste
thing<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.600> I<00:00:48.600> picked<00:00:49.079> up<00:00:49.230> some<00:00:49.309> g36c<00:00:51.469> mag

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
thing and I picked up some g36c mag

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.670 
thing and I picked up some g36c mag
pouches<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.379> have<00:00:55.379> all<00:00:55.649> of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
pouches that so that I can have all of

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.130 
pouches that so that I can have all of
my<00:00:57.739> mp5<00:00:58.739> mags<00:00:59.100> well<00:01:00.059> about<00:01:00.239> three<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.870> them<00:01:01.020> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
my mp5 mags well about three of them and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.969 
my mp5 mags well about three of them and
each<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.890> hold<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:03.290> so<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.710> six

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979

really a speed loader it just holds bb's
and<00:02:09.840> i<00:02:09.899> thought<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.140> was<00:02:10.289> cool<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:11.099> i<00:02:11.129> picked<00:02:11.400> up

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
tearing into it we're not sure what was

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.360

wrong<00:03:59.509> with<00:03:59.689> the<00:03:59.780> gearbox<00:04:00.169> but<00:04:00.349> we're<00:04:01.129> looking

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
wrong with the gearbox but we're looking

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.819 
wrong with the gearbox but we're looking
into<00:04:01.519> it<00:04:01.849> and<00:04:01.879> just<00:04:02.870> kind<00:04:03.049> of<00:04:03.079> getting<00:04:03.259> a<00:04:03.349> feel

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
into it and just kind of getting a feel

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.149 
into it and just kind of getting a feel
for<00:04:03.859> what<00:04:05.229> how<00:04:06.229> gearbox<00:04:06.709> works<00:04:06.919> and

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
for what how gearbox works and

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.439 
for what how gearbox works and
everything's<00:04:07.459> it's<00:04:07.669> our<00:04:07.790> first<00:04:07.969> time<00:04:08.060> opening

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
everything's it's our first time opening

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.559 
everything's it's our first time opening
up<00:04:08.569> a<00:04:08.659> gun<00:04:08.840> together<00:04:09.259> and<00:04:09.500> stuff<00:04:09.739> so<00:04:10.039> it's<00:04:10.699> it's

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
up a gun together and stuff so it's it's

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.839 
up a gun together and stuff so it's it's
a<00:04:11.750> process<00:04:12.019> I<00:04:12.409> guess<00:04:12.439> I'll<00:04:13.370> be<00:04:13.489> happy<00:04:13.609> if<00:04:13.759> we

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
a process I guess I'll be happy if we

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.060 
a process I guess I'll be happy if we
even<00:04:14.090> get<00:04:14.150> it<00:04:14.269> back<00:04:14.359> together<00:04:14.539> but<00:04:14.959> it's<00:04:15.739> just

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
even get it back together but it's just

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.289 
even get it back together but it's just
a<00:04:16.159> learning<00:04:16.280> experience<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:17.030> gun<00:04:17.150> was

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
a learning experience the gun was

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.839 
a learning experience the gun was
non-functional<00:04:17.959> anyway<00:04:18.229> so<00:04:18.289> it<00:04:18.889> was<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.489> good

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
non-functional anyway so it was a good

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:23.230 
non-functional anyway so it was a good
project<00:04:20.150> gun<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:21.739> don't<00:04:22.250> tend<00:04:22.669> that<00:04:22.789> I<00:04:22.969> don't

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
project gun I don't tend that I don't

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.219 
project gun I don't tend that I don't
think<00:04:23.389> we're<00:04:23.510> gonna<00:04:23.570> do<00:04:23.810> anything<00:04:23.900> with<00:04:24.199> it

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
think we're gonna do anything with it

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.430 
think we're gonna do anything with it
but<00:04:24.740> it's<00:04:25.370> good<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.729> learn

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
but it's good to learn

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.430 
but it's good to learn
basics<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:28.510> then<00:04:28.540> over<00:04:28.900> here<00:04:28.930> we<00:04:29.170> also

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
basics and then over here we also

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.960 
basics and then over here we also
organize<00:04:30.160> some<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.580> stuff<00:04:30.760> it's<00:04:30.910> all

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970
