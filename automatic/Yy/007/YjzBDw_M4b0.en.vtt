00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello everyone today I got a laptop 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.890
 hp pavilion g6 whose download 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.559
 the system was about 5-7 minutes what 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.990
 a very long time to figure it out 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.690
 went the standard way first through 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.480
 conflict with utility m checked what 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.840
 programs are in the autoload cleaned 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.060
 from unnecessary non-system programs then 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.880
 looked windows magazine and made sure 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.340
 that the problem is not on the hard disk 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.700
 yes, I checked if there are any write errors 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.670
 or in the style of the disc they were not but I 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.950
 I thought and decided that these operations I do 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.110
 pretty often and i need 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.570
 this process automates because 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.910
 it is standard on all computers and 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.280
 I did type 1 on the Internet 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.559
 script that automates this 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.469
 the process was written by one specialist 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.489
 microsoft vadim we take it on power 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.829
 shell and 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.230
 works performing all standard 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.020
 actions that I usually spend 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.090
 but only very automated 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.439
 convenient, I advise everyone who has this 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.240
 problem with long loading 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.970
 use this script to 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.490
 just make your life easier and do it 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.080
 everything is much faster now let's 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.869
 move on to the software part and you 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.020
 I will show how to run this script on 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.900
 a laptop which I already accelerated loading 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.840
 but this bottom is not important because you 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.170
 see how the script works and show on 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.420
 your mac computer which 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.310
 installed ssd drive this is such 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.290
 feature because neighbors he 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.479
 loads much faster just so you 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.820
 saw the difference and tell some 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.970
 the nuances and development between the ordinary and wait 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.189
 disk and create a disk so you can 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.229
 start now you see the laptop screen 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.299
 I went under users with 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.790
 administrator rights because 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.240
 to run this script are needed as 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.509
 just the same and run it and see that it 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.329
 we have from the publisher vadim with terkin as 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.380
 I can tell you that this program and 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.840
 certified that is, it has 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.640
 security certificate as we see 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.800
 batch reports download speeds 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.380
 system fixes problem slow 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.420
 also loading windows hard disk in 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.970
 In this window, we see the item additionally and 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.760
 here you can uncheck the box automatically 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.340
 apply a fix that will give us 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.200
 first view the report and then later 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.260
 decide on 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.990
 correct mistakes or not remove this 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.730
 tick click further if you do not want 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.250
 by the way you can not do that is 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.590
 and leave by default she herself everything 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.990
 correct at this point you will see which 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.300
 options for fixing the program you 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.550
 offer and you can agree either 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.170
 I have to give up only one point 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.380
 which program offers to fix 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.590
 this is a collection of information to the system without 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.770
 her changes well let's do this 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.380
 collection 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.680
 and after a while I saw here 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.420
 such is the report in the text version 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.820
 which is presented very understandable 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.600
 language and formed using scripts 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.570
 powershell 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.520
 what can we learn from this report 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.220
 system booted in a hundred and two seconds 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.260
 that is, this time is rounded large 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.150
 side including profile for one 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.160
 you can also see what has been done 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.230
 analysis of the last three reboots and 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.870
 average time is seventy 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.640
 four seconds is a very good time 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.340
 from the appearance of the desktop to his 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.140
 total readiness for work amounted to 69 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.840
 seconds that is to these sixty nine 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.810
 seconds these 12 were loaded here 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.940
 programs from startup by disabling one 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.100
 of these programs or all of them or 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.760
 only you do not need you can reduce 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.860
 this time is pretty and significant 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.200
 the superfetch service has auto start type 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.390
 and this service is currently running 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.550
 is engaged in collecting information about 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.040
 Last uploaded files moment 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.530
 boot system and determines which of 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.560
 they were influenced by speeds which are not after 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.170
 this, it passes them to the readyboost function. 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.330
 which caches them into RAM 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.640
 and the next time you boot 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.920
 from there it loads them 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.660
 speeds up system loading if 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.020
 service off then program 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.250
 automatically or manually offer you 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.110
 turn it on 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.150
 and then you will see the result when 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.160
 next turn on the computer and so 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.989
 further we see that the service scheduler 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.940
 tasks has the type of startup cars and 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.360
 the moment is running and she is in her 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.850
 queue affects the start of defragmentation 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.100
 the disk that is if the last analysis 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.110
 hard drive which is produced 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.990
 automatically the system found it necessary 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.450
 defragment she adds 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.980
 new task in the scheduler and then without 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.169
 user intervention will 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.630
 pass just the same defragmentation 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.120
 This process can not be carried out on ssd 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.100
 disks though it is pretty controversial but 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.800
 I think that all the same is not necessary therefore 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.930
 if you have an ssd disk you can skip 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.390
 this item also in this report can 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.310
 see what the disk optimizer is doing 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.470
 boot file optimization 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.570
 if not, then the script will prompt you 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.180
 correct this defect and here we can 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.740
 see 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.280
 disk space which is installed 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.669
 the system in this case is free here 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:15.180
 34 and 25 percent if that number were 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.880
 less than 15 percent then defragmentation 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.330
 disk in the panel would not be effective because 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.070
 what 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.770
 developers stated that 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.380
 defragmentation is successful if 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.210
 free 15 percent or more of this 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.490
 due to the fact that it is impossible to effectively 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.590
 transfer data also in the report we can 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.610
 see the type of operating system 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.650
 version and and processor in iron 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.690
 operative memory and so on and item about 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.590
 that the system is probably installed on 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.479
 hdd 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.840
 because random read speed 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:49.199
 is 1 and 27 megabytes per second 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.810
 The main difference between hdd and ssd 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:54.360
 is that their children have 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.280
 moving parts and in order to 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.440
 get information from this disk 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.020
 the read head should hit 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.820
 exactly where the right one is written 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.280
 Information about ssd 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.770
 doesn't use moving parts there 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.440
 apply the principle as on a flash card then 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.419
 have all the information recorded by the IC 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.820
 memory and therefore read and write 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:17.370
 going much faster and now you 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.409
 be able to compare this report with that 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.050
 which I will spend on my computer 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:24.120
 where ssd drive is installed and on the left you 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.460
 can see this report compare 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.000
 highlights the system has booted for 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.190
 35 seconds to ssd-disks that almost 70 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.080
 seconds faster than hdd 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.130
 time of full readiness for work 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.659
 made 23 seconds she hdd 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.419
 69 and on my computer 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:44.190
 set to startup 24 programs 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:46.259
 and on laptop 12 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.539
 and despite the fact that they are more computer 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:51.419
 loaded them faster you can still notice 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:54.570
 what's on the computer among the disk service 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:56.699
 superfetch has a manual startup type and 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.830
 currently stopped and also 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:01.409
 disabled caching is disabled 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:04.080
 the readyboost function has disabled this service 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:05.909
 I did not do everything myself windows system 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.639
 since she determined that I have 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:10.979
 installed ssd drive for all 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:13.740
 the rest of the points are practically 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:16.169
 No, well, except for natural interest 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.330
 free space iron 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:20.669
 and random read speeds so 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.550
 see for yourself how much faster 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:25.590
 the system boots to ssd and he acts 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.900
 carriage has a better idea of 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:30.300
 how windows is loaded and how 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.490
 speed up this process but much remains 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.599
 behind the scenes if you are interested in the details 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.150
 about 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:38.729
 system kernel initialization and so on 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:41.069
 what files are immersed in the screen stage 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:42.629
 with windows logo then write in 

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:45.569
 comments what you want to know about 

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:49.460
 This is more detailed and then I will shoot a video about 

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:49.460
 thanks for watching this bye
