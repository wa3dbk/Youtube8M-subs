00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 a company appeared in the Russian army where 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.930
 the service is not so dangerous as difficult 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.400
 the soldiers past the toughest selection and 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.990
 special training will entrust 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.540
 control unmanned aircraft 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.070
 prior to this, vehicles were serviced 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.350
 invited civilians only 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.970
 specialists are now fighters new 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.740
 unmanned mouths and work out 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.100
 acquired knowledge in the sky above Altai 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.840
 Alex Hamza then that seen from above 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.000
 weigh several kilograms are placed in 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.349
 small suitcase and resemble creation 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.480
 circle of young technicians 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.579
 have tactical drone series of grenades 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.770
 harmless appearance but first 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.360
 impression deceptive body kilo paradise 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.370
 coated with an oxide resin therefore on 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.260
 radar it does not display the engine 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.239
 electric works so quietly that in 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.370
 the device is almost inaudible in the air but 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.620
 the most important equipment she is so 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.750
 modern expensive what's worth such 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.789
 a small light plane about 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.070
 like 50 cars like this 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.079
 the range of the device is almost 10 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.410
 kilometers in the air can be up to 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.239
 hours and take off if needed and at -30 this 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.550
 Before scout accounted for as they 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.170
 are expressed to open up the battle space 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.510
 move on two 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.760
 and more often crawling now the sky is not for them 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.979
 source of danger and a reliable assistant 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.350
 but at first the fighters did not believe that these 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.020
 small drones can in half an hour 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.710
 learn in the enemy's rear more than a platoon beyond 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.409
 all day 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.500
 much higher seeking excuse because 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.840
 expected new again say here 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.880
 unexplored now exploiting 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.259
 complex itself for yourself 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.119
 opened much more that is 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.350
 the possibility of the aircraft themselves 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.450
 peg and gum 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.520
 drone runs like a slingshot with 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.790
 anywhere the runway is not him 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.790
 need 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.770
 in the viewfinder camera airplane catch 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.750
 almost impossible it is as if small 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.460
 soaring bird on the line of sight 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.380
 the enemy most often not even 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.840
 suspects that he is being watched 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.869
 falcon neck i eagle 7 mind watching 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.119
 object of the enemy 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.030
 one grenade plane flies at an altitude of 270 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:08.160
 meters gas you see a tank drives like 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.570
 clearly visible even with snow it is covered 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.220
 snow tanks like guilt 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.350
 research on drone given 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.720
 high priority because they help 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.630
 save the most important life of a fighter 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.090
 scout is essentially a suicide bomber gone 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.269
 intelligence got perhaps information well done 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.850
 life left a hero star got 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.390
 there is an unmanned aerial vehicle 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.860
 leads here intelligence immediately read us 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.310
 personal electronic amplifying 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.739
 cars 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.780
 the commander owns the situation now on 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.090
 armament of the first western Siberian company 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.310
 unmanned reconnaissance three models on 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.750
 queues more sophisticated complexes in 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.040
 which not only installed the engine 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.950
 internal combustion 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.420
 but the main thing is accommodation 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.140
 weaponry so that the enemy will not 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.450
 only find 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.860
 but immediately neutralize Alexei messengers
