00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
we're gonna start this morning with a

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.860 
we're gonna start this morning with a
math<00:00:07.160> number<00:00:07.730> talk<00:00:08.000> so<00:00:08.270> first<00:00:08.540> we're<00:00:08.690> going<00:00:08.809> to

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
math number talk so first we're going to

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.539 
math number talk so first we're going to
review<00:00:09.139> our<00:00:09.380> hand<00:00:09.620> signals<00:00:10.010> for<00:00:10.100> the<00:00:10.250> number

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:10.549 
review our hand signals for the number

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.180 
review our hand signals for the number
talk<00:00:10.760> so<00:00:11.480> remember<00:00:11.930> we<00:00:12.139> are<00:00:12.170> doing<00:00:12.650> mental

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
talk so remember we are doing mental

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.070 
talk so remember we are doing mental
math<00:00:13.400> so<00:00:13.820> all<00:00:14.000> of<00:00:14.180> the<00:00:14.299> our<00:00:14.449> math<00:00:14.660> is<00:00:14.690> gonna<00:00:14.990> be

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
math so all of the our math is gonna be

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.830 
math so all of the our math is gonna be
done<00:00:15.230> inside<00:00:15.680> of<00:00:15.830> our<00:00:15.949> brain<00:00:16.520> so<00:00:17.000> if<00:00:17.270> you<00:00:17.630> have

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
done inside of our brain so if you have

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.820 
done inside of our brain so if you have
your<00:00:17.960> answer<00:00:18.289> you're<00:00:18.380> going<00:00:18.440> to<00:00:18.529> put<00:00:18.710> your

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
your answer you're going to put your

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.380 
your answer you're going to put your
thumbs<00:00:19.100> up<00:00:19.310> right<00:00:19.580> on<00:00:19.730> your<00:00:19.820> chest<00:00:20.060> you<00:00:20.210> don't

thumbs up right on your chest you don't

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.270 
thumbs up right on your chest you don't
to<00:00:20.540> raise<00:00:20.690> your<00:00:20.870> hand<00:00:21.110> just<00:00:21.590> put<00:00:21.830> a<00:00:21.860> gentle

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.280 
to raise your hand just put a gentle

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.280 
to raise your hand just put a gentle

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
thumbs up right on your chest if you

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.830 
thumbs up right on your chest if you
have<00:00:24.740> a<00:00:25.040> second<00:00:25.610> strategy<00:00:25.850> for<00:00:26.330> solving<00:00:26.510> it

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
have a second strategy for solving it

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.880 
have a second strategy for solving it
that<00:00:26.960> you're<00:00:27.080> gonna<00:00:27.170> put<00:00:27.380> your<00:00:27.500> pointer

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
that you're gonna put your pointer

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.680 
that you're gonna put your pointer
finger<00:00:28.190> out<00:00:28.340> if<00:00:28.640> you<00:00:29.060> can<00:00:29.210> even<00:00:29.360> come<00:00:29.570> up<00:00:29.600> with

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
finger out if you can even come up with

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.270 
finger out if you can even come up with
a<00:00:29.780> third<00:00:30.140> strategy<00:00:30.470> you'll<00:00:30.770> put<00:00:30.920> a<00:00:30.950> third

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:31.280 
a third strategy you'll put a third

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.130 
a third strategy you'll put a third
finger<00:00:31.610> out<00:00:31.880> you're<00:00:32.419> just<00:00:32.480> gonna<00:00:32.750> hold<00:00:32.960> your

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
finger out you're just gonna hold your

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.899 
finger out you're just gonna hold your
hand<00:00:33.200> signal<00:00:33.770> here<00:00:34.070> so<00:00:34.250> I<00:00:34.280> know<00:00:34.460> that<00:00:34.789> you're

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:34.909 
hand signal here so I know that you're

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.000 
hand signal here so I know that you're
finished<00:00:35.300> that<00:00:35.449> you<00:00:35.539> have<00:00:35.719> an<00:00:35.839> answer<00:00:36.199> and<00:00:36.499> so

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
finished that you have an answer and so

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.619 
finished that you have an answer and so
if<00:00:37.100> you<00:00:37.190> get<00:00:37.309> your<00:00:37.370> one<00:00:37.640> answer<00:00:37.940> keep<00:00:38.179> thinking

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
if you get your one answer keep thinking

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.239 
if you get your one answer keep thinking
if<00:00:38.839> you<00:00:38.960> can<00:00:39.109> solve<00:00:39.320> it<00:00:39.530> a<00:00:39.589> different<00:00:40.070> way<00:00:40.100> but

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:40.249 
if you can solve it a different way but

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:42.340 
if you can solve it a different way but
we're<00:00:40.519> going<00:00:40.640> practicing<00:00:41.300> how<00:00:41.870> we<00:00:41.929> can<00:00:42.140> solve

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
we're going practicing how we can solve

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.860 
we're going practicing how we can solve
these<00:00:42.679> problems<00:00:43.190> using<00:00:43.460> our<00:00:43.909> brain<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:44.690> on

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
these problems using our brain and so on

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.090 
these problems using our brain and so on
all<00:00:45.199> right<00:00:45.350> so<00:00:45.499> we're<00:00:45.620> going<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:45.769> do<00:00:45.890> two

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
all right so we're going to do two

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.100 
248 all right any different answers all
right<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:28.179> it<00:01:28.270> looks<00:01:28.299> like<00:01:28.570> we<00:01:28.689> all<00:01:28.840> agreed

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
right so it looks like we all agreed

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.859 
right so it looks like we all agreed
that<00:01:29.140> 248<00:01:30.130> is<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.759> answer<00:01:31.090> so<00:01:31.420> who<00:01:31.600> would<00:01:31.720> like

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
that 248 is the answer so who would like

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.560 
that 248 is the answer so who would like
to<00:01:31.899> tell<00:01:32.259> us<00:01:32.289> our<00:01:32.500> strategy<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.369> defend<00:01:34.270> why

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
to tell us our strategy and defend why

00:01:34.570 --> 00:02:04.880 
to tell us our strategy and defend why
248<00:01:35.439> is<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.920> correct<00:01:36.310> answer

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.649 

okay<00:02:05.890> very<00:02:06.610> good<00:02:06.789> that's<00:02:07.240> one<00:02:07.420> strategy

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
okay very good that's one strategy

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.749 
okay very good that's one strategy
definitely<00:02:08.410> did<00:02:08.799> anyone<00:02:09.039> else<00:02:09.190> do<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:09.519> same

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
definitely did anyone else do that same

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.820 
definitely did anyone else do that same
strategy<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:10.959> couple<00:02:11.200> other<00:02:11.349> people<00:02:11.560> got

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
strategy so a couple other people got

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.289 
strategy so a couple other people got
their<00:02:12.010> answer<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.459> way<00:02:12.640> different

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
their answer that way different

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.759 
their answer that way different
strategies<00:02:13.750> James<00:02:14.019> would<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.320> give<00:02:14.440> them<00:02:14.530> um

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
strategies James would you give them um

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.430 
strategies James would you give them um
so<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.640> just<00:02:15.970> imagined<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.600> it<00:02:16.780> was<00:02:16.840> just<00:02:17.109> two

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
so I just imagined that it was just two

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:31.380 
so I just imagined that it was just two
times<00:02:17.680> twenty<00:02:18.160> four<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:19.329> got<00:02:19.630> four<00:02:19.900> okay<00:02:30.390> one

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
times twenty four and got four okay one

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:40.220 
times twenty four and got four okay one
hundred<00:02:31.780> or<00:02:32.049> one<00:02:32.920> is<00:02:35.670> two<00:02:36.670> hundred<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.150> then<00:02:37.810> I

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.710 

added<00:02:41.230> those<00:02:41.350> together

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
added those together

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.590 
added those together
yeah<00:02:43.720> very<00:02:44.109> good<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:44.709> since<00:02:45.250> 24<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.060> it's<00:02:46.420> a

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
yeah very good so since 24 is it's a

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.330 
yeah very good so since 24 is it's a
pretty<00:02:46.810> friendly<00:02:47.260> number<00:02:47.620> we<00:02:47.769> can<00:02:47.980> think<00:02:48.160> of

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
pretty friendly number we can think of

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.580 
pretty friendly number we can think of
how<00:02:49.120> we<00:02:49.180> could<00:02:49.359> easily<00:02:49.600> double<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.470> get

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
how we could easily double that and get

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.410 
how we could easily double that and get
48<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.340> was<00:02:51.489> definitely<00:02:51.639> another<00:02:52.150> great

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
48 so that was definitely another great

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.190 
48 so that was definitely another great
strategy<00:02:53.230> for<00:02:53.260> solving<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:53.950> problem<00:02:55.200> all

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
strategy for solving the problem all

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.900 
strategy for solving the problem all
right<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:56.650> here<00:02:56.859> are<00:02:56.889> two<00:02:57.130> great<00:02:57.370> ways<00:02:57.549> that<00:02:57.819> we

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
right so here are two great ways that we

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.030 
right so here are two great ways that we
can<00:02:58.120> solve<00:02:58.840> this<00:02:58.989> from<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.380> answer<00:02:59.650> so<00:02:59.859> great

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
can solve this from the answer so great

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.570 
can solve this from the answer so great
job<00:03:00.250> let's<00:03:00.459> do<00:03:00.670> one<00:03:01.000> more

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.250 

that's<00:03:06.970> one<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.240> their<00:03:07.360> strategies<00:03:07.990> for

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
that's one of their strategies for

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:33.720 
that's one of their strategies for
sobbing<00:03:08.560> about<00:03:08.830> biology<00:03:32.550> okay

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
sobbing about biology okay

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.410 
sobbing about biology okay
all<00:03:33.910> right<00:03:34.090> very<00:03:34.480> good<00:03:35.200> a<00:03:35.230> different<00:03:36.070> strategy

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
all right very good a different strategy

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:48.500 
all right very good a different strategy
Francie<00:03:37.420> was<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.630> know<00:03:37.780> who<00:03:38.140> I<00:03:38.620> do<00:03:41.700> not<00:03:43.110> some

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:57.540 

okay

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.040 

400<00:03:58.550> here<00:03:58.580> and<00:03:59.150> then<00:03:59.270> you<00:03:59.360> added<00:03:59.540> those<00:03:59.840> two

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
400 here and then you added those two

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.630 
400 here and then you added those two
numbers<00:04:00.410> and<00:04:00.710> you<00:04:00.830> gotta<00:04:01.010> for<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:01.460> beta

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
numbers and you gotta for that beta

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.410 
numbers and you gotta for that beta
separately

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
separately

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.330 
separately
all<00:04:02.660> right<00:04:02.780> great<00:04:03.140> another<00:04:03.470> great<00:04:03.710> two<00:04:03.860> anyway

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
all right great another great two anyway

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.180 
all right great another great two anyway
great<00:04:04.820> any<00:04:05.360> different<00:04:05.870> strategies<00:04:06.500> Alexi

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
great any different strategies Alexi

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:17.500 
great any different strategies Alexi
would<00:04:07.340> you<00:04:07.490> do<00:04:13.300> 230<00:04:14.920> okay<00:04:15.920> H<00:04:15.980> would<00:04:16.310> be<00:04:16.510> some

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
would you do 230 okay H would be some

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:27.030 
would you do 230 okay H would be some
two<00:04:17.720> times

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.830 

okay<00:04:28.040> yeah<00:04:28.310> very<00:04:28.670> good<00:04:28.790> another<00:04:29.330> great<00:04:29.660> way<00:04:29.810> to

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
okay yeah very good another great way to

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.680 
okay yeah very good another great way to
solve<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:31.160> problem<00:04:31.550> great<00:04:32.150> so<00:04:32.300> we<00:04:32.420> have<00:04:32.510> three

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
solve the problem great so we have three

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.990 
solve the problem great so we have three
different<00:04:32.780> strategies<00:04:33.440> here<00:04:33.830> did<00:04:34.430> anyone<00:04:34.730> see

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
different strategies here did anyone see

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.490 
different strategies here did anyone see
us<00:04:35.030> try<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.270> do<00:04:35.450> that<00:04:35.570> they<00:04:35.780> saw<00:04:36.080> than<00:04:36.350> they<00:04:36.440> did

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
us try to do that they saw than they did

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.470 
us try to do that they saw than they did
in<00:04:36.680> their<00:04:36.890> mind<00:04:37.100> as<00:04:37.280> well<00:04:37.490> yes<00:04:37.970> we<00:04:38.180> have<00:04:38.270> some

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
in their mind as well yes we have some

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.570 
in their mind as well yes we have some
people<00:04:38.630> agree<00:04:38.990> so<00:04:39.350> again<00:04:39.950> we<00:04:40.100> can<00:04:40.190> look<00:04:40.250> at<00:04:40.460> our

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
people agree so again we can look at our

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.430 
people agree so again we can look at our
strategy<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.210> see<00:04:41.390> people<00:04:41.780> are<00:04:41.840> just<00:04:42.050> doing<00:04:42.230> a

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
strategy and see people are just doing a

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.100 
strategy and see people are just doing a
couple<00:04:42.800> steps<00:04:43.010> to<00:04:43.310> get<00:04:43.430> their<00:04:43.640> answer<00:04:43.970> so<00:04:44.300> and

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
couple steps to get their answer so and

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.600 
couple steps to get their answer so and
we're<00:04:45.230> using<00:04:45.410> some<00:04:45.770> different<00:04:45.920> strategies

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
we're using some different strategies

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.220 
we're using some different strategies
what<00:04:47.120> would<00:04:47.210> we<00:04:47.300> call<00:04:47.330> this<00:04:47.750> strategy<00:04:48.200> that

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
what would we call this strategy that

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.780 
what would we call this strategy that
people<00:04:48.470> are<00:04:48.680> doing<00:04:48.830> in<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.130> remaining<00:04:49.430> is

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
people are doing in the remaining is

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.250 
people are doing in the remaining is
sure<00:04:49.970> remind<00:04:50.270> you<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:50.510> a<00:04:50.540> strategy<00:04:50.930> that<00:04:50.960> leads

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
sure remind you of a strategy that leads

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:58.060 
sure remind you of a strategy that leads
anytime<00:04:51.560> to<00:04:51.680> do<00:04:51.770> a<00:04:51.800> paper<00:04:56.680> its<00:04:57.680> bullets

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
anytime to do a paper its bullets

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.830 
anytime to do a paper its bullets
breaking<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.610> pieces<00:04:58.850> up<00:04:59.240> but<00:04:59.600> what<00:04:59.750> do<00:04:59.810> we

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
breaking the pieces up but what do we

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.160 
breaking the pieces up but what do we
call<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.170> do<00:05:00.440> you<00:05:00.500> remember<00:05:00.560> we<00:05:00.860> call<00:05:01.100> it

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
call that do you remember we call it

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.960 
call that do you remember we call it
yeah<00:05:03.170> exactly<00:05:03.200> so<00:05:03.710> that's<00:05:03.950> basically<00:05:04.430> partial

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
yeah exactly so that's basically partial

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.580 
yeah exactly so that's basically partial
products<00:05:05.390> but<00:05:06.050> it<00:05:06.140> just<00:05:06.260> looks<00:05:06.470> a<00:05:06.560> little

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
products but it just looks a little

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.140 
products but it just looks a little
different<00:05:06.920> since<00:05:07.340> people<00:05:07.670> are<00:05:07.730> doing<00:05:08.000> you<00:05:08.090> in

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
different since people are doing you in

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:20.159 
different since people are doing you in
their<00:05:08.270> mind<00:05:08.480> all<00:05:08.870> right<00:05:08.930> great<00:05:09.290> job<00:05:09.320> thank<00:05:09.920> you

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.229 

you
