design<00:03:18.070> something<00:03:19.070> like<00:03:19.280> this<00:03:19.490> we<00:03:20.090> put<00:03:20.300> it

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
design something like this we put it

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:29.590 
design something like this we put it
here<00:03:24.400> now<00:03:25.400> with<00:03:25.850> this<00:03:26.030> small<00:03:26.390> box<00:03:28.209> this<00:03:29.209> small

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
here now with this small box this small

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.350 
here now with this small box this small
box<00:03:29.870> of<00:03:30.200> wood<00:03:30.590> I<00:03:30.890> made<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.610> here<00:03:31.940> hole<00:03:34.360> which

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
box of wood I made it here hole which

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.090 
box of wood I made it here hole which
diameter<00:03:36.200> is<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:37.100> same<00:03:37.430> of<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:38.269> of<00:03:39.100> the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
diameter is the same of the of the

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.160 
diameter is the same of the of the
camera<00:03:40.489> so<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.540> camera<00:03:41.989> fits<00:03:42.380> here<00:03:43.900> very<00:03:44.900> well

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
camera so the camera fits here very well

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:58.470 
camera so the camera fits here very well
and<00:03:46.630> then<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:48.140> film<00:03:48.519> comes<00:03:49.519> here<00:03:51.459> so

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.760 

you<00:03:58.959> always<00:03:59.620> put<00:03:59.890> the<00:03:59.920> film<00:04:00.280> like<00:04:00.520> this

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
you always put the film like this

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:12.470 
you always put the film like this
passing<00:04:02.770> here<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:06.720> passing<00:04:08.220> also<00:04:09.220> healed

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.300 

well<00:04:14.489> Tamron<00:04:15.489> a<00:04:15.700> fall<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.810> let<00:04:17.350> us<00:04:17.380> put<00:04:17.799> first

well Tamron a fall so let us put first

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:33.860 
well Tamron a fall so let us put first
food<00:04:22.889> so<00:04:27.450> here<00:04:28.450> is<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.780> film

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:45.050 

and<00:04:34.870> now<00:04:37.470> lights<00:04:38.470> on<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.660> camera<00:04:43.440> will

pitch here and you can see what you are

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.040 
pitch here and you can see what you are
going<00:04:51.250> to<00:04:51.460> photograph<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.480> camera<00:04:52.780> let<00:04:52.870> me

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
going to photograph the camera let me

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.240 
going to photograph the camera let me
deposit<00:04:53.470> another<00:04:54.310> position<00:04:55.000> this<00:04:55.900> position

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
deposit another position this position

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.050 
deposit another position this position
for<00:04:57.250> instance<00:04:58.200> maybe<00:04:59.200> better<00:04:59.610> you<00:05:00.610> can<00:05:00.850> see

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
for instance maybe better you can see

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:16.020 
for instance maybe better you can see
what<00:05:01.390> you<00:05:01.810> are<00:05:02.080> going<00:05:02.500> to<00:05:02.770> photograph

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.250 

see

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.500 

and<00:05:19.380> then<00:05:20.040> let<00:05:20.580> us<00:05:20.610> take<00:05:21.000> a<00:05:21.270> picture<00:05:22.010> of<00:05:23.510> the

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
and then let us take a picture of the

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:36.300 
and then let us take a picture of the
negative

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.420 

you<00:05:37.310> see<00:05:37.550> its<00:05:37.849> focus<00:05:38.860> out<00:05:39.860> of<00:05:40.220> focus<00:05:40.460> and<00:05:40.960> then
