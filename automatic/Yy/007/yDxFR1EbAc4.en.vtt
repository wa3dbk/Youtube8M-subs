solitude I'll show you where that is

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.740 
solitude I'll show you where that is
later<00:00:45.680> on<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:45.980> video<00:00:46.250> but<00:00:46.690> there's<00:00:47.690> a

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
later on the video but there's a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.150 
later on the video but there's a
question<00:00:48.200> where<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:48.440> just<00:00:48.739> need<00:00:48.860> to<00:00:48.980> go<00:00:49.070> out

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
question where you just need to go out

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.610 
question where you just need to go out
and<00:00:49.220> kill<00:00:49.670> some<00:00:49.940> bandits<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.600> it<00:00:51.350> gives<00:00:51.500> you<00:00:51.590> a

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
and kill some bandits and it gives you a

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.380 
and kill some bandits and it gives you a
thousand<00:00:52.040> five<00:00:52.160> hundred<00:00:52.340> gold<00:00:52.640> so<00:00:52.969> I<00:00:53.180> think

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
thousand five hundred gold so I think

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.910 
thousand five hundred gold so I think
it's<00:00:53.630> pretty<00:00:53.719> worth<00:00:54.020> it<00:00:54.200> it's<00:00:54.350> pretty<00:00:54.559> easy<00:00:54.620> to

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
it's pretty worth it it's pretty easy to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.410 
it's pretty worth it it's pretty easy to
do<00:00:56.290> is<00:00:57.290> I<00:00:57.350> think<00:00:57.739> it's<00:00:57.829> unlike<00:00:58.160> Broken<00:00:58.760> Bow

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
do is I think it's unlike Broken Bow

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.440 
do is I think it's unlike Broken Bow
grotto<00:01:00.079> something<00:01:00.620> like<00:01:00.710> that<00:01:01.000> really<00:01:02.000> easy

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
grotto something like that really easy

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.330 
grotto something like that really easy
place<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:02.809> score<00:01:03.800> a<00:01:03.860> couple<00:01:03.950> thousand<00:01:04.460> gold

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
place to score a couple thousand gold

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.790 
place to score a couple thousand gold
and<00:01:07.340> after<00:01:07.640> that<00:01:07.820> it's<00:01:08.149> just<00:01:08.180> a<00:01:08.390> matter<00:01:08.600> of

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
and after that it's just a matter of

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.760 
and after that it's just a matter of
getting<00:01:09.800> your<00:01:10.100> gold<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.670> either<00:01:11.240> just

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
getting your gold and either just

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.620 
getting your gold and either just

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
somehow silently killing him and with

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.779 
somehow silently killing him and with
that<00:01:18.200> way<00:01:18.410> you<00:01:18.470> can<00:01:18.770> just<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.280> know<00:01:19.310> take<00:01:19.640> his

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
that way you can just you know take his

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.150 
that way you can just you know take his
action<00:01:20.410> that's<00:01:21.410> about<00:01:21.740> it

action that's about it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.630 
action that's about it
so<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:23.000> mean<00:01:23.330> it's<00:01:24.229> pretty<00:01:24.560> self-explanatory<00:01:24.890> I

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
so I mean it's pretty self-explanatory I

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.580 
so I mean it's pretty self-explanatory I
mean<00:01:25.970> I<00:01:26.000> just<00:01:26.179> did<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.750> side<00:01:26.959> quest<00:01:27.259> just<00:01:27.500> to

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
mean I just did the side quest just to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.410 
mean I just did the side quest just to
get<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.860> thousand<00:01:28.340> five<00:01:28.520> hundred<00:01:28.700> gold<00:01:29.060> you

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.070 
get the thousand five hundred gold you
don't<00:01:29.569> have<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:30.110> do<00:01:30.289> it<00:01:31.450> all<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:32.509> it<00:01:32.750> should<00:01:32.959> be

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
don't have to do it all so it should be

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.580 
don't have to do it all so it should be
noted<00:01:33.440> that<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:33.979> can't<00:01:34.399> do<00:01:34.959> what<00:01:35.959> quest<00:01:36.289> was

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
noted that you can't do what quest was

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.400 
noted that you can't do what quest was
it<00:01:36.770> was<00:01:37.069> something<00:01:37.310> I<00:01:37.910> think<00:01:38.720> it's<00:01:38.810> lights<00:01:39.170> out

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
it was something I think it's lights out

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.150 
it was something I think it's lights out
I<00:01:39.800> think<00:01:40.429> that's<00:01:41.030> what<00:01:41.209> the<00:01:41.300> quest<00:01:41.569> was<00:01:42.160> you

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
I think that's what the quest was you

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.190 
I think that's what the quest was you
know<00:01:43.250> look<00:01:43.640> it<00:01:43.729> up<00:01:43.849> here<00:01:44.090> yeah<00:01:44.300> lights<00:01:44.599> out<00:01:44.780> by

know look it up here yeah lights out by

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.449 
know look it up here yeah lights out by
jury<00:01:46.009> rah<00:01:46.550> he's<00:01:46.910> an<00:01:47.030> Argonian<00:01:48.069> you<00:01:49.069> can't

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
jury rah he's an Argonian you can't

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.580 
jury rah he's an Argonian you can't
either<00:01:49.910> be<00:01:50.330> doing<00:01:50.690> that<00:01:50.869> quest<00:01:51.200> or<00:01:51.380> have

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
either be doing that quest or have

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.850 
either be doing that quest or have
completed<00:01:52.039> it<00:01:52.300> to<00:01:53.300> do<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:53.690> quest<00:01:54.080> but<00:01:54.530> that

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
completed it to do this quest but that

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.570 
completed it to do this quest but that
doesn't<00:01:55.280> mean<00:01:55.459> that<00:01:55.489> you<00:01:56.030> can't<00:01:56.450> get<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:56.959> X

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
doesn't mean that you can't get the X

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.940 
doesn't mean that you can't get the X
it's<00:01:58.580> only<00:01:59.000> you're<00:01:59.810> not<00:01:59.840> allowed<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.619> do<00:02:00.770> this

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
it's only you're not allowed to do this

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.740 
it's only you're not allowed to do this
quest<00:02:01.310> if<00:02:01.550> you've<00:02:01.729> already<00:02:01.970> done<00:02:02.239> lights<00:02:02.539> out

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
quest if you've already done lights out

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.010 
quest if you've already done lights out
so<00:02:03.310> if<00:02:04.310> you've<00:02:04.819> done<00:02:04.970> that<00:02:05.209> quest<00:02:05.569> you<00:02:05.780> can't

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
so if you've done that quest you can't

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.080 
so if you've done that quest you can't
do<00:02:06.170> this<00:02:06.349> one<00:02:06.560> if<00:02:06.709> you<00:02:06.830> haven't<00:02:07.310> already<00:02:07.489> then

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.630 
do this one if you haven't already then
I<00:02:08.390> would<00:02:08.720> suggest<00:02:09.140> doing<00:02:09.440> this<00:02:09.679> one<00:02:10.009> first<00:02:10.369> and

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
I would suggest doing this one first and

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.420 
I would suggest doing this one first and
then<00:02:10.729> doing<00:02:11.720> lights<00:02:12.020> out<00:02:12.260> but<00:02:12.680> I'm<00:02:12.980> not<00:02:13.190> sure

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
then doing lights out but I'm not sure

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.920 
then doing lights out but I'm not sure
if<00:02:13.550> there's<00:02:13.730> any<00:02:13.790> restrictions<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:14.720> that

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
if there's any restrictions on that

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.970 
if there's any restrictions on that
quest<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:17.050> yeah<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.260> would<00:02:18.349> have<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.650> look<00:02:18.800> into

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
quest so yeah it would have to look into

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.330 
quest so yeah it would have to look into
that<00:02:19.130> more<00:02:19.520> if<00:02:19.849> you<00:02:20.840> cannot<00:02:21.560> do<00:02:21.769> lights<00:02:22.010> out<00:02:22.189> if

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
that more if you cannot do lights out if

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.390 
that more if you cannot do lights out if
you<00:02:22.459> do<00:02:22.579> this<00:02:22.790> quest

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
you do this quest

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.940 
you do this quest
but<00:02:24.610> after<00:02:25.209> you<00:02:25.360> do<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:26.079> find<00:02:26.560> them<00:02:26.709> again

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
but after you do this find them again

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.059 
but after you do this find them again
and<00:02:27.510> tell<00:02:28.510> them<00:02:28.629> that<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:29.650> know<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.860> jobs

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
and tell them that you know the jobs

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.890 
and tell them that you know the jobs
been<00:02:30.220> done<00:02:30.430> he'll<00:02:30.670> give<00:02:30.849> you<00:02:30.909> your<00:02:31.030> gold<00:02:31.269> at

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
an enchanting table and I put some fire

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
it so that it can be a little bit better

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.219

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:08.229 
than it is already because it is a

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.020
