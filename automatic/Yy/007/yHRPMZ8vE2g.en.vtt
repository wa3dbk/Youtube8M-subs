famous Instagram makeup artist right and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.729 
famous Instagram makeup artist right and
you<00:02:05.340> know<00:02:05.369> her<00:02:06.149> craft<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.990> her<00:02:07.320> her<00:02:08.300> photos

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
her look all of the things that has a

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.760 
her look all of the things that has a
weird<00:02:12.569> photo<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.410> mean

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
weird photo but I mean

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.530 
weird photo but I mean
the<00:02:14.070> value<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.700> guess<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.270> not<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
the value of that I guess is not the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.000 
the value of that I guess is not the
Instagram<00:02:15.960> border<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> photo<00:02:16.830> itself

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
Instagram border it's the photo itself

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.490 
Instagram border it's the photo itself
and<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:18.000> think<00:02:18.240> that<00:02:18.390> too<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.990> profit<00:02:19.380> off<00:02:19.440> of

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
and I think that too to profit off of

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.070 
and I think that too to profit off of
something<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.890> obviously<00:02:20.100> for<00:02:20.520> her<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.820> a

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
something that obviously for her is a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.990 
something that obviously for her is a
maybe<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.200> lifetime<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:22.980> work<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.640> think<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:23.970> is

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
maybe a lifetime of work I think it is

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.540 
maybe a lifetime of work I think it is
it<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.720> negative<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:25.320> also<00:02:25.650> think<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.950> sucks<00:02:26.250> I

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
it is negative I also think it sucks I

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.220 
it is negative I also think it sucks I
think<00:02:26.940> it's<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.210> like<00:02:27.360> if<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:27.960> is<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.890 
feel like they come up with things that
are<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:57.020> like<00:02:58.550> simplistic<00:02:59.550> like<00:03:00.120> utterly

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
are so like simplistic like utterly

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.900 
are so like simplistic like utterly
simplistic<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.800> they<00:03:01.950> make<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:02.550> much<00:03:02.730> money

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
simplistic and they make so much money

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.120 
simplistic and they make so much money
off<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.540> also<00:03:03.720> how<00:03:04.140> do<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.380> value<00:03:04.680> art

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
off of it and also how do you value art

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.280 
off of it and also how do you value art
like<00:03:05.760> how<00:03:05.970> do<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.120> decide<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.780> something<00:03:06.990> is

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
like how do you decide that something is

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.870 
like how do you decide that something is
worth<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.650> hundred<00:03:07.800> thousand<00:03:08.370> dollars<00:03:08.400> i

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
worth a hundred thousand dollars i

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.190 
worth a hundred thousand dollars i
wouldn't<00:03:09.270> pay<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.390> hundred<00:03:09.540> thousand<00:03:09.990> dollars

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
but probably because i don't have a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.350 
but probably because i don't have a
hundred<00:03:11.370> thousand<00:03:11.730> dollars<00:03:11.760> like<00:03:12.030> even<00:03:12.270> if
