00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.300
 hi i am physical and it is monday and welcome 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.880
 a field in I know that last week 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.470
 neither did your video realize that 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.510
 go up a week if a week does not 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.920
 weeks and that's not good but I had 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.780
 some little problems that I will not tell 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.560
 and it really was impossible for me to upload 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:33.270
 cervoles videos but today I have returned as 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.270
 you see bryant keeps uploading videos 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.690
 do not ask me why others do not 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.309
 usually videos they have their accounts 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.500
 of twitter and they are all asking 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.750
 them because I 'm not the one to give 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.780
 explanations with others good today 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.489
 I bring a subject a bit serious and it's how 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.710
 beat your ex 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.110
 I do not know if I'm the best person 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.629
 to talk about this topic because no 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.729
 I'm very good at beating things so if 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.500
 you are going through a process of rupture 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.629
 I hope to cheer you up a little bit the day and 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.369
 in three councils they serve you as something 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.830
 first that when you cut with a 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:13.750
 person is very hard obviously but there 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.789
 that know how to focus things, know how 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.560
 take them and do not drink or have 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.690
 cut as you're going to lose this 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.030
 person try to be happy for everything 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.220
 what happened to this person and if I know 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.590
 that remembering happy moments is not 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.690
 precisely what will encourage you the most 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.640
 in these moments but someday it will 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.069
 and the process that you have to go through now 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.229
 it is necessary so that one day he remembers 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.400
 is that person some affection and not with 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.710
 sadness 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.690
 what you feel now couples see us 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.730
 for thousands and thousands and thousands of reasons 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.740
 different some because they stop 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.000
 love each other because if they want but not 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.270
 It can 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.820
 others for infidelities distance 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.320
 millions of things and evidently every 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.570
 case is different but something that you should not 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.300
 do or be things that you should do for 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.060
 example are trying to distract from a lot 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.310
 take this time to be with you 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.830
 same because there is no better company to 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.410
 times that you go out with your friends 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.060
 if you do not want to be alone because I'm 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.730
 sure that your friends are going to be there 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.490
 when you need them most or you take this 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.490
 time to learn new things 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.310
 I do not know how to travel or discover new hobbies 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.210
 start that puzzle of a thousand pieces that 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.040
 you have there that you have never started or 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.560
 paint a picture read a book that you 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.300
 I want a lot now obviously 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.810
 You have much more time than 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.270
 you had before so do not pass them 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.950
 all day in bed crying or in the 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.410
 computer watching your photos of 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.470
 your videos or reading your letters 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.480
 old are not you try to distract yourself 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.600
 spend time with yourself another of the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.520
 things that I usually recommend is 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.100
 try to count cut the contact to 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.950
 less for a while is fine 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.920
 that of being friends with your ex in fact a 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.319
 of my best friends because it's my ex 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.040
 and even pointed it as excel and 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:19.670
 story as a friend and already but still 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.830
 it is not advisable to just cut and 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.200
 try to maintain a friendship because 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.819
 well you will not get over it you never need 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.430
 Take time for yourself to 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.280
 assimilate the situation without realizing 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.110
 that is not so bad because when a 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.000
 door closes means that another one is 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.190
 will open and maybe it will not open 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.200
 here a month or two months but neither 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.150
 you need it because now you have time 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.480
 to go out with your friends and do things 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.610
 and distract yourself and do not try to search 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.519
 new love do not be afraid of the 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.940
 loneliness because the more you look for it 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.860
 unless you find it and never be very 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.360
 closed mind thinking 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.100
 I do not like this person 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.290
 physically so I'm not going to like it 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.880
 nothing inside him because sometimes he 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.980
 you least expect can become 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.110
 the love of your life I'm not telling you 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.030
 that you simply forget your ex and already 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.140
 Put to find another person relax 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.140
 breathe with me 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.430
 they think that now if you are alone or alone 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.979
 but you are free you are also free of 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.320
 do what you want to leave when 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.960
 want to go with your friends to where 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.130
 want and do the things that you 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.810
 fancy 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.550
 all give you this opportunity to 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.180
 meet new people to discover you 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.620
 yourself 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.919
 the things you have to know look at them with 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.550
 black perspective and half full and half 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.169
 low 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.750
 good to hope we have encouraged a bit with 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:45.020

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.729

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:56.030
 I always try to help you though sometimes 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.910
 do not upload videos with circumstances because 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.510
 I also have life and I have exams 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.910
