00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.730
 new astra 40 headphones which are quite 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.680
 not like the ones I had 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:24.240
 earlier but what unpack 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.740
 Astra company can be delivered safely 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.680
 the top five for a very stylish and high-quality 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.480
 Design 1 puppies that this headphone to 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.000
 the reason the stealth pilot because of these 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.800
 cut elements first on that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.570
 I want to pay attention this is what 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.820
 The headphone case is made of matte and 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.860
 gloss plastic weight headphones 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.230
 weighs only 320 grams despite them 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.860
 volume is a huge plus with long 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.050
 using 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.640
 if you take headphones for new they are not 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.570
 will break because it turns on 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.890
 90 degrees and part-time design 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.170
 I will note that he you shura made not from 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.899
 synthetic rubber means summer will 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.910
 not so hot but in winter the microphone is warm 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.070
 these headphones are rubberized and take 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.940
 almost any shape which is very convenient 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.369
 and very flexible 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.920
 it can be lifted and connected to another 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.150
 ear for this will have to remove removable 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.060
 nozzles which is mounted on four 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.390
 magnets and swap them in order 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.630
 to connect the headset to the opposite 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.009
 the side is this very way 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.630
 convenient that these headphones can 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.200
 connect wire for convenience 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.909
 carrying 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.680
 there is also a special regulator 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.090
 the volume is really not clear why u 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.900
 two-sided as a high probability 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.329
 what 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.860
 the volume will change randomly itself also 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.659
 of the microphone on / off button 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.829
 Headphones adjusted when very 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.960
 small so for a very big head 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.740
 hard to convey how not convenient 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.110
 sit on the head 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.520
 To be honest they do not shoot and even their 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.880
 can be used as headphones for 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.220
 playstation 3 4 and xbox one 360 magic 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.920
 also for the usual bo3 player it does 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.450
 their very versatile 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.009
 also liked very flexible 1 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.899
 a very correct microphone 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.340
 convenient to communicate on the Internet and for 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.649
 commentator or streamer and this is very 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.689
 important sale 40 available in different 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.070
 trim levels and color at the time of recording 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.590
 review and cost is 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.319
 approximately 10,000 rubles but in full 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.740

 Come think they are worth it 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.540
 In general, I really liked the headphones and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.370
