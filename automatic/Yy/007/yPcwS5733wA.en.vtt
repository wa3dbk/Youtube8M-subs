we'll<00:02:52.310> go<00:02:52.520> to<00:02:56.200> probably<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.380> part<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:58.040> most

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
we'll go to probably the part that most

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.580 
we'll go to probably the part that most
people<00:02:58.910> are<00:02:59.000> excited<00:02:59.300> for<00:02:59.480> which<00:02:59.900> is<00:03:00.080> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
people are excited for which is the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:08.199 
people are excited for which is the
Wi-Fi<00:03:01.340> connection<00:03:04.090> no<00:03:05.090> it<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:07.550> gameplay

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
Wi-Fi connection no it is the gameplay

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.240 
Wi-Fi connection no it is the gameplay
itself<00:03:08.600> is<00:03:08.810> great<00:03:09.320> and<00:03:11.709> you<00:03:12.709> know<00:03:12.739> everything

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
itself is great and you know everything

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.490 
itself is great and you know everything
holds<00:03:13.580> out<00:03:13.670> there<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.030> much<00:03:14.150> lag<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:15.350> only

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
holds out there and much lag the only

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.600 
holds out there and much lag the only
thing<00:03:15.739> is<00:03:15.890> that<00:03:15.970> takes<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.300> really<00:03:18.050> long<00:03:18.200> time

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
thing is that takes a really long time

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.580 
thing is that takes a really long time
to<00:03:19.610> find<00:03:20.090> other<00:03:20.269> players<00:03:20.600> like<00:03:21.019> at<00:03:21.380> least

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
to find other players like at least

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.880 
to find other players like at least
