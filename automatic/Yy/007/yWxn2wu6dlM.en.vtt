Jenna and today we're gonna be learning

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:37.119 
Jenna and today we're gonna be learning
how<00:00:26.850> to<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> fool<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.710> fool<00:00:28.890> looks<00:00:29.130> like

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.739 

now<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.249> looks<00:00:38.429> pretty<00:00:38.489> simple<00:00:39.059> once<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.569> get

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:39.749 
now it looks pretty simple once you get

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:41.959 
now it looks pretty simple once you get
it<00:00:39.870> down<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.229> usually<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:41.010> fairly<00:00:41.429> simple<00:00:41.699> but

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
it down it usually is fairly simple but

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.819 
it down it usually is fairly simple but
a<00:00:42.539> couple<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.109> things<00:00:43.289> we<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.679> have

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
a couple of things we have to have

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.169 
a couple of things we have to have
before<00:00:44.159> we<00:00:44.249> start<00:00:44.460> learning<00:00:44.670> before<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:45.179 
before we start learning before is the

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.539 
before we start learning before is the
front<00:00:45.420> flip<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.929> back<00:00:46.109> flip<00:00:46.350> our<00:00:46.589> first

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:47.549 
front flip and a back flip our first

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:49.039 
front flip and a back flip our first
skill<00:00:47.729> that<00:00:47.789> will<00:00:47.909> be<00:00:48.030> learning<00:00:48.209> to<00:00:48.329> get<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.049 
skill that will be learning to get the

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.590 
skill that will be learning to get the
understanding<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.679> halves<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.149> arabian

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
understanding of halves is the arabian

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.049 
understanding of halves is the arabian
so<00:00:52.409> to<00:00:52.469> learn<00:00:52.799> the<00:00:52.949> arabian<00:00:53.369> you<00:00:53.729> have<00:00:53.879> to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
so to learn the arabian you have to

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.759 
so to learn the arabian you have to
understand<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.079> back<00:00:55.229> flip<00:00:55.409> in<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.589> front

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
understand the back flip in the front

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.219 
understand the back flip in the front
flip<00:00:55.920> really<00:00:56.309> well<00:00:56.539> all<00:00:57.539> you're<00:00:57.690> gonna<00:00:57.809> do<00:00:57.989> is

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
flip really well all you're gonna do is

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:00.799 
flip really well all you're gonna do is
go<00:00:58.769> back<00:00:59.069> flip<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.819> as<00:01:00.119> you<00:01:00.359> reach<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.659> for

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
go back flip and as you reach you for

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:01.849 
go back flip and as you reach you for
the<00:01:00.899> back<00:01:01.049> flip<00:01:01.260> you're<00:01:01.409> gonna<00:01:01.499> make<00:01:01.709> your

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the back flip you're gonna make your

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.250 
the back flip you're gonna make your
arms<00:01:02.100> rainbow<00:01:02.549> over<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> top<00:01:03.059> into<00:01:03.929> the<00:01:04.049> front

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
arms rainbow over the top into the front

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.740 
arms rainbow over the top into the front
flip<00:01:04.439> we're<00:01:04.979> gonna<00:01:05.100> start<00:01:05.339> off<00:01:05.460> by<00:01:05.489> doing<00:01:05.750> flat

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
flip we're gonna start off by doing flat

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.289 
flip we're gonna start off by doing flat
backs<00:01:06.960> or<00:01:07.109> timers<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.619> we're<00:01:08.609> gonna<00:01:08.729> set<00:01:09.119> as

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
backs or timers and we're gonna set as

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.029 
backs or timers and we're gonna set as
if<00:01:09.450> we're<00:01:09.600> doing<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.899> back<00:01:09.990> flip<00:01:10.259> twist<00:01:10.710> and

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
if we're doing the back flip twist and

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:28.910 
if we're doing the back flip twist and
then<00:01:11.430> land<00:01:11.640> flat<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.000> our<00:01:12.090> backs<00:01:25.759> and<00:01:27.920> reach

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
then land flat on our backs and reach

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.260 
then land flat on our backs and reach
your<00:01:29.189> hands<00:01:32.479> like<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.880> once<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.149> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
your hands like so so once you get the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.849 
your hands like so so once you get the
concept<00:01:36.719> of<00:01:36.840> doing<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.289> couple<00:01:37.380> times

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
concept of doing that a couple times

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:39.349 
concept of doing that a couple times
then<00:01:38.100> we'll<00:01:38.189> start<00:01:38.369> pulling<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.880> arabian

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
then we'll start pulling the arabian

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.440 
then we'll start pulling the arabian
over<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> top<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:41.820> now<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.270> guys<00:01:42.390> have

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
over the top so now that you guys have

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.690 
over the top so now that you guys have
gone<00:01:42.780> through<00:01:43.109> kind<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.979> landing<00:01:44.249> flap<00:01:44.490> back

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
gone through kind of landing flap back

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.959 
gone through kind of landing flap back
or<00:01:44.999> half<00:01:45.719> turn<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.109> dive<00:01:46.259> roll<00:01:46.759> let's<00:01:47.759> start

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
or half turn to dive roll let's start

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:49.999 
or half turn to dive roll let's start
moving<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.539> arabian<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.350> arabian<00:01:49.829> is

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
moving on to the arabian the arabian is

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.739 
moving on to the arabian the arabian is
gonna<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> high<00:01:50.700> set<00:01:50.999> like<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.359> back<00:01:51.509> flip

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
gonna be a high set like the back flip

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.840 
gonna be a high set like the back flip
as<00:01:51.929> soon<00:01:52.259> as<00:01:52.439> you're<00:01:52.590> about<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> tuck<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
as soon as you're about to tuck for the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.090 
as soon as you're about to tuck for the
back<00:01:53.999> flip<00:01:54.270> you're<00:01:54.749> gonna<00:01:54.869> spot<00:01:55.409> your

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
back flip you're gonna spot your

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830 
back flip you're gonna spot your
dominant<00:01:56.670> shoulder<00:01:56.850> or<00:01:57.270> your<00:01:57.359> dominant<00:01:57.810> side

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
dominant shoulder or your dominant side

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.590 
dominant shoulder or your dominant side
and<00:01:58.259> look<00:01:59.039> into<00:01:59.249> your<00:01:59.399> armpit<00:01:59.999> and<00:02:00.119> throw<00:02:00.450> it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
and look into your armpit and throw it

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.090 
and look into your armpit and throw it
into<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.079> front<00:02:01.200> flip<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.619> your<00:02:01.770> arms<00:02:02.039> are

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
into the front flip so your arms are

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.109 
into the front flip so your arms are
literally<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.639> rainbow<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.229> turn<00:02:05.119> to

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
literally going to rainbow and turn to

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:18.990 
literally going to rainbow and turn to
the<00:02:06.240> front<00:02:06.329> leg<00:02:06.569> so<00:02:07.020> looks<00:02:07.319> like<00:02:07.469> this

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.660 

it's<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.690> high<00:02:19.960> set<00:02:20.230> like<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.500> backflip<00:02:20.920> twist

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
it's a high set like the backflip twist

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.970 
it's a high set like the backflip twist
pull<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.270> front<00:02:22.480> end<00:02:22.600> okay<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:23.620> once<00:02:23.830> you've

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
pull the front end okay so once you've

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.130 
pull the front end okay so once you've
got<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.370> understanding<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:25.060> twisting<00:02:25.900> into

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
got the understanding of twisting into

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.200 
got the understanding of twisting into
the<00:02:26.350> Arabian<00:02:26.770> then<00:02:27.520> we're<00:02:27.670> gonna<00:02:27.760> work<00:02:28.030> the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
the Arabian then we're gonna work the

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.120 
the Arabian then we're gonna work the
other<00:02:28.360> half<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.320> next<00:02:29.560> step<00:02:29.740> is<00:02:29.920> learning

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
other half so the next step is learning

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.250 
other half so the next step is learning
the<00:02:30.490> front<00:02:30.790> half<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.540> make<00:02:31.810> sure<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:32.080> have<00:02:32.230> a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the front half so make sure you have a

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:44.000 
the front half so make sure you have a
solid<00:02:32.440> front<00:02:32.710> foot<00:02:32.860> before<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.160> attempt<00:02:33.460> ease

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.550 

and<00:02:45.010> then<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.640> spot<00:02:46.120> my<00:02:46.300> soldier<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.230> want<00:02:47.470> to

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
and then I spot my soldier and I want to

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.870 
and then I spot my soldier and I want to
make<00:02:47.680> sure<00:02:47.710> that<00:02:47.980> I'm<00:02:48.070> spotting<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.580> same

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
make sure that I'm spotting the same

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.940 
make sure that I'm spotting the same
side<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.450> if<00:02:49.570> I<00:02:49.660> twisted<00:02:50.080> my<00:02:50.140> Arabian<00:02:50.710> to<00:02:50.830> my

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
side so if I twisted my Arabian to my

00:02:50.950 --> 00:03:01.550 
side so if I twisted my Arabian to my
left<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.460> want<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.030> finish<00:02:52.270> my<00:02:52.600> half<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:53.170> my<00:02:53.290> life

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.630 

work<00:03:02.560> those<00:03:02.740> for<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.010> little<00:03:03.070> bit<00:03:03.310> make<00:03:03.610> sure

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
work those for a little bit make sure

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.160 
work those for a little bit make sure
that<00:03:04.060> when<00:03:04.180> you're<00:03:04.300> going<00:03:04.450> over<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.720> top<00:03:04.930> you

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
that when you're going over the top you

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.450 
that when you're going over the top you
set<00:03:05.410> it<00:03:05.500> exactly<00:03:05.950> like<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.220> would<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.400> regular

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
set it exactly like you would a regular

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.210 
set it exactly like you would a regular
front<00:03:06.940> tuck<00:03:07.120> okay<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.320> now<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.500> we've<00:03:08.740> done

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
front tuck okay so now that we've done

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.580 
front tuck okay so now that we've done
the<00:03:09.940> Arabian<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.720> front<00:03:10.930> half<00:03:11.080> now<00:03:11.470> we're

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
the Arabian and the front half now we're

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.200 
the Arabian and the front half now we're
going<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.740> combine<00:03:11.950> them<00:03:12.310> we're<00:03:12.760> gonna<00:03:12.910> put

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
going to combine them we're gonna put

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.140 
going to combine them we're gonna put
the<00:03:13.480> Arabian<00:03:14.350> first<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.640> then<00:03:15.910> we're<00:03:16.030> gonna

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
the Arabian first and then we're gonna

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.390 
the Arabian first and then we're gonna
wait<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.660> pull<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.500> extra<00:03:17.800> half<00:03:17.950> out<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.250> it

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
wait and pull that extra half out of it

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.820 
wait and pull that extra half out of it
so<00:03:19.030> think<00:03:19.300> finish<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.810> Arabian<00:03:20.260> once<00:03:20.710> you're

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
so think finish the Arabian once you're

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.470 
so think finish the Arabian once you're
done<00:03:20.980> with<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.250> Arabian<00:03:21.670> pull<00:03:22.210> to<00:03:22.390> the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
done with the Arabian pull to the

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:38.130 
done with the Arabian pull to the
shoulder<00:03:35.370> when<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.550> hit<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.000> half<00:03:37.420> really

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
shoulder when you hit that half really

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.320 
shoulder when you hit that half really
really<00:03:38.500> pull<00:03:38.860> in<00:03:39.100> tight<00:03:39.340> once<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.090> get<00:03:40.240> the

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
really pull in tight once you get the

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.930 
really pull in tight once you get the
concept<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:41.020> finishing<00:03:41.560> half<00:03:41.920> half<00:03:42.190> then<00:03:42.910> you

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
concept of finishing half half then you

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.760 
concept of finishing half half then you
can<00:03:43.210> move<00:03:43.360> on<00:03:43.570> to<00:03:43.720> finishing<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.320> full<00:03:44.500> twist

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
can move on to finishing the full twist

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.210 
can move on to finishing the full twist
so<00:03:45.640> instead<00:03:46.240> of<00:03:46.300> doing<00:03:46.630> Arabian<00:03:47.470> half<00:03:48.010> out

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
so instead of doing Arabian half out

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.170 
so instead of doing Arabian half out
this<00:03:48.970> time<00:03:49.210> you<00:03:49.420> would<00:03:49.570> go<00:03:49.750> back<00:03:50.820> half<00:03:51.820> like

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
this time you would go back half like

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.300 
this time you would go back half like
the<00:03:52.300> Arabian<00:03:52.540> but<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:53.620> would<00:03:53.770> keep<00:03:54.100> that

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
the Arabian but you would keep that

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.220 
the Arabian but you would keep that
rotation<00:03:54.460> going<00:03:55.090> instead<00:03:55.450> of<00:03:55.540> stopping<00:03:56.080> the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
rotation going instead of stopping the

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.899 
rotation going instead of stopping the
Arabian

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.020 

all<00:04:02.909> it<00:04:03.090> is<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:04.400> wrapping<00:04:05.400> those<00:04:05.519> arms<00:04:05.849> in

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
all it is is wrapping those arms in

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.789 
all it is is wrapping those arms in
spotting<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.840> shoulder<00:04:07.200> and<00:04:07.439> just<00:04:07.530> keep

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
spotting the shoulder and just keep

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.319 
spotting the shoulder and just keep
spotting<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.250> shoulder<00:04:08.549> but<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.090> got<00:04:09.239> to

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
spotting the shoulder but you got to

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.300 
spotting the shoulder but you got to
make<00:04:09.420> sure<00:04:09.569> that<00:04:09.689> you<00:04:09.780> always<00:04:09.989> set<00:04:10.439> and<00:04:10.709> pull

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
make sure that you always set and pull
