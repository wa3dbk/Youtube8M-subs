00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.800
 next frame we have here 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.500
 so right now 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.500
 I connect the moment 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:37.630
 all that has been and will show how it is so 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:42.600
 Here we have the frame Yes that's how it was shot 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:45.430
 initially why are you correct geometry 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.720
 given the year the frame was originally like this 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.150
 Tatiana came to us 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.989
 know Che is shot well, yes it happened 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.390
 that this frame is also one of the participants 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.739
 of our club photo planet I just once 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.470
 remember this shooting is for you 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.430
 the year before last for my autumn 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.830
 group you one of the lake 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.110
 eastern tibet western tibet 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.900
 sorry and appropriate 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.620
 handle what an interesting effect 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.720
 called the crown of the buddha when the sun 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.120
 rises from the opposite side 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.740
 rises through the peaks and it is usually in 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.390
 tibet and himalayas happens on 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.250
 the opposite side of the sky arises 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.350
 like a crown of rays is very beautiful 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.350
 visual and respectively and 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.790
 accordingly, you need to get as much as possible 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.400
 bags of the main section that I do but 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.500
 raze whites highlights rise 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.090
 fire contrast is strong because there 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:50.070
 It was initially faded I increase the contrast 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.590
 reduce both black rump yes 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.770
 I need to straighten the geometry 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:01.840
 little mind in adjusting the lens 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.790
 straightening the geometry here at the author is very 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.900
 dirty sensor if you watch the video 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.869
 very many dirty spots artifacts 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.440
 climb here and accordingly it is very 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.780
 hinders therefore we fight but stained with them 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:23.590
 we remember how everything disappears 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:25.870
 but now all of our tools are either 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.489
 that same comb comb has changed 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.950
 scary stain remover which i have 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.680
 taught throughout the homework 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.490
 but in any case, I tomorrow leg 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.340
 work and made and accordingly frames 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.560
 Grandma also became a little cleaner 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.050
 hurt the sense of beauty throughout 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.910
 groups further 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.560
 the curve that i am doing i raise the contrast 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:53.250
 so that i have mostly in the dark 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.320
 the tone of the area was thicker 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.020
 gradient date of everything in principle 2 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.280
 gradient here is the first start down than 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.280
 without him here with him let's turn off Lena 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.650
 hint 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.750
 which click and so it does not interfere 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.870
 cut training again here without 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.630
 gradient mode here with a gradient in this 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.760
 Glare highlights 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.370
 Increased slightly lower average ton 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.140
 what Andrei asked when I raise 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.650
 highlights here you raise something 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.560
 stronger 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.390
 yes you can easily understand but the third hour 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.730
 I have two light sources 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.790
 differently I see the picture so it was 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.550
 top of the gradient lies here without 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.010
 him yes here with him this gradient 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.450
 lower average tone increase contrast 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.040
 raising the highlights may even be a little 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:48.510
 stronger further what else are we going to 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.140
 detail clean up the noise here you can see 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.720
 well in this specks in mali in 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.690
 The square to the noise level 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.660
 here grating this emotionally turn on 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.180
 noise and opera mini 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.020
 need these pretty color artifacts 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.000
 much we press as the frame was taken 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.730
 400 you do not have a contrast that is, we are for 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.190
 kontra what this shot that always started 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.170
 generally very narrow behind the control footage and 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.930
 we pull out of all the plots 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.090
 here's information to give up dirt raised 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.510
 color rose color pretty 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.280
 strongly lift that is here 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:31.790
 masking goes like this yes on 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:34.740
 the brink of not killing the color in the rays 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:38.340
 what else do we do next we go to color 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.360
 of course and here we add it by 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.360
 about the color we have here 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.599
 and warm and cold tones in warm colors 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.360
 we have red yellow orange I'm yellow 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.699
 I turn off specifically in the slope 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.610
 This one has come through all times 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.650
 so as not to interfere with the perception to give if 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.189
 raising us the future to crawl out so much 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.800
 and about cold tones something that is not and 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:06.050
 just hanging out and here we have the blue and 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.680
 this is the most unpleasant this warm 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.960
 magenta 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.250
 here they are getting out of here because 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.620
 that the border of the rays is very soft and there is 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.279
 risk of causing civilization here is an unpleasant 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:23.300
 ok baby i'm raising saturation 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:24.500
 evenly then 15-10 10 he recognizes 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.779
 it turns out that I have these all 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.210
 cold tones rise evenly and 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:31.729
 also gradually lower the sacredness in 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:36.770
 there are five points on all three 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:39.800
 that is, here it is initially, so here it is 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.930
 became on balance squirrels here was 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.319
 initially forgot you such a very 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.629
 cool shot but i remember how to frame it 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:49.099
 I have done shots similar yes here 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:51.319
 filming was common 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.599
 so I raise the white balance 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:55.509
 high enough this is just 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.909
 predawn light just 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:02.150
 the sun is ready to rise from the mountains 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:05.330
 Here I am, respectively, a book 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.960
 differently perceived here is a cat on 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.599
 full screen 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.990
 Well, respectively, it turns out 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:16.189
 near the artifact-free read about 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:19.039
 a little bit and no distortion anyone 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:21.430
 very important to the transition between tones 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:24.469
 here is from this lilac here 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:27.439
 rose red no was soft without 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:32.419
 such as baby nasty thing 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:35.770
 hard what could be the frame initially 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:38.419
 that's what we did to him 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.550
 and visually so 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.719
 everything and was a unique natural phenomenon 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.719
 happen only in tibet and himalayas 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:51.649
 Details welcome Vitaly FGC Missed 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:52.610
 No, not all, now we will do a little 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:55.819
 break and 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.289
 and continue yes no I did not miss 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:01.669
 we don't even get there and then these files 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:04.009
 see the dhx tailor and put it on 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:05.840
 the school server will just be easier 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:08.259
 you import and view them by 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.259
 steps
