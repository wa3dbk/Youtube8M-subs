00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
just exploded and we've got this wiki

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.240 
just exploded and we've got this wiki
now<00:01:55.719> that's<00:01:55.990> hundreds<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.710> hundreds<00:01:57.130> and

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
now that's hundreds and hundreds and

now that's hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds<00:01:57.700> of<00:01:57.820> pages<00:01:58.090> long<00:01:59.049> it's<00:01:59.350> it's

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
hundreds of pages long it's it's

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.469 
hundreds of pages long it's it's
incredible<00:02:00.280> what<00:02:00.759> are<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.909> challenges<00:02:01.119> you

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
incredible what are the challenges you

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.330 
incredible what are the challenges you
see<00:02:01.509> now<00:02:01.840> of<00:02:02.229> writing<00:02:02.560> for<00:02:02.679> video<00:02:02.890> games<00:02:03.100> then

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
see now of writing for video games then

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.179 
see now of writing for video games then
maybe<00:02:03.520> it<00:02:03.700> was<00:02:03.880> maybe<00:02:04.299> ten<00:02:04.570> years<00:02:04.600> ago<00:02:05.159> well<00:02:06.159> I

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
maybe it was maybe ten years ago well I

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.219 
maybe it was maybe ten years ago well I
I<00:02:06.640> don't<00:02:06.909> know<00:02:07.210> ten<00:02:07.509> years<00:02:07.539> ago<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:07.929> wasn't

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
I don't know ten years ago I wasn't

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.290 
I don't know ten years ago I wasn't
writing<00:02:08.440> for<00:02:08.770> them<00:02:08.920> but<00:02:09.070> I<00:02:09.220> think<00:02:09.520> we<00:02:09.940> can<00:02:10.090> do<00:02:10.270> I

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
writing for them but I think we can do I

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.730 
writing for them but I think we can do I
think<00:02:10.420> it's<00:02:10.660> actually<00:02:10.720> easier<00:02:11.260> now<00:02:11.440> because

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
think it's actually easier now because

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.170 
think it's actually easier now because
you<00:02:11.800> can<00:02:11.920> do<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:12.220> much<00:02:12.370> more<00:02:12.400> with<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.940> video

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
you can do so much more with the video

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.970 
you can do so much more with the video
games<00:02:13.450> now<00:02:13.659> you<00:02:13.750> can<00:02:14.019> get<00:02:14.170> more<00:02:14.379> immersion<00:02:14.950> you

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
games now you can get more immersion you

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.770 
games now you can get more immersion you
can<00:02:15.220> get<00:02:15.370> more<00:02:15.580> realism<00:02:16.269> into<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.569> games

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
can get more realism into the games

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.940 
can get more realism into the games
because<00:02:17.230> the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
because the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.440 
because the
you<00:02:18.129> know<00:02:18.220> bandwidth<00:02:18.849> is<00:02:19.030> better<00:02:19.239> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
you know bandwidth is better the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.300 
you know bandwidth is better the
computers<00:02:19.930> are<00:02:20.110> better<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.590> air<00:02:21.099> all<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
computers are better the air all the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.280 
computers are better the air all the
tools<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.879> you're<00:02:22.120> using<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.569> better<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.019> I<00:02:23.050> I

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
tools that you're using a better so I I

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.600 
tools that you're using a better so I I
think<00:02:23.530> 10<00:02:23.920> years<00:02:23.950> ago<00:02:24.280> would<00:02:24.459> have<00:02:24.519> been

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
think 10 years ago would have been

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.699 
think 10 years ago would have been
harder<00:02:25.030> because<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.330> were<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:25.599> limited<00:02:25.930> by

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
harder because you were so limited by

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.040 
harder because you were so limited by
the<00:02:27.180> mechanics<00:02:28.180> of<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.569> technical

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
the mechanics of and the technical

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.410 
the mechanics of and the technical
difficulties<00:02:29.980> if<00:02:30.160> you<00:02:30.280> will<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.640> now<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:31.120> you

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
difficulties if you will and now it you

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.620 
difficulties if you will and now it you
know<00:02:31.510> it's<00:02:31.660> it's<00:02:31.870> getting<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.470> much<00:02:32.530> better

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
know it's it's getting so much better

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.030
