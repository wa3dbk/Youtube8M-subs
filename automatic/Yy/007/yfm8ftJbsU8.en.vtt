grows<00:00:30.509> these<00:00:31.509> are<00:00:31.749> the<00:00:31.839> seeds<00:00:32.110> right<00:00:32.410> here

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
grows these are the seeds right here

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.819 
grows these are the seeds right here
this<00:00:34.989> is<00:00:35.050> from<00:00:35.379> the<00:00:35.469> Moringa<00:00:36.190> oleifera<00:00:36.850> and

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
this is from the Moringa oleifera and

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.860 
this is from the Moringa oleifera and
the<00:00:38.829> Moringa<00:00:39.340> stand<00:00:39.640> patella<00:00:40.059> has<00:00:40.300> a<00:00:40.329> little

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
the Moringa stand patella has a little

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.419 
the Moringa stand patella has a little
different<00:00:41.260> seed<00:00:41.500> grows<00:00:42.129> a<00:00:42.160> little

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:42.429 
different seed grows a little

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:44.069 
different seed grows a little
differently<00:00:42.760> I<00:00:42.850> believe<00:00:43.120> this<00:00:43.269> is<00:00:43.329> from<00:00:43.600> from

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
differently I believe this is from from

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.229 
differently I believe this is from from
Africa<00:00:44.649> this<00:00:44.769> is<00:00:44.829> the<00:00:44.949> African<00:00:45.309> version<00:00:45.519> and<00:00:45.879> I
