00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.099
 I have already seen that meiosis participates in 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.629
 the stability of the species but also 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.580
 to the diversity of individuals through 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.349
 intra and inter chromosome mixing 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.429
 in this new video we will 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.960
 see together at first 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.220
 how fertilization participates 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.050
 also to genetic brewing 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.070
 we will then show that there is 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.259
 an infinity of combinations 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.460
 chromosome possible then we 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.520
 will highlight the various 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.960
 Possible anomalies of meiosis you saw 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.430
 that meiosis participate in brewing 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.290
 genetics and more particularly the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.910
 range diversity is another step 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.800
 of sexual reproduction amplifies this 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.360
 brewing is fertilization the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.280
 fertilization is the fusion of nuclei 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.390
 of range is reminded to ide the egg 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.400
 for the female gamete and the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.930
 sperm for the male gamete she 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.340
 is causing a cell off or 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.810
 diploid zygote whose heritage 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.100
 genetics will be half of origin 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.490
 maternal and half of origin 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.750
 paternal be two times 23 chromosomes 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.640
 during fertilization the gametes are 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.080
 randomly choose the zygote 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.160
 from the fusion of the two gametes 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.450
 will therefore contain a combination 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.390
 single allelic 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.620
 it can be deduced that fertilization 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.480
 amplifies the genetic mixing 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.830
 we saw that meiosis and the 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.450
 fertilization was at the origin of 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.640
 united allelic combinations thanks to the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.930
 genetic brewing trying to calculate 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.909
 the number of possible combinations 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.140
 let's start by calculating the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.610
 number of range possibilities is 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.230
 different who can be trained when 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.490
 meiosis for a pair of 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.770
 homologous chromosomes carrying 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.060
 different alleles first of all the pair 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.650
 of chromosomes and separated during the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.120
 first division of meiosis and 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.890
 chromaticity of each chromosome are 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.780
 separated in the second division 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.000
 you can observe two types of range is 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.770
 different be of power a gamete 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.540
 different for two pairs of 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.740
 chromosomes now as a result of 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.300
 two media divisions you can 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.909
 observe four ranges is different 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.380
 be of power 2 so for the 23 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.820
 characteristic chromosome pairs 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.500
 you can theoretically get two 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.960
 powers 23 range is different be 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.590
 about 8 million possibilities 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.120
 let's take a look now at the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.780
 chromosome distribution during 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.610
 fertilization 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.260
 for that we use what we call 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.430
 a cross board is a 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.140
 table in which we will represent 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.860
 all possibilities of fertilization 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.170
 between gametes 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.300
 take the example of Drosophila with 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.620
 the crossing of two years 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.620
 defend the big ones
