00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 with which he kept the goal here thermos of 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:07.290
 samsung galaxy 53 60 in that short 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.960
 video I will easily teach you how 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.309
 close applications the procedure is 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.309
 very simple basically 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.210
 it consists of leaving the button 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.280
 erratic center but before I invite you to 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.990
 subscribe to my channel and that was to be able 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.670
 be aware of all my videos and 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.950
 be aware of my boyfriend in which 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.180
 I will teach how to force the closure of 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.160
 applications one thing is to know 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.140
 applications and other things like force 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.270
 many times when closing applications 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.490
 are completely of aranza and what 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.320
 touches is to force its closure as I told you 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.270
 before we basically have the button here 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.030
 sunk here you can see the applications 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.640
 that we have recently used and if 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.220
 we want to close the applications that 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.570
 are in use in the background or using 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.090
 processes and memory we go here to 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.130
 task manager and here we can 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.290
 see that we have three applications that 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.870
 they have they are working in the background 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.820
 in this case we can see that they are 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.650
 consuming ram as he had told them is 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.260
 say I would like to open another application in 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.840
 this other application would not have as much 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.549
 ram to use if I want that 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.530
 work in a fluid way simply 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.420
 close all active applications the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.640
 which simply by giving click here 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.830
 finally populate saving or if there is a 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.020
 very long list simply define it 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.450
 all 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.789
 here we have closed the applications 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.289
 active and if we want to close more 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.079
 applications that are working in the 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.240
 background let's go here to rne and here we have 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.159
 immediately removed the malignant 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.259
 memory has hung them a notice that has 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.240
 closed 11 applications that in addition to 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.429
 that were also consuming memory 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.799
 ram that way we can make the 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.409
 phone work more flow more 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.539
 fast and soon load some other 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.149
 application that soon exists more 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.250
 and especially for this video do not forget 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.659
 subscribe to my channel so you do not 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.909
 lose in the next video that is how 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.459
 force the certain applications of 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.989
 colors to errors applications that are 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.119
 a little fence that does not follow will be 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:59.829
 easily and especially for this video 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.119
 thank you very much for watching videos and
