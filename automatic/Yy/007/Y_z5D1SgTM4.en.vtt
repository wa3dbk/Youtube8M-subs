00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.330
 In this video we will talk about the gate or 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.480
 Noise gate and its main 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.280
 controls and applications here we have 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.860
 a battery that has been recorded by 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.860
 channels let's listen a little 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.190
 we have the hype channel 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.449
 another microphone that is out of the hype 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.330
 around dante on the top 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:39.420
 drummer at the bottom the town 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.730
 why he usually gets a lot 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.880
 noise from the other parts of the battery 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.430
 the soviets 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:54.790
 and the environments 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.790
 they are going to help us capture the room 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:02.040
 then let's take the first channel 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.880
 what is the hype and are we going to use in 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.080
 this case 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.080
 a gate that is twitter 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 broggi 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.960
 and we can see it has a part in the 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.220
 center where it shows us graphically 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.220
 what's happening 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.850
 is showing us what is entering 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.650
 we can see the signal as it comes 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.790
 and the highest peaks that are the hype 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:41.490
 every time you hit 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.490
 this big control over here is the right 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.979
 they are shown with this line 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.670
 three suns ago the threshold or want 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:02:00.399
 say that what you put on top is going to be 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.289
 the only thing that we will let ourselves hear 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.119
 so if we go up there is going to be a 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.479
 point where we only listen to the 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.759
 hype beats that are the strongest 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:15.250
 because the microphone is closer then 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:18.920
 of this we have here the racing that is 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.220
 the proportion that is going to tell us how 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.020
 strong or how soft we want it to be 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.090
 This process 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.940
 we realize that every time we go 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.150
 increasing what he is doing in a wheel 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.659
 more drastic 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.140
 if we put it to maximum it's just going to 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.810
 let these peaks pass and already the rest what 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.770
 I'm going to cut 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.599
 we have here the range that is a value in 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.560
 decibeles what does it mean that what 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.780
 is below 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.000
 how much we want him to reduce the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:01.540
 level that we are increasing we see as he 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.060
 is reducing the level more 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.110
 until you hear and also not 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.100
 show here in black 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.200
 we also have attack control 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.130
 that because it is an instrument of 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.000
 percussion 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.630
 we want the attack to be very short 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.210
 to catch the start of each hit if 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.410
 the attack is a longer value 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.770
 it will not reach to happen 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.390
 will only catch after the blow 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.790
 initial 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.560
 then you are not going to listen well not going 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.980
 to sound with a kick 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.260
 so this value should be pretty 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.579
 small 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.860
 and we will have the release that wants us 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.409
 say is the time it takes to 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.640
 close this gate is to say the time 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:57.500
 in which after falling from that threshold 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.400
 that he is going to take so long to finish 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.909
 to close then if the value is very 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.610
 long we realize that leaves more 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.350
 time and begins to close after 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.810
 every hit 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.920
 what also depending on the 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.920
 song speed 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.120
 and as in the blows we want it to be a 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.450
 value 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.880
 average if it is very short 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.920
 It will also remove us just down 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.280
 the attack but it will take away the body 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.000
 Hype or is not going to sound long but 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.969
 only the first part will sound 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.700
 that's why we want that choice 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:44.400
 longer blows 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:49.020
 now let's hear it 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:52.919
 removing the process we hear how it 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:56.419
 get in front and the plates and now 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.419
 let's listen to it with the gheit
