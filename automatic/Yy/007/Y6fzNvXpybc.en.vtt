00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.289 
ridiculously hard to do the AL because
it's<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:37.979> left<00:01:38.790> right<00:01:38.880> left<00:01:39.119> right<00:01:39.180> left

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
it's just left right left right left

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.950 
it's just left right left right left
rather<00:01:39.570> stupid<00:01:40.170> way<00:01:40.950> throws<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.150> was

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
rather stupid way throws it but I was

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.420 
rather stupid way throws it but I was
really<00:01:43.229> concentrate<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:43.979> trying<00:01:44.369> to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
really concentrate on just trying to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.340 
really concentrate on just trying to
move<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.820> left<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.479> right<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.840> actually<00:01:46.200> get

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
move it left and right to actually get

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.260 
move it left and right to actually get
the<00:01:46.380> impact<00:01:46.860> instead<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.549> stand<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the impact instead of just stand in the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.090 
the impact instead of just stand in the
middle<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.630> hoping<00:01:48.930> for<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> best<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.619> it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
middle and hoping for the best and it

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.920 
middle and hoping for the best and it
really<00:01:50.430> did<00:01:50.670> work<00:01:50.700> out<00:01:51.180> as<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.810> at

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
really did work out as you can see at

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.410 
really did work out as you can see at
this<00:01:52.020> point<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.409> had<00:01:52.619> eight<00:01:53.159> home<00:01:53.520> runs<00:01:53.549> with<00:01:53.880> 22

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
this point I had eight home runs with 22

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.780 
this point I had eight home runs with 22
left<00:01:54.810> only<00:01:55.259> neat<00:01:55.590> where<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.799> only<00:01:56.340> need<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.670> get

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
left only neat where I only need to get

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.510 
left only neat where I only need to get
11<00:01:57.149> from<00:01:57.299> 22<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.079> there<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.009> go<00:01:59.040> who's<00:01:59.280> getting

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
11 from 22 so there we go who's getting

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.340 
11 from 22 so there we go who's getting
better<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.790> better<00:01:59.880> 10<00:02:00.270> from<00:02:00.509> 21<00:02:01.049> just

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
better and better 10 from 21 just

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.109 
better and better 10 from 21 just
everything<00:02:01.860> was<00:02:02.009> seemed<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.399> work<00:02:02.939> out

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
everything was seemed to work out

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.149 
everything was seemed to work out
absolutely<00:02:03.390> perfectly<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:04.740> was<00:02:04.920> getting

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
absolutely perfectly and we was getting

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.350

the<00:02:05.219> ones<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:05.579> need<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.180> just

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the ones that we need it and it was just

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.919 
the ones that we need it and it was just

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
happening again and again and again now

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.999 
happening again and again and again now
because<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.050> was<00:02:10.170> recording<00:02:10.410> through<00:02:10.709> my<00:02:10.890> old

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
because I was recording through my old

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.430 
because I was recording through my old
gutter<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.489> automatically<00:02:12.120> picks<00:02:12.480> up<00:02:12.690> this

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
gutter it automatically picks up this

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.170 
gutter it automatically picks up this
the<00:02:13.530> sound<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.370> was<00:02:14.490> in<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.640> skype<00:02:14.940> call<00:02:15.120> with

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
the sound and I was in a skype call with

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.580 
the sound and I was in a skype call with
someone<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:15.810> I'm<00:02:15.990> not<00:02:16.170> gonna<00:02:16.290> actually<00:02:16.410> show

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
someone so I'm not gonna actually show

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.840 
someone so I'm not gonna actually show
that<00:02:16.740> because<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.100> was<00:02:17.190> really<00:02:17.430> random<00:02:17.580> but

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
that because it was really random but

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.610 
that because it was really random but
there<00:02:18.420> was<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> point<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:19.110> where<00:02:19.260> as<00:02:19.440> I

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
there was a point in it where as I

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.380 
there was a point in it where as I
actually<00:02:19.800> hit<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.160> last<00:02:20.430> one<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:20.940> heard

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
actually hit the last one you just heard

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.480 
actually hit the last one you just heard
me<00:02:21.420> go<00:02:21.720> mental<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.590> there's<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.800> possibility<00:02:22.980> I

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
me go mental so there's a possibility I

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.210 
me go mental so there's a possibility I
will<00:02:23.880> actually<00:02:24.030> keep<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.830> I'm<00:02:25.830> not

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
will actually keep that in I'm not

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.650 
will actually keep that in I'm not
exactly<00:02:26.460> sure<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.850> may<00:02:27.000> hear<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.330> randomly

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
exactly sure you may hear that randomly

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.410 
exactly sure you may hear that randomly
in<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.870> minute<00:02:28.110> but<00:02:28.490> yeah<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.520> was<00:02:30.120> getting<00:02:30.360> a

you<00:03:06.720> haven't<00:03:06.990> already<00:03:07.020> seen<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.560> or<00:03:07.650> played<00:03:07.920> it

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
you haven't already seen it or played it

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.280 
you haven't already seen it or played it
but<00:03:08.550> it's<00:03:08.820> ridiculous<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.690> involves

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
but it's ridiculous it involves

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.050 
but it's ridiculous it involves
invisibility<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.550> is<00:03:11.670> what<00:03:11.790> I'm<00:03:11.880> going<00:03:12.030> to

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
invisibility that is what I'm going to

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.320 
invisibility that is what I'm going to
say<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:13.250> yeah<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:14.820> going<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.030> be<00:03:15.150> absolutely

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
say so yeah it's going to be absolutely

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.930 
say so yeah it's going to be absolutely
ridiculous<00:03:16.050> so<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.310> basically<00:03:17.459> going<00:03:17.850> to

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
ridiculous so this is basically going to

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.760 
ridiculous so this is basically going to
be<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.660> continuation<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.470> as<00:03:19.590> many

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
be the the continuation of as many

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.430 
be the the continuation of as many
