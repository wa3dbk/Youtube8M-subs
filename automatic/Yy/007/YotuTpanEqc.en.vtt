and then just gently start rubbing and
then<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.570> can<00:02:09.750> cut<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.470> shape<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
then you can cut this and shape it

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.770 
then you can cut this and shape it
however<00:02:11.040> you<00:02:11.370> want<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.820> get<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.300> little<00:02:12.540> loop

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
however you want to get this little loop

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.170 
however you want to get this little loop
I<00:02:13.080> just<00:02:13.709> ran<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.400> around<00:02:14.670> here<00:02:15.680> hold<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.890> there

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
I just ran it around here hold in there

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.090 
I just ran it around here hold in there
so<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.240> will<00:02:18.570> see<00:02:18.810> other<00:02:19.020> plenty<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.920> other

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
so you will see other plenty of other

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.520 
so you will see other plenty of other
methods<00:02:20.970> for<00:02:21.240> doing<00:02:21.540> image<00:02:21.900> transfers<00:02:22.380> out

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
methods for doing image transfers out

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.260 
methods for doing image transfers out
there<00:02:22.740> these<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:23.610> happen<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:23.910> be<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> ones

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
there these just happen to be the ones

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.830 
there these just happen to be the ones
that<00:02:24.510> work<00:02:24.660> best<00:02:24.690> for<00:02:24.959> me

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.990 

we're<00:02:29.800> going<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.010> talk<00:02:30.220> about<00:02:30.400> how<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.730> make

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
we're going to talk about how to make

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.870 
we're going to talk about how to make
mosaics<00:02:31.930> cut<00:02:32.770> out<00:02:32.890> however<00:02:33.130> my<00:02:33.430> child<00:02:33.700> I

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
mosaics cut out however my child I

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.820 
mosaics cut out however my child I
always<00:02:34.000> end<00:02:34.330> up<00:02:34.630> making<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:35.020> ton<00:02:35.230> do<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.590> want

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
always end up making a ton do you want

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.630 
always end up making a ton do you want
to<00:02:36.040> set<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:37.270> boundaries<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.870> where<00:02:38.380> your<00:02:38.680> your

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
to set the boundaries of where your your

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.760 
to set the boundaries of where your your
tiles<00:02:39.970> are<00:02:40.090> going<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.300> go<00:02:40.480> it's<00:02:41.230> up<00:02:41.349> to<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.620> how

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
tiles are going to go it's up to you how

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.100 
tiles are going to go it's up to you how
much<00:02:41.950> space<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.610> want<00:02:42.730> between<00:02:42.970> them<00:02:43.300> at<00:02:43.959> this

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
much space you want between them at this

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.509 
much space you want between them at this
point<00:02:44.349> get<00:02:44.530> I'm<00:02:44.709> going<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:44.950> press<00:02:45.160> them<00:02:45.400> in

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
point get I'm going to press them in

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.910 
point get I'm going to press them in
lightly<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:46.239> then<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:46.989> can<00:02:47.170> make<00:02:47.349> your<00:02:47.380> cut

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
lightly and then you can make your cut

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.120 
lightly and then you can make your cut
and<00:02:48.700> then<00:02:48.940> wrap<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.239> around<00:02:49.739> put<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:50.920> down

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
and then wrap it around put that down

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.420 
and then wrap it around put that down
there

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
there

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.470 
there
mmm<00:02:52.360> sit<00:02:52.810> down<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:54.400> I'm<00:02:54.519> just<00:02:54.700> taking<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.060> couple

mmm sit down so I'm just taking a couple
of<00:02:55.569> really<00:02:55.780> thin<00:02:56.230> slices<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.130> really<00:02:58.060> just

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
of really thin slices and really just

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.470 
of really thin slices and really just
push<00:02:59.050> it<00:02:59.260> right<00:02:59.470> in<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.430> want<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.880> try<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.330> get

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
push it right in I want to try and get

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.050 
push it right in I want to try and get
off<00:03:01.630> as<00:03:01.810> much<00:03:02.080> as<00:03:02.319> you<00:03:02.410> can<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.819> my

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
off as much as you can so that is my

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.480 
off as much as you can so that is my
method<00:03:04.269> for<00:03:04.890> making<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.489> grouting<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.180> mosaic
