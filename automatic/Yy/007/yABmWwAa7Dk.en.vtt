one of the things that's nice about the
audi<00:02:37.510> r8<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.080> that<00:02:38.260> it's<00:02:38.440> an<00:02:38.530> all<00:02:38.680> wheel<00:02:38.860> drive

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
audi r8 is that it's an all wheel drive

audi r8 is that it's an all wheel drive
vehicle<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.700> Quattro<00:02:40.090> system<00:02:40.300> sends<00:02:40.690> just<00:02:41.260> a

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
vehicle the Quattro system sends just a

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.080 
vehicle the Quattro system sends just a
little<00:02:41.680> bit<00:02:42.069> of<00:02:42.190> power<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.610> front<00:02:42.790> wheels

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
little bit of power to the front wheels

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.910 
little bit of power to the front wheels
so<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.420> still<00:02:43.630> feels<00:02:43.900> like<00:02:44.050> a<00:02:44.140> rear<00:02:44.380> drive<00:02:44.620> car

so it still feels like a rear drive car
but<00:02:45.489> that<00:02:45.640> front<00:02:45.940> power<00:02:46.180> holds<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.020> right

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
but that front power holds you right

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.809 
but that front power holds you right
through<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.709> corners<00:02:48.069> and<00:02:48.370> if<00:02:48.610> you're<00:02:48.700> on<00:02:48.760> a
