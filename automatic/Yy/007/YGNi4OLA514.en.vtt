00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello youtube personal only priscilla and no 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.000
 Today is another way for GPs 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.190
 years and with you are looking for the title 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.039
 rigid and if so will add to 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.080
 special ability of gta 5 franklin 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.000
 no gta san andreas 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.820
 the way to give a slow-motion effect 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.890
 usually as gta5 in vehicles right 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.779
 because this is the special ability of the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.300
 franklin in detail that a lot of people 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.219
 commented on a video I made of 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.469
 Special ability of the maicon that I go 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.829
 also leave in the description of the video case 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.079
 someone wants to see that in gta 5 happens 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.390
 slow motion, and also means that the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.969
 textures the colors of the game gets half 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.070
 gray and played gta5 will understand that I 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.600
 I'm talking and I've seen some 20 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.030
 on YouTube you will want when talking 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.770
 this is not san andreas gta happens 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.469
 so far not reached any way that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.420
 and I think it's going to be 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.579
 It's kind of difficult, they can do it. 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.859
 Guys, why are you there and messing around? 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.920
 in the original mechanics of the game then 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.010
 There is a lot to do but the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.830
 template exactly like gta5 exactly 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.560
 Nothing changes in slow motion. 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.740
 the effect of the franc and in the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.570
 gta 5 Then, now, as always, I will. 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.970
 back on the desktop and I'll show you 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.299
 to you installing it that way then 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.299
 come on 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.719
 just now we are going to install the mode 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.659
 as I will always leave in the description of the 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:34.250
 video link to let you shape and 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.979
 I'll also leave it in the video description 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.679
 the link to the video where it shows the 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.470
 installation in library cléo 4 because 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:47.240
 to install this template its already 10 years 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.009
 need to take cléo 4 has to be 4 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.590
 so it's okay if you do not have 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.750
 you'll have to install before 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.119
 install this motto here then you go 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.670
 find mole extract as usual 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.740
 usually within the folder of the name 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.470
 There's going to be this folder that you're going 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.390
 open and inside you will copy 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.000
 these two files 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.250
 after copying the two files you 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.310
 now they will find their 10's folder 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.650
 years I counted all the files of the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.049
 Then the location of the shipyard 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.959
 my shirt pocket one of you there 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:24.769
 so come on, my computer disk 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.079
 local c files from rockstar programs 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.660
 games gts 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:33.139
 arriving here in the gt band the years 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.690
 you will see that part of it and cléo 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:37.670
 inside the folder you will paste the 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.160
 two files that we have just 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.620
 copy simple just by scrolling two 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.030
 files and only people are this too 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.040
 very simple 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.440
 here you can close this folder and 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.470
 we are just that, we just copy the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.989
 files and paste into the folder and cléo 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.840
 if you want to remove the mob you 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.299
 only pay these two files of the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.060
 Please be careful not to pay the 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.340
 file is paying attention well in time 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.709
 which is to remove the mode so now as 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.569
 I'll always open ten years and go 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.190
 show you what mode it really is 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.190
 Working so let's go 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.260
 and as you see the gta is 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.310
 working normally without locking in 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.349
 nothing like 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.760
 so what I'm going to get a vehicle to 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.549
 show you here the way it is 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.989
 working 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.109
 remembering that this special ability 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.480
 that the whole gta5 chicken is only for 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.780
 Vehicles are for those who do not know of course 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.780
 then oh to activate the mobi is very simple 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.050
 just press the key 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.120
 only this pressed the zo mode key and it goes 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.950
 activate and how you are seeing 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.340

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.620
