noticed a shift pattern it just the
whole<00:00:15.719> feel<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.470> between

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
whole feel of it and between

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
acceleration and deceleration it just

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.810 
acceleration and deceleration it just
changed<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.529> could<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.189> tell<00:00:20.340> right<00:00:20.550> off<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
you got an upper and transmission motor

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.990 
you got an upper and transmission motor
mount<00:00:24.900> over<00:00:25.170> here<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:25.619> fine<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.580> got<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.730> back

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.440 
lower motor mount right here and then
you<00:00:31.710> got<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> main<00:00:32.189> front<00:00:32.669> motor<00:00:33.030> mount<00:00:33.270> over

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
you got the main front motor mount over

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.920 
you got the main front motor mount over
here<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.500> lower<00:00:34.890> mount<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.120> side<00:00:36.420> was

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
here the lower mount on this side was

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.190

and that is your part number right now
anyway<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.140> we're<00:00:46.680> going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> go<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.129> pull<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
anyway so we're going to go and pull the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.190 
anyway so we're going to go and pull the
old<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:47.730> off<00:00:47.940> I've<00:00:48.239> jacked<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.719> car<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:49.079> a

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
old one off I've jacked the car up a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.340 
old one off I've jacked the car up a
little<00:00:49.230> bit<00:00:49.910> pretty<00:00:50.910> easy<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.420> change<00:00:51.690> almost

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
little bit pretty easy to change almost

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.470 
little bit pretty easy to change almost
anyone<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:53.070> do<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.430> one

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
anyone can do this one

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.209 
anyone can do this one
it's<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> 19<00:00:55.170> millimeter<00:00:55.590> bolt<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:56.039> two

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
it's a 19 millimeter bolt with two

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.459 
it's a 19 millimeter bolt with two
fourteens<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.969> hold<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> frame<00:00:57.780> so

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
fourteens that hold it to the frame so

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.090 
fourteens that hold it to the frame so
the<00:00:58.980> 19<00:00:59.399> actually<00:00:59.789> goes<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.809> bolt<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:02.039> goes

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the 19 actually goes to a bolt that goes

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.119 
the 19 actually goes to a bolt that goes
into<00:01:02.579> your<00:01:02.820> AC<00:01:03.030> brackets<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.379> usually<00:01:04.949> just

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
into your AC brackets so I usually just

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.219 
into your AC brackets so I usually just
I<00:01:05.339> keep<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> wheel<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.330> turn<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.750> out<00:01:06.900> to

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
I keep the wheel on it I turn it out to

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.530 
I keep the wheel on it I turn it out to
the<00:01:07.350> left<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.710> little<00:01:07.740> bit<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.299> go<00:01:09.510> down

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the left a little bit and as I go down

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.539 
the left a little bit and as I go down
just<00:01:10.049> take<00:01:10.229> my<00:01:10.380> breaker<00:01:10.710> bar<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.159> there<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
just take my breaker bar in there with a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.570 
just take my breaker bar in there with a
long<00:01:11.790> extension<00:01:12.200> 3/4<00:01:13.200> inch<00:01:13.409> size<00:01:13.740> or<00:01:14.189> 1/2<00:01:14.369> inch

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
long extension 3/4 inch size or 1/2 inch

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.810 
long extension 3/4 inch size or 1/2 inch
size<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.689> break<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.080> free<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.670> pretty<00:01:17.670> much

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
size and I break it free and pretty much

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.469 
size and I break it free and pretty much
go<00:01:18.030> from<00:01:18.180> there

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
go from there

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.850 
go from there
so<00:01:18.780> let's<00:01:18.930> go<00:01:19.049> ahead<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.710> up

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
so let's go ahead and get this it up

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.320 
so let's go ahead and get this it up
break<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.220> down<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.670> said<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.030> pretty<00:01:21.240> much

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
break it down and I said I pretty much

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.390 
break it down and I said I pretty much
just<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> breaker<00:01:22.140> bar<00:01:22.500> other<00:01:23.130> little

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
just do the breaker bar other little

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.390 
just do the breaker bar other little
right<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.509> it's<00:01:24.869> right<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.979> mean<00:01:26.280> you

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
right here it's right there I mean you

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.450 
right here it's right there I mean you
can<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.740> pretty<00:01:28.740> much<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.009> push

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
can just get to it pretty much just push

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.670 
can just get to it pretty much just push
the<00:01:29.610> pressure<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.090> right<00:01:30.329> there<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.470> as

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the pressure on right there it's just as

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.859 
the pressure on right there it's just as
simple<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> brackets<00:01:33.150> motor

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
simple just one of the brackets motor

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.020 
simple just one of the brackets motor
mats<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.380> change<00:01:34.770> out<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.520> pretty<00:01:35.880> much

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
mats you can change out and pretty much

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.679 
mats you can change out and pretty much
5<00:01:36.479> minutes<00:01:36.900> or<00:01:37.049> less<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.820> that<00:01:38.820> was<00:01:39.090> free<00:01:39.450> once

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
5 minutes or less so that was free once

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.539 
5 minutes or less so that was free once
you<00:01:39.869> get<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.229> main<00:01:40.530> bolt<00:01:40.860> off<00:01:41.100> right<00:01:41.310> here

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
you get this main bolt off right here

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.080 
you get this main bolt off right here
then<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:43.380> rest<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.799> simple

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.370 

and<00:01:49.090> actually<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.479> noticed<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.960> new<00:01:50.110> mount

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
and actually I noticed the new mount

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.929 
and actually I noticed the new mount
comes<00:01:50.740> even<00:01:51.039> with<00:01:51.189> a<00:01:51.219> little<00:01:51.430> bit<00:01:51.579> of<00:01:51.610> space

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
comes even with a little bit of space

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.060 
comes even with a little bit of space
where<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.299> bushing<00:01:53.079> is<00:01:53.200> on<00:01:53.350> inside<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:53.979> it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
where the bushing is on inside so it

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.709 
where the bushing is on inside so it
allows<00:01:54.340> you<00:01:54.579> to<00:01:54.700> give<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.179> that<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.390> little<00:01:55.600> bit

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
allows you to give it that a little bit

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.660 
allows you to give it that a little bit
of<00:01:55.810> play<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.049> put<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.500> in<00:01:56.679> without<00:01:57.369> like

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
of play to put it in without like

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.550 
of play to put it in without like
dropping<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.600> motor<00:01:58.780> down<00:01:59.049> and<00:01:59.350> all<00:01:59.409> the

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
dropping the motor down and all the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
but it helps absorb the acceleration and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.309 
but it helps absorb the acceleration and
deceleration<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:49.720> way<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:50.079> doesn't

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
deceleration and that way it doesn't

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.970 
deceleration and that way it doesn't
wear<00:02:50.769> on<00:02:51.010> your<00:02:51.250> other<00:02:51.600> motor<00:02:52.600> mounts<00:02:52.989> if<00:02:53.109> you
