carbon-fiber brakes and not like a
normal<00:01:22.960> road<00:01:23.229> pass<00:01:23.470> so<00:01:23.680> you<00:01:23.740> need<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.040> be<00:01:24.130> able

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
normal road pass so you need to be able

to get them up to something like 300

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.260 
to get them up to something like 300
degrees<00:01:26.530> which<00:01:27.190> is<00:01:27.520> when<00:01:27.729> they<00:01:27.850> work<00:01:28.000> at<00:01:28.149> their

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
degrees which is when they work at their

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.139 
degrees which is when they work at their
optimum<00:01:28.630> level<00:01:29.080> without<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:30.160> ABS<00:01:30.550> and

the<00:01:40.119> interesting<00:01:40.509> thing<00:01:40.630> about<00:01:40.660> a<00:01:40.869> Formula

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
the interesting thing about a Formula

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.950 
the interesting thing about a Formula
One<00:01:41.380> car<00:01:41.619> is<00:01:42.100> it<00:01:42.460> takes<00:01:43.060> less<00:01:43.390> distance<00:01:43.869> to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
One car is it takes less distance to

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.960 
One car is it takes less distance to
stop<00:01:44.229> a<00:01:44.259> Formula<00:01:44.649> One<00:01:44.680> car<00:01:44.830> from<00:01:45.250> 160

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
stop a Formula One car from 160

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.730 
stop a Formula One car from 160
kilometers<00:01:46.390> now<00:01:46.600> than<00:01:47.050> it<00:01:47.140> does<00:01:47.289> a<00:01:47.319> road<00:01:47.530> car

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
kilometers now than it does a road car

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.070 
kilometers now than it does a road car
from<00:01:48.039> 100<00:01:48.580> kilometers<00:01:49.000> an<00:01:49.030> hour<00:01:49.179> when<00:01:49.750> I<00:01:49.780> first

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
from 100 kilometers an hour when I first

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.020 
from 100 kilometers an hour when I first
drove<00:01:50.319> when<00:01:50.619> I<00:01:50.649> was<00:01:50.830> 17<00:01:51.280> it<00:01:51.670> was<00:01:51.850> just

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
drove when I was 17 it was just

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.520 
drove when I was 17 it was just
incredible<00:01:52.690> yeah<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:52.869> went<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.319> first

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
incredible yeah I went to the first

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.889 
incredible yeah I went to the first
corner<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:53.890> I<00:01:54.009> hit<00:01:54.160> the<00:01:54.280> brakes<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
corner and I hit the brakes and the

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.779 
corner and I hit the brakes and the
g-force<00:01:56.110> is<00:01:56.380> so<00:01:56.649> strong<00:01:56.979> that<00:01:57.459> I<00:01:57.520> didn't

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
g-force is so strong that I didn't

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.639 
g-force is so strong that I didn't
expect<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.209> so<00:01:58.390> my<00:01:58.509> head<00:01:58.720> went<00:01:59.289> straight<00:01:59.619> down

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
expect it so my head went straight down

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.919 
expect it so my head went straight down
into<00:02:00.250> my<00:02:00.399> legs<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:01.300> I<00:02:01.420> couldn't<00:02:01.630> see<00:02:01.750> where<00:02:01.899> I

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
into my legs and I couldn't see where I

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.179 
into my legs and I couldn't see where I
was<00:02:02.020> going<00:02:02.110> anymore

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
was going anymore

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.030 
was going anymore
with<00:02:04.700> brakes<00:02:05.030> this<00:02:05.240> powerful<00:02:05.630> it's<00:02:06.590> possible

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
with brakes this powerful it's possible

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.460 
with brakes this powerful it's possible
