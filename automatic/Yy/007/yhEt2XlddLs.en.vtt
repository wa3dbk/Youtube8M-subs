okay this is your own do numbers meaning

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.629 
okay this is your own do numbers meaning
so<00:00:06.420> you<00:00:06.480> can<00:00:06.720> find<00:00:06.990> out<00:00:07.170> what<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.560> do<00:00:07.770> within

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
so you can find out what to do within

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.610 
so you can find out what to do within
the<00:00:08.910> week

this<00:03:43.390> does<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.690> actually<00:03:44.410> um<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.940> can<00:03:46.120> see

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
this does you actually um you can see

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.259 
this does you actually um you can see
what<00:03:46.480> number<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:46.870> due<00:03:47.110> for<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:48.400> midday<00:03:48.640> that

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
what number is due for the midday that

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.420 
what number is due for the midday that
hasn't<00:03:49.480> came<00:03:49.810> out<00:03:50.049> so<00:03:50.739> I<00:03:50.769> will<00:03:51.100> look<00:03:51.190> at<00:03:51.340> the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
hasn't came out so I will look at the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.930 
hasn't came out so I will look at the
numbers<00:03:51.610> that's<00:03:52.540> done<00:03:53.080> that<00:03:54.070> hasn't<00:03:54.580> fallen

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
numbers that's done that hasn't fallen

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.560 
numbers that's done that hasn't fallen
ahead<00:03:55.360> 0<00:03:55.630> upon<00:03:56.200> them<00:03:56.380> so<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.040> would<00:03:57.430> put<00:03:57.670> for<00:03:58.209> the

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
ahead 0 upon them so I would put for the

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:05.250 
ahead 0 upon them so I would put for the
midday<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:59.320> do<00:03:59.470> number<00:04:03.810> there<00:04:04.810> do<00:04:04.930> numbers

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
midday the do number there do numbers

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:13.890 
midday the do number there do numbers
for<00:04:05.410> me<00:04:05.530> they<00:04:05.739> would<00:04:05.920> be<00:04:05.980> 0<00:04:07.769> 4<00:04:09.570> 6<00:04:10.570> &amp;<00:04:11.080> 7<00:04:11.680> so<00:04:12.070> my<00:04:13.060> our

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
for me they would be 0 4 6 &amp; 7 so my our

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.500 
for me they would be 0 4 6 &amp; 7 so my our
plane<00:04:14.290> is<00:04:14.440> for<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.709> pick<00:04:15.040> 4<00:04:15.400> as<00:04:15.700> well<00:04:16.090> as<00:04:16.299> the

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
plane is for the pick 4 as well as the

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.509 
plane is for the pick 4 as well as the
peak<00:04:16.720> 3<00:04:17.109> I<00:04:17.320> will<00:04:17.739> take<00:04:17.919> three<00:04:18.070> numbers<00:04:18.489> and

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
peak 3 I will take three numbers and

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.949 
peak 3 I will take three numbers and
make<00:04:18.760> different<00:04:18.910> combination<00:04:19.540> of<00:04:19.690> those

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
make different combination of those

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.980 
make different combination of those
numbers<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:20.739> so<00:04:21.640> I<00:04:21.669> will<00:04:21.940> go<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.120> they<00:04:22.360> do<00:04:22.419> for

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
numbers and so I will go to they do for

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.300 
numbers and so I will go to they do for
the<00:04:23.080> evening

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.470 

they<00:04:28.310> do<00:04:28.550> even<00:04:29.000> in<00:04:29.120> number<00:04:29.650> it<00:04:30.650> would<00:04:31.610> be<00:04:31.850> zero

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
they do even in number it would be zero

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.140 
they do even in number it would be zero
five<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:37.570> seven<00:04:39.250> so<00:04:40.250> I<00:04:40.280> would<00:04:40.610> play<00:04:40.850> this

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
five and seven so I would play this

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.850 
five and seven so I would play this
particular<00:04:41.360> number<00:04:41.750> for<00:04:42.050> my<00:04:42.139> even<00:04:42.530> because<00:04:42.770> I

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
particular number for my even because I

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.879 
particular number for my even because I
know<00:04:42.919> these<00:04:43.250> numbers<00:04:43.520> are<00:04:43.820> missing<00:04:44.080> from<00:04:45.080> the

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
know these numbers are missing from the

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.480 
know these numbers are missing from the
particular<00:04:46.190> week<00:04:46.610> that<00:04:46.910> I<00:04:46.940> started<00:04:47.870> in<00:04:48.490> and

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
particular week that I started in and

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.070 
particular week that I started in and
what<00:04:49.730> you<00:04:49.880> can<00:04:50.030> do<00:04:50.180> you<00:04:50.240> can<00:04:50.389> actually<00:04:50.540> mix

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
what you can do you can actually mix

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.379 
what you can do you can actually mix
those<00:04:51.320> numbers<00:04:51.830> as<00:04:52.010> well<00:04:52.430> if<00:04:52.760> you<00:04:53.030> would<00:04:53.180> like

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
those numbers as well if you would like

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.320 
those numbers as well if you would like
and<00:04:53.690> when<00:04:54.380> I<00:04:54.410> do<00:04:54.560> when<00:04:55.160> I<00:04:55.190> get<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.639> total<00:04:55.820> I<00:04:56.120> go

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
and when I do when I get the total I go

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.570 
and when I do when I get the total I go
to<00:04:56.390> the<00:04:56.600> bottom<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.050> see<00:04:57.200> who<00:04:57.380> has<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:58.310> least

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
to the bottom and see who has the least

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.310 
to the bottom and see who has the least
amount<00:04:58.850> of<00:04:59.180> numbers<00:04:59.510> and<00:04:59.720> then<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.110> most

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
amount of numbers and then the most

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.050 
amount of numbers and then the most
amount<00:05:00.710> of<00:05:00.830> numbers<00:05:01.160> so<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.400> most<00:05:01.580> amount<00:05:01.910> of

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
amount of numbers so the most amount of

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.220 
amount of numbers so the most amount of
number<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.450> has<00:05:02.660> fallen<00:05:02.960> would<00:05:03.890> be<00:05:05.290> eight

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
number that has fallen would be eight

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.409 
number that has fallen would be eight
because<00:05:09.230> it's<00:05:09.410> falling<00:05:09.590> five<00:05:09.980> times<00:05:10.310> nine<00:05:11.060> has

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
because it's falling five times nine has

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.280 
because it's falling five times nine has
fallen<00:05:12.070> six<00:05:13.070> times<00:05:13.370> for<00:05:13.850> both<00:05:14.030> with<00:05:14.570> both<00:05:15.110> and

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
fallen six times for both with both and

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.640 
fallen six times for both with both and
even<00:05:15.460> evening<00:05:16.460> combined<00:05:16.940> and<00:05:17.360> then<00:05:18.260> I<00:05:18.380> will<00:05:18.500> go

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
even evening combined and then I will go

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.710 
even evening combined and then I will go
over<00:05:18.830> to<00:05:18.860> your<00:05:19.190> number<00:05:19.490> one<00:05:19.880> because<00:05:20.270> it<00:05:20.570> has

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
over to your number one because it has

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.170 
over to your number one because it has
fallen<00:05:20.990> four<00:05:21.440> times<00:05:21.710> and<00:05:22.310> I<00:05:22.610> would<00:05:22.790> play<00:05:22.910> this

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
fallen four times and I would play this

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.900 
fallen four times and I would play this
number<00:05:23.600> as<00:05:23.780> well<00:05:24.260> because<00:05:25.130> that<00:05:25.160> gives<00:05:25.639> you

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
number as well because that gives you

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.730 
number as well because that gives you
the<00:05:26.150> idea<00:05:26.510> that<00:05:27.080> they're<00:05:27.260> pulling<00:05:27.470> the

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
the idea that they're pulling the

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.620 
the idea that they're pulling the
numbers<00:05:28.040> for<00:05:28.220> that<00:05:28.340> weeks<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:28.850> most<00:05:29.000> of<00:05:29.419> them

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
numbers for that weeks and most of them

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:36.780 
numbers for that weeks and most of them
is<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.770> number<00:05:31.070> eight<00:05:31.280> six<00:05:32.150> or<00:05:32.360> four<00:05:32.950> so<00:05:33.950> um

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:46.600 

I'm<00:05:37.790> sorry<00:05:38.120> it's<00:05:39.010> number<00:05:40.010> nine<00:05:45.310> so<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.460> most

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
I'm sorry it's number nine so the most

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.659 
I'm sorry it's number nine so the most
numbers<00:05:46.970> for<00:05:47.120> the<00:05:47.210> week<00:05:47.450> would<00:05:47.600> be<00:05:48.669> number

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
numbers for the week would be number

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.270 
numbers for the week would be number
eight<00:05:50.860> number<00:05:51.860> nine<00:05:52.280> and<00:05:53.050> number<00:05:54.050> one<00:05:54.740> because

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
eight number nine and number one because

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.260 
eight number nine and number one because
it's<00:05:55.820> five<00:05:56.090> years<00:05:56.479> six<00:05:56.810> here<00:05:57.110> and<00:05:57.350> four<00:05:57.710> here

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
it's five years six here and four here

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.940 
it's five years six here and four here
so<00:05:59.270> the<00:05:59.750> number<00:05:59.900> that<00:06:00.169> I<00:06:00.200> would<00:06:00.380> play<00:06:00.620> would<00:06:00.830> be

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
so the number that I would play would be

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.640 
so the number that I would play would be
eight<00:06:01.100> nine<00:06:01.340> one<00:06:01.669> and<00:06:01.970> I<00:06:02.720> will<00:06:02.900> play<00:06:03.110> that

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
eight nine one and I will play that

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.680 
eight nine one and I will play that
number<00:06:04.130> into<00:06:04.340> the<00:06:04.580> end<00:06:04.760> of<00:06:04.940> the<00:06:05.030> week<00:06:05.210> as<00:06:05.419> well

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
number into the end of the week as well

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.080 
number into the end of the week as well
and<00:06:06.050> as<00:06:06.680> you<00:06:06.710> see<00:06:07.070> the<00:06:07.340> least<00:06:07.580> amount<00:06:07.940> of

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
and as you see the least amount of

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.020 
and as you see the least amount of
numbers<00:06:08.419> on<00:06:08.570> here<00:06:08.870> would<00:06:09.530> be<00:06:09.710> the<00:06:09.919> zero<00:06:10.220> in<00:06:10.580> the

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
numbers on here would be the zero in the

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.420 
numbers on here would be the zero in the
seven<00:06:11.560> so<00:06:12.560> I<00:06:12.590> would<00:06:12.950> find<00:06:13.729> a<00:06:13.970> way<00:06:14.150> to<00:06:14.210> see<00:06:14.960> that

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
seven so I would find a way to see that

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.790 
seven so I would find a way to see that
to<00:06:16.430> find<00:06:16.640> out<00:06:16.850> which<00:06:17.030> number<00:06:17.419> I<00:06:17.660> can<00:06:18.110> add<00:06:18.500> to

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
to find out which number I can add to

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.770 
to find out which number I can add to
this<00:06:18.979> to<00:06:19.700> make<00:06:19.850> it<00:06:19.910> as<00:06:20.150> you<00:06:20.300> see<00:06:20.450> the<00:06:20.570> zero

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
this to make it as you see the zero

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.440 
this to make it as you see the zero
seven<00:06:21.200> is<00:06:21.320> here<00:06:21.650> so<00:06:22.490> I<00:06:22.520> will<00:06:22.669> play<00:06:22.880> all<00:06:23.120> these

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
seven is here so I will play all these

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.779 
seven is here so I will play all these
numbers<00:06:23.990> here<00:06:24.440> but<00:06:25.190> I<00:06:25.250> would<00:06:25.460> do<00:06:25.550> a<00:06:25.580> different

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
numbers here but I would do a different

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:27.610 
numbers here but I would do a different
combination<00:06:26.120> because<00:06:26.840> of<00:06:27.050> this<00:06:27.169> particular

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
combination because of this particular

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.010 
combination because of this particular
number<00:06:27.710> has<00:06:28.010> four<00:06:28.370> but<00:06:29.240> that's<00:06:29.450> how<00:06:29.600> you<00:06:29.660> find

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
number has four but that's how you find

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.560 
number has four but that's how you find
your<00:06:30.140> do<00:06:30.350> numbers<00:06:30.710> for<00:06:30.890> the<00:06:30.979> week<00:06:31.190> to<00:06:32.060> come<00:06:32.090> as

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
your do numbers for the week to come as

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.650 
your do numbers for the week to come as
well<00:06:32.900> as<00:06:33.080> the<00:06:33.320> month
