where<00:00:43.900> it<00:00:44.020> starts<00:00:44.350> that<00:00:44.470> I<00:00:44.590> got<00:00:44.830> so<00:00:45.400> knowing

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
where it starts that I got so knowing

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.030 
where it starts that I got so knowing
this<00:00:45.820> knowing<00:00:46.660> that<00:00:46.840> screen<00:00:47.350> overload<00:00:47.470> takes

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
this knowing that screen overload takes

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.640 
this knowing that screen overload takes
probably<00:00:48.280> had<00:00:48.580> something<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:48.970> do<00:00:49.150> with<00:00:49.330> it

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
probably had something to do with it

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.560 
probably had something to do with it
figure<00:00:50.650> out<00:00:50.740> if<00:00:50.890> you<00:00:50.980> go<00:00:51.160> into<00:00:51.420> sky<00:00:52.420> be

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
figure out if you go into sky be

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.050 
figure out if you go into sky be
impressed<00:00:53.080> or<00:00:53.410> any<00:00:53.740> which<00:00:54.610> will<00:00:54.760> be<00:00:54.880> in<00:00:54.970> the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
impressed or any which will be in the

impressed or any which will be in the
main<00:00:55.240> folder<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:55.990> then<00:00:56.850> change<00:00:57.850> do<00:00:58.450> depth<00:00:58.780> of

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
main folder and then change do depth of

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.780 
main folder and then change do depth of
field<00:00:59.320> 20<00:00:59.800> instead<00:01:00.490> of<00:01:00.640> one<00:01:01.740> that<00:01:02.740> gets<00:01:03.580> rid<00:01:03.730> of

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
field 20 instead of one that gets rid of

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.560 
field 20 instead of one that gets rid of
the<00:01:03.910> depth<00:01:04.150> of<00:01:04.269> field<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:05.340> it's<00:01:06.340> a<00:01:06.700> lot<00:01:07.390> better

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
the depth of field and it's a lot better

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.710 
the depth of field and it's a lot better
already<00:01:08.470> just<00:01:08.770> by<00:01:09.040> doing<00:01:09.190> that<00:01:09.460> if<00:01:10.240> you<00:01:10.540> want

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
space 1 the more that will do is that

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.630 
space 1 the more that will do is that
will<00:01:45.190> disable<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:46.979> radial<00:01:47.979> blur<00:01:48.130> effect

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
will disable the radial blur effect

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.000 
will disable the radial blur effect
which<00:01:49.060> also<00:01:49.330> comes<00:01:49.750> in<00:01:50.020> when<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.530> press<00:01:50.770> tab

which also comes in when you press tab
and<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:53.500> will<00:01:53.560> make<00:01:53.799> it<00:01:53.979> run

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and it will make it run

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.910 
and it will make it run
hell<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.770> lot<00:01:55.950> smoother<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.590> also<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.740> you

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920
