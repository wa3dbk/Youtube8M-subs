00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
here we go and go okay so what we're

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.390 
here we go and go okay so what we're
doing<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:12.080> we<00:01:13.080> need<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.439> look<00:01:13.920> at<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
doing here is we need to go look at the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.060 
doing here is we need to go look at the
dice<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.420> then<00:01:16.229> predict<00:01:16.770> what

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
dice we have and then predict what

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.600 
dice we have and then predict what
everyone<00:01:17.640> will<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:17.939> total<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.979> um<00:01:20.159> what<00:01:20.580> I

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
everyone will have total so um what I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.450 
everyone will have total so um what I
mean<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.090> if<00:01:21.330> we<00:01:21.479> took<00:01:21.689> everyone's<00:01:22.259> dice<00:01:22.950> took

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
mean is if we took everyone's dice took

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.670 
mean is if we took everyone's dice took
the<00:01:24.299> two<00:01:24.479> other<00:01:24.630> took<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> dice<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> two

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the two other took the dice of the two

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.200 
the two other took the dice of the two
other<00:01:25.860> players<00:01:26.130> I'm<00:01:26.369> playing<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.970> my

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
dice and we put them all together I'm

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.670 
dice and we put them all together I'm
trying<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> guess<00:01:29.780> how<00:01:30.780> many<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.320> certain

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
trying to guess how many of a certain

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.990 
trying to guess how many of a certain
number<00:01:31.770> we'd<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.549> put<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> dice

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
number we'd have if we put all the dice

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.980 
number we'd have if we put all the dice
together<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:34.860> um<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:36.420> say<00:01:36.600> there<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:36.840> two

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
together so um if I say there are two

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.940 
together so um if I say there are two
fives<00:01:37.530> I'm<00:01:38.520> saying<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.270> there<00:01:39.509> are<00:01:39.689> two<00:01:39.960> five

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
fives I'm saying that there are two five

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.980 
fives I'm saying that there are two five
two<00:01:41.579> or<00:01:41.610> more<00:01:42.090> fives<00:01:42.829> total<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:44.159> everyone<00:01:44.990> so

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
two or more fives total for everyone so

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.510 
two or more fives total for everyone so
if<00:01:47.000> we<00:01:48.000> took<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.960> dice<00:01:49.200> his<00:01:49.950> dice<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
if we took my dice his dice and the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.300 
if we took my dice his dice and the
other<00:01:50.640> guys<00:01:50.880> dice<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.420> pum<00:01:51.930> all<00:01:52.049> together<00:01:52.350> we

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
other guys dice and pum all together we

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.730 
other guys dice and pum all together we
would<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:53.939> least<00:01:54.229> two<00:01:55.229> or<00:01:55.500> more<00:01:55.530> fives<00:01:57.740> so

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
would have at least two or more fives so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.590 
would have at least two or more fives so
since<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.579> have<00:01:59.700> two<00:01:59.850> fives<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.299> obvious

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
since I have two fives that obvious

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.810 
since I have two fives that obvious
means<00:02:00.899> there<00:02:01.290> are<00:02:01.469> two<00:02:01.710> fives<00:02:02.009> or<00:02:02.219> more<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.670> the

fives<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.650> table<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.900> that's<00:02:31.470> what<00:02:31.709> will

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
fives on the table so that's what will

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.110 
fives on the table so that's what will
happen<00:02:31.920> if<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.250> come<00:02:32.400> up<00:02:32.430> laughs<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.820> if<00:02:32.970> you

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
happen if you come up laughs and if you

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.910 
happen if you come up laughs and if you
declare<00:02:34.050> bid<00:02:34.350> spot-on

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
declare bid spot-on

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.650 
declare bid spot-on
that<00:02:35.610> means<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.000> believe<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.330> there

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
that means that you believe that there

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.920 
that means that you believe that there
are<00:02:36.720> exactly<00:02:37.709> five<00:02:38.610> fives<00:02:38.940> no<00:02:39.390> more<00:02:39.630> no<00:02:39.900> less

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
are exactly five fives no more no less
