around<00:00:11.700> us<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.660> because<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.019> made

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
around us that is because I made

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.010 
around us that is because I made
something<00:00:13.769> like<00:00:14.490> all<00:00:14.759> monster<00:00:15.480> dispenser

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
something like all monster dispenser

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.370 
something like all monster dispenser
it's<00:00:16.289> pretty<00:00:16.529> cool<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.720> let's<00:00:18.720> actually<00:00:18.960> turn

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
it's pretty cool and let's actually turn

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.929 
it's pretty cool and let's actually turn
down<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.770> volume<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.310> little<00:00:20.340> bit<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:20.850> you

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
down the volume a little bit so you

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.560 
down the volume a little bit so you
don't<00:00:21.060> have<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.270> hear<00:00:21.650> those<00:00:22.650> monsters<00:00:23.570> but

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
don't have to hear those monsters but

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.480 
don't have to hear those monsters but
anyway<00:00:26.900> well<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.140> kind<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.740> explain<00:00:29.130> how<00:00:29.310> this

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
anyway well I kind of explain how this

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.830 
anyway well I kind of explain how this
works<00:00:30.320> so<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.679> have<00:00:31.980> our<00:00:32.219> long<00:00:32.640> hallway<00:00:33.510> okay

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
works so we have our long hallway okay

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.440 
works so we have our long hallway okay
and<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:35.010> pressure<00:00:35.340> plates<00:00:35.700> okay<00:00:36.090> I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and we have to pressure plates okay I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.350 
and we have to pressure plates okay I
step<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> crack<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:37.969> nothing<00:00:38.969> happens

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
step on the crack one nothing happens

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.670 
step on the crack one nothing happens
okay<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.530> step<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.370> wrong<00:00:41.670> one

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
okay but if we step on the wrong one

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.410 
okay but if we step on the wrong one
whole<00:00:43.680> bunch<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.010> monsters<00:00:44.190> will<00:00:45.090> come<00:00:45.270> out

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
whole bunch of monsters will come out

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
whole bunch of monsters will come out
and<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.899> course<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.500> probably<00:00:48.590> monsters<00:00:49.590> that

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and of course and probably monsters that

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.290 
and of course and probably monsters that
will<00:00:50.489> come<00:00:50.969> out<00:00:51.090> okay<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:53.129> that's<00:00:54.120> what

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
will come out okay so that's what

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.979 
will come out okay so that's what
happens<00:00:55.309> okay<00:00:56.420> same<00:00:57.420> thing<00:00:57.629> happened<00:00:57.960> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
happens okay same thing happened to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.560 
happens okay same thing happened to
overhear<00:00:58.760> we<00:00:59.760> step<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> crack<00:01:00.270> one

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
overhear we step on the crack one

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.569 
overhear we step on the crack one
nothing<00:01:00.899> happens<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.070> step<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
nothing happens but if we step on the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
wrong one a certain amount of monsters

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.280 
wrong one a certain amount of monsters
will<00:01:06.630> fall<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.140> okay<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:09.570> let's<00:01:09.900> actually<00:01:10.049> get

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
will fall out okay so let's actually get

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.510 
will fall out okay so let's actually get
on<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.590> how<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:10.979> works<00:01:12.409> I<00:01:13.409> won't<00:01:14.100> change<00:01:14.340> it

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
on to how this works I won't change it

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.090 
on to how this works I won't change it
today<00:01:15.330> yet<00:01:15.869> but<00:01:16.799> let's<00:01:17.130> fly<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.610> here<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:19.100> you

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
today yet but let's fly up here and you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.950 
today yet but let's fly up here and you
can<00:01:20.220> see<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.580> there<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:20.759> monsters<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.689> top

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
can see that there are monsters on top

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.830 
can see that there are monsters on top
of<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:22.259> okay<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.270> once<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.420> steps<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
of here okay and once it steps on a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.749 
of here okay and once it steps on a
pressure<00:01:25.110> plate<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:25.920> wants<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.310> fall<00:01:26.549> in

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
pressure plate or just wants to fall in

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.480 
pressure plate or just wants to fall in
it<00:01:27.030> will<00:01:27.509> land<00:01:27.750> here<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.409> then<00:01:29.009> when<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.250> step

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it will land here and then when we step

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.280 
it will land here and then when we step
on<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> pressure<00:01:29.880> plate<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.540> will<00:01:31.020> send<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
on the pressure plate it will send a

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.410 
on the pressure plate it will send a
signal<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:32.009> piston<00:01:32.460> over<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:32.939> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
signal to this piston over here to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.870 
signal to this piston over here to
retract<00:01:33.780> back<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.320> causing<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.159> fall<00:01:35.280> okay

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
retract back in causing it to fall okay

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.670 
retract back in causing it to fall okay
and<00:01:36.060> then<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.750> our<00:01:36.960> monster<00:01:37.380> spawner

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and then we have our monster spawner

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.109 
and then we have our monster spawner
here<00:01:38.040> i'm<00:01:38.220> using<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.670> mod<00:01:38.930> GUI<00:01:39.930> spawner<00:01:40.970> to<00:01:41.970> be

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
here i'm using the mod GUI spawner to be

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.780 
here i'm using the mod GUI spawner to be
able<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.360> select<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:43.439> type<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.829> mob<00:01:44.130> who<00:01:44.490> would

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
able to select the type of mob who would

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.440 
able to select the type of mob who would
like<00:01:44.970> okay<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.810> let's<00:01:46.020> actually<00:01:46.170> i<00:01:47.180> get<00:01:48.180> on<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
like okay so let's actually i get on to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.090 
like okay so let's actually i get on to
how<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.659> actually<00:01:48.899> make<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.380> okay<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.740> let's

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
how you actually make this okay so let's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.990 
how you actually make this okay so let's
change<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.610> back<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.119> peaceful

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
change this back to peaceful

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.639 
change this back to peaceful
so<00:01:54.000> you're<00:01:54.149> going<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.390> want<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:55.079> pressure

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
so you're going to want to pressure

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.149 
so you're going to want to pressure
plates<00:01:56.039> I<00:01:56.810> would<00:01:57.810> suggest<00:01:58.020> stone<00:01:58.560> but<00:01:59.039> it

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
plates I would suggest stone but it

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.880 
plates I would suggest stone but it
doesn't<00:01:59.460> really<00:01:59.579> matter<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.710> you're<00:02:01.710> going

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
doesn't really matter and you're going

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
okay so let's make about two blocks up

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:16.430 
okay so let's make about two blocks up
from<00:02:10.709> here<00:02:11.280> okay<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:12.530> we'll<00:02:13.530> place<00:02:15.440> will

from here okay and we'll place will

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.910 
from here okay and we'll place will
place<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:17.660> stone<00:02:18.660> pressure<00:02:18.959> plate<00:02:19.290> on<00:02:19.470> each<00:02:19.650> one

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
place a stone pressure plate on each one

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.289 
place a stone pressure plate on each one
of<00:02:19.980> these<00:02:20.160> blocks<00:02:20.489> okay<00:02:20.910> from<00:02:21.720> here<00:02:22.049> put<00:02:22.709> down

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
of these blocks okay from here put down

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.850 
of these blocks okay from here put down
redstone<00:02:24.299> on<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.810> one<00:02:25.019> that<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.319> want<00:02:25.530> to

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
redstone on the one that you want to

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.030 
redstone on the one that you want to
open<00:02:26.579> up<00:02:26.760> or<00:02:27.480> n<00:02:27.660> let<00:02:27.900> monsters<00:02:28.500> come<00:02:28.680> out<00:02:28.709> okay

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
open up or n let monsters come out okay

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.210 
open up or n let monsters come out okay
so<00:02:29.099> we'll<00:02:29.819> just<00:02:30.150> kind<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.569> make<00:02:31.410> ourselves<00:02:31.739> a

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
so we'll just kind of make ourselves a

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.280 
so we'll just kind of make ourselves a
little<00:02:32.340> walking<00:02:32.790> pad<00:02:34.970> okay<00:02:35.970> from<00:02:36.870> here<00:02:37.079> now

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
little walking pad okay from here now

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.229 
little walking pad okay from here now
you're<00:02:37.500> going<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.920> want<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.250> make<00:02:38.549> a<00:02:38.579> ceiling

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
you're going to want to make a ceiling

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.470 
you're going to want to make a ceiling
so<00:02:39.930> maybe<00:02:40.530> about<00:02:41.120> two<00:02:42.120> blocks<00:02:42.480> up<00:02:43.459> so<00:02:44.480> when

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
so maybe about two blocks up so when

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.900 
so maybe about two blocks up so when
under<00:02:45.870> they<00:02:46.170> can't<00:02:46.410> jump<00:02:46.829> over<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.670> pressure

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
under they can't jump over the pressure

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.059 
under they can't jump over the pressure
plates<00:02:48.269> they<00:02:48.690> must<00:02:48.900> choose<00:02:49.290> one<00:02:49.910> so<00:02:50.910> as<00:02:52.069> you

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
plates they must choose one so as you

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.130 
plates they must choose one so as you
can<00:02:53.160> see<00:02:53.370> if<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.819> can't<00:02:54.180> jump<00:02:54.569> over<00:02:54.750> these

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
can see if I I can't jump over these

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.030 
can see if I I can't jump over these
okay<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:56.340> from<00:02:56.970> here<00:02:57.180> now<00:02:57.359> we're<00:02:57.420> going<00:02:57.870> to

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
okay so from here now we're going to

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.539 
okay so from here now we're going to
kind<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.250> bring<00:03:00.350> this<00:03:01.350> pathway<00:03:01.709> out<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.250> little

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
kind of bring this pathway out a little

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:15.770 
kind of bring this pathway out a little
bit

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.780

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
walkway set up a little bit now we need

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.630 
walkway set up a little bit now we need
to<00:03:22.270> add<00:03:22.660> in<00:03:22.810> our<00:03:22.900> piston<00:03:23.380> okay<00:03:23.800> so<00:03:23.860> we<00:03:24.430> have<00:03:24.610> our

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
to add in our piston okay so we have our

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.190 
to add in our piston okay so we have our
redstone<00:03:25.239> right<00:03:25.390> here<00:03:25.660> we're<00:03:25.870> going<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.050> have

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
redstone right here we're going to have

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.040 
redstone right here we're going to have
this<00:03:27.060> we're<00:03:28.060> going<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.209> add<00:03:28.300> a<00:03:28.720> redstone

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
this we're going to add a redstone

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.470 
this we're going to add a redstone
repeater<00:03:29.590> on<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.459> other<00:03:30.610> side<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:30.940> this<00:03:31.150> okay

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
to put our piston to hold all the

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.680 
to put our piston to hold all the
monsters<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.260> little<00:04:02.709> bit<00:04:03.090> further<00:04:04.090> out<00:04:04.390> so

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
monsters a little bit further out so

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.250 
monsters a little bit further out so
let's<00:04:05.019> get<00:04:05.170> our<00:04:05.440> piston<00:04:06.400> out<00:04:06.930> actually<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:07.959> need

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
let's get our piston out actually I need

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.930 
let's get our piston out actually I need
this<00:04:08.790> don't<00:04:09.790> need<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.239> and<00:04:11.580> we'll<00:04:12.580> make<00:04:12.760> sure

going<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:16.959> put<00:04:17.919> our<00:04:18.160> piston<00:04:18.900> right<00:04:19.900> here<00:04:20.169> okay

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
going to put our piston right here okay

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.710 
going to put our piston right here okay
and<00:04:21.180> let's<00:04:22.180> add<00:04:22.360> in<00:04:22.750> red<00:04:23.169> stone<00:04:24.090> right<00:04:25.090> here<00:04:25.300> ok

and let's add in red stone right here ok

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.190 
and let's add in red stone right here ok
and<00:04:25.930> then<00:04:25.990> let's<00:04:26.470> add<00:04:26.710> in<00:04:26.979> our<00:04:27.340> little<00:04:27.610> ceiling

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.210 

like<00:04:32.200> that<00:04:33.990> okay<00:04:34.990> so<00:04:35.560> now<00:04:35.830> that<00:04:35.860> we<00:04:36.070> have<00:04:36.100> our

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
like that okay so now that we have our

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.779 
like that okay so now that we have our
ceiling<00:04:36.760> as<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.150> can<00:04:37.330> see<00:04:37.539> if<00:04:37.810> we<00:04:38.080> were<00:04:38.260> to

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
ceiling as you can see if we were to

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.790 
ceiling as you can see if we were to
step<00:04:39.789> on<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.060> correct<00:04:40.360> pressure<00:04:40.539> plate<00:04:40.930> that

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
step on the correct pressure plate that

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.640 
step on the correct pressure plate that
part<00:04:42.070> of<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.400> wall<00:04:42.580> will<00:04:42.880> fall<00:04:43.120> okay<00:04:43.570> or<00:04:44.320> come

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
part of the wall will fall okay or come

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.180 
part of the wall will fall okay or come
in<00:04:44.889> if<00:04:45.310> we<00:04:45.400> step<00:04:45.610> on<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:45.880> correct<00:04:46.270> one<00:04:46.539> or<00:04:46.810> the

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
in if we step on the correct one or the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.029 
in if we step on the correct one or the
one<00:04:48.190> that<00:04:48.370> doesn't<00:04:48.600> toggle<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:50.039> piston

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
one that doesn't toggle the piston

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.279 
one that doesn't toggle the piston
nothing<00:04:51.460> will<00:04:51.610> happen<00:04:51.639> okay<00:04:52.180> so<00:04:52.930> now<00:04:53.080> from

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
nothing will happen okay so now from

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.190 
nothing will happen okay so now from
here<00:04:53.320> we're<00:04:53.830> going<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:54.460> make<00:04:55.360> our<00:04:55.630> little

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
here we're going to make our little

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.290 
here we're going to make our little
monster<00:04:57.100> dispenser<00:04:57.610> thing<00:04:57.820> okay

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
monster dispenser thing okay

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.469 
monster dispenser thing okay
so<00:05:00.199> we're<00:05:00.830> going<00:05:00.949> to<00:05:01.250> surround<00:05:01.729> this<00:05:02.150> hole

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
so we're going to surround this hole

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.140 
so we're going to surround this hole
right<00:05:02.990> here<00:05:03.050> okay<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:03.800> then<00:05:04.639> i'm<00:05:04.940> going<00:05:05.090> to

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
right here okay and then i'm going to

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.760 
right here okay and then i'm going to
use<00:05:05.330> worldedit<00:05:05.780> to<00:05:06.080> make<00:05:06.229> this<00:05:06.349> go<00:05:06.590> a<00:05:06.620> little

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
use worldedit to make this go a little

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.490 
use worldedit to make this go a little
bit<00:05:06.979> faster<00:05:07.389> but<00:05:08.389> we're<00:05:08.930> going<00:05:09.050> to<00:05:09.139> stack<00:05:09.470> it

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
bit faster but we're going to stack it

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.140 
bit faster but we're going to stack it
about<00:05:09.919> five<00:05:10.190> times<00:05:11.680> oops<00:05:12.680> that<00:05:13.430> was<00:05:13.940> not

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
about five times oops that was not

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.839 
about five times oops that was not
wanted<00:05:14.690> undo<00:05:15.159> stack<00:05:16.180> five<00:05:17.180> up<00:05:17.539> I<00:05:18.550> this<00:05:19.550> is<00:05:19.699> just

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
wanted undo stack five up I this is just

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.520 
wanted undo stack five up I this is just
how<00:05:19.940> many<00:05:20.090> times<00:05:20.330> I<00:05:20.509> do<00:05:20.569> it<00:05:20.840> but<00:05:21.050> it<00:05:21.229> doesn't

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
how many times I do it but it doesn't

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.770 
how many times I do it but it doesn't
really<00:05:21.620> matter<00:05:21.860> and<00:05:22.449> we're<00:05:23.449> going<00:05:23.599> to<00:05:23.659> put

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
really matter and we're going to put

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.240 
really matter and we're going to put
another<00:05:23.900> pressure<00:05:24.319> plate<00:05:24.620> right<00:05:24.770> here<00:05:24.800> okay

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
another pressure plate right here okay

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.520 
another pressure plate right here okay
from<00:05:25.759> here<00:05:25.940> we're<00:05:26.120> going<00:05:26.150> to<00:05:26.539> outline<00:05:27.110> the

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
from here we're going to outline the

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:37.719 
from here we're going to outline the
sides<00:05:34.960> ok<00:05:35.960> so<00:05:36.020> now<00:05:36.680> from<00:05:37.159> here<00:05:37.190> we're<00:05:37.580> just

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
sides ok so now from here we're just

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.309 
sides ok so now from here we're just
going<00:05:37.849> to<00:05:37.879> add<00:05:38.030> a<00:05:38.060> redstone<00:05:38.509> repeater<00:05:39.020> and

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 
going to add a redstone repeater and

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:43.149 
going to add a redstone repeater and
then<00:05:40.099> we'll<00:05:40.250> add<00:05:40.490> another<00:05:41.050> block<00:05:42.050> about<00:05:42.919> right

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
then we'll add another block about right

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:47.740 
then we'll add another block about right
here<00:05:43.460> and<00:05:43.930> we<00:05:44.930> will<00:05:45.169> put<00:05:45.949> down<00:05:46.569> piece<00:05:47.569> of

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
here and we will put down piece of

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.240 
here and we will put down piece of
redstone<00:05:47.930> right<00:05:48.259> here<00:05:48.440> and<00:05:48.650> then<00:05:48.800> this<00:05:48.979> part

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
redstone right here and then this part

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.939 
redstone right here and then this part
you<00:05:49.879> can<00:05:50.030> add<00:05:50.210> in<00:05:50.419> a<00:05:50.509> regular<00:05:50.930> piston<00:05:51.379> or<00:05:51.560> just

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
you can add in a regular piston or just

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:53.740 
you can add in a regular piston or just
sticky<00:05:52.490> piston<00:05:52.879> i'm<00:05:53.000> just<00:05:53.180> going<00:05:53.300> to<00:05:53.330> use<00:05:53.599> a

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:39.699 
the ceiling so when it's a day out the

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.560 
the ceiling so when it's a day out the
monsters<00:06:40.180> will<00:06:40.720> not<00:06:40.900> burn<00:06:41.410> so<00:06:42.250> now<00:06:42.820> every<00:06:43.330> time

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 
you step on this pressure plate you will

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.400 
you step on this pressure plate you will
get<00:06:45.729> moved<00:06:46.030> out<00:06:46.300> from<00:06:46.360> here<00:06:46.960> ok<00:06:47.260> and<00:06:47.500> then

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.410 
get moved out from here ok and then

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.600 
get moved out from here ok and then
believe<00:06:50.410> it<00:06:50.530> or<00:06:50.590> not<00:06:50.770> monsters<00:06:51.250> will<00:06:51.460> not

stack<00:06:52.539> on<00:06:52.720> top<00:06:52.750> of<00:06:52.960> each<00:06:53.199> other<00:06:53.380> so<00:06:53.560> you'll

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
stack on top of each other so you'll

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.310 
stack on top of each other so you'll
have<00:06:54.580> a<00:06:54.610> bunch<00:06:55.180> in<00:06:55.510> there<00:06:55.539> depending<00:06:56.050> on<00:06:56.199> how

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:56.320 
have a bunch in there depending on how

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.909 
have a bunch in there depending on how
many<00:06:56.380> are<00:06:56.680> in<00:06:56.710> there<00:06:56.830> so<00:06:57.820> now<00:06:58.419> one<00:06:59.260> monster

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 
many are in there so now one monster

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.890 
many are in there so now one monster
Falls<00:07:00.160> if<00:07:00.460> they<00:07:00.639> step<00:07:00.880> on<00:07:01.120> the<00:07:01.300> pressure<00:07:01.720> plate

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900 
Falls if they step on the pressure plate

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.189 
Falls if they step on the pressure plate
it<00:07:02.590> will<00:07:02.770> fall<00:07:03.039> and<00:07:03.600> monsters<00:07:04.600> will<00:07:04.780> drop<00:07:04.990> down

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 
it will fall and monsters will drop down

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:09.180 
it will fall and monsters will drop down
and<00:07:05.410> then<00:07:05.820> you<00:07:06.820> can<00:07:07.090> fight<00:07:08.020> them<00:07:08.260> so<00:07:08.590> just<00:07:09.010> a

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190 
and then you can fight them so just a

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.180 
and then you can fight them so just a
little<00:07:09.490> idea<00:07:10.150> I<00:07:10.600> thought<00:07:11.470> of<00:07:11.650> when<00:07:11.800> I<00:07:11.889> was<00:07:11.919> at

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:12.190 
little idea I thought of when I was at

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.710 
little idea I thought of when I was at
school<00:07:12.220> and<00:07:12.850> decided<00:07:13.000> to<00:07:13.360> make<00:07:13.539> it<00:07:13.860> it's<00:07:14.860> a

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 
school and decided to make it it's a

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.779 
school and decided to make it it's a
monster<00:07:16.720> dispenser<00:07:17.380> very<00:07:17.889> good<00:07:18.520> for
