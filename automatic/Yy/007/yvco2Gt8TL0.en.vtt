00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.480
 to 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.490
 there are very good new video kids in 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.190
 this ocation we are here to solve 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.870
 an error that happens a lot between 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.930
 windows windows users sorry 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.080
 and good which is the we have windows 8 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.670
 and we go to our store as 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.040
 deferred I have the 81 that is what we 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.800
 interested we are going here we are going to 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.710
 the store 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.710
 ok and we get this is not 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.589
 we get this, it does not know we can 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.260
 update to 81 not the previous one is worth the 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.900
 better windows 81 version the one that we have 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.930
 OK 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.530
 what investment is worth 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.210
 and well we give everything perfect and the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.800
 first mistake that can occur is this 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.340
 something happened and can not be installed 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.010
 windows 8.1 this code error is worth not 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.150
 nothing happens 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.310
 there is a solution and it is the same for both 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.060
 already downloaded and we are installing it 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.820
 and we get this in the installation your pc 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.580
 does not have unpublished information to restore 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:23.409
 the system so that it works and you go back to 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.240
 version 81 to 81 because you prefer 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.820
 the ones from Microsoft have screwed up 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.549
 the update to me happened to me with a 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.060
 professional version they had the 32 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.240
 bit the pirate but bad also happened 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.740
 with the Danish originals they told me 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.850
 well how do we solve this is very 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.850
 easy we come here 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.490
 to sanz google 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.580
 and we're going to need three little things are 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.980
 all good 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.420
 let's put more let's be two usb 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:00.900
 minimum four gigs of ram 4 gb of ram 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.540
 of ram of 4 gb of space sorry I'm 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.420
 thinking about other good things then 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.300
 we are also going to need the program 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.550
 to bounce windows that we're going to in 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.810
 original I will also leave you in the 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.200
 description 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.510
 that left the description the iso of 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.650
 windows 7 now explain why and the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.840
 iso Windows 8.1'd better let 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.270
 do 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.840
 let's do the following 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.490
 we take a pendrive me as I do not like 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.300
 I have now, I'm not going to do it 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.300
 virtually 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.990
 if we say that we have put our 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.990
 pendrive 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.280
 we mount our iso file of the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.280
 Following way 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.879
 it's windows 7 usb 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.050
 well here we would put our iso 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.770
 in this case the windows 7 that is this 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.620
 we give to next will be our usb here we give 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.410
 to beijing and start putting it once 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.190
 finished we close it and it's good 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.040
 it's already once we've done that I 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.819
 I'm going to ride it from here, it's worth not 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.659
 you do that 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.659
 once mounted 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.520
 let's say this is our usb and has 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.160
 mounted a game you have more files 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.830
 but basically this is what we give the 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.430
 windows 7 setup that remember you 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.430
 we give yes 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.320
 and give us the option to install a 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.210
 we install it normal one time 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.819
 installed 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.980
 If you do not know how to install it 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.260
 It's very easy, it tells you everything 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.689
 it practically even tells you that you can 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.150
 save the files without losing them like this 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:12.420
 what perfect is we here in winton 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.799
 7 perfect since from windows 7 with 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.799
 our drip program 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.860
 and remember to keep the iso of 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.570
 windows 8.1 that's very important then 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.170
 we do the same but with windows 8 1 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.950
 with the same program and we give it 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.639
 and now if we use the windows setup 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:35.719
 8.1 we give it twice this one 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:39.680
 what would be windows 7 does not come out the setup 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:44.060
 and we installed windows 8.1 again and now 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.729
 we will have the 8.1 now we have 8.1 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.849
 but that activate it as it activates very 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:53.160
 easy I'll leave you in this corner for 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:56.400
 example over here on the screen 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.830
 a label or a link for you to go 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.160
 how to activate windows is worth that program 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.590
 It's worth as much for sight as 7 as the 8 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.260
 as the 81 is worth doubt with those four 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.580
 systems and even with the servers I think 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.680
 that also with windows server also 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.330
 well basically that's how it is 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.220
 solve this error can not be like 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.860
 yes be in the systems as it is very 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.430
 simple and I do not have much time but if 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.080
 you want I do not do it apart though I think 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.670
 that can not or can not and I'm sorry 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.350
 but quiet to the installation very 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.750
 simple just follow the steps that we 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.690
 mark on the screen because windows of 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.000
 only installers that are very easy and 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.070
 nothing basically that we see ourselves in the 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.040
 next video that I will upload will be worth little 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.170
 before this video you will have the special 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.320

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.030
 minutes at last after one hour and two

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.510
 have liked this video have you 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.370
 solved the problem because this is 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.980
 very simple since it happened to me too 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.270
 it leaves totally full worth here what 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.070
 you can see 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.890
 and well basically this is the 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.840
 tutorial later I will teach you new 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.590
