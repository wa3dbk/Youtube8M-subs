part<00:02:44.650> sits<00:02:44.980> on<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.280> face<00:02:45.550> of<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.180> ramp<00:02:47.520> we'll

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
part sits on the face of the ramp we'll

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.420 
part sits on the face of the ramp we'll
go<00:02:48.640> back<00:02:48.820> through<00:02:49.180> each<00:02:49.600> one<00:02:49.840> of<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.020> bolts

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
go back through each one of the bolts

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.789 
go back through each one of the bolts
we're<00:02:51.430> gonna<00:02:51.550> tighten<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.000> coping<00:02:52.390> first<00:02:52.799> you

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
we're gonna tighten the coping first you

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.310 
we're gonna tighten the coping first you
want<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.100> snug<00:02:54.370> but<00:02:55.180> not<00:02:55.360> over<00:02:55.630> tighten<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.200> it

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
want it snug but not over tighten so it

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.890 
want it snug but not over tighten so it
allows<00:02:56.560> some<00:02:57.010> adjustability<00:02:57.910> when<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.660> touch

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
allows some adjustability when you touch

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.789 
allows some adjustability when you touch
attach<00:02:59.620> these<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.250> other<00:03:00.340> ramps<00:03:01.799> again

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
attach these to the other ramps again

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.340 
attach these to the other ramps again
starting<00:03:03.519> with<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.730> coping<00:03:04.230> using<00:03:05.230> the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
starting with the coping using the

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
supplied allen key and wrench will

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.640 
supplied allen key and wrench will
tighten<00:03:09.040> all<00:03:09.160> four<00:03:09.430> of<00:03:09.459> these<00:03:10.500> just<00:03:11.500> so

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
tighten all four of these just so

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.070 
tighten all four of these just so
they're<00:03:11.830> snug<00:03:11.950> but<00:03:12.489> not<00:03:12.519> over<00:03:12.970> tightened<00:03:13.360> to

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
they're snug but not over tightened to

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.990 
they're snug but not over tightened to
allow<00:03:14.290> some<00:03:14.709> maneuverability<00:03:15.610> when<00:03:15.910> you

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
allow some maneuverability when you

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.850 
allow some maneuverability when you
attach<00:03:16.239> them<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.690> other<00:03:16.810> ramps<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:17.709> that

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
attach them to the other ramps so that

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.940 
attach them to the other ramps so that
they<00:03:17.980> line<00:03:18.190> up<00:03:18.340> properly

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.000 

from<00:03:23.640> here<00:03:23.940> we<00:03:24.480> will<00:03:24.599> go<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.840> our<00:03:25.110> hinge<00:03:25.410> long

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
from here we will go to our hinge long

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.690 
from here we will go to our hinge long
bolts<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:27.330> three<00:03:27.569> Center<00:03:27.900> bolts<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.700> tighten

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
bolts the three Center bolts and tighten

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.180 
bolts the three Center bolts and tighten
these<00:03:29.970> up<00:03:30.209> as<00:03:30.390> well<00:03:30.630> there's<00:03:31.560> important<00:03:32.040> that

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
these up as well there's important that

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.589 
these up as well there's important that
you<00:03:32.370> do<00:03:32.849> not<00:03:33.000> over<00:03:33.360> tighten<00:03:33.630> these<00:03:35.209> if<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.420> do

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
you do not over tighten these if you do

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.630 
you do not over tighten these if you do
over<00:03:36.870> tighten<00:03:37.200> them<00:03:37.349> it<00:03:37.709> will<00:03:37.860> cause<00:03:38.099> binding

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
over tighten them it will cause binding

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.300 
over tighten them it will cause binding
and<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.849> ramp<00:03:39.060> will<00:03:39.270> not<00:03:39.450> fold<00:03:39.900> for<00:03:40.440> storage

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.040 

so<00:03:47.310> we'll<00:03:47.459> go<00:03:47.580> down<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.940> line<00:03:47.970> tighten<00:03:48.959> each

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
so we'll go down the line tighten each

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.170 
so we'll go down the line tighten each
one<00:03:49.080> of<00:03:49.410> these<00:03:50.269> insert<00:03:51.269> allen<00:03:51.630> key<00:03:53.030> snug<00:03:54.030> it

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
one of these insert allen key snug it

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.300 
one of these insert allen key snug it
with<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.540> wrench<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.010> bolt<00:03:56.220> just

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
with the wrench so that the bolt just

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.180 
with the wrench so that the bolt just
touches<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.269> hinges<00:03:58.130> do<00:03:59.130> not<00:03:59.310> over<00:03:59.580> tighten

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
touches the hinges do not over tighten

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.059 
touches the hinges do not over tighten
and<00:04:02.269> you're<00:04:03.269> all<00:04:03.360> set

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
and you're all set

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.070 
and you're all set
next<00:04:05.069> we'll<00:04:05.190> take<00:04:05.340> our<00:04:05.400> legs<00:04:05.760> make<00:04:06.750> sure<00:04:06.900> that

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
next we'll take our legs make sure that

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.100 
next we'll take our legs make sure that
you<00:04:07.170> have<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.410> angle<00:04:07.739> properly<00:04:08.310> aligned<00:04:09.110> it

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
you have the angle properly aligned it

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.720 
you have the angle properly aligned it
is<00:04:10.290> possible<00:04:10.799> for<00:04:10.830> these<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.280> be<00:04:11.310> put<00:04:11.610> in

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
is possible for these to be put in

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.270 
is possible for these to be put in
backwards<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:13.140> line<00:04:13.319> them<00:04:13.470> up<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.890> right<00:04:14.069> way

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
backwards so line them up the right way

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.969 
backwards so line them up the right way
what<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.850> angle<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.269> shown<00:04:15.680> we'll<00:04:16.680> tighten

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
what the angle is shown we'll tighten

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.789 
what the angle is shown we'll tighten
the<00:04:17.130> knobs<00:04:17.519> do<00:04:18.479> not<00:04:18.660> use<00:04:18.870> any<00:04:19.049> tools<00:04:19.169> when

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
the knobs do not use any tools when

the knobs do not use any tools when
you're<00:04:19.919> tightening<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.370> knobs<00:04:20.579> as<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.660> will

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
you're tightening the knobs as you will

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.760 
you're tightening the knobs as you will
cause<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.650> knobs<00:04:22.889> to<00:04:23.070> break<00:04:24.470> they<00:04:25.470> do<00:04:25.530> not

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
cause the knobs to break they do not

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.760 
cause the knobs to break they do not
need<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.190> be<00:04:26.490> too<00:04:26.910> tight<00:04:27.150> just<00:04:28.080> nice<00:04:28.289> and<00:04:28.320> snug

need to be too tight just nice and snug

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.279 
need to be too tight just nice and snug
so<00:04:28.979> that<00:04:29.039> they<00:04:29.250> hold<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.520> legs<00:04:29.729> in<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.780> then

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
so that they hold the legs in and then

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.750 
so that they hold the legs in and then
