when<00:00:03.480> we're<00:00:03.630> climbing<00:00:03.960> seated<00:00:04.290> we're<00:00:04.470> able<00:00:04.830> to

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
when we're climbing seated we're able to

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.889 
when we're climbing seated we're able to
really<00:00:05.340> conserve<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.850> lot<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.359> energy<00:00:06.510> I'm

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
really conserve a lot of energy I'm

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.030 
really conserve a lot of energy I'm
going<00:00:07.050> to<00:00:07.170> show<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.349> some<00:00:07.590> of<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.769> ways<00:00:07.890> that

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
going to show you some of the ways that

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.740 
going to show you some of the ways that
I<00:00:08.130> save<00:00:08.580> energy<00:00:08.790> while<00:00:09.120> I'm<00:00:09.240> climbing<00:00:09.420> now

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
I save energy while I'm climbing now

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.079 
I save energy while I'm climbing now
first<00:00:10.650> thing<00:00:10.830> I'm<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.190> an<00:00:11.309> easier<00:00:11.610> gear<00:00:11.879> than<00:00:12.030> I

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:12.089 
first thing I'm in an easier gear than I

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.079 
first thing I'm in an easier gear than I
would<00:00:12.240> be<00:00:12.269> if<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.509> distended<00:00:13.759> second<00:00:14.759> thing<00:00:14.910> is

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
would be if I distended second thing is

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.510 
would be if I distended second thing is
you<00:00:15.480> know<00:00:15.599> I'm<00:00:16.440> just<00:00:16.620> really<00:00:17.220> lightly

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
you know I'm just really lightly

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.700 
you know I'm just really lightly
grasping<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.360> handle<00:00:18.390> bars<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:19.289> almost

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
grasping the handle bars it's almost

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.550 
grasping the handle bars it's almost
like<00:00:20.070> I'm<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.720> handlebars<00:00:22.170> just

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
like I'm just on the handlebars just

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.279 
like I'm just on the handlebars just
touching<00:00:22.920> them<00:00:23.210> you<00:00:24.210> know<00:00:24.300> sometimes<00:00:24.900> you

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
touching them you know sometimes you

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.870 
touching them you know sometimes you
don't<00:00:25.380> even<00:00:25.529> need<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.890> fully<00:00:26.189> wrap<00:00:26.519> your<00:00:26.699> hands

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
don't even need to fully wrap your hands

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.339 
don't even need to fully wrap your hands
around<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.390> save<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> lot<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.810> energy<00:00:28.109> that

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
around you can save a lot of energy that

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.450 
around you can save a lot of energy that
way<00:00:29.000> so<00:00:30.349> I'm<00:00:31.349> not<00:00:31.529> using<00:00:31.740> any<00:00:32.070> upper<00:00:32.430> body

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
way so I'm not using any upper body

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.580 
way so I'm not using any upper body
strength<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.330> don't<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.870> basically

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
strength if I don't have to basically

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.470 
strength if I don't have to basically
I'm<00:00:34.950> letting<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.220> bike<00:00:35.430> steer<00:00:35.790> itself<00:00:35.910> up<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
I'm letting the bike steer itself up the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.200 
I'm letting the bike steer itself up the
hill<00:00:36.630> which<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.560> a<00:00:37.800> nice<00:00:37.980> way<00:00:38.220> to<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.610> but

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
hill which is a nice way to do it but

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.370 
hill which is a nice way to do it but
you<00:00:39.330> know<00:00:39.420> now<00:00:39.540> I'm<00:00:39.570> getting<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.990> section

up this section what you'll see is that

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.260 
up this section what you'll see is that
you<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:52.830> I'll<00:00:52.920> go<00:00:53.100> from<00:00:53.400> having<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.790> light

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
you know I'll go from having this light

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.030 
you know I'll go from having this light
almost<00:00:54.720> just<00:00:54.930> resting<00:00:55.350> my<00:00:55.380> hands<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:55.950> the

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
almost just resting my hands on the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.690 
almost just resting my hands on the
handlebars<00:00:57.200> grip<00:00:58.200> to<00:00:58.860> one<00:00:59.040> that's<00:00:59.310> you<00:00:59.610> know

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
handlebars grip to one that's you know

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.670 
handlebars grip to one that's you know
creating<00:01:00.060> more<00:01:00.180> downward<00:01:00.450> force<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.470> I<00:01:01.500> can

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
creating more downward force so I can

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.649 
creating more downward force so I can
really<00:01:01.860> get<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.400> around<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.790> corner<00:01:07.429> so

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
really get up and around this corner so

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.109 
really get up and around this corner so
getting<00:01:09.659> lower<00:01:09.929> my<00:01:10.920> hands<00:01:11.280> grasped<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
getting lower my hands grasped on the

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
when I'm not doing technical climbing

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.969 
when I'm not doing technical climbing
they<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.109> you<00:01:34.319> know<00:01:34.409> meat<00:01:34.770> hooks

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
they can just be you know meat hooks

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.559 
they can just be you know meat hooks
they<00:01:35.429> don't<00:01:35.670> need<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.819> have<00:01:35.939> any<00:01:35.999> grasping

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
they don't need to have any grasping

Force you know the way the bikes are

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.300 
Force you know the way the bikes are
designed<00:01:39.119> they<00:01:39.840> track<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.380> fine<00:01:40.710> going<00:01:41.219> up

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
designed they track just fine going up

designed they track just fine going up
the<00:01:41.399> hill<00:01:41.689> so<00:01:42.689> it's<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:42.960> about<00:01:43.100> using<00:01:44.100> as

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the hill so it's all about using as

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.969 
the hill so it's all about using as
little<00:01:44.369> energy<00:01:44.789> as<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.359> have<00:01:45.539> to<00:01:45.569> so<00:01:46.200> seated

little energy as you have to so seated

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.999 
little energy as you have to so seated
pedaling<00:01:47.819> nice<00:01:48.030> smooth<00:01:48.389> circles<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.679> maintain

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
pedaling nice smooth circles to maintain

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.520 
pedaling nice smooth circles to maintain
traction<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.639> you<00:01:51.630> know<00:01:51.749> when<00:01:52.200> i<00:01:52.229> get<00:01:52.439> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
traction and you know when i get to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.289 
traction and you know when i get to
those<00:01:52.649> harder<00:01:52.979> steeper<00:01:53.340> parts<00:01:53.639> i'm<00:01:53.969> still

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
those harder steeper parts i'm still

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.410 
those harder steeper parts i'm still
just<00:01:54.450> keeping<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.310> keeping<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.399> smooth<00:01:56.700> just
