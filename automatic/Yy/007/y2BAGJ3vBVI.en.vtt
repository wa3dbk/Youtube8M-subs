guitar to midi converter is plugged into
once<00:00:39.660> you've<00:00:39.870> done<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.910> you<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:41.940> open<00:00:42.899> up<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
once you've done that you can open up a

once you've done that you can open up a
soft<00:00:43.500> synth<00:00:43.890> let's<00:00:44.399> take<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:45.000> cab<00:00:45.840> since<00:00:46.460> create

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
soft synth let's take a cab since create

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.369 
soft synth let's take a cab since create
the<00:00:47.610> midi<00:00:47.789> track<00:00:48.149> for<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.539> too<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.850> then<00:00:51.379> we

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the midi track for that too and then we

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.090 
the midi track for that too and then we
can<00:00:52.530> set<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.360> to<00:00:54.360> receive<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:55.140> HMT<00:00:55.649> one

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
can set this up to receive from HMT one

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.069 
can set this up to receive from HMT one
and<00:00:56.360> again<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.949> all<00:00:59.160> midi<00:00:59.430> channels

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
and again so it's to all midi channels

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.429 
and again so it's to all midi channels
its<00:01:01.079> turn<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.530> monitoring<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.280> those<00:01:03.019> so<00:01:04.019> using

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
its turn on monitoring on those so using

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.130 
its turn on monitoring on those so using
his<00:01:04.619> pretty<00:01:04.860> simple<00:01:05.309> there's<00:01:06.090> those<00:01:06.510> enable

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
his pretty simple there's those enable

and then on this one will learn the next
paddle<00:03:05.870> along<00:03:08.800> now<00:03:09.800> we<00:03:09.860> are<00:03:10.100> good<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.850> go<00:03:10.880> and

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
paddle along now we are good to go and

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.980 
paddle along now we are good to go and
we<00:03:12.590> have<00:03:12.710> to<00:03:12.830> enable<00:03:13.070> it<00:03:13.400> here<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.570> now<00:03:14.870> I'll

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
we have to enable it here so now I'll

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.580 
we have to enable it here so now I'll
enable<00:03:15.500> both<00:03:15.740> of<00:03:15.980> these<00:03:16.130> on<00:03:16.840> all<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.050> strings

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
enable both of these on all the strings

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.790 
enable both of these on all the strings
and<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:21.470> can<00:03:21.620> switch<00:03:21.890> between<00:03:22.100> them<00:03:22.490> using<00:03:22.970> the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
and I can switch between them using the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:38.440 
and I can switch between them using the
pedal<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.900> that's<00:03:36.410> all<00:03:36.590> there<00:03:36.739> is<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:38.420> I

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
pedal and that's all there is to it so I

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.540 
pedal and that's all there is to it so I
hope<00:03:38.720> that's<00:03:39.050> given<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.440> some<00:03:39.739> ideas<00:03:39.920> of<00:03:40.340> some

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
hope that's given you some ideas of some

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.550 
hope that's given you some ideas of some
of<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.850> things<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.239> can<00:03:41.360> do<00:03:41.510> with<00:03:41.630> HMT<00:03:42.140> one

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
of the things you can do with HMT one

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.780 
of the things you can do with HMT one
