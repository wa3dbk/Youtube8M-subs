00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.010
 Tell people b from jb on foot in the area 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.200
 bringing another commented video to 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.150
 You and today that was transmitting video 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.220
 here to talk a little bit more about 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.760
 competitive of the four benefit 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.320
 galleries 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.460
 it's not that I do not like competitive 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.859
 quite the opposite I adore 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.109
 competitive but how can I say my 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.939
 class so my style of play it 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.070
 does not fit very well in the competitive 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.630
 understood if I was to play competitive 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.250
 I would have to train a lot, I do not want to say 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.020
 also that I could not because if I 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.940
 I wanted to train so I believe 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.670
 that I would be able to learn to 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.520
 playing with I can say so, but it's 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.620
 strategically more tactically in 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.170
 smaller numbers will say competitive 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.760
 30 of the players is difficult is practically 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.100
 impossible you have today a 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.379
 competitive price of 32 10 32 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.070
 then play for example a 10 x 10 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.859
 requires much skill it was very 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.219
 training and lots of dedication 1 5 x 5 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.140
 then 6 x 6 x 6 even more and I still 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.390
 I would have to train a lot but really 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.180
 to even try trying at least 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.340
 betray on this competitive branch then 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.409
 to participate in a match 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.869
 competitive for me is very difficult even 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.670
 Maybe later on, I know. 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.350
 start training to participate in 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.670
 some matches there but it's a parade 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.470
 I'll tell you more here later. 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.330
 front is one thing that at least 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.900
 I'm not even thinking at the moment. 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.970
 guys 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.990
 but the fact does not participate in competing 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.340
 It does not mean that I do not like 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.680
 competing is the same thing that guy who 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.960
 watch football but does not play ball but 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.549
 I love soccer, it's practically not 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.579
 can be competitive but I love it 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.600
 I really like it very much and I 'm 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.090
 bringing this video was a little bit 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.280
 more about the match is special on the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.350
 yesterday's departure guys who rolled over 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.810
 match was against the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.030
 team elton's top scorer is a 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.710
 very strong team - guys are a team that 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.869
 came very well prepared training 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.700
 pretty even and very players 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.020
 experienced very good prices 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.430
 has a stain that is one of the best 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.829
 brazil's backs the guy plays a lot 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.420
 would have scraped the match played 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.399
 There is the defender who has the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.590
 Yesterday he played too many guys the defender with 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.289
 who knows how to play infantry and the stain 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.569
 in case they play tank your Gaddafi 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.890
 and many others the guys playing by 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.780
 territory and playing 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.270
 very serious if you have no notion the faces 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.160

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.440
 orchard galera is a very 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.110
 experienced it was one of the best times 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.030
 of the neighborhood of 2 or it already has much 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.280
 The road there has been a lot on this road. 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.350
 competitive and they did not play 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.630
 competitive in the neighborhood of 3 degrees 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.280
 even so they arrived with everything in triumph 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.620
 out of 4 served the team was very well 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.280
 trained and it was a game both 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.470

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.290

 yesterday guys and it was a sensational part of 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.739
 You have no idea the departure was too much. 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.810
 the team autuori won by a difference 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.190
 more or less 80 tickets in the first 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.989
 departure they lost a difference of 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.090
 20 but in the second they gained a 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.190
 difference of 102 tickets so it was more 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.070
 or less a difference of 80 tickets 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.959
