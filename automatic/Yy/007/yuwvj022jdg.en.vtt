inside the tires feel a lot stiffer they
feel<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:47.820> hold<00:00:48.090> their<00:00:48.329> shape<00:00:48.360> really<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
feel like they hold their shape really a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.799 
feel like they hold their shape really a
lot<00:00:49.379> better<00:00:49.590> than<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> previous<00:00:50.309> versions

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
lot better than the previous versions

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.299

the rubber compound feels a lot softer

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.150

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
so it'll definitely provide a bit more

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.060 
so it'll definitely provide a bit more
traction<00:00:56.750> especially<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:58.260> those<00:00:58.379> climbs<00:00:58.800> or

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
traction especially for those climbs or

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.479 
traction especially for those climbs or
even<00:00:59.399> those<00:00:59.579> those<00:01:00.149> wheelies<00:01:01.190> not<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.340> mention

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489

of this size and the servo saver is
built<00:04:51.640> into<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:52.060> servo<00:04:52.300> horn<00:04:52.570> so<00:04:52.900> that's<00:04:53.050> also

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
built into the servo horn so that's also

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.070 
built into the servo horn so that's also
pretty<00:04:53.980> cool<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.700> get<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:54.970> dual<00:04:55.120> bellcrank
