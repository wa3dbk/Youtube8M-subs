00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.240 
the leaves to the side and added
homemade<00:01:57.270> compost<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.050> furrows<00:01:58.349> I<00:01:58.619> took<00:01:59.220> a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
homemade compost to the furrows I took a

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.919 
homemade compost to the furrows I took a
handful<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.910> wide<00:02:00.119> variety<00:02:00.569> of<00:02:00.599> the<00:02:00.720> seeds

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
handful of a wide variety of the seeds

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.779 
handful of a wide variety of the seeds
just<00:02:01.229> mentioned<00:02:01.739> and<00:02:01.860> broadcast<00:02:02.429> them<00:02:02.580> in<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
just mentioned and broadcast them in the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.970 
just mentioned and broadcast them in the
compost

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.430 

I<00:02:07.040> also<00:02:07.790> transplanted<00:02:08.480> to<00:02:08.660> kale<00:02:08.900> plants<00:02:09.320> in

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
I also transplanted to kale plants in

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.860 
I also transplanted to kale plants in
the<00:02:09.500> leaf<00:02:09.680> mulch<00:02:09.980> with<00:02:10.250> some<00:02:10.400> compost<00:02:10.870> it's

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
the leaf mulch with some compost it's

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.510 
the leaf mulch with some compost it's
possible<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.440> over<00:02:12.770> planted<00:02:13.190> in<00:02:13.340> some

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
possible that I over planted in some

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.060 
possible that I over planted in some
areas<00:02:13.910> but<00:02:13.940> that's<00:02:14.240> fine<00:02:14.540> if<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.590> need<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.860> thin

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
areas but that's fine if I need to thin

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.440 
areas but that's fine if I need to thin
the<00:02:16.190> bed<00:02:16.370> most<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.030> plants<00:02:17.300> can<00:02:17.420> be

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
the bed most of the plants can be

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.060 
the bed most of the plants can be
harvested<00:02:17.960> young<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.500> nothing<00:02:18.800> will<00:02:18.890> go<00:02:19.040> to

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
harvested young so nothing will go to

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.860 
harvested young so nothing will go to
waste

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
waste

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.300 
waste
finally<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:20.900> planted<00:02:21.290> onions<00:02:21.680> in<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.890> few<00:02:22.100> rows

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
finally I planted onions in a few rows

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.670 
finally I planted onions in a few rows
across<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.880> bed<00:02:23.140> thinking<00:02:24.140> back<00:02:24.320> I<00:02:24.470> could

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
across the bed thinking back I could

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.140 
across the bed thinking back I could
have<00:02:24.770> interspersed<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.370> onions<00:02:25.670> more<00:02:25.970> with

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
have interspersed the onions more with

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150 
have interspersed the onions more with
the<00:02:26.240> other<00:02:26.390> crops<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:26.990> probably<00:02:27.740> will<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.070> the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
the other crops and probably will in the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.370 
the other crops and probably will in the
future<00:02:28.340> but<00:02:29.270> at<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.510> time<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.140> idea

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
future but at the time I like the idea

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.370 
future but at the time I like the idea
of<00:02:30.440> creating<00:02:30.620> protective<00:02:31.220> walls<00:02:31.490> of<00:02:31.730> onions

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
of creating protective walls of onions

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.150 
of creating protective walls of onions
going<00:02:33.380> forward<00:02:33.710> I<00:02:33.770> plan<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:33.980> continue

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
going forward I plan to continue

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.220 
going forward I plan to continue
refining<00:02:34.790> this<00:02:35.060> approach<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.660> doing<00:02:35.960> my<00:02:36.080> best

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
refining this approach and doing my best

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.680 
refining this approach and doing my best
to<00:02:36.350> confuse<00:02:36.890> garden<00:02:37.310> pests<00:02:37.670> especially<00:02:38.540> those

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
to confuse garden pests especially those

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.920 
to confuse garden pests especially those
pesky<00:02:38.990> cabbage<00:02:39.530> moths<00:02:40.420> well<00:02:41.420> that's<00:02:41.600> all<00:02:41.780> for

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
pesky cabbage moths well that's all for

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.600 
pesky cabbage moths well that's all for
now<00:02:42.080> thank<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:42.680> very<00:02:42.860> much<00:02:43.010> for<00:02:43.130> watching<00:02:43.280> and

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
now thank you very much for watching and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.670 
now thank you very much for watching and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
until next time remember you can change

00:02:45.680 --> 00:03:19.170 
until next time remember you can change
the<00:02:46.070> world<00:02:46.250> one<00:02:46.700> yard<00:02:46.760> at<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.210> time
