00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
so you know it's not a race to see who

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.020

yeah<00:02:16.690> we<00:02:16.870> came<00:02:17.049> into<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.290> turn<00:02:17.650> usually

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
yeah we came into that turn usually

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.949 
yeah we came into that turn usually
we're<00:02:18.760> on<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:19.000> ragged<00:02:19.239> edge<00:02:19.599> right<00:02:19.900> there

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
we're on the ragged edge right there

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.660 
we're on the ragged edge right there
because<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:20.379> have<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.680> get<00:02:20.830> with<00:02:21.040> one<00:02:21.190> foot<00:02:21.489> of

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
because you have to get with one foot of

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.309 
because you have to get with one foot of
that<00:02:21.700> light<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.480> light<00:02:22.629> it<00:02:22.750> up<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.200> outer

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
that light to light it up to the outer

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.979 
that light to light it up to the outer
clip<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.310> we<00:02:24.909> basically<00:02:25.390> throw<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.810> in<00:02:25.930> with

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
clip so we basically throw it in with

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.750 
clip so we basically throw it in with
full<00:02:26.200> speed<00:02:26.379> and<00:02:26.680> then<00:02:26.799> use<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.159> power<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.580> the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
full speed and then use the power of the

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.850 
full speed and then use the power of the
car<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.060> dig<00:02:28.299> itself<00:02:28.599> off<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.049> wall<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.769> when

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
car to dig itself off the wall and when

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.110 
car to dig itself off the wall and when
I<00:02:29.890> put<00:02:30.099> it<00:02:30.190> in<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.370> gear<00:02:30.579> and<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.790> gear<00:02:30.819> wasn't

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
I put it in the gear and the gear wasn't

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.030 
I put it in the gear and the gear wasn't
there<00:02:31.510> they<00:02:32.049> went<00:02:32.200> flat<00:02:32.440> there<00:02:32.709> was<00:02:32.799> nothing

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
there they went flat there was nothing

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:46.110 
there they went flat there was nothing
to<00:02:33.129> pull<00:02:33.310> me<00:02:33.400> away<00:02:33.519> so<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.970> miss<00:02:34.360> my<00:02:34.690> back

I<00:03:21.040> think<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.130> next<00:03:22.280> step<00:03:22.489> is<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.819> just<00:03:22.880> keep

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
I think the next step is to just keep

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.880 
I think the next step is to just keep
progressing<00:03:23.390> everything<00:03:24.140> I<00:03:24.290> think<00:03:24.709> that

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
progressing everything I think that

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.070 
progressing everything I think that
drifting<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.550> only<00:03:25.760> add<00:03:26.000> about<00:03:26.209> 50%<00:03:26.900> of<00:03:26.930> its

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
drifting is only add about 50% of its

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.960 
drifting is only add about 50% of its
potential<00:03:27.410> right<00:03:27.739> now<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.550> sky<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:28.790> the

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
potential right now and the sky is the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.820 
potential right now and the sky is the
limit<00:03:29.090> with<00:03:29.420> it<00:03:29.599> so<00:03:29.840> if<00:03:30.260> we<00:03:30.380> can<00:03:30.470> keep<00:03:30.620> doing

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
limit with it so if we can keep doing

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.589 
limit with it so if we can keep doing
the<00:03:31.040> marketing<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.640> getting<00:03:31.880> more<00:03:32.000> fans<00:03:32.330> out

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599
