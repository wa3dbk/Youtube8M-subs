00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.550
 Hi, how are you, very welcome? 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.550
 portal coches.net we are going to give us a 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.940
 back in this jeep wrangler does not accompany 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.940
 in our favour 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.759
 all right 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.720
 We started although you've already seen 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.730
 well, we wanted to come to a 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.180
 from one of the scenarios 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.310
 usual 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.930
 of all-terrain tests we do 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.520
 in portal coches.net the page of 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.690
 reference to the motor world and as always 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.460
 Well, since the capabilities 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.830
 good 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.900
 of traction of this type of vehicle 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.580
 4x4 and obviously we can tell you what 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:55.660
 this wrangler book is the one that best 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.550
 It also long fulfills all the 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:02.270
 let's say the demands that we could 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:05.120
 have a pure 4x4 or you've already seen 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.390
 here we have a small lever 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.679
 the gearbox and as can be or is 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.200
 what we are selling for everything 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.870
 worse than we can and is that he does not even know 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.170
 is more I have not even got the 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.959
 reductive we go in 4x4 normal traction and 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.250
 well, I'm doing it, it's nothing 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.240
 because it has some entry angles 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.310
 after departure 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.990
 wood capacity etcetera that good 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.710
 Well, they have few cars in 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.410
 in the market right now 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.540
 4 meters and 22 centimeters of good 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.750
 of pure 4x4 you 've already seen on the outside that 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.800
 good that has some beautiful rims and 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.750
 the finished a new edition as it is 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.640
 let's say the most the highest one to which 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.770
 more equipment has also is more 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.290
 face a langlais title you can have 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.600
 of 29 thousand 900 euros and good and the version 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.770
 mab least expensive two - door like this 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.410
 then we can in 35 thousand 800 euros 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.750
 so I can tell you then here 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.640
 we do not sit down with plastic nonsense 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.440
 hard all iron everything all rigid and 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.210
 simply changing gears already demands 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.400
 some effort because it's pretty 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.640
 hard so we do not sit down with nonsense 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.410
 we need a car that is the tube 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.800
 hard that is strong that is robust 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.140
 because because it's their natural habitat is 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.700
 the field or we have made a couple of 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.129
 highway hours 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.690
 120 and the truth is that sneaks the 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.810
 air everywhere makes a lot of noise 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.790
 aerodynamically very regular 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.150
 because obviously because it's not done 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.040
 for this is made for that to go up 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.990
 cliffs there is a photographic report that 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.480
 accompanies on portal coches.net as 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.430
 quite extensive in this test and the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.810
 truth is that I can assure you that 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.850
 we have undergone very hard tests in the 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.640
 what are you going to see good then a lot 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.530
 of details of suspensions of 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:04.400
 cushioning of how good how 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.380
 all this type of elements work 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.020
 so that a 4x4 for example can 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.590
 save this kind of dimensions but we go without 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.090
 no problem and I still have not 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.000
 stuck in no time in this video 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.890
 in the reductive because it is not necessary 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.340
 because even though they carry tires 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.980
 mixed, the truth is that 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.770
 by land he eats it absolutely everything 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.319
 has a brutal capacity 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.690
 consumption well look at these for 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:33.310
 example I would not dare to put here 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.110
 no other car and the truth is that 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.780
 this is like being in the yard of 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.349
 your home consumption well we have done more than 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.310
 1000 kilometers pretty enough 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:45.400
 off-road the truth because this guy 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.569
 of cars demands a one a 4x4 test 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.639
 pretty hard 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:53.990
 and we are around 10 liters now 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:56.089
 right now the 2.8 diesel engine has 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.969
 200 horses in this case how can you 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:00.679
 see here associated with a manual change if 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:03.310
 Would you like the automatic change? 

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:05.980
 we would have to go to 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.490
 to put on the table 2600 more equipment 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.990
 So, well, that's your thing 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.510
 it is not strange for example we have as 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.740
 lands like this and not so pure have 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.900
 altimeters and slope curves and 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.580
 compasses and such and here good has here 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.520
 a north-south compass indicator in 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:25.720
 the one where right now he puts the autonomy 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.460
 but the truth is that I do not know the 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.440
 temperature and that we go south direction not 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.750
 have nothing else waiting a little more than 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.700
 careful in that sense but it is that it is a 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.680
 jeep is that it's a time it's a car that 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.510
 by the way I do not know how to enter realized 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.250
 you can dismantle absolutely everything 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.290
 can dismantle the roof can be 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.610
 disassemble until the doors that is us 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.460
 we have been amazed at how simple 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.990
 which is to dismantle the doors we put 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.570
 because it is a car because maybe 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:52.060
 thought for the beaches of california in 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.800
 where good where can you go if that 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.590
 it always affects intense minds you import 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.840
 and that's it and it does not matter anymore so 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.520
 well I 'll tell you many more things 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.930
 important is to put the web page of 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.120
 reference of the motor world where 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.370
 let's analyze how it's always there 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.960
 enough to infinity and beyond and 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.940
 little more thank you for being there as 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.780
 We always see each other in the next 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.780
 bye
