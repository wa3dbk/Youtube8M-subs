00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
hopefully this will work this method is

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.979 
hopefully this will work this method is
simple<00:00:43.370> this<00:00:43.579> is<00:00:43.760> by<00:00:43.910> far<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:44.210> easiest<00:00:44.420> method

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
simple this is by far the easiest method
