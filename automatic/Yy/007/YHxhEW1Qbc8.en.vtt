00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
actually going for nuclear I just

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.300 
actually going for nuclear I just
thought<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.170> making<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.619> video<00:01:40.829> because<00:01:40.979> not

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
many too many on YouTube and this this

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.690 
many too many on YouTube and this this
is<00:01:43.380> actually<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:43.649> really<00:01:43.950> fast<00:01:44.280> nuclear

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
is actually really really fast nuclear

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.300 
is actually really really fast nuclear
I'm<00:01:45.119> not<00:01:45.600> sure<00:01:45.780> how<00:01:45.930> how<00:01:46.320> many<00:01:46.560> how<00:01:46.770> fast<00:01:47.070> is

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
I'm not sure how how many how fast is

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.830 
I'm not sure how how many how fast is

compared to others on YouTube it's

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.859 
compared to others on YouTube it's
around<00:01:48.990> 3<00:01:49.320> minutes<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:50.460> really<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:51.479> school

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
around 3 minutes but really with school

a UAV orbital vsat and maybe another one
I<00:01:58.530> may<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> county<00:02:00.299> wavy<00:02:00.509> or

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
I may be like the county wavy or

I may be like the county wavy or
something<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.500> also<00:02:01.680> decent<00:02:02.219> i<00:02:02.640> guess

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
something that is also decent i guess

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.899 
something that is also decent i guess
but<00:02:03.479> wait<00:02:04.229> i<00:02:04.380> was<00:02:04.649> an<00:02:04.770> i<00:02:04.979> was<00:02:05.040> running<00:02:05.219> swarm<00:02:05.640> so

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
but wait i was an i was running swarm so

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.310 
but wait i was an i was running swarm so
it<00:02:06.000> was<00:02:06.119> actually<00:02:06.390> kind<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.659> kind<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.049> hard<00:02:07.229> for

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
it was actually kind of kind of hard for

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.499 
it was actually kind of kind of hard for
me<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.710> get<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.220> nuclear<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:09.060> somehow<00:02:09.360> I

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
me to get the nuclear but but somehow I

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.880 
me to get the nuclear but but somehow I
managed<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.899> get<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.259> when

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
managed to get it when

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.440 
managed to get it when
any<00:02:11.100> quick<00:02:11.280> timing<00:02:11.700> without<00:02:11.940> even<00:02:12.270> having

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
any quick timing without even having

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.910 
any quick timing without even having
really<00:02:13.440> like<00:02:13.950> decent<00:02:14.400> like<00:02:15.330> help<00:02:15.840> keys<00:02:16.740> to

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
really like decent like help keys to

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.770 
really like decent like help keys to
kill<00:02:17.069> streaks<00:02:17.370> whatever<00:02:17.670> but<00:02:18.180> there<00:02:18.420> as<00:02:18.660> you

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
kill streaks whatever but there as you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.510 
kill streaks whatever but there as you
see<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:18.990> was<00:02:19.290> really<00:02:19.680> lucky<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.950> shotgun<00:02:20.340> I

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
see I was really lucky that shotgun I

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.520 
see I was really lucky that shotgun I
should<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.790> killed<00:02:20.970> me<00:02:21.060> with<00:02:21.330> his<00:02:21.510> s12<00:02:21.990> but

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
should have killed me with his s12 but

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.440 
should have killed me with his s12 but
the<00:02:22.620> s12<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.340> underpowered<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.120> as<00:02:24.330> you

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
the s12 is so underpowered and as you

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.760 
the s12 is so underpowered and as you
see<00:02:24.600> here<00:02:24.750> I'm<00:02:24.810> not<00:02:24.840> even<00:02:25.140> going<00:02:25.260> for<00:02:25.470> nuclear

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
see here I'm not even going for nuclear

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.290 
see here I'm not even going for nuclear

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
if I was actually going for nuclear I

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.880 
if I was actually going for nuclear I

going like that i was going like 10 and
six<00:04:30.660> or<00:04:30.840> something<00:04:31.170> then<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:31.680> man<00:04:31.860> just<00:04:32.010> gone<00:04:32.130> 30

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
six or something then I man just gone 30

gunstreak<00:04:32.850> hut<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.180> then<00:04:33.390> I<00:04:33.510> died<00:04:33.750> just<00:04:34.110> as<00:04:34.320> I

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
gunstreak hut and then I died just as I

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.620 
gunstreak hut and then I died just as I
got<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:34.740> but<00:04:35.220> I<00:04:35.430> actually<00:04:35.730> go<00:04:36.030> on<00:04:36.060> a<00:04:36.210> reasonable

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
got it but I actually go on a reasonable

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.270 
got it but I actually go on a reasonable
reasonable<00:04:37.410> kill<00:04:37.740> Street<00:04:37.920> but<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.100> can't

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
reasonable kill Street but I can't

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.220 
reasonable kill Street but I can't
really<00:04:38.430> find<00:04:38.730> anyone<00:04:39.000> at<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.240> end<00:04:39.390> but<00:04:40.020> then

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
really find anyone at the end but then

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.790 
really find anyone at the end but then
it<00:04:40.830> tends<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.430> be<00:04:41.610> much<00:04:42.000> much<00:04:42.240> easier<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:43.650> get

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800

this kind of game play is actually

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.050 
this kind of game play is actually
coming<00:05:26.100> to<00:05:26.190> them<00:05:26.370> but<00:05:26.490> as<00:05:26.580> you'll<00:05:26.760> see<00:05:26.940> it's

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
coming to them but as you'll see it's

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.580 
coming to them but as you'll see it's
really<00:05:27.270> really<00:05:27.600> hard<00:05:27.780> to<00:05:27.930> find<00:05:28.170> people<00:05:28.320> at<00:05:28.530> the

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
really really hard to find people at the

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.890 
really really hard to find people at the
moment<00:05:28.920> on<00:05:29.040> this<00:05:29.190> like<00:05:29.520> map<00:05:29.850> or<00:05:30.030> whatever<00:05:30.240> well

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
moment on this like map or whatever well

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.690 
moment on this like map or whatever well
it's<00:05:31.230> not<00:05:31.350> hard<00:05:31.530> to<00:05:31.590> find<00:05:31.740> them<00:05:31.890> I<00:05:31.980> hijack<00:05:32.160> God

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
it's not hard to find them I hijack God

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.610 
it's not hard to find them I hijack God
but<00:05:33.330> they<00:05:33.540> look<00:05:33.810> because<00:05:33.900> of<00:05:34.140> the<00:05:34.230> limited

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
but they look because of the limited

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.140 
but they look because of the limited
amount<00:05:34.740> of<00:05:34.920> people<00:05:35.220> like<00:05:35.310> this<00:05:35.460> my<00:05:35.730> kills<00:05:35.970> keep

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
amount of people like this my kills keep

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.820 
amount of people like this my kills keep
on<00:05:36.270> getting<00:05:36.480> stolen<00:05:36.720> or<00:05:37.140> that<00:05:37.320> that<00:05:37.500> that

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
on getting stolen or that that that

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.070 
on getting stolen or that that that
wasn't<00:05:38.370> exactly<00:05:38.550> stolen<00:05:39.060> but<00:05:39.240> I<00:05:39.450> think<00:05:40.050> I

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
wasn't exactly stolen but I think I

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.860 
wasn't exactly stolen but I think I
wasn't<00:05:40.410> able<00:05:40.470> to<00:05:40.650> get<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.920> kills<00:05:41.510> but<00:05:42.510> anyway

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
wasn't able to get the kills but anyway

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.780 
wasn't able to get the kills but anyway
