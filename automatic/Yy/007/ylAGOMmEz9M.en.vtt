 around 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.390
 b 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.840
 b 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.200
 I hope I've had fallen 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.510
 something different than the usual let's 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.000
 place from me and I have mine too 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.060
 I wonder if I maybe once 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.340
 Something for you on guitar in the month 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.730
 games and the tabs to write bought 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.840
 I also like it myself as a guitarist 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.870
 stupid if you find nowhere where the 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.150
 notes or tabs are my own 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.900
 play 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:50.989
 so I do not know that either 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.410
 others were good at it 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:58.670
 better case than I can and it was 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.470
 not even the original tempo had to 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.170
 I already play a bit slower 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.660
 that's really fast for mine 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.600
 taste so fast I am then 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.250
 not yet 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:15.980
 and I also linked you again 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:20.060
 the video for the red trailer below 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.040
 left and then the first episode of 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.520
 ruby bottom right 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:31.610
 I think it's really great 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:33.440
 respect i really like it and we like it 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.320
 could also write something I do 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.020
 maybe still playing on guitar 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:43.370
 I will definitely go over it 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:46.040
 happy if you liked it and you 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.810
 You are also welcome to my 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.180

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.180
 until then must
