00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
I strongly do believe in that I think at

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.110 
I strongly do believe in that I think at
a<00:05:37.690> young<00:05:37.960> age<00:05:37.990> kids<00:05:38.860> typically<00:05:39.580> get<00:05:39.850> a<00:05:39.880> little

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
a young age kids typically get a little

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.570 
a young age kids typically get a little
bit<00:05:40.240> too<00:05:40.360> serious<00:05:40.690> too<00:05:40.870> soon<00:05:41.400> whether<00:05:42.400> that<00:05:42.520> be

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
bit too serious too soon whether that be

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.550 
bit too serious too soon whether that be
the<00:05:42.760> kids<00:05:42.970> whether<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.360> be<00:05:43.480> the<00:05:43.600> parents<00:05:43.990> I

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
the kids whether that be the parents I

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.380 
the kids whether that be the parents I
think<00:05:45.400> it's<00:05:45.490> important<00:05:45.910> for<00:05:45.970> the<00:05:46.090> kids<00:05:46.240> to

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
think it's important for the kids to

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.270 
think it's important for the kids to
just<00:05:46.690> enjoy<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.320> game<00:05:47.500> for<00:05:47.710> what<00:05:47.860> it<00:05:47.980> is<00:05:48.010> and

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
just enjoy the game for what it is and

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.550 
just enjoy the game for what it is and
have<00:05:48.400> fun<00:05:48.610> with<00:05:48.790> it<00:05:48.970> and<00:05:49.260> if<00:05:50.260> you're<00:05:50.440> lucky

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
have fun with it and if you're lucky

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.820 
have fun with it and if you're lucky
enough<00:05:50.770> to<00:05:51.190> make<00:05:51.610> it<00:05:51.670> a<00:05:51.850> career<00:05:52.180> then<00:05:52.830> then

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
enough to make it a career then then

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.010 
enough to make it a career then then
that's<00:05:54.010> great<00:05:54.160> but

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020
