00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
thumbtacked and this one not be so I can

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.350 
thumbtacked and this one not be so I can
switch<00:01:32.220> over<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.610> check<00:01:32.970> check<00:01:33.240> out

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
switch over and check check out

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.090

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
stays up now for electric guitar that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.810 
stays up now for electric guitar that
doesn't<00:01:37.950> make<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.070> lot<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.280> sense<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:38.640> one

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
doesn't make a lot of sense but one

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.950 
doesn't make a lot of sense but one
place<00:01:39.000> where<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.240> does<00:01:39.479> make<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.720> lot<00:01:39.930> of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
place where that does make a lot of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.780 
place where that does make a lot of
sense<00:01:40.159> especially<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> big

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
sense especially if you have a big

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.069 
sense especially if you have a big
screen<00:01:42.119> with<00:01:42.360> lots<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.630> screen<00:01:42.869> real<00:01:43.049> estate

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
screen with lots of screen real estate

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.370 
screen with lots of screen real estate
maybe<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.799> want<00:01:44.040> your<00:01:44.159> buss<00:01:44.579> compressor<00:01:45.380> for

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
maybe you want your buss compressor for

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.679 
maybe you want your buss compressor for
your<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.860> your<00:01:47.189> mix<00:01:47.430> bus<00:01:47.640> maybe<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.360> want<00:01:48.509> that

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
your on your mix bus maybe you want that

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.569 
your on your mix bus maybe you want that
to<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:48.869> visible<00:01:49.409> at<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:49.619> times<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.310> maybe<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
to be visible at all times so maybe you

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
to be visible at all times so maybe you
do<00:01:50.700> something<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.450> set<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> open

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
do something like this you set it open

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.830 
do something like this you set it open
you<00:01:53.310> click<00:01:53.549> on<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.939> little<00:01:54.060> thumbtack<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.720> it

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
you click on the little thumbtack so it

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.800 
you click on the little thumbtack so it
will<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.320> top<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:56.009> times<00:01:56.420> you<00:01:57.420> stick<00:01:57.689> it

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
will be on top at all times you stick it

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.569 
will be on top at all times you stick it
right<00:01:57.840> there

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
right there

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.590 
right there
kind<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.640> off<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.969> corner<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.299> you're<00:02:00.450> just

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
kind of off in the corner so you're just

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.789 
kind of off in the corner so you're just
seeing<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> readout<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.439> then<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.649> come

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
seeing the readout and then you come

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.840 
seeing the readout and then you come
back<00:02:01.829> over<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.399> you're<00:02:02.549> doing<00:02:02.640> your

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
back over here and you're doing your

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.760 
back over here and you're doing your
normal<00:02:02.939> mixing<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.380> literally<00:02:04.680> just

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
normal mixing and you can literally just

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.200 
normal mixing and you can literally just
glance<00:02:05.189> over<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.670> make<00:02:05.790> sure<00:02:05.969> you're<00:02:06.119> not

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
glance over and make sure you're not

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.670 
glance over and make sure you're not
doing<00:02:06.450> too<00:02:06.479> much<00:02:06.689> compression<00:02:07.170> over<00:02:07.290> there

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
doing too much compression over there

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.710 
doing too much compression over there
that's<00:02:08.069> something<00:02:08.310> I've<00:02:08.429> done<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.819> lot<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.119> and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
that's something I've done a lot of and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.300 
that's something I've done a lot of and
a<00:02:10.110> lot<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.349> people<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.560> know<00:02:10.590> do<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.950> same<00:02:10.979> sort

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
a lot of people I know do the same sort

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.830 
a lot of people I know do the same sort
of<00:02:11.370> thing<00:02:11.580> but<00:02:12.300> if<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.599> didn't<00:02:12.840> know<00:02:12.900> about

of thing but if you didn't know about

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.839 
of thing but if you didn't know about
a thumbtack<00:02:14.170> right<00:02:14.620> here<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.519> wouldn't<00:02:15.760> be

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
a thumbtack right here you wouldn't be

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.880 
a thumbtack right here you wouldn't be
able<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.030> do<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.390> this<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.810> also<00:02:16.959> great<00:02:17.260> if<00:02:17.590> you

thing is great too and by using these

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.949 
thing is great too and by using these
thumbtacks<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:27.910> can<00:02:28.000> keep<00:02:28.150> all<00:02:28.330> those<00:02:28.510> open

mastering where you tend to want to see
all<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.640> plugins<00:02:36.970> at<00:02:37.150> once<00:02:37.390> on<00:02:37.660> a<00:02:37.720> given<00:02:38.019> track
