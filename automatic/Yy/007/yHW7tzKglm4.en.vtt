as<00:02:48.629> to<00:02:48.780> experiment<00:02:49.530> one<00:02:49.680> time<00:02:49.919> i<00:02:49.949> took<00:02:50.129> a<00:02:50.280> cup

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
as to experiment one time i took a cup

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.509 
as to experiment one time i took a cup
of<00:02:50.609> ice<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.150> some<00:02:51.780> water<00:02:52.049> like<00:02:53.010> me<00:02:53.219> high

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
of ice and some water like me high

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.939 
of ice and some water like me high
school<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.359> put<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.659> all<00:02:54.750> over<00:02:54.810> my<00:02:55.169> hair<00:02:55.409> my
