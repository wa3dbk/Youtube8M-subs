talking<00:01:34.320> about<00:01:34.380> structural<00:01:35.159> failures<00:01:35.549> here

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
talking about structural failures here

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.149 
talking about structural failures here
we're<00:01:36.450> talking<00:01:36.630> about<00:01:36.810> long-term<00:01:37.350> failure<00:01:38.070> of

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
we're talking about long-term failure of

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.649 
we're talking about long-term failure of
the<00:01:38.250> deck<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.759> like<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.909> said<00:01:39.090> we're<00:01:39.329> using<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the deck and like I said we're using the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.200 
the deck and like I said we're using the
deck<00:01:39.840> board<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.189> case<00:01:41.250> master<00:01:41.820> Anubha

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
deck board in this case master Anubha

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.780 
deck board in this case master Anubha
that's<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.570> really<00:01:42.899> be<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.520> long<00:01:44.520> long

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
that's going to really be a long long

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.550 
that's going to really be a long long
time<00:01:45.000> many<00:01:45.360> decades<00:01:45.899> before<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.380> see<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
time many decades before we see a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.800 
time many decades before we see a
failure<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.159> master<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.610> dooba<00:01:47.909> but<00:01:48.659> this

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
failure on that master on dooba but this

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.870 
failure on that master on dooba but this
number<00:01:49.079> one<00:01:49.380> pressure<00:01:49.710> treated<00:01:50.009> pine<00:01:50.310> even

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
number one pressure treated pine even

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.130 
number one pressure treated pine even
though<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.090> been<00:01:51.240> pressure<00:01:51.479> treated<00:01:51.840> will

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
though it's been pressure treated will

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.109 
though it's been pressure treated will
fail<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.680> time<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:53.909> moisture

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
fail in time if it if we have moisture

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.139 
fail in time if it if we have moisture
issues<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> first<00:01:55.710> tip<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.610> really<00:01:56.969> want

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149

protector<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> similar<00:02:10.560> product<00:02:10.830> or

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
protector is a similar product or

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.170 
protector is a similar product or
basically<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.580> same<00:02:11.730> product<00:02:12.150> just

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
basically the same product just

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.760 
basically the same product just
rebranded<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.900> little<00:02:13.110> different<00:02:13.410> length

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
rebranded a little different length

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.580 
rebranded a little different length
and<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.190> can<00:02:14.340> see<00:02:14.520> we've<00:02:14.700> rolled<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.120> out<00:02:15.270> it's

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
and you can see we've rolled it out it's

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.770 
and you can see we've rolled it out it's
forming<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.680> cap<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.310> here<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.360> idea<00:02:18.660> is

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
forming a cap on here so the idea is

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.420 
forming a cap on here so the idea is
when<00:02:18.930> we<00:02:19.020> set<00:02:19.230> our<00:02:19.260> deck<00:02:19.560> board<00:02:19.800> on<00:02:19.950> here<00:02:20.250> and

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
when we set our deck board on here and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.490 
when we set our deck board on here and
we<00:02:20.550> screw<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.000> deck<00:02:21.270> board<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.780> we're<00:02:22.410> going

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
we screw that deck board in we're going

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.950 
we screw that deck board in we're going
to<00:02:22.590> self<00:02:22.890> seal<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.190> little<00:02:23.640> bit<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.030> screw

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
to self seal a little bit on that screw

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.720 
to self seal a little bit on that screw
through<00:02:25.230> here<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.710> then<00:02:26.220> all<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.400> places

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
through here and then all the places

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.730 
through here and then all the places
where<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:26.940> boards<00:02:27.300> come<00:02:27.390> together<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:28.170> it

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
where the boards come together is it

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.950 
where the boards come together is it
really<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> spot<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.430> ends<00:02:29.850> up<00:02:29.970> forming<00:02:30.570> rot

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
really a spot that ends up forming rot

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.040 
really a spot that ends up forming rot
in<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.940> know<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:33.180> not<00:02:33.300> one<00:02:33.660> year<00:02:33.840> or<00:02:34.020> two

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
in in you know it's not one year or two

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.710 
in in you know it's not one year or two
years<00:02:34.380> we're<00:02:34.590> talking<00:02:34.890> about<00:02:34.980> ten<00:02:35.340> plus<00:02:35.610> years

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
years we're talking about ten plus years

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.360 
years we're talking about ten plus years
but<00:02:36.720> really<00:02:36.930> rot<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.470> going<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.890> happen<00:02:38.220> even

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
but really rot is going to happen even

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.070 
but really rot is going to happen even
on<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> pressure<00:02:39.000> treated<00:02:39.180> board<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.720> this

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
on a pressure treated board and this

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.900 
on a pressure treated board and this
Vicor<00:02:40.500> plus<00:02:40.740> should<00:02:40.980> easily<00:02:41.280> double<00:02:41.820> the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
Vicor plus should easily double the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.530 
Vicor plus should easily double the
lifespan<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.600> these<00:02:43.440> these<00:02:44.130> joists<00:02:44.540> okay

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540

the ground in any way shape or form so
we<00:02:56.280> always<00:02:56.460> want<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:56.880> use<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.060> Simpson<00:02:57.570> post

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840

base<00:02:58.250> when<00:02:59.250> we're<00:02:59.430> when<00:02:59.760> we're<00:02:59.880> coming<00:03:00.180> down

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
base when we're when we're coming down

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.450 
base when we're when we're coming down
to<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.480> concrete<00:03:00.870> footer<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.890> third<00:03:02.190> tip

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
to a concrete footer and the third tip

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.040 
to a concrete footer and the third tip
which<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.940> little<00:03:03.270> bit<00:03:03.360> over<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.660> top<00:03:03.690> but

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
which is a little bit over the top but

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.720 
which is a little bit over the top but
we<00:03:04.200> really<00:03:04.440> feel<00:03:04.560> like<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.890> best<00:03:05.130> practice<00:03:05.580> is

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
we really feel like is best practice is

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.880 
we really feel like is best practice is
to<00:03:06.270> use<00:03:06.300> seal<00:03:06.690> Crete<00:03:07.020> on<00:03:07.200> all<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.560> your<00:03:07.620> cut

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
to use seal Crete on all of your cut
