00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.010
 good that so welcome as virtualized 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.690
 Today we have Nazi accessories that can be very useful for you 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.909
 work with shows the pair to transport it to protect it 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.849
 even to apply 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.140
 but we are going to explain all these accessories that we have here 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.720
 agreement 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.710
 so they use hospi 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.300
 What's the score 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.110
 the first thing is that it's worth to us all 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.160
 introduced two components 1 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.020
 a silicone case that leaves 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.190
 open 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.810
 dog connections the speakers 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.250
 volume control 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.790
 particular 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.400
 but what to protect 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.420
 i that allows us to let the iPad that anywhere without fear of it 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.740
 raye without fear 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.870
 h that hit 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.040
 is founded by what you see 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.500
 and in this framework 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.500
 we have combined it with a protector 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.970
 painful Aztec sports and something more of which is appreciated at the time of leaving at 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.020
 Exterior 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.580
 we do not lose sensitivity without doing just force we still have 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.370
 the same 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.420
 percent 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.370
 sensitivity with the screen 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.399
 the ipad 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.399
 without protector to the horn 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.200
 we manage to protect the screen that with daily use as it can carry out a 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.969
 scratch or some rubbing and then oea see it 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.419
 of working getting to bother more on some screen let go without harming the 

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:42.340
 scratch is to consider 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.350
 in this case the next 40 we have opted for this option 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.420
 because without a cover 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.710
 we can handle it 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.680
 perfectly 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.370
 with our hands 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.230
 because I say without a case 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.230
 this option to use a sleeve like this that you can see 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.040
 with a cover in book format what 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.350
 It is very good to transport track very well for certain moments of 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.579
 agreement 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.980
 to work with her I do not suffer a book but we will be able to combine 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.670
 this private form 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.679
 Silicone sheath 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.769
 The transport even uses certain moments 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:24.929
 but now 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:28.809
 to work from intensive use perhaps because it is inconvenient to have to be 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.779
 as with an open book of agreement 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:35.409
 The good thing is that it will serve us to transport, we can work in a 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:36.829
 Certain moment 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.829
 but we will be able to extract we need to work more comfortably 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:42.469
 well these would be 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.469
 The transport and protection accessories 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:50.769
 the silicone cover is a Greschenko brand according to its price of 29 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.049
 euros 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.809
 the protector medel 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:58.219
 reprobated by I recommend the depro holder of agreement for the ipad 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.929
 you will get this 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:02.409
 matte effect 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.209
 apart from that it is a good protector that 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.209
 e does not say that you have bubbles with a good placement 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:11.499
 avoid is the bubbles 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:13.119
 so annoying impact 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:14.679
 when combining 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:18.419
 both the foundation and coma as the protector what we get is that not 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.969
 we are respected and we are owed 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.459
 strange air bubbles at the edges of our high 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.629
 since we protect ourselves with the foundation if we avoid 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.969
 that dirt from daily wear can do what the 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.969
 protector go see being by the poles 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.499
 so we have silicone leader 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:42.499
 We found her elected to the squad and direct 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:47.139
 of the griffin brand 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.040
 with good finishes its price is about 49 seconds 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:55.279
 what else do we have here 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:57.879
 we have 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.969
 a cleaning liquid in this case woman according to serves for all kinds of 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.719
 Screens for cleaning all types of screens 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.919
 and with that we will be able to clean both 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.589
 the protector 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:12.959
 the crystal but we have protector does not work for any type of screen 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.650
 the good thing is that it is a mba 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.680
 it's a gel 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.680
 since being liquid, woman has 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.500
 p certain characteristic a little thicker 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.590
 that you will avoid because if you accidentally drop percent a 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.720
 accurate circuitry which can be done damage your device 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.880
 Can you do it 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.969
 easier also that there are no month 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:37.029
 my apologies 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:41.009
 anyway, I recommend that it's easier to choose the palmito 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.090
 treatment and move in the same direction 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.539
 in agreement 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:51.029
 to clean the screen in a moment we are on a screen because 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:54.080
 realize they are good as you can see here we have been 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.980
 using 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.980
 agreement 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.650
 another one of the accessories you have from apple 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.219
 you can have if you have called the fonacit friendly guy 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:06.909
 p device that includes them 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:10.680
 are the headphones that have microbank agreement 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.460
 and who have 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.930
 volume control 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.319
 what do we get with this, for example, the programs 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.339
 3 that works through voice ip 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:22.340
 then the calls and we will be able to make them 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.040
 col headphones recording programs because they will be able to have their 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.449
 recorder since the headphones 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:29.479
 It allows 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.349
 capture the sound i 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:32.339
 record it 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:34.110
 take out is going to be something useful 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.889
 he also asks to be able to read 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.699
 without disturbing anyone and listening to our music 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.170
 ok so they were 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.120
 an accessory that had not included 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.580
 with our high would be these headphones 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.439
 agreement 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:47.849
 29 euros 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:52.669
 which nuzman is very much needed if we want to use our the pope to 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.330
 make calls 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.669
 10 and finally 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.249
 we have received a transport bag 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:01.639
 the accessories that come with our altar 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.259
 we will be able to get anywhere these and more accessories 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:06.849
 agreement we will be able to 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:07.860
 kill them 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.729
 our transport bag 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.020
 The small bag according to 9 inch times 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.669
 used a tucano briefcase 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.360
 also for a price of 29 the 2 that allows us to transport 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.430
 our altar agreement 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.919
 as you can see 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.029
 it's a bag 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:27.800
 quite small allows us to respond not extradite 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.869
 like all those actions that we may need 

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:32.430
 he founded the bluetooth keyboard 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.180
 in agreement 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.650
 or how you have seen then the charger to finish moment the headphones 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.809
 Mexican 

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:41.919
 We can carry certain accessories that we may need 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:43.119
 in a briefcase 

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:46.220
 for this we have chosen to continue briefcases for netbook 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.050
 between 9 and 10 inches 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.869
 with a reasonable price 

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:51.759
 9 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:56.220
 so these accessories as you can see can facilitate that daily use and 

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:57.120
 daily 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.189
 to be able to return and with your there are ducks to work to the office 

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:02.470
 it is needed is for 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.550
 for some kind of 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.279
 d the problem then you need that 

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:09.560
 but they used they were portable 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.870
 always that we will come in very well all this protection 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:16.800
 do not regret that it showed apparently amy 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.020
 and above all to facilitate those others transporting both the device and 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.259
 of access 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:25.580
 well then this is all we'll see in a next pil
