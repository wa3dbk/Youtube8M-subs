the PCOS or whatever I know a lot of you

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.839 
the PCOS or whatever I know a lot of you
guys<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.920> also<00:00:26.130> thought<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.640> was<00:00:26.730> the

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
guys and I also thought it was the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.089 
guys and I also thought it was the
foundations<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.599> i<00:00:27.689> have<00:00:27.930> been<00:00:27.960> using<00:00:28.349> but

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
foundations that i have been using but

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.669 
foundations that i have been using but
honestly<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:30.029> was<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> part<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.109> condition

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
honestly it was a part of the condition

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.220 
honestly it was a part of the condition
so<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.130> went<00:00:32.460> out<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.640> got<00:00:32.969> all<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.570> these<00:00:33.719> skin

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
so I went out and got all of these skin

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.970

or anything like that that might scare
you<00:04:44.640> guys<00:04:44.880> off<00:04:44.940> this<00:04:45.690> system<00:04:46.140> also<00:04:46.290> works

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
you guys off this system also works

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.580 
you guys off this system also works
three<00:04:47.040> times<00:04:47.340> faster<00:04:48.000> than<00:04:48.030> most<00:04:48.590> acne

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
three times faster than most acne

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.520 
three times faster than most acne
systems<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.430> is<00:04:50.910> formulated<00:04:51.840> for<00:04:52.260> adults

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
systems and it is formulated for adults

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.040 
systems and it is formulated for adults
so<00:04:52.860> this<00:04:53.040> is<00:04:53.190> an<00:04:53.400> adult<00:04:53.940> system<00:04:54.300> it's<00:04:54.630> not<00:04:54.780> like

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
so this is an adult system it's not like

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.770 
so this is an adult system it's not like
for<00:04:55.260> beauty<00:04:55.980> or<00:04:56.160> 10<00:04:56.430> acne<00:04:56.850> or<00:04:57.000> anything<00:04:57.420> it<00:04:57.630> is

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
for beauty or 10 acne or anything it is

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.050 
for beauty or 10 acne or anything it is
for<00:04:58.020> adults<00:04:58.260> what<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.040> like<00:04:59.250> about<00:04:59.280> it<00:04:59.580> is<00:05:00.030> that

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
for adults what I like about it is that

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.390 
for adults what I like about it is that
it<00:05:00.540> does<00:05:00.660> not<00:05:00.810> dry<00:05:01.260> your<00:05:01.500> skin<00:05:01.650> out<00:05:01.830> it<00:05:02.220> doesn't

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
it does not dry your skin out it doesn't

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.730 
it does not dry your skin out it doesn't
stink<00:05:02.850> it<00:05:03.150> doesn't<00:05:03.510> burn<00:05:03.690> and<00:05:04.080> I'm<00:05:04.440> quite<00:05:04.680> sure

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
stink it doesn't burn and I'm quite sure

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.530 
stink it doesn't burn and I'm quite sure
all<00:05:05.190> of<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:05.430> has<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.730> do<00:05:05.970> with<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.180> fact<00:05:06.390> that

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
all of that has to do with the fact that

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.680 
all of that has to do with the fact that
there<00:05:06.780> is<00:05:06.810> no<00:05:07.140> peroxide<00:05:08.010> no<00:05:08.700> alcohol<00:05:09.390> no
