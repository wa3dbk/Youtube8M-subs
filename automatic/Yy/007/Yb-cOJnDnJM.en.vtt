00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.950
 the complex 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.950
 demolished fog 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.039
 so spent steps you need to be informed 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.039
 I cut muscles 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.619
 is psyche singh 4 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.789
 the reactors are taken but it can always be easy 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.329
 will be submitted later 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.050
 but critics intention is that I did very well at each other also be limited 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.050
 in the center I wanted 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.890
 well what happens when hitting hard 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.470
 I accumulate stress 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.560
 draka vierschaar to give ireland 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.670
 strong role 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.670
 I earn 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.450
 I earn 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.890
 who grab with zero points to baptize 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.890
 then you better not be at stake 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.350
 thinking and only then trying to hold a pawn example is unknown 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.870
 what does not do that because you are going anp 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 due to its storage in the 500 meters everything off 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.510
 looking can also not because we learn may not allow the tour 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.510
 ger 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.760
 you can do it there 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.970
 board of bp 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.090
 according to didier two attacked 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.970
 to close that later 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.390
 then google twitter i left to stand 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
 so soon champion 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.490
 what I really super 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.460
 youth 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.130
 get it is also bad is 4 the black panther closed 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.930
 may call the champion 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.900
 the most played is that black 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.410
 the two options 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.579
 if there is the reds 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:14.179
 c7 and c6 r the super rippling ladies during the week 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.099
 sit there 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.129
 oh well that gives a lot of variants 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.409
 I feel a lot played mild is in sight 6 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.259
 the club I say 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.669
 has it purely for 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:33.589
 but it also had to watch so it is also possible but if I actually have you in 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.649
 to purchase during rush hour 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:38.649
 also saves 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.029
 points divers they often have again 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.629
 in theory that statement 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.019
 titi characters 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.619
 paul simon 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:54.619
 something like that comes i think 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.509
 I am sleeping 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.869
 in friesland 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:03.019
 I'm looking at Paris Gent 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.159
 on the spit 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.159
 she is certainly not covered 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:14.619
 awarded a few times 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.729
 make them can be blackened 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.349
 but that this project 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.369
 who thinks go 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.899
 robbie keane 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:26.899
 but then comes a cold shower or 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.799
 and what should I do now anp per kilo swz 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.709
 it is not very drastic 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.109
 those rules 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.959
 So what it thought very well about Frankfurt is keeping a black eye today 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.959
 can be kept in two information 8 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.269
 in 2 2 a little further on for a discount 2 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.889
 it is for the first time well thought out i am a pawn that they play poker 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.869
 won 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.099
 really ridiculous 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.099
 dcm the tielse team of 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.359
 so you can of course 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.819
 must appear 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.729
 that is 13 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:11.309
