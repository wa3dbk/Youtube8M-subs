 population growth worldwide 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:18.369
 has been increasing

 from the interpretation of the results of 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.209
 analysis of soil passing through the 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.760
 technical assistance needed to 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:51.409
 perfect implementation and
