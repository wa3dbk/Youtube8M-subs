now we're going to pour the mixture into
the<00:06:08.810> baking<00:06:09.500> dish<00:06:12.490> now<00:06:13.490> we're<00:06:13.670> going<00:06:13.790> to<00:06:13.880> bake

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
the baking dish now we're going to bake

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.810 
the baking dish now we're going to bake
this<00:06:15.130> for<00:06:16.130> 20<00:06:17.030> to<00:06:17.360> 25<00:06:17.390> minutes<00:06:17.960> so<00:06:18.700> set<00:06:19.700> your

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
this for 20 to 25 minutes so set your

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.370 
this for 20 to 25 minutes so set your
timer<00:06:20.030> for<00:06:20.180> 20<00:06:20.540> minutes<00:06:20.780> and<00:06:20.960> then<00:06:21.020> check<00:06:21.350> it

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
timer for 20 minutes and then check it

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.130 
timer for 20 minutes and then check it
and<00:06:21.950> see<00:06:22.010> how<00:06:22.310> it<00:06:22.490> is<00:06:22.700> you<00:06:23.630> want<00:06:23.780> to<00:06:23.840> be<00:06:23.900> able<00:06:23.990> to

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
and see how it is you want to be able to

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.260 
and see how it is you want to be able to
stick<00:06:24.380> a<00:06:24.560> toothpick<00:06:25.130> in<00:06:25.280> it<00:06:25.460> and<00:06:25.670> of<00:06:26.210> course

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
stick a toothpick in it and of course

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.790 
stick a toothpick in it and of course
pull<00:06:26.630> that<00:06:26.720> toothpick<00:06:27.080> up<00:06:27.230> and<00:06:27.350> have<00:06:27.440> it<00:06:27.470> dry

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
pull that toothpick up and have it dry

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.820 
pull that toothpick up and have it dry
so<00:06:28.670> we'll<00:06:29.600> set<00:06:29.810> the<00:06:29.900> timer<00:06:30.110> for<00:06:30.230> 20<00:06:30.500> minutes

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
so we'll set the timer for 20 minutes

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.770 
so we'll set the timer for 20 minutes
and<00:06:31.580> then<00:06:31.670> come<00:06:31.850> back<00:06:31.880> and<00:06:32.150> check<00:06:32.390> on<00:06:32.450> our

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
and then come back and check on our

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.840 
and then come back and check on our
pumpkin<00:06:33.260> burrs

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:36.850 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:43.240 

our<00:06:37.850> pumpkin<00:06:40.270> burrs<00:06:41.270> are<00:06:41.900> finished<00:06:42.560> I<00:06:42.920> guess

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
our pumpkin burrs are finished I guess

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.040 
our pumpkin burrs are finished I guess
it's<00:06:43.460> kind<00:06:43.700> of<00:06:43.730> more<00:06:43.880> like<00:06:43.910> a<00:06:44.090> pumpkin<00:06:44.390> cake<00:06:44.750> we

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
it's kind of more like a pumpkin cake we

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.380 
it's kind of more like a pumpkin cake we
cut<00:06:45.920> it<00:06:46.010> up<00:06:46.070> into<00:06:46.250> bars<00:06:46.520> or<00:06:46.760> however<00:06:47.090> you<00:06:47.180> want

cut it up into bars or however you want

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.700 
cut it up into bars or however you want
now<00:06:48.320> to<00:06:49.010> make<00:06:49.160> sure<00:06:49.190> that<00:06:49.580> it's<00:06:49.790> done<00:06:50.090> just

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
now to make sure that it's done just

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.770 
now to make sure that it's done just
insert<00:06:51.710> a<00:06:51.950> toothpick<00:06:52.730> in<00:06:53.150> the<00:06:53.270> middle<00:06:53.300> and<00:06:53.690> if

insert a toothpick in the middle and if

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.840 
insert a toothpick in the middle and if
the<00:06:53.870> toothpick<00:06:54.260> comes<00:06:54.290> out<00:06:54.590> dry<00:06:54.860> then<00:06:55.430> it<00:06:55.730> is

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
the toothpick comes out dry then it is

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.700 
the toothpick comes out dry then it is
done<00:06:56.030> this<00:06:56.780> one<00:06:56.990> here<00:06:57.140> actually<00:06:57.260> took<00:06:57.530> about

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
done this one here actually took about

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.390 
done this one here actually took about
27<00:06:58.340> minutes<00:06:58.600> to<00:06:59.600> do<00:06:59.750> so<00:07:00.320> again<00:07:00.920> it<00:07:01.040> depends<00:07:01.280> on

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 
27 minutes to do so again it depends on

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.910 
27 minutes to do so again it depends on
the<00:07:01.460> heat<00:07:01.820> of<00:07:02.030> your<00:07:02.210> oven<00:07:02.330> plus<00:07:02.720> I<00:07:02.990> set<00:07:03.800> the

the heat of your oven plus I set the

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.620 
the heat of your oven plus I set the
timer<00:07:04.130> first<00:07:04.490> for<00:07:04.670> 20<00:07:04.880> minutes<00:07:05.120> and<00:07:05.270> then<00:07:05.390> just

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630 
timer first for 20 minutes and then just

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.540 
timer first for 20 minutes and then just
checked<00:07:05.870> it<00:07:05.990> periodically<00:07:06.380> put<00:07:07.160> a<00:07:07.190> total<00:07:07.490> of

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
checked it periodically put a total of

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.730 
checked it periodically put a total of
27<00:07:08.150> minutes<00:07:08.300> to<00:07:08.570> get<00:07:08.690> to<00:07:09.320> the<00:07:09.380> point<00:07:09.560> where<00:07:09.680> the
