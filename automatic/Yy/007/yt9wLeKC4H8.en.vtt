00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
way too many unknown factors most

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.979 
way too many unknown factors most
notably<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> price<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.469> availability<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.750> if

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
notably the price and availability so if

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.930 
notably the price and availability so if

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
i do go with the nexus 7 i'd probably

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.410 
i do go with the nexus 7 i'd probably
get<00:00:54.510> rid<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.809> all<00:00:55.020> these<00:00:55.230> ads<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:59.420> also

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
another thing that's that's weighing my

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.189 
another thing that's that's weighing my
decision<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> fact<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.449> overall<00:01:03.809> i've

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
decision is the fact that overall i've

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.520

device<00:05:40.779> I<00:05:40.990> don't<00:05:41.380> know<00:05:42.690> but<00:05:43.690> I'm<00:05:43.840> basing<00:05:44.259> that

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
device I don't know but I'm basing that

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.080 
device I don't know but I'm basing that
on<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.650> fact<00:05:44.860> that<00:05:44.919> I<00:05:45.039> do<00:05:45.099> tend<00:05:45.520> to<00:05:45.610> use<00:05:45.729> Google

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
on the fact that I do tend to use Google

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.379 
on the fact that I do tend to use Google
services<00:05:46.539> a<00:05:46.599> lot<00:05:46.810> more<00:05:47.669> but<00:05:48.669> again<00:05:48.969> you<00:05:49.210> have

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
services a lot more but again you have

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:50.790 
services a lot more but again you have
to<00:05:49.569> ask<00:05:49.690> yourself<00:05:49.960> a<00:05:50.319> lot<00:05:50.440> of<00:05:50.529> people<00:05:50.740> are

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
to ask yourself a lot of people are

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.200 
to ask yourself a lot of people are
going<00:05:50.889> to<00:05:50.979> say<00:05:51.099> well<00:05:51.130> Facebook<00:05:51.550> collects<00:05:52.029> my

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
going to say well Facebook collects my

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.890 
going to say well Facebook collects my
day<00:05:52.270> to<00:05:52.389> Google<00:05:52.810> collects<00:05:53.080> my<00:05:53.229> data<00:05:53.440> um<00:05:54.900> the

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
day to Google collects my data um the

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.300 
day to Google collects my data um the
way<00:05:56.020> I<00:05:56.050> look<00:05:56.379> at<00:05:56.529> it<00:05:56.560> is<00:05:56.740> that<00:05:56.770> if<00:05:56.979> you<00:05:57.039> store

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
way I look at it is that if you store

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.890 
way I look at it is that if you store
anything<00:05:57.550> on<00:05:57.759> a<00:05:57.789> remote<00:05:58.000> server<00:05:58.240> you<00:05:58.539> always

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
anything on a remote server you always

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.659 
anything on a remote server you always
have<00:05:59.050> to<00:05:59.169> have<00:05:59.199> that<00:05:59.529> possibility<00:06:00.370> in<00:06:00.639> mind

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
have to have that possibility in mind

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.100 
have to have that possibility in mind
and<00:06:01.180> given<00:06:01.990> the<00:06:02.349> way<00:06:02.949> the<00:06:02.979> world<00:06:03.370> seems<00:06:03.789> to<00:06:03.909> be

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
and given the way the world seems to be

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.379 
and given the way the world seems to be
shifting<00:06:05.110> towards<00:06:05.590> this<00:06:05.830> remote<00:06:06.389> kamote

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
shifting towards this remote kamote

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.480 
shifting towards this remote kamote
computation<00:06:08.199> model<00:06:08.590> maybe<00:06:09.099> not<00:06:09.279> for

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
computation model maybe not for

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.700 
computation model maybe not for
everything<00:06:09.909> keep<00:06:10.120> in<00:06:10.240> mind<00:06:10.479> but<00:06:10.710> certainly

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
everything keep in mind but certainly

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.740 
everything keep in mind but certainly
for<00:06:11.919> a<00:06:11.979> fair<00:06:12.250> for<00:06:12.610> a<00:06:12.639> lot<00:06:12.879> of<00:06:13.029> it<00:06:13.169> I<00:06:15.690> don't<00:06:16.690> know

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
for a fair for a lot of it I don't know

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.769 
for a fair for a lot of it I don't know
if<00:06:16.870> that's<00:06:17.020> avoidable<00:06:17.490> you<00:06:18.490> know<00:06:18.610> all<00:06:19.389> I<00:06:19.449> can

if that's avoidable you know all I can

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.050 
if that's avoidable you know all I can
say<00:06:19.960> is<00:06:19.990> be<00:06:20.229> careful<00:06:20.669> but<00:06:21.669> what<00:06:21.759> do<00:06:21.849> you<00:06:21.879> guys
