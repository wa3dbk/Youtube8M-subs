00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:31.050
 with a conception almost like 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:34.140

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.550

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.379
 my voice aligns nina and exactly 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.040
 in a year we can all ours 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.040

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.590
 the idea of ​​the boys choir city 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.360
 Berlin is cultural as well 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.820
 easy things have happened in Munich 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.980
 Nightlife is missing until now 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.309
 but what exactly is that special about 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.489
 scarce choir first of course that we 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.970
 just always can be beautiful and 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.369
 We also drink during the beer or 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.940
 some more often stay afterwards 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.680
 hang when the bathing is opened 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.220
 is the basis for it and so to speak 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.149
 then we just pop in 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.000
 occur 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.530
 actually it should just be fun 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.140
 loose round up were left when 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.380
 a lot and rant and drink as well 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.810
 during rehearsals and actually that 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.810
 is great fun 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.310
 the musical director and 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.530
 the heart of the troupe the trained 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.610
 singer andrea punk 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.010
 completely different people 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.880
 different professions of musicians 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:55.890
 artists the cs teacher advocate 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.110
 Judge everything together with one 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.270
 girlfriend had visited many lisa grains 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.730
 but no one really liked it 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.790
 So they decided shortly 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.670
 december 2013 founded their own 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.229
 We like the short choir because it stops 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.570
 somehow more unconventional than in 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.130
 I tell other serious choirs now 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.200
 that means everyone can join 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.440
 regardless of how well he sings he 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.290
 reading notes can be the main thing that's fun 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.350
 calms me is actually so what 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.300
 during the week totally total 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.209
 relaxed I am the boys choir here 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.220
 because I like singing and looking for people 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.660

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.390
 People just enjoy singing 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.870
 is loose and what cruise on his legs 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.870
 provides 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.049
 the collective dresses in his 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:54.159
 appear a very specific motto 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.969
 magic detect detection muscle shirts and 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.159
 jogging pants 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:59.620
 but more important than beautiful sounds 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.290
 or the occurrence is that together 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.629

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.829
