00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
was up but that is just because the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.360 
was up but that is just because the
rendering<00:02:19.870> settings<00:02:20.050> are<00:02:20.470> messing<00:02:20.920> up<00:02:21.069> on<00:02:21.220> my

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
rendering settings are messing up on my

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.370 
rendering settings are messing up on my
computer<00:02:21.580> which<00:02:22.360> makes<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.870> look<00:02:23.110> like<00:02:23.140> it's

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
computer which makes it look like it's

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.270 
computer which makes it look like it's
lagging<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.400> when<00:02:25.269> i<00:02:25.300> play<00:02:25.540> 2k<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.380> that's<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
lagging on when i play 2k and that's the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.860 
lagging on when i play 2k and that's the
only<00:02:27.459> game<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.640> does<00:02:27.849> that<00:02:28.120> for<00:02:28.180> other<00:02:28.480> every

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
only game that does that for other every

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.120 
only game that does that for other every
other<00:02:28.900> game<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.380> doesn't<00:02:29.470> do<00:02:29.739> that<00:02:29.860> just<00:02:30.069> for

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
other game it doesn't do that just for

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.949 
other game it doesn't do that just for
2k<00:02:30.550> that's<00:02:30.760> probably<00:02:31.090> why<00:02:31.269> having<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.599> posting

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959
