00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.429
 saleh falling from these viewfinders and 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.590
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.900
 monthly video of tutorials on minecraft 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.400
 to told myself why not make 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.759
 tutos because it would please any 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.430
 the world 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.929
 So here at maintaining it is night 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.789
 but suddenly very quickly and you 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.140
 see his lower left fleet 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.660
 so today I 'm going to teach you to 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.570
 to make a machine to go back in time 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.769
 that's what we're going to do today so 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.790
 with these new blocks of how it's 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.960
 true that I have not returned to 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.339
 minecraft for some time which I 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.199
 do not know all the blues that's true 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.330
 what me makes me laugh 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.600
 a command block in quite a lot 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:50.220
 so we're going to expand that then 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.430
 look when I turn on that long the 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.830
 watch turns and time goes on see 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.239
 like that tac tac tac 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.979
 of course for creative construction 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.750
 but we all have humanitarian issues 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.220
 we can go into adventure mode 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.080
 and it always works in oubien mode 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.790
 survival is the same it continues to 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.759
 walk so it's true that if you 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.500
 use it in the survival side 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.700
 put yourself in the creative and after not 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.950
 to build it and then put 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.430
 you in survival pupa to benefit from 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.909
 this this machine of course you can 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.630
 always customize it by putting 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.909
 stairs 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.500
 that's your wish to look at I 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.110
 can put stairs provera rhdp 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.820
 like that hop I look at the tek tek thing 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.800
 here you see it's true that everything is 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.060
 possible 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.440
 yeah good so today I'm going to you 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.409
 learn to build this machine there 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.550
 so we put you two blocks of 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.150
 whatever 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.979
 a trick a frame you put the ride 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.960
 in 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:56.820
 then you do one two three and tac 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.880
 she must be there like that look 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.820
 compared to others 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.060
 then we will make a mini watch 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.479
 tak tak takers tears were safe 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.149
 of them , we are on two and we put 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.410
 two are like that 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.599
 look at it works she admits to put a 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.220
 time block doc tech commands and 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.000
 larvae boarded times at 2,500 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.260
 so here they tell me that I'm going to be 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.880
 in creative so we will get down to 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:28.090
 creative tech that's all so times to 2 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.410
 500 here after we'll spare a 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.510
 little bit because it's true like that 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.810
 it is I read all pretty pretty pretty 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.640
 so we can put yes we can put 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.700
 stairs 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.200

 stairs what did I do in 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.459
 stairs we can put others 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:03:00.280
