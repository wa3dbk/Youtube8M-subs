00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
though I think I definitely saw myself

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.289 
though I think I definitely saw myself
as<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> Matilda<00:01:31.799> when<00:01:32.280> adults<00:01:32.640> were<00:01:32.880> angry<00:01:33.180> at

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
as a Matilda when adults were angry at

you you could imagine yourself being

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.440 
you you could imagine yourself being
Matilda<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.460> getting<00:01:35.790> your<00:01:35.880> own<00:01:36.030> back<00:01:36.240> I

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
Matilda and getting your own back I

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.999 
Matilda and getting your own back I
think<00:01:36.630> actually<00:01:36.780> my<00:01:37.020> favorite<00:01:37.290> role<00:01:37.590> Darlow
