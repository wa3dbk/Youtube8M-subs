right<00:00:21.869> now<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.080> update<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:22.859> Minecraft<00:00:23.220> is

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
right now the update for Minecraft is

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.019 
right now the update for Minecraft is
one<00:00:23.550> point<00:00:23.760> seven<00:00:23.970> point<00:00:24.330> four<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.820> if<00:00:26.820> you're

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
one point seven point four so if you're

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.700 
one point seven point four so if you're
wondering<00:00:27.240> why<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:27.810> doesn't<00:00:28.140> work<00:00:28.380> if<00:00:28.560> it's

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
wondering why this doesn't work if it's

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.139 
wondering why this doesn't work if it's
like<00:00:28.890> two<00:00:29.310> point<00:00:30.679> seven<00:00:31.679> point<00:00:31.949> thirty<00:00:32.790> two

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
like two point seven point thirty two

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.060 
like two point seven point thirty two
and<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.750> completely<00:00:34.290> different<00:00:34.710> then

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
and it's completely different then

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.690 
and it's completely different then
that's<00:00:35.309> probably<00:00:35.489> why<00:00:36.020> but<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.700> extremely

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
that's probably why but it's extremely

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.670 
that's probably why but it's extremely
extremely<00:00:39.239> simple<00:00:39.660> today<00:00:39.870> well<00:00:40.410> I'm<00:00:40.559> just
