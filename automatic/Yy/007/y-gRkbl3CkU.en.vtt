00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
much kind of got me realizing that his

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.200

to take him down and the best way to
take<00:01:55.020> him<00:01:55.140> down<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.890> use<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.219> most<00:01:56.369> useless

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
take him down is to use the most useless

Pokemon<00:01:57.329> on<00:01:57.540> your<00:01:57.780> team<00:01:58.049> against<00:01:58.560> it

Pokemon on your team against it

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.469 
Pokemon on your team against it
now<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.040> reason<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.399> said<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.640> I<00:02:00.060> feel<00:02:00.329> like

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
now the reason I said that I feel like

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.850 
now the reason I said that I feel like
my<00:02:00.659> dragon<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.229> particular<00:02:01.680> match

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
my dragon in this particular match

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.950 
my dragon in this particular match
against<00:02:02.219> his<00:02:02.369> team<00:02:02.520> was<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> most<00:02:03.390> useless<00:02:03.689> is

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
against his team was the most useless is

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.410 
against his team was the most useless is
because<00:02:04.439> he<00:02:04.619> had<00:02:04.829> rack<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.399> he<00:02:05.520> had<00:02:05.700> Garchomp

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
because he had rack and he had Garchomp

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.449 
because he had rack and he had Garchomp
yeah<00:02:06.630> actually<00:02:06.899> Guardian<00:02:07.380> cannot<00:02:07.619> speed<00:02:07.890> he

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
yeah actually Guardian cannot speed he

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.479 
yeah actually Guardian cannot speed he
had<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.789> many<00:02:08.910> stuff<00:02:09.500> even<00:02:10.500> Breloom<00:02:11.009> that

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
had so many stuff even Breloom that

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.010 
had so many stuff even Breloom that
could<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:11.819> all<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.330> those<00:02:12.480> who<00:02:12.660> could<00:02:12.780> have

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
could have all of those who could have

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.720 
could have all of those who could have

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
ready my dragon and I personally feel

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.910 
ready my dragon and I personally feel
dragon<00:02:15.570> won't<00:02:15.720> have<00:02:15.900> really<00:02:16.230> been<00:02:16.470> doing<00:02:16.620> much

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
dragon won't have really been doing much

put it to sleep I guess he was

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
most likely switch but he isn't waking

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.850 
most likely switch but he isn't waking
up<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.300> now<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.540> know<00:02:33.870> he's<00:02:34.440> going<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.710> switch

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
up and now I know he's going to switch

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.380 
up and now I know he's going to switch
out<00:02:35.070> if<00:02:35.250> he<00:02:35.340> doesn't<00:02:35.640> switch<00:02:35.820> out<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.300> still

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
know he's kind of switch out to

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.120 
know he's kind of switch out to
something<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.930> he<00:02:58.110> did<00:02:58.290> there<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:58.830> now<00:02:59.070> he

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
something and he did there but now he

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.880 
something and he did there but now he
did<00:02:59.460> stay<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.940> think<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.780> will<00:03:01.140> maybe<00:03:01.650> all

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
did stay and think that I will maybe all

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.530 
did stay and think that I will maybe all
predict<00:03:02.280> I'm<00:03:02.400> not<00:03:02.550> too<00:03:02.700> sure<00:03:02.910> maybe<00:03:03.150> make<00:03:03.510> a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
predict I'm not too sure maybe make a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.830 
predict I'm not too sure maybe make a
double<00:03:03.840> switch<00:03:04.310> but<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.340> didn't<00:03:05.640> do<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.840> maybe

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
double switch but I didn't do that maybe

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.600 
double switch but I didn't do that maybe
he<00:03:07.200> was<00:03:07.320> saying<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.590> don't<00:03:07.620> have<00:03:07.860> Matt<00:03:08.130> puncture

at<00:04:44.390> Caesar<00:04:44.660> and<00:04:44.870> everybody's<00:04:45.560> gonna<00:04:45.680> think

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
at Caesar and everybody's gonna think

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.980

that<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:46.460> resists<00:04:46.820> bug<00:04:47.000> for<00:04:47.210> exams<00:04:47.480> but<00:04:47.780> it

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
that it resists bug for exams but it

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.140 
that it resists bug for exams but it
doesn't<00:04:48.350> buck<00:04:48.530> that's<00:04:49.280> neutral<00:04:49.580> against<00:04:49.940> bog

doesn't buck that's neutral against bog

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.990 
doesn't buck that's neutral against bog
and<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:50.990> guess<00:04:51.200> in<00:04:51.950> that<00:04:51.980> case<00:04:52.370> was<00:04:52.670> the<00:04:52.820> best

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
and I guess in that case was the best

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.210 
and I guess in that case was the best
but<00:04:53.510> he<00:04:53.990> let<00:04:54.140> out<00:04:54.200> speed<00:04:54.470> me<00:04:54.590> because<00:04:54.830> he<00:04:54.950> is<00:04:55.070> of

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
but he let out speed me because he is of

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.130 
but he let out speed me because he is of
course<00:04:55.430> our<00:04:55.670> fine<00:04:55.910> life<00:04:56.180> for<00:04:56.420> genesect<00:04:56.960> I'm

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
I would have decided to go for it

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.530 
I would have decided to go for it
because<00:05:19.100> of<00:05:19.430> this<00:05:19.550> certain<00:05:19.910> situations<00:05:20.420> I

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
because of this certain situations I

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.690

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
mean it's already a defensive wall a

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.130 
mean it's already a defensive wall a
defensive<00:05:23.270> think<00:05:23.480> it's<00:05:23.660> still<00:05:23.810> dishing<00:05:24.080> out

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
defensive think it's still dishing out

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.920 
defensive think it's still dishing out
enough<00:05:24.470> damage<00:05:24.830> but<00:05:25.790> really<00:05:26.420> when<00:05:26.690> you<00:05:26.780> think

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
enough damage but really when you think

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.080 
enough damage but really when you think
about<00:05:26.990> it<00:05:27.260> I<00:05:27.350> mean<00:05:27.440> 8pp<00:05:27.920> is<00:05:28.310> just<00:05:28.550> not<00:05:28.820> that

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
about it I mean 8pp is just not that

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.450 
about it I mean 8pp is just not that
good<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.710> yeah<00:05:30.710> and<00:05:30.830> when<00:05:31.010> I<00:05:31.040> think<00:05:31.250> about<00:05:31.280> it

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
good and yeah and when I think about it

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.670 
good and yeah and when I think about it
a<00:05:31.520> bit<00:05:31.640> more<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:32.840> way<00:05:32.990> I<00:05:33.020> was<00:05:33.320> playing<00:05:33.560> with

a bit more the way I was playing with

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.890 
a bit more the way I was playing with
this<00:05:33.800> guy<00:05:34.010> wasn't<00:05:34.370> the<00:05:34.610> smartest<00:05:34.970> way<00:05:35.390> I<00:05:35.630> could

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
this guy wasn't the smartest way I could

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.480 
this guy wasn't the smartest way I could
have<00:05:35.990> easily<00:05:36.169> would<00:05:36.620> switch<00:05:36.890> away<00:05:37.100> and<00:05:37.310> switch

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490
