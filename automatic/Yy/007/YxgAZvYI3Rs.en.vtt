00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.639 

so<00:00:05.759> now<00:00:05.910> we're<00:00:06.060> going<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.240> go<00:00:06.359> downstairs<00:00:06.649> in

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
so now we're going to go downstairs in

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.950 
so now we're going to go downstairs in
make<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.639> small<00:00:08.849> God's<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.269> some<00:00:09.420> biodiesel

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
make of small God's of some biodiesel

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.129 
make of small God's of some biodiesel
from<00:00:10.410> fish<00:00:10.590> oil

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.689 

and<00:00:15.139> here's<00:00:15.889> our<00:00:16.010> nice<00:00:16.250> little<00:00:16.460> app

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
and here's our nice little app

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.420 
and here's our nice little app
downstairs<00:00:17.270> where<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:17.689> fish<00:00:17.990> oil<00:00:18.200> gets<00:00:21.430> in

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
downstairs where the fish oil gets in

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.710 
downstairs where the fish oil gets in
what<00:00:22.970> chemical<00:00:23.390> is<00:00:23.509> that<00:00:23.689> Morgan<00:00:25.750> all<00:00:26.750> right

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
what chemical is that Morgan all right

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.749 
what chemical is that Morgan all right
so<00:00:29.720> we're<00:00:29.869> just<00:00:29.900> making<00:00:30.290> a<00:00:30.349> small<00:00:30.619> batch<00:00:30.800> of<00:00:31.070> of

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
so we're just making a small batch of of

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:48.630 
so we're just making a small batch of of
biodiesel<00:00:32.329> today

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.810 

good

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
good

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.920 
good
that's<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.149> mixing<00:00:50.480> of<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.660> potassium

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
that's the mixing of the potassium

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.040 
that's the mixing of the potassium
hydroxide<00:00:51.730> with<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:52.910> methyl<00:00:53.269> alcohol<00:00:53.449> which

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
hydroxide with the methyl alcohol which

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.380 
hydroxide with the methyl alcohol which
creates<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.860> methyl<00:00:55.220> ester<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:55.879> cat<00:00:56.089> or<00:00:56.360> the

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
creates a methyl ester the cat or the

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.280 
creates a methyl ester the cat or the
potassium<00:00:56.900> hydroxide<00:00:57.320> is<00:00:57.710> a<00:00:57.739> catalyst<00:00:59.290> and

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
potassium hydroxide is a catalyst and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:08.460 
potassium hydroxide is a catalyst and
how<00:01:00.409> much<00:01:00.559> of<00:01:00.710> that<00:01:01.570> 250<00:01:02.570> milliliters<00:01:03.170> of<00:01:03.280> a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.719 

soil<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.820> we're<00:01:11.000> going<00:01:11.119> to<00:01:11.180> add<00:01:12.729> 40

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
soil and we're going to add 40

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:25.100 
soil and we're going to add 40
milliliters<00:01:14.030> out<00:01:14.450> of<00:01:14.600> 50

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:41.859 

she<00:01:25.620> noon<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:25.980> two<00:01:26.190> stages<00:01:26.550> to<00:01:26.610> make<00:01:26.760> sure

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:49.000 

now<00:01:42.869> we're<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.140> reading<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> temperature

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.760 

this<00:01:50.010> is<00:01:50.130> separating<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.950> glycerin<00:01:53.790> has<00:01:54.770> sunk

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
this is separating the glycerin has sunk

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.219 
this is separating the glycerin has sunk
to<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.070> bottom<00:01:56.190> and<00:01:56.910> now<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.660> just<00:01:57.840> drain

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
to the bottom and now we can just drain

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.590 
to the bottom and now we can just drain
it<00:01:58.260> up
