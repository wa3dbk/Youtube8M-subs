00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.760 
me a little bit more about how the
action<00:01:34.039> is<00:01:34.130> going<00:01:34.219> to<00:01:34.340> work<00:01:34.490> in<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:34.850> game<00:01:35.770> in

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
action is going to work in the game in

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.469 
action is going to work in the game in
this<00:01:36.950> game<00:01:37.189> we've<00:01:37.430> really<00:01:37.909> focused<00:01:38.119> on

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
this game we've really focused on

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.429 
this game we've really focused on
Harry's<00:01:39.170> experience<00:01:40.780> outside<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:42.020> Hogwarts

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
Harry's experience outside of Hogwarts

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.090 
Harry's experience outside of Hogwarts
obviously<00:01:42.890> he's<00:01:43.520> on<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.090> run<00:01:44.270> from<00:01:45.100> Voldemort

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
obviously he's on the run from Voldemort

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.219 
obviously he's on the run from Voldemort
and<00:01:46.280> obviously<00:01:46.549> Voldemort's<00:01:47.090> minions<00:01:47.929> if<00:01:48.140> you

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
and obviously Voldemort's minions if you

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.660 
and obviously Voldemort's minions if you
like<00:01:48.409> so<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.829> death<00:01:49.009> eaters<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:49.579> the

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
like so the death eaters and the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.580 
like so the death eaters and the
snatchers<00:01:50.119> so<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:50.929> really<00:01:50.990> means<00:01:51.320> that<00:01:51.500> he

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
snatchers so it really means that he

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.109 
snatchers so it really means that he
needs<00:01:51.799> to<00:01:51.950> use<00:01:51.979> all<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:52.460> those<00:01:52.579> skills<00:01:52.880> all

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
needs to use all of those skills all

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.700

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
those spells he's learnt over time at

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.130 
those spells he's learnt over time at
school<00:01:54.979> in<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.820> real<00:01:56.000> world<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:56.630> he's

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
school in the real world so he's

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.139 
school in the real world so he's
immediately<00:01:57.380> on<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:58.039> run<00:01:58.219> he's<00:01:58.549> fighting<00:01:59.060> for

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.370 
immediately on the run he's fighting for
his<00:01:59.210> life<00:01:59.329> he<00:01:59.659> really<00:01:59.899> needs<00:02:00.049> to<00:02:00.140> use<00:02:00.229> their

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.550 
his life he really needs to use their
spells<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.920> defend<00:02:01.909> himself<00:02:02.060> really<00:02:02.719> so<00:02:02.990> it's

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
spells to defend himself really so it's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.899

that we've seen in the fiction has been

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.270 
that we've seen in the fiction has been
the<00:02:22.370> inferi<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:23.120> found<00:02:23.810> them<00:02:23.990> truly<00:02:24.280> terrifying

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280

in<00:02:25.640> half-blood<00:02:26.180> Prince<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.780> noticed<00:02:27.550> there<00:02:28.550> in

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
in half-blood Prince I noticed there in

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.300 
in half-blood Prince I noticed there in
this<00:02:28.880> launch<00:02:29.150> trailer<00:02:29.600> they<00:02:30.170> are<00:02:30.350> Voldemort's

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
this launch trailer they are Voldemort's

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.420

reanimating<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.450> dead<00:02:33.170> effectively<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.160> and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
reanimating the dead effectively and and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.170

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
essentially and so that Voldemort can

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.400 
essentially and so that Voldemort can
capture<00:02:41.000> him<00:02:41.270> they're<00:02:41.810> kind<00:02:42.020> of<00:02:42.050> used<00:02:42.260> as

pictures<00:04:39.949> to<00:04:40.130> create<00:04:40.460> that<00:04:40.789> term<00:04:41.150> texture<00:04:41.810> we

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
pictures to create that term texture we

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.930 
pictures to create that term texture we
call<00:04:42.199> them<00:04:42.380> which<00:04:42.860> appears<00:04:43.220> on<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.520> floor<00:04:43.789> and

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
call them which appears on the floor and

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.730 
call them which appears on the floor and
on<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.030> walls<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:44.539> when<00:04:45.139> you're<00:04:45.259> looking<00:04:45.560> at

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
on the walls so when you're looking at

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.129 
on the walls so when you're looking at
the<00:04:46.190> wall<00:04:46.400> in<00:04:46.699> the<00:04:46.910> game<00:04:47.120> it's<00:04:47.509> actually<00:04:47.660> using

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
the wall in the game it's actually using

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.809 
the wall in the game it's actually using
the<00:04:48.229> same<00:04:48.470> kind<00:04:48.860> of<00:04:48.919> material<00:04:49.460> that's<00:04:49.639> being

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
the same kind of material that's being

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.180 
the same kind of material that's being
used<00:04:49.940> in<00:04:50.449> the<00:04:50.539> real<00:04:50.720> in<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.110> real<00:04:51.229> set<00:04:51.560> so<00:04:52.069> it

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
used in the real in the real set so it

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.070 
used in the real in the real set so it
really<00:04:52.340> is<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.490> one-to-one<00:04:52.819> image<00:04:53.180> so<00:04:53.930> why

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
really is a one-to-one image so why

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.559 
really is a one-to-one image so why
don't<00:04:54.229> we<00:04:54.259> talk<00:04:54.500> about<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:55.430> dragon<00:04:55.940> yes<00:04:56.180> the

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:31.909 
throughout the game engine and you've

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:33.459 
throughout the game engine and you've
actually<00:05:32.090> built<00:05:32.389> this<00:05:32.630> game<00:05:33.050> engine<00:05:33.349> from

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:33.469 
actually built this game engine from

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:34.930 
actually built this game engine from

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
to capture the whole idea of magic being

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.490 
to capture the whole idea of magic being
alive<00:05:40.039> and<00:05:40.370> being<00:05:40.430> bright<00:05:40.909> and<00:05:41.150> powerful<00:05:41.599> and

these<00:05:44.990> great<00:05:45.259> effects<00:05:45.620> with<00:05:45.800> physics<00:05:46.219> and<00:05:46.490> our

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
these great effects with physics and our

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.689 
these great effects with physics and our
new<00:05:47.719> tech<00:05:47.900> allows<00:05:48.169> us<00:05:48.320> to<00:05:48.409> do<00:05:48.530> that<00:05:48.740> so<00:05:49.099> the<00:05:49.219> 360

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
new tech allows us to do that so the 360

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.469 
new tech allows us to do that so the 360
ps3<00:05:50.440> are<00:05:51.440> amazing<00:05:52.370> level<00:05:52.669> now<00:05:52.789> and<00:05:53.000> also<00:05:53.270> that

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
version as well this seems to me the

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.100 
version as well this seems to me the
most<00:05:57.860> dangerous<00:05:58.280> moment<00:05:58.520> of<00:05:58.819> also<00:05:59.389> talk<00:05:59.630> to<00:05:59.840> me
