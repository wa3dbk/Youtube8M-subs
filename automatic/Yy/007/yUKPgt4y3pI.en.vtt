yeah the purpose of the pests are to

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.959 
yeah the purpose of the pests are to
pass<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.170> cups<00:03:09.379> over<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.709> weight<00:03:10.129> mechanism

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:10.969 
pass the cups over a weight mechanism

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.970 
pass the cups over a weight mechanism
dropping<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.109> Apple<00:03:12.500> out<00:03:12.680> of<00:03:12.859> each

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
dropping the Apple out of each

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.280 
dropping the Apple out of each
individual<00:03:13.519> cup<00:03:13.730> onto<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.239> little<00:03:14.689> conveyor

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
individual cup onto a little conveyor

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.890 
individual cup onto a little conveyor
that<00:03:15.799> then<00:03:16.010> takes<00:03:16.310> them<00:03:16.489> to<00:03:16.640> these<00:03:16.819> bins<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:17.840> we

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
that then takes them to these bins so we

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.959 
that then takes them to these bins so we
have<00:03:18.019> larger<00:03:18.500> apples<00:03:18.890> at<00:03:19.040> one<00:03:19.219> end<00:03:19.430> the

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:19.969 
have larger apples at one end the

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:21.459 
have larger apples at one end the
smallest<00:03:20.299> apples<00:03:20.870> at<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.079> far<00:03:21.260> end

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:21.469 
smallest apples at the far end

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:22.780 
smallest apples at the far end

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.459 
ultimately you're gonna end up with the
apples<00:03:23.150> being<00:03:23.420> put<00:03:23.599> into<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.870> bag
