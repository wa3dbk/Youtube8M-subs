well<00:00:01.709> it<00:00:01.920> occurs<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.399> me<00:00:02.550> that<00:00:03.149> I've<00:00:03.210> never

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
well it occurs to me that I've never

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.019 
well it occurs to me that I've never
actually<00:00:03.629> done<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:03.959> video<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.529> this<00:00:04.650> car<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.850> I

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
actually done a video of this car and I

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.909 
actually done a video of this car and I
figured<00:00:06.359> because<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.779> new<00:00:06.960> loaner<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.620> coming

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
figured because the new loaner is coming

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.009 
figured because the new loaner is coming
to<00:00:07.980> pick<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.189> up<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:08.820> should<00:00:09.059> probably<00:00:09.510> do<00:00:09.809> one

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
to pick it up I should probably do one

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.259 
to pick it up I should probably do one
while<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.170> had<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> chance
