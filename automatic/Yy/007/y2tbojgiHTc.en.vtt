00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.530 

getting<00:05:38.530> rid<00:05:38.920> of<00:05:38.950> all<00:05:39.280> those<00:05:39.460> gaps<00:05:39.910> so<00:05:40.300> take

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
all right so now I'm just gonna pin a

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.019 
all right so now I'm just gonna pin a
little<00:05:57.289> bit<00:05:59.739> these<00:06:00.739> up<00:06:01.039> here<00:06:01.339> I<00:06:01.610> would<00:06:01.879> have

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:02.029 
little bit these up here I would have

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:05.289 
little bit these up here I would have
preferred<00:06:02.269> them<00:06:02.689> single<00:06:03.349> a<00:06:03.379> bit<00:06:03.709> more<00:06:04.009> but<00:06:04.369> it

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:05.299 
preferred them single a bit more but it

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:13.089 
preferred them single a bit more but it
is<00:06:05.479> weighted<00:06:11.259> then<00:06:12.259> when<00:06:12.379> I<00:06:12.409> have<00:06:12.559> tint<00:06:12.799> files

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099 
is weighted then when I have tint files

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:15.999 
is weighted then when I have tint files
like<00:06:13.399> this<00:06:13.639> I<00:06:13.849> don't<00:06:13.909> want<00:06:14.569> to<00:06:15.319> pin<00:06:15.559> it<00:06:15.709> crazy

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:16.009 
like this I don't want to pin it crazy

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:18.339 
like this I don't want to pin it crazy
tight<00:06:16.369> like<00:06:16.579> that<00:06:16.629> so<00:06:17.629> I<00:06:17.659> just<00:06:17.689> gather<00:06:18.110> a

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:18.349 
tight like that so I just gather a

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:35.570 
tight like that so I just gather a
little<00:06:18.709> bit<00:06:18.889> and<00:06:19.099> kind<00:06:19.279> of<00:06:19.399> twist

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.820
