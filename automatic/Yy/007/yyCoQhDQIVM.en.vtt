00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:13.139
 there is nothing to which we must say no 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:17.460
 absolute but there is much more 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:22.529
 neighbor say we limit you see the man not 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.199
 he never ate a sugar in the gran 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:30.449
 part of its history 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.489
 of the industry discovered that if if in i 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.230
 bad quality foods adds some 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.630
 of sugar seem of good quality 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.969
 in fact follow the people and the labels 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.040
 find out that a lot of Rome from 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.230
 supermarket contains sugar that it 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.120
 sugar in the boxed design is there 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.100
 sugar in the serene beautiful zuccaro sky 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.620
 the sugar is ready in the bar 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.460
 etc. and sugar in rusks 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.140
 very difficult to find faith there 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.010
 Discounted real accomplishes the pumpkin is 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.010
 why they put us 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.290
 because they are the first side boulders 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.180
 catch fine end with pan di 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.770
 sugar 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.830
 it almost seems like a thing to eat 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.229
 because we are capable sugar is a 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.479
 way to make things look good 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.729
 which are not good it was all bad 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.890
 but perhaps the form of sugar that does more 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.320
 bad is that of liquid sugar 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.260
 of sugar in the form of drinks 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.760
 sweetened sugars of the object encloses 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.560
 fruit juices because they must also 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.060
 a pumpkin festival of his strongest 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.070
 because society is already sweet but that 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.660
 he would need but he expects it bad 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.910
 in my opinion with what you will never succeed 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.470
 to sell it 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.360
 and meanwhile this liquid sugar was born 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.780
 to liquidate one of the peculiarities that 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.580
 goes down even if you pile up and there is indeed 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.860
 It is a pleasure to have done great 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.560
 big meal really a glass of 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.890
 coca cola almost gets us there later 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.860
 sink and you know these drinks 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.280
 sweetened are the main cause 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.240
 of obesity to visit children 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.240
 why fly 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:14.090
 the best way to sweeten the 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:15.770
 fruit for example you can make one 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.720
 good last sweet collection for 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.370
 example with the deal with the many i 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.560
 museums made with just the flakes 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.270
 hazelnuts with sultanas with 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.310
 small pieces of dried fruit 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.290
 if we eat i instead in the morning 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.110
 sweetened biscuits in the active 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.090
 sweetened it gets very high 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.970
 I know that when you raise blood sugar and 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.170
 still we respond by producing many 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.580
 insulin china will pass 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.380
 quickly to put the sugar 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.560
 inside the circle you know ours 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.310
 cells live a glucose concert is 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.400
 but when the collection is very sweet the 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.580
 pancreas produces unusual time and after 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.980
 a little goes I say he says he wants me 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.690
 say that the sweets you eat the most comes 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.340
 hunger for sugar because when it's mini 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.780
 pro generally we are hungry for sugar 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.430
 this is the reason why many 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.319
 students at the end of the morning are 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.940
 nervous are distracted fail to 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.069
 concentrate because there is not enough 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.690
 blood sugar and not enough 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.480
 sugar because we ate too much 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.769
 above mine also much better than 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.980
 sugar for the average do not eat at 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.200
 breakfast that honey is best eaten 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.730
 to snack after an intense one has been made 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.190
 physical activity has become a game 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.959
 to the ball of those that cut you off 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.609
 just that in the end it hurts me 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.410
 legs but say that you have consumed all 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.269
 the rowe pumpkins deposited at the canal that 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.079
 normally and excited of muscles below 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.549
 Octopus form I have with you both 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.170
 all of them started their sugar 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.330
 even if something like honey comes in 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.310
 which increases very quickly 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.350
 Mr. that Catalan needs because 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.130
 will go to replace what I know 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.130
 consummate of the no
