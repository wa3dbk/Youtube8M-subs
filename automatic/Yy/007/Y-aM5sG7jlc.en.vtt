found that over a day or two people tend

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.910 
found that over a day or two people tend
to<00:01:34.850> eat<00:01:35.060> a<00:01:35.090> pretty<00:01:35.420> consistent<00:01:36.050> weight<00:01:36.530> or

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
to eat a pretty consistent weight or

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
so if you lower the energy density you

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.500 
so if you lower the energy density you
can<00:01:42.130> have<00:01:42.370> a<00:01:42.400> full<00:01:42.700> plate<00:01:42.940> of<00:01:43.000> food<00:01:43.270> without

on

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
on

on

food<00:03:47.099> that<00:03:47.489> we<00:03:47.580> eat<00:03:47.610> is<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.180> water<00:03:48.450> content

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
food that we eat is the water content

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.559 
food that we eat is the water content
water<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.400> biggest<00:03:50.700> component<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.360> food

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
water is the biggest component of food

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.140 
water is the biggest component of food
and<00:03:51.930> because<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.709> adds<00:03:52.890> weight<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.580> volume

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
and because it adds weight and volume

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.530 
and because it adds weight and volume
and<00:03:54.360> no<00:03:54.569> calories<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:55.769> lowers<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:57.150> calorie

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
and no calories it lowers the calorie

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.580 
and no calories it lowers the calorie
density<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.769> if<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.580> bulk<00:03:59.940> out<00:04:00.150> foods<00:04:00.989> with

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
density so if you bulk out foods with

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.860 
density so if you bulk out foods with
high<00:04:02.190> water<00:04:02.519> content<00:04:02.849> foods<00:04:03.269> like<00:04:03.450> fruits<00:04:03.750> and

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
high water content foods like fruits and

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.520 
high water content foods like fruits and
vegetables<00:04:03.959> you<00:04:04.620> get<00:04:05.099> a<00:04:05.129> much<00:04:05.580> bigger<00:04:05.849> portion

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
vegetables you get a much bigger portion

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.979 
vegetables you get a much bigger portion
for<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.769> same<00:04:07.980> number<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.400> calories<00:04:08.989> doctor
