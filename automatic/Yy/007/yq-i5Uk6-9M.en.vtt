00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
new line of iPad microphones designed to

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.730 
new line of iPad microphones designed to
work<00:00:11.460> with<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.820> iPad<00:00:12.210> it's<00:00:12.809> called<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.259> tempo

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
work with the iPad it's called the tempo

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.790 
work with the iPad it's called the tempo
and<00:00:13.950> it's<00:00:14.429> right<00:00:14.639> over<00:00:14.670> here<00:00:15.410> what<00:00:16.410> happens

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
and it's right over here what happens

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.910 
and it's right over here what happens
with<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:16.980> ipad<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.359> puts<00:00:18.630> out<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> lower<00:00:19.080> USB

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
with the ipad is it puts out a lower USB

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.370 
with the ipad is it puts out a lower USB
power<00:00:20.250> than<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> standard<00:00:21.600> laptop<00:00:21.840> or<00:00:22.350> desktop

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
power than a standard laptop or desktop

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.439 
power than a standard laptop or desktop
so<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.460> we've<00:00:23.640> done<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.850> we've<00:00:24.119> made<00:00:24.330> our

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
so what we've done is we've made our

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.810 
so what we've done is we've made our
microphone<00:00:24.960> work<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> lower<00:00:25.949> power<00:00:26.279> rating

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
microphone work on a lower power rating

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.359 
microphone work on a lower power rating
so<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.480> operates<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.980> don't<00:00:29.189> need<00:00:29.340> a

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
so it operates with it you don't need a

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.999 
so it operates with it you don't need a
powered<00:00:29.760> USB<00:00:29.789> hub<00:00:30.269> what<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.560> need<00:00:31.769> though

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
powered USB hub what you do need though

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.840 
powered USB hub what you do need though
is<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:33.030> camera<00:00:33.809> connection<00:00:34.170> kit<00:00:34.320> which<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.920> 32
