00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
it bone straight and that's going to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
you know bone straight so there are

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.899 
you know bone straight so there are
several<00:01:24.759> ways<00:01:24.999> you<00:01:25.390> can<00:01:26.490> things<00:01:27.490> you<00:01:27.670> can<00:01:27.820> do

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
several ways you can things you can do

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.810 
several ways you can things you can do
the<00:01:28.060> text<00:01:28.420> likes<00:01:28.600> your<00:01:28.780> hair<00:01:28.810> what<00:01:29.590> I<00:01:29.770> do<00:01:29.829> is<00:01:30.130> I

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
the text likes your hair what I do is I

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.050 
the text likes your hair what I do is I
use<00:01:30.999> a<00:01:31.719> sensitive<00:01:32.350> scalp<00:01:32.619> base<00:01:32.890> which<00:01:33.759> that

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
use a sensitive scalp base which that

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.109 
use a sensitive scalp base which that
slows<00:01:34.420> down<00:01:34.719> the<00:01:34.990> relaxer<00:01:35.799> process<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.640> also

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
slows down the relaxer process and also

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.289 
slows down the relaxer process and also
if<00:01:37.600> you<00:01:37.719> put<00:01:37.990> conditioner<00:01:38.799> or<00:01:39.159> some<00:01:40.060> kind<00:01:40.240> of

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
if you put conditioner or some kind of

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.109 
if you put conditioner or some kind of
oil<00:01:40.569> and<00:01:40.899> your<00:01:41.079> relaxer<00:01:41.649> that<00:01:42.189> will<00:01:42.310> also<00:01:42.729> slow

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
oil and your relaxer that will also slow

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.389 
oil and your relaxer that will also slow
down<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.509> relaxer<00:01:44.939> now<00:01:46.859> when<00:01:47.859> the<00:01:47.950> relaxer

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
down the relaxer now when the relaxer

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.059 
down the relaxer now when the relaxer
gets<00:01:48.609> slow<00:01:48.850> down<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:49.780> means<00:01:50.020> that<00:01:50.170> is<00:01:50.380> taking

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
gets slow down that means that is taking

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.429 
gets slow down that means that is taking
longer<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.490> break<00:01:51.729> through<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.119> texture<00:01:52.689> also

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
longer to break through the texture also

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.889 
longer to break through the texture also
another<00:01:53.770> way<00:01:54.069> that<00:01:54.729> you<00:01:54.759> can<00:01:54.909> text<00:01:55.509> lecture

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
another way that you can text lecture

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.700 
another way that you can text lecture
hair<00:01:56.139> is<00:01:56.350> not<00:01:56.859> skip<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.789> straightening<00:01:58.710> step

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
hair is not skip the straightening step

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.859 
hair is not skip the straightening step
like<00:02:00.399> you<00:02:00.759> know<00:02:00.880> when<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.209> put<00:02:01.359> the<00:02:01.420> relaxer

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
like you know when you put the relaxer

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.870 
like you know when you put the relaxer
ND<00:02:02.109> you<00:02:02.200> have<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.619> know<00:02:02.740> straighten<00:02:03.670> it

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
ND you have to you know straighten it

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.090 
ND you have to you know straighten it
manually<00:02:04.450> with<00:02:04.600> your<00:02:04.780> hand<00:02:05.079> the<00:02:05.560> smoothing

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
manually with your hand the smoothing

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.520 
manually with your hand the smoothing
step<00:02:06.369> if<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:07.060> just<00:02:07.090> skip<00:02:07.509> that<00:02:07.749> that<00:02:08.289> also

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
step if you just skip that that also

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.490 
step if you just skip that that also
takes<00:02:08.890> lex<00:02:09.190> your<00:02:09.369> hair<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:10.390> test<00:02:10.810> Lessing<00:02:11.290> it's

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
takes lex your hair so test Lessing it's

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.010 
takes lex your hair so test Lessing it's
basically<00:02:12.069> just<00:02:12.160> under<00:02:13.120> processing<00:02:13.870> your

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
basically just under processing your
