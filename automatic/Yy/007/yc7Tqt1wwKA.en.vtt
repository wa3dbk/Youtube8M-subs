00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.409
 among the best and most accurate Catholics there will be in the world 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:25.079
 the first to be built in Mexico and Latin America and that was the time 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.439

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.120
 this duel 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.050
 will provide the nation 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.500
 of the technology platform 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.090
 basic to aim on 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.820
 the system

 industrial activity is required

 applications where a second is an invention of time 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.050
 what can another failure 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.420
 and repairable insists 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.010
 we are talking in systems 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.350
 Communication 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.439
 scientific experiments that require time measurement this clock 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.729
 atoms will coordinate the transmission of electricity the air navigation and 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.130
 maritime position systems 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.260
 I feel that which 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.410
 instead of pendulums to use tomes and replace news with systems 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.640
 electronic 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.510
 it is said that in these upcoming holidays 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.510
 the oscillations of the héctor martínez field 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.150
 the mechanical clock depends on a pendulum to work

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.220
 when these automotive

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.060
 Specially conditioned 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.430
 are you a very interesting phenomenon in which 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.649
 the atoms 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.499
 they decrease their temperature practically 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:16.569
 in fractions of a second the temperature of these atoms goes from 23 degrees 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.419
 Celsius at least 273 degrees Celsius 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.439
 these atoms in frozen state 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.439
 will be used 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.219
 know how long it will last 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.130
 one second 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.460
 and this time the atomic clock, despite about two tons, occupied a space of 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.800
 four meters wide by five long 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.030
 and here is forever in the national center of metrology in the state 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.230
 Mexican construction of the atomic clock started six years ago in the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.529
 final dependent of the economy secretariat 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:53.139
 10 Mexican scientists work full time in their development 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:58.230
