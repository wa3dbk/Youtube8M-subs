because<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:35.860> never<00:03:35.980> overheated<00:03:36.630> now<00:03:37.630> we'll

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
because it never overheated now we'll

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.910 
because it never overheated now we'll
just<00:03:39.900> let's<00:03:40.900> just<00:03:40.989> turn<00:03:41.230> on<00:03:41.350> this<00:03:41.530> decibel

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
just let's just turn on this decibel

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.390 
just let's just turn on this decibel
meter

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
meter

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.070 
meter
they<00:03:42.850> say<00:03:43.030> sixty<00:03:44.819> okay<00:03:45.819> I<00:03:46.000> said<00:03:46.569> about<00:03:46.780> our

they say sixty okay I said about our

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.080 
they say sixty okay I said about our
setup<00:03:47.920> maybe<00:03:48.130> ran<00:03:48.370> around<00:03:48.489> three<00:03:48.790> feet<00:03:48.819> away

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
setup maybe ran around three feet away

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.479 
setup maybe ran around three feet away
and<00:03:52.090> we'll<00:03:52.330> see<00:03:52.800> how<00:03:53.800> loud<00:03:54.010> this<00:03:54.160> unit

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
and we'll see how loud this unit

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:02.470 
and we'll see how loud this unit
actually<00:03:54.670> is

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.420 

and<00:04:02.900> it's<00:04:03.020> running<00:04:03.260> about<00:04:03.440> 80<00:04:03.800> DBS<00:04:05.740> slow<00:04:06.740> rated

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:16.940 

compared<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:10.700> MSM<00:04:11.660> unit<00:04:11.959> here

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.090 

just<00:04:17.950> about<00:04:18.100> 70<00:04:18.459> 60<00:04:18.880> bees<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:20.500> Emerson<00:04:20.920> is<00:04:21.070> a

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
just about 70 60 bees the Emerson is a

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.490 
just about 70 60 bees the Emerson is a
higher<00:04:21.549> pitch<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.510> seems<00:04:22.720> louder

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
higher pitch it seems louder

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.570 
higher pitch it seems louder
whereas<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.419> staples<00:04:25.419> unit<00:04:26.250> does<00:04:27.250> not<00:04:27.280> seem

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
whereas the staples unit does not seem

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:57.059 
whereas the staples unit does not seem
as<00:04:27.700> loud<00:04:29.790> there's<00:04:30.790> more<00:04:31.060> about<00:04:31.240> droning<00:04:31.660> noise

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.339 

and<00:04:58.069> this<00:04:58.310> is<00:04:58.520> I'm<00:04:59.000> gonna<00:04:59.150> put<00:04:59.449> ten<00:05:00.050> sheets<00:05:00.229> of

and this is I'm gonna put ten sheets of

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.219 
and this is I'm gonna put ten sheets of
paper<00:05:00.530> through<00:05:01.659> obviously<00:05:02.659> what<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.080> does

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
paper through obviously what it does

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:13.149 
paper through obviously what it does
here<00:05:11.169> it's<00:05:12.169> running<00:05:12.379> about<00:05:12.470> seventy<00:05:12.889> sixty

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
here it's running about seventy sixty

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:16.930 
here it's running about seventy sixty
bees<00:05:13.460> about<00:05:13.880> two<00:05:14.030> feet<00:05:14.180> away<00:05:15.550> and<00:05:16.550> I<00:05:16.669> ran<00:05:16.819> it

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
bees about two feet away and I ran it

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.540 
bees about two feet away and I ran it
through<00:05:16.970> without<00:05:17.180> any<00:05:17.539> problems<00:05:17.990> at<00:05:18.110> all

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
through without any problems at all

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.749 
through without any problems at all
so<00:05:19.550> this<00:05:20.030> is<00:05:20.210> the<00:05:20.479> staples<00:05:20.930> 16<00:05:21.830> cup<00:05:22.009> micro<00:05:22.490> cut

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
so this is the staples 16 cup micro cut

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.480 
so this is the staples 16 cup micro cut
