00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
each and every section you guys probably

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.200

are a little bit on my hands there so

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.340 
are a little bit on my hands there so
this<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.450> good<00:01:15.720> method<00:01:16.080> if<00:01:16.229> you

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
this is a really good method if you

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.920 
this is a really good method if you
really<00:01:16.710> don't<00:01:16.890> want<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.250> use<00:01:17.430> tools<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.240> it

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
really don't want to use tools and it

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.780 
really don't want to use tools and it
does<00:01:19.259> take<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> little<00:01:19.950> bit<00:01:20.159> more<00:01:20.400> time<00:01:20.759> but

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
does take a little bit more time but

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.420 
does take a little bit more time but
it's<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.479> lot<00:01:21.659> easier<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:22.409> far<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.860> some<00:01:23.159> big

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
it's a lot easier as far as some big

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.340 
it's a lot easier as far as some big

a<00:03:18.040> little<00:03:18.310> frustrating<00:03:18.970> but<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.630> do<00:03:19.930> when<00:03:20.110> i

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
a little frustrating but you do when i

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.040 
a little frustrating but you do when i
take<00:03:20.350> your<00:03:20.500> time<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:20.769> make<00:03:20.980> sure<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.489> you're

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
take your time and make sure that you're

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.509 
take your time and make sure that you're
babying<00:03:23.050> your<00:03:23.290> hair<00:03:23.500> with<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:23.890> so<00:03:24.160> now<00:03:24.340> we're

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
babying your hair with it so now we're

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.100 
babying your hair with it so now we're
going<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.730> move<00:03:24.880> on<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.030> step<00:03:25.330> three<00:03:25.750> of<00:03:25.989> the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
going to move on to step three of the

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.110 
going to move on to step three of the
tangling<00:03:26.620> method<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.489> is<00:03:27.670> with<00:03:27.940> a

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
tangling method and that is with a

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.300 
tangling method and that is with a
diamond<00:03:28.510> brush<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:29.410> just<00:03:29.650> repeat<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.100> same

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
diamond brush so just repeat the same

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.100 
diamond brush so just repeat the same
step<00:03:30.670> with<00:03:31.000> making<00:03:31.480> sure<00:03:31.510> your<00:03:31.840> hair<00:03:32.080> is

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
step with making sure your hair is

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.770 
step with making sure your hair is
saturated<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.100> also<00:03:33.519> going<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.820> use<00:03:34.180> some<00:03:34.510> oil

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
saturated and also going to use some oil

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.930 
saturated and also going to use some oil
for<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.530> just<00:03:36.310> going<00:03:36.550> to<00:03:36.640> run<00:03:36.820> that

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
for this and just going to run that

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.340 
for this and just going to run that
through<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.480> then<00:03:37.630> I'm<00:03:37.750> going<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.170> go<00:03:38.320> a

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
bl5 i chose this one because it gives me

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.490 
bl5 i chose this one because it gives me
a<00:03:53.890> lot<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.280> slip<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.360> now<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:55.840> guys<00:03:56.140> see<00:03:56.470> me

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
a lot of slip so now you guys see me

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.410 
a lot of slip so now you guys see me
just<00:03:56.830> using<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.370> diamond<00:03:57.760> brush<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.269> of

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
just using the diamond brush and of

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.970 
just using the diamond brush and of
course<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.900> want<00:03:59.049> to<00:03:59.110> do<00:03:59.230> smaller<00:03:59.530> sections

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
course you want to do smaller sections

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.800 
course you want to do smaller sections
because<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.459> teeth<00:04:00.700> on<00:04:00.970> this<00:04:01.209> brush<00:04:01.540> are<00:04:01.780> a

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
because the teeth on this brush are a

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.170 
because the teeth on this brush are a
little<00:04:02.290> more<00:04:02.560> compacted<00:04:03.160> together<00:04:03.489> which

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
little more compacted together which

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.479 
little more compacted together which
means<00:04:04.510> that<00:04:04.600> it<00:04:04.810> causes<00:04:05.019> more<00:04:05.530> room<00:04:05.980> for<00:04:06.400> you

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
means that it causes more room for you

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:07.740 
means that it causes more room for you
to<00:04:06.519> be

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
to be

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.360 
to be
Gary's<00:04:08.050> in<00:04:08.170> breakage<00:04:08.620> or<00:04:08.740> anything<00:04:09.130> so<00:04:09.310> you

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
Gary's in breakage or anything so you

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.400 
Gary's in breakage or anything so you
want<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.760> take<00:04:09.910> your<00:04:10.030> time<00:04:10.300> and<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:11.260> reason

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
want to take your time and the reason

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.020 
want to take your time and the reason
why<00:04:11.650> i<00:04:11.710> like<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.040> diamond<00:04:12.340> brush<00:04:12.520> is<00:04:12.700> because

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
why i like the diamond brush is because

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.760 
why i like the diamond brush is because
i<00:04:13.060> feel<00:04:13.390> like<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.690> basically<00:04:14.170> kills<00:04:14.530> two<00:04:14.740> birds

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
i feel like it basically kills two birds

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.610 
i feel like it basically kills two birds
with<00:04:15.100> one<00:04:15.160> stone<00:04:15.390> one<00:04:16.390> it<00:04:16.660> detangles<00:04:17.230> my<00:04:17.350> hair

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
with one stone one it detangles my hair

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.860 
with one stone one it detangles my hair
but<00:04:17.799> it<00:04:17.950> also<00:04:18.220> gives<00:04:18.489> my<00:04:18.940> hair<00:04:18.970> a<00:04:19.180> really<00:04:19.690> nice

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
but it also gives my hair a really nice

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.990 
but it also gives my hair a really nice
curl<00:04:20.260> as<00:04:20.470> well<00:04:20.799> so<00:04:21.040> that<00:04:21.220> helps<00:04:21.579> as<00:04:21.670> far<00:04:21.880> as

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
curl as well so that helps as far as

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.030 
curl as well so that helps as far as
once<00:04:22.240> i'm<00:04:22.420> finishing<00:04:22.900> with<00:04:23.080> washing<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:23.860> deep

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
once i'm finishing with washing and deep

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.010 
once i'm finishing with washing and deep
conditioning<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:24.760> all<00:04:24.910> of<00:04:25.030> that<00:04:25.060> my<00:04:25.750> hair<00:04:25.990> is

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
conditioning and all of that my hair is

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.930 
conditioning and all of that my hair is
both<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.350> tangle<00:04:26.860> but<00:04:27.040> it's<00:04:27.160> also<00:04:27.400> going<00:04:27.820> to

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
both the tangle but it's also going to

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.290 
both the tangle but it's also going to
be<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.510> guess<00:04:29.040> made<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.310> pop<00:04:30.550> what<00:04:30.820> I'm<00:04:30.910> doing<00:04:31.180> my

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
be I guess made to pop what I'm doing my

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.580 
be I guess made to pop what I'm doing my
twist<00:04:31.570> outs<00:04:31.780> because<00:04:31.960> of<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.410> curl

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
twist outs because of the curl

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.400 
twist outs because of the curl
definition<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.430> gives<00:04:33.610> me<00:04:33.930> so<00:04:34.930> now<00:04:35.230> I'm

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
definition that it gives me so now I'm

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.140 
definition that it gives me so now I'm
finished<00:04:35.800> with<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:36.040> process<00:04:36.460> as<00:04:36.640> far<00:04:36.910> as

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
finished with the process as far as

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.510 
finished with the process as far as
doing<00:04:37.840> three<00:04:38.500> different<00:04:38.890> ways<00:04:39.040> that<00:04:39.070> you<00:04:39.280> can

show you guys the results of the

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.240 
show you guys the results of the
tangling<00:04:43.270> once<00:04:43.540> I<00:04:43.720> take<00:04:43.930> out<00:04:44.080> all<00:04:44.230> my<00:04:44.260> hair<00:04:44.620> so

going to go towards the back where I did

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.380 
going to go towards the back where I did

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
guys still see I have some type of

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.070 
guys still see I have some type of
definition<00:04:57.640> but<00:04:57.850> of<00:04:58.120> course<00:04:58.390> my<00:04:58.450> hair<00:04:58.780> looks<00:04:58.960> a

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
definition but of course my hair looks a

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.450 
definition but of course my hair looks a
little<00:04:59.230> bit<00:04:59.440> stressed<00:04:59.680> because<00:04:59.950> I<00:05:00.130> went

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
little bit stressed because I went

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.120 
little bit stressed because I went
through<00:05:00.580> each<00:05:00.850> and<00:05:01.120> every<00:05:01.630> single<00:05:01.930> strand<00:05:02.500> so

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
through each and every single strand so

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.650 
through each and every single strand so
there<00:05:03.340> are<00:05:03.490> some<00:05:03.760> benefits<00:05:03.910> with<00:05:04.360> finger

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
there are some benefits with finger

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.150 
there are some benefits with finger
detangling<00:05:05.110> as<00:05:05.410> well<00:05:07.740> now<00:05:08.740> we're<00:05:08.980> going<00:05:09.100> to

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
detangling as well now we're going to

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.890 
detangling as well now we're going to
move<00:05:09.220> on<00:05:09.550> to<00:05:09.580> this<00:05:09.880> portion<00:05:10.419> and<00:05:10.570> I<00:05:10.690> use<00:05:10.870> a

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
move on to this portion and I use a

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.540 
move on to this portion and I use a
diamond<00:05:11.200> brush<00:05:11.530> hair<00:05:11.830> and<00:05:12.070> you<00:05:12.190> guys<00:05:12.370> are

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
diamond brush hair and you guys are

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.340 
diamond brush hair and you guys are
going<00:05:12.640> to<00:05:12.760> see<00:05:12.970> that<00:05:13.180> for<00:05:13.419> one<00:05:13.600> my<00:05:13.840> hair<00:05:14.140> is<00:05:14.320> a

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
going to see that for one my hair is a

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.469 
going to see that for one my hair is a
lot<00:05:14.680> curlier<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.400> I<00:05:15.460> did<00:05:15.700> experience<00:05:16.150> the

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
lot curlier and I did experience the

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.390 
lot curlier and I did experience the
most<00:05:16.690> shrinkage<00:05:17.200> with<00:05:17.410> using<00:05:17.800> this<00:05:17.950> method

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
most shrinkage with using this method

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.700 
most shrinkage with using this method
but<00:05:18.910> I<00:05:18.970> also<00:05:19.270> did<00:05:19.630> use<00:05:19.810> a<00:05:19.840> conditioner<00:05:20.140> so<00:05:20.650> you

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
but I also did use a conditioner so you

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.320 
but I also did use a conditioner so you
could<00:05:20.979> take<00:05:21.010> that<00:05:21.340> into<00:05:21.550> consideration<00:05:21.580> as

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
could take that into consideration as

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.570 
could take that into consideration as
well<00:05:22.360> but<00:05:22.810> it's<00:05:22.960> also<00:05:23.169> equally<00:05:23.740> tangled<00:05:24.430> and

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
well but it's also equally tangled and

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.240 
well but it's also equally tangled and
it<00:05:25.240> has<00:05:25.390> curl<00:05:25.690> definition<00:05:25.890> so<00:05:26.890> that's<00:05:27.130> the

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
it has curl definition so that's the

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.860 
it has curl definition so that's the
majority<00:05:27.400> of<00:05:27.790> what<00:05:28.000> my<00:05:28.120> hair<00:05:28.300> looks<00:05:28.510> like<00:05:28.600> with

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
majority of what my hair looks like with

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.750 
majority of what my hair looks like with
using<00:05:29.229> all<00:05:29.380> three<00:05:29.560> methods<00:05:29.830> of<00:05:30.220> course<00:05:30.490> you

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
using all three methods of course you

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.030 
using all three methods of course you
can<00:05:30.970> just<00:05:31.240> use<00:05:31.300> whatever<00:05:31.810> is<00:05:32.260> best<00:05:32.560> for<00:05:32.680> you

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
can just use whatever is best for you

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.950 
can just use whatever is best for you
and<00:05:33.280> just<00:05:33.850> tweak<00:05:34.180> it<00:05:34.330> and<00:05:34.419> see<00:05:34.600> how<00:05:34.630> it<00:05:34.840> works

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
and just tweak it and see how it works

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.900 
and just tweak it and see how it works
