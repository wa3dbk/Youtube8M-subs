and<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.239> blew<00:02:48.450> out<00:02:48.600> those<00:02:48.840> little<00:02:49.020> portholes

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and I blew out those little portholes

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.020 
and I blew out those little portholes
and<00:02:50.840> took<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.080> needle<00:02:52.410> valve<00:02:52.440> off<00:02:53.010> from<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
and took the needle valve off from the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.760 
and took the needle valve off from the
bottom<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.570> carburetor<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:57.560> blew<00:02:58.560> that

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
bottom of the carburetor and blew that

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.190 
bottom of the carburetor and blew that
out<00:03:02.239> so<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.270> think<00:03:03.450> I'm<00:03:03.600> going<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.780> put<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.050> back

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
out so I think I'm going to put it back

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.979 
out so I think I'm going to put it back
together<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.709> see<00:03:05.040> if<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.420> will<00:03:06.420> take<00:03:06.480> care<00:03:06.930> of

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
together and see if it will take care of

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.690 
together and see if it will take care of
her<00:03:08.570> well<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.600> have<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.080> apart<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.459> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
her well I have this apart this is the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.979 
her well I have this apart this is the
float<00:03:11.970> here<00:03:12.769> I'm<00:03:13.769> going<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.540> pull<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.690> pin

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
float here I'm going to pull this pin

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.060 
float here I'm going to pull this pin
out<00:03:16.170> pull<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.160> float<00:03:17.459> off<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.860> blow<00:03:19.860> out<00:03:20.040> the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
out pull the float off and blow out the

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.210 
out pull the float off and blow out the
little<00:03:23.070> needle<00:03:23.340> valve<00:03:23.580> under<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.209> float<00:03:24.480> and

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
little needle valve under the float and

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.410 
little needle valve under the float and
make<00:03:26.220> sure<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.610> that's<00:03:26.790> not<00:03:26.970> clogged

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
make sure that that's not clogged

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.289 
make sure that that's not clogged
because<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.230> gas<00:03:28.440> goes<00:03:29.190> through<00:03:29.489> there<00:03:29.700> and

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
because the gas goes through there and

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.560 
because the gas goes through there and
if<00:03:30.630> that's<00:03:30.810> clogged<00:03:31.670> that<00:03:32.670> can<00:03:32.970> prevent<00:03:33.390> it

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
if that's clogged that can prevent it

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.229 
if that's clogged that can prevent it
from<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:34.320> gas<00:03:34.560> from<00:03:34.830> flowing<00:03:35.519> through<00:03:36.120> the

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
from the gas from flowing through the

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.920 
from the gas from flowing through the
carburetor

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930

pin out and lifted the float out you can

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.290 
pin out and lifted the float out you can
see<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.640> needle<00:03:55.790> valve<00:03:56.150> there<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:58.150> I'm<00:03:59.150> going

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
see the needle valve there and I'm going

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.780 
see the needle valve there and I'm going
to<00:03:59.330> blow<00:03:59.540> out<00:03:59.690> that<00:04:00.190> hole<00:04:01.190> that<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.519> needle

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
to blow out that hole that the needle

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.479 
to blow out that hole that the needle
valve<00:04:01.819> goes<00:04:02.300> up<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:02.690> down<00:04:02.750> in<00:04:03.190> see<00:04:04.190> if<00:04:04.280> that's

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
valve goes up and down in see if that's

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.199 
valve goes up and down in see if that's
o'clock<00:04:05.349> okay<00:04:06.349> I<00:04:06.560> got<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:07.010> gasket<00:04:07.459> off<00:04:07.610> this

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
o'clock okay I got the gasket off this

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.199 
o'clock okay I got the gasket off this
where<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.540> needle<00:04:08.810> valve<00:04:09.050> goes<00:04:09.349> I<00:04:09.590> like<00:04:09.739> to

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
where the needle valve goes I like to

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:17.830 
where the needle valve goes I like to
spray<00:04:11.209> it<00:04:11.269> out<00:04:11.390> with<00:04:11.600> carburetor<00:04:12.080> cleaner

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.309 

and<00:04:18.109> all<00:04:18.919> the<00:04:19.100> little<00:04:19.250> portholes

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:24.319 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:29.659 

and<00:04:25.580> that<00:04:26.580> went<00:04:26.819> in<00:04:27.440> in<00:04:28.440> there<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.069> shot<00:04:29.639> out

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
and that went in in there and shot out

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.659 
and that went in in there and shot out
here<00:04:30.090> so<00:04:30.539> that<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:31.590> gas<00:04:31.830> runs<00:04:32.190> through<00:04:32.490> there

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
here so that the gas runs through there

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.200 
here so that the gas runs through there
and<00:04:32.910> comes<00:04:33.120> out<00:04:33.270> there<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:34.620> then<00:04:34.740> I<00:04:34.830> take<00:04:35.069> my

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
and comes out there and then I take my

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.950 
and comes out there and then I take my
compressed<00:04:36.210> air<00:04:36.560> blow<00:04:37.560> them<00:04:37.800> out<00:04:38.720> make<00:04:39.720> sure

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.020 

and<00:04:49.380> then<00:04:50.380> I'll<00:04:50.560> put<00:04:50.770> it<00:04:50.860> back<00:04:51.009> together

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.970
