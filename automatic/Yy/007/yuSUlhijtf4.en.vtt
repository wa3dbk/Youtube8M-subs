00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:18.920
 ok strange then the negative 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:25.400
 of the module 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:30.080
 the region after the negative of the ter 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.980
 been estranged is isolated using the back 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.309
 repeat 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:43.129
 insulating material or may also use 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:47.660
 Spaghetti the seam when strange is 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.900
 as if there were no leaks 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.900
 due 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:06.210
 most of the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:10.990
 people who turn on the sound in a car 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:15.690
 feeds the power module to the 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:19.930
 positive battery correct procedure 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:23.560
 wrong procedure or module negative 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.690
 people who were sound feed from the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.869
 tin of the car of any kind 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.040
 negative point of car procedure 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.490
 wrong 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.440
 do not forget the module negative 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.350
 also has to start from the negative of the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.580
 battery because the same importance as 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:49.860
 has the positive has the importance also 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.860
 of the battery negative 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:02.090
 see the negative of the battery itself
