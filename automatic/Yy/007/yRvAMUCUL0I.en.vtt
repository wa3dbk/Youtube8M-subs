00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
see they're obviously not the same car

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.179 
see they're obviously not the same car
because<00:01:33.630> one<00:01:33.840> has<00:01:34.020> seven<00:01:34.439> contracts<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
other one has two contracts so it is a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.710 
other one has two contracts so it is a
very<00:01:38.040> very<00:01:38.700> weird<00:01:40.040> glitch<00:01:41.090> however<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.329> can't

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
