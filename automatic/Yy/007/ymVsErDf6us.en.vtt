00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
time and separate those parts it's they

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.120 
time and separate those parts it's they
don't<00:03:02.329> really<00:03:02.450> line<00:03:02.720> up<00:03:02.750> right<00:03:03.470> /<00:03:03.859> yeah<00:03:04.010> yeah

this situation

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.100 
this situation
snare<00:04:36.980> but<00:04:37.880> you<00:04:38.360> know<00:04:38.450> those<00:04:38.780> are<00:04:38.960> ways<00:04:39.080> that

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
snare but you know those are ways that

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.440 
snare but you know those are ways that
you<00:04:39.290> can<00:04:39.560> modify<00:04:40.280> what<00:04:40.670> you<00:04:40.760> play<00:04:40.970> to<00:04:41.300> make

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
you can modify what you play to make

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.330 
you can modify what you play to make
sure<00:04:41.600> that<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:41.840> fits<00:04:42.440> where<00:04:42.740> you<00:04:42.860> have<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.220> play

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
sure that it fits where you have to play

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.790 
sure that it fits where you have to play
you<00:04:43.820> use<00:04:44.030> dibbles<00:04:44.540> and<00:04:44.780> thing<00:04:45.020> I<00:04:45.170> got<00:04:45.440> to<00:04:45.650> move

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
you use dibbles and thing I got to move

00:04:45.800 --> 00:05:09.410 
you use dibbles and thing I got to move
stuff<00:04:45.980> around<00:04:46.130> so<00:04:46.520> um<00:04:47.330> yeah<00:04:48.170> so<00:04:48.440> it'll<00:04:48.590> be

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.310 

that's<00:05:10.420> the<00:05:10.570> idea

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
that's the idea

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.470 
that's the idea
so<00:05:11.860> segments<00:05:12.370> okay<00:05:12.670> so<00:05:12.730> before<00:05:13.030> we<00:05:13.210> move

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
so segments okay so before we move

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.960 
so segments okay so before we move
forward<00:05:13.660> too<00:05:13.990> much<00:05:14.220> because<00:05:15.220> really<00:05:15.610> this

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
forward too much because really this

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.550 
forward too much because really this
idea<00:05:16.300> is<00:05:16.360> like<00:05:16.510> that<00:05:16.750> that's<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.200> whole<00:05:17.320> thing

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
idea is like that that's the whole thing

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.750 
idea is like that that's the whole thing
right<00:05:17.620> pretty<00:05:18.070> much<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:18.340> whole<00:05:18.430> thing<00:05:18.610> yeah

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
right pretty much the whole thing yeah

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.550 
right pretty much the whole thing yeah
let's<00:05:19.120> tighten<00:05:19.480> up<00:05:19.510> that<00:05:19.660> idea<00:05:19.840> over<00:05:20.140> there<00:05:20.290> so

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
let's tighten up that idea over there so

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.660 
let's tighten up that idea over there so
do<00:05:20.680> you<00:05:20.740> want<00:05:20.860> to<00:05:20.920> explain<00:05:21.220> what<00:05:21.550> you're

mind I know you're totally right this is
triplets<00:05:57.730> yeah<00:05:57.910> so<00:05:58.780> it's<00:05:58.930> just<00:05:58.960> triplet

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
triplets yeah so it's just triplet

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.480 
triplets yeah so it's just triplet
triplet<00:05:59.860> triplet<00:06:00.370> triplet<00:06:00.970> triplet<00:06:01.600> triplet

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
triplet triplet triplet triplet triplet

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.820 
triplet triplet triplet triplet triplet
triplet<00:06:03.490> which<00:06:04.150> would<00:06:04.330> be<00:06:04.720> I<00:06:05.050> guess<00:06:05.530> in<00:06:05.680> this

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
triplet which would be I guess in this

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.680 
triplet which would be I guess in this
temple<00:06:06.160> would<00:06:06.310> be<00:06:06.370> 16th<00:06:06.910> note<00:06:07.060> triplets<00:06:07.090> yeah

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
temple would be 16th note triplets yeah

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.320 
temple would be 16th note triplets yeah
yeah<00:06:07.870> so<00:06:08.500> I'm<00:06:08.620> just<00:06:08.650> thinking<00:06:08.920> the<00:06:09.850> whole<00:06:10.030> time

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
yeah so I'm just thinking the whole time

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.300 
yeah so I'm just thinking the whole time
in<00:06:10.450> my<00:06:10.540> mind<00:06:10.780> I'm<00:06:10.930> just<00:06:10.960> I<00:06:11.410> know<00:06:11.950> it's<00:06:12.100> coming

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
in my mind I'm just I know it's coming

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:22.850 
in my mind I'm just I know it's coming
so<00:06:13.000> I'm<00:06:13.210> thinking<00:06:13.570> like<00:06:18.690> it's<00:06:19.690> that<00:06:19.840> bass<00:06:20.110> drum

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.720 

that's<00:06:23.860> what<00:06:24.070> makes<00:06:24.250> it<00:06:24.400> really<00:06:24.520> tough

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
that's what makes it really tough
