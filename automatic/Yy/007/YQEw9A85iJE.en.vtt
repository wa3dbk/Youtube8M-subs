carbon fiber monocoque is really an

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.490 
carbon fiber monocoque is really an
amazing<00:01:34.430> invention<00:01:34.880> about<00:01:35.659> 30<00:01:35.899> years<00:01:36.110> ago<00:01:36.259> it

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
amazing invention about 30 years ago it

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.350 
amazing invention about 30 years ago it
still<00:01:36.710> used<00:01:36.920> to<00:01:37.040> be<00:01:37.159> aluminium<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:37.970> that<00:01:38.210> was

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
still used to be aluminium and that was

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.910 
still used to be aluminium and that was
really<00:01:38.659> very<00:01:38.869> very<00:01:39.049> dangerous<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:39.770> nowadays

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
really very very dangerous and nowadays

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.370 
really very very dangerous and nowadays
the<00:01:40.640> monocoque<00:01:41.030> is<00:01:41.060> really<00:01:41.420> my<00:01:41.960> little<00:01:42.200> safety

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
the monocoque is really my little safety

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.830 
the monocoque is really my little safety
cell<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:42.950> know<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:43.220> it<00:01:43.310> really<00:01:43.720> helps<00:01:44.720> a<00:01:44.810> lot

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
cell you know and it really helps a lot

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.830 
cell you know and it really helps a lot
to<00:01:45.140> prevent<00:01:45.320> injuries<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:47.390> great<00:01:47.570> thing

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
to prevent injuries the great thing

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.690 
to prevent injuries the great thing
about<00:01:47.869> from<00:01:48.229> one<00:01:48.409> today<00:01:48.649> is<00:01:48.829> that<00:01:49.009> technology

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
about from one today is that technology

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.910 
about from one today is that technology
is<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:49.909> advanced<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.689> safety<00:01:51.020> has<00:01:51.710> been

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
is so advanced and the safety has been

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.740 
is so advanced and the safety has been
worked<00:01:52.159> on<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:52.549> much<00:01:52.670> that<00:01:52.729> we<00:01:53.299> can<00:01:53.450> get<00:01:53.570> in<00:01:53.659> the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
worked on so much that we can get in the

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.209 
worked on so much that we can get in the
cars<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.079> feel<00:01:54.320> completely<00:01:54.439> safe<00:01:54.890> there's

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
cars and feel completely safe there's

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.130 
cars and feel completely safe there's
