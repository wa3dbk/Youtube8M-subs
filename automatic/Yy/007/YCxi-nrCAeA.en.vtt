00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
the perfect transparency but I think

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.150 
the perfect transparency but I think
they<00:05:34.790> will<00:05:34.940> fix<00:05:35.150> it<00:05:35.360> soon<00:05:35.390> it<00:05:36.320> is<00:05:36.770> not<00:05:36.950> a<00:05:36.980> big

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
they will fix it soon it is not a big

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.900 
they will fix it soon it is not a big

from<00:05:57.980> I<00:05:58.340> think<00:05:58.610> from<00:05:58.850> san<00:05:59.090> OU<00:05:59.120> gen<00:05:59.360> mod<00:05:59.600> 7<00:06:00.140> we

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
from I think from san OU gen mod 7 we

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.690 
from I think from san OU gen mod 7 we
had<00:06:00.920> this<00:06:01.100> problem<00:06:02.290> and<00:06:03.290> way<00:06:03.800> to<00:06:03.860> solve<00:06:04.190> it<00:06:04.370> was

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
had this problem and way to solve it was

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.820 
had this problem and way to solve it was
using<00:06:05.240> voodoo<00:06:05.570> louder<00:06:05.930> this<00:06:06.410> little

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
using voodoo louder this little

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.120 
using voodoo louder this little
application<00:06:07.370> that<00:06:07.790> costs<00:06:08.690> one<00:06:08.960> dollar<00:06:09.200> and<00:06:09.590> i

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
application that costs one dollar and i

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.920 
application that costs one dollar and i
will<00:06:10.310> like<00:06:10.550> it<00:06:10.790> because<00:06:11.090> it<00:06:11.900> works<00:06:12.230> and<00:06:12.530> i

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
will like it because it works and i
