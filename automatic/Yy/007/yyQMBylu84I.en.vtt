00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
brain electronics are good but we'll

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.560 
brain electronics are good but we'll
find<00:00:25.740> out<00:00:25.949> all<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.760> know<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.090> incredibly

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
find out all I know is it's incredibly

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.150 
find out all I know is it's incredibly
light<00:00:27.840> like<00:00:28.170> you'd<00:00:28.410> almost<00:00:28.529> lift<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.920> with<00:00:29.039> one

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
light like you'd almost lift it with one

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.089 
light like you'd almost lift it with one
finger<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.849> compared<00:00:30.300> with<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.480> sharp<00:00:31.470> tv<00:00:31.830> of

finger and compared with a sharp tv of
the<00:00:32.189> same<00:00:32.369> size<00:00:32.700> or<00:00:32.969> sorry<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.239> sanyo<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.750> the

the same size or sorry to sanyo of the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
same size which is much heavier so it's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.010 
same size which is much heavier so it's
incredibly<00:00:37.860> light<00:00:38.180> that's<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.360> model<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.840> a

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
incredibly light that's the model it's a

GE six six zero six it does flash and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.500 
GE six six zero six it does flash and
try<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.219> power<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> think<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.120> busted

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
try and power up but I think the busted

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.319 
try and power up but I think the busted
CCFL<00:00:46.260> tubes<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> back<00:00:47.039> light<00:00:47.309> forcing<00:00:48.239> the

CCFL tubes in the back light forcing the
inverter<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.809> shut<00:00:49.020> down<00:00:49.309> someone's<00:00:50.309> give<00:00:50.460> her

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
inverter to shut down someone's give her

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.189 
inverter to shut down someone's give her
an<00:00:50.610> affair<00:00:50.940> whack<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.629> something<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
an affair whack with something and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.650 
an affair whack with something and
completely<00:00:52.829> destroyed<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.250> panel<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.910> believe

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
completely destroyed the panel I believe

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.600 
completely destroyed the panel I believe
it<00:00:54.750> was<00:00:54.870> High<00:00:54.989> Definition<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.800> maybe<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.370> fake

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
it was High Definition or maybe a fake

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.760 
it was High Definition or maybe a fake
HD<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:58.079> does<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.829> HDMI<00:00:59.010> inputs<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.770> it

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
HD it does have HDMI inputs on it so it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.479 
HD it does have HDMI inputs on it so it
could<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> fake<00:01:02.510> HDTV<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:04.199> yeah

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
could be a fake HDTV but yeah

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.910 
could be a fake HDTV but yeah
cheap<00:01:06.000> cheap<00:01:06.030> probably<00:01:06.689> no<00:01:07.049> more<00:01:07.080> than<00:01:07.320> 150

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
cheap cheap probably no more than 150

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.580 
cheap cheap probably no more than 150
bucks<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:09.420> already<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.869> power<00:01:10.229> supply

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
bucks I can already see the power supply

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.039 
bucks I can already see the power supply
looks<00:01:10.860> almost<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.220> same<00:01:11.310> as<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.049> Toyota

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
looks almost the same as the Toyota

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.130 
looks almost the same as the Toyota
branded<00:01:13.470> ones<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.600> toasted<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.750> trashed

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
branded ones that I toasted and trashed

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.289 
branded ones that I toasted and trashed
last<00:01:16.439> time<00:01:16.770> they<00:01:17.159> already<00:01:17.369> had<00:01:17.610> break<00:01:17.850> broken

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
last time they already had break broken

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.780 
last time they already had break broken
panels<00:01:18.630> -<00:01:18.900> they<00:01:19.590> were<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.740> standard<00:01:20.250> def<00:01:20.490> will

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
panels - they were a standard def will

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.609 
panels - they were a standard def will
definitely<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> standard<00:01:21.630> def<00:01:21.780> panel<00:01:22.290> compared

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
definitely a standard def panel compared

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.850 
definitely a standard def panel compared
with<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:24.020> it<00:01:25.020> wouldn't<00:01:25.290> surprise<00:01:25.470> me<00:01:25.619> in

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
with this one it wouldn't surprise me in

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.810 
with this one it wouldn't surprise me in
the<00:01:25.890> least<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.250> they<00:01:26.369> all<00:01:26.520> use<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.790> same

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the least if they all use the same

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.969 
the least if they all use the same
internals<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.840> let's<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.560> back<00:01:28.740> cover

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
internals so let's get this back cover

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.710 
internals so let's get this back cover
off<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> quick<00:01:29.579> look<00:01:29.640> I'm<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.570> going

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
off and have a quick look I'm not going

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.510 
off and have a quick look I'm not going
to<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:30.900> into<00:01:31.020> too<00:01:31.200> much<00:01:31.229> depth<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.770> might<00:01:31.920> pop

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
to go into too much depth I might pop

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.190 
to go into too much depth I might pop
the<00:01:32.670> back<00:01:32.820> off<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> panel<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:33.600> something<00:01:33.630> but

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the back off the panel or something but

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.990 
the back off the panel or something but
more<00:01:34.439> than<00:01:34.560> likely<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:35.100> you've<00:01:35.670> all<00:01:35.820> seen

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
more than likely not you've all seen

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.539 
more than likely not you've all seen
inside<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.509> LCD<00:01:36.930> panel<00:01:36.960> now<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.520> want

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
inside the LCD panel now so if you want

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.580 
inside the LCD panel now so if you want
to<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.509> haven't<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.020> want<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> look<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.470> it

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
to if you haven't you want to look at it

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.080 
to if you haven't you want to look at it
go<00:01:40.710> back<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.009> some<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.369> my<00:01:41.400> other<00:01:41.490> else<00:01:41.880> say

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
go back to some of my other else say
