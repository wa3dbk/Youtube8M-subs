00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:02.550
 fan sector differs from others in that 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.689
 here people set themselves their task 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.870
 team support sometimes to the detriment 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.469

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.290
 last year's championship of ruby 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.920

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.060
 home match attendance 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.660
 quantitative problem 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.440
 plan to stay away but 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.440
 there was an organizational 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.829
 in a new field 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:29.869
 authorities 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.070
 for this active fan groups were 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.059
 spelled out a set of rules of conduct for the fan 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.530
 sector which can be found 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.760
 it is the newly opened site of robin hood s.rut 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.230
 read a brochure which will 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.280
 spread on the fan sector as well 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.769
 our programs met with 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:44.920
 initiative group 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.600
 Robert Ultras all to read more 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.620
 learn about these rules no 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.660
 discussions of the rules sold roshal 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.200
 if they all come from moral 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.180
 of principles 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.110
 and they intersect to some extent 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.040
 even with safety 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.680
 redirect to new baby heart 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.040
 in green 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.060
 is this blasphemy whether it is more likely 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.790
 you need to come to football 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.810
 however, more red and green colors 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.780
 ships 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 colorful 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.950
 Tell me please 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.680
 here it is necessary to carry a caring attitude to 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.670
 fame and other club paraphernalia 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.880
 Why trample into the dirt what is 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.070
 important to rule number two themselves 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.650
 coming to the sector before the match starts in 30 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.630
 minutes when we prepare sats 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.460
 we pre-store light at all that is 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.479
 Kiev when I signed the start of the match 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.880
 passes the second round come out very much and 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.170
 Immediately explained related what you need 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.920
 to make 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.350
 impossible stock very often from this 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.220
 got wrong if people 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.070
 this task can be released in advance 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.720
 explain stated what to show 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.180
 This also implies the third rule. 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.710
 what they say guys from 50 tee me a cult 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.750
 defeat n in the future it is planned that they 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.300
 will pay four jerseys 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.200
 club colors and not notice them will 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.010
 impossible also need to pay 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.140
 attention typing the bank it is he who sets 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.460
 peculiar so sector and charging 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.450
 expresses the mood of the people who came 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.050
 cheer for your favorite team dawn then 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.269
 there is 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.549
 only a man who knows what 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.479
 then they can start a sector 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:20.929
 listen to 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:22.469
 campaign against israel 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:23.769
 in no case 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.670
 he tried to take his sector 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.670
 rule number 4 forget the product 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.789
 really hinders 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:33.559
 normal support choir singing 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:35.709
 they all basically drown out there 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.519
 all charge 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.949
 melt Korean ban 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:40.619

 the seats 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.809
 but rocky iron criteria by 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:50.049
 which can stumble and 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.040
 get injured 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.520
 in order to prevent this from happening 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.680
 it is safer to stand on the concrete floor sector 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.959
 there have been cases at the home match 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.329
 when people hint on ice 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.259
 Sechin injured investigators 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:05.529
 work out the south fan tribune consists 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.029
 of three sectors and people are mostly 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:09.409
 trying to fill the central where on 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.069
 one seat for two people 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.449
 so you should boldly go to the side 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.959
 sectors 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.920

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.259
 commands is it possible to draw up a contract with 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.920
 growing point 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.569
 occupancy and attendance 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.290
 which directly depends on the activity 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.890
 fans can also offer an idea 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.239
 passion for the match and if it turns out to be better and 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.810
 it will surely be brought to life 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.870
 the word forum is the field where you can advise 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.010
 plan and help of course help 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.739
 never superfluous

 interest 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.019
 national holiday if anyone 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.149
 Ie such opportunity 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:50.639
 then draw everything in small 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.479
 wards need people who understand 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.079
 saw wiring programs owning 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.729
 Photoshop needs healthy criticism 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.159
 proceeding shares a small set of rules 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.819
 remembering is not so difficult just by common 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.269
