00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:07.139 

the<00:00:01.300> watercycle<00:00:04.799> hang<00:00:05.799> their<00:00:06.069> kids<00:00:06.400> I<00:00:06.670> am

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:07.149 
the watercycle hang their kids I am

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.660 
the watercycle hang their kids I am
winning<00:00:07.450> the<00:00:07.839> water<00:00:08.109> drop<00:00:08.530> and<00:00:08.800> today<00:00:09.460> I'm

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
winning the water drop and today I'm

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.400 
winning the water drop and today I'm
going<00:00:09.880> to<00:00:09.969> show<00:00:10.210> you<00:00:10.269> a<00:00:10.389> process<00:00:10.900> I<00:00:11.050> go<00:00:11.380> through

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
going to show you a process I go through

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.749 
going to show you a process I go through
every<00:00:12.070> day<00:00:12.280> it's<00:00:12.969> called<00:00:13.210> the<00:00:13.360> water<00:00:13.660> cycle<00:00:14.049> I

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
every day it's called the water cycle I

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.260 
every day it's called the water cycle I
first<00:00:15.759> start<00:00:16.449> in<00:00:16.570> rivers<00:00:16.960> lakes<00:00:17.619> oceans<00:00:18.029> or<00:00:19.029> on

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
first start in rivers lakes oceans or on

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.929 
first start in rivers lakes oceans or on
the<00:00:19.390> ground<00:00:19.660> so<00:00:20.619> I<00:00:20.680> am<00:00:20.890> in<00:00:21.010> a<00:00:21.100> liquid<00:00:21.550> state<00:00:21.670> of

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
the ground so I am in a liquid state of

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.290 
the ground so I am in a liquid state of
matter<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:24.039> first<00:00:24.369> stage

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
matter the first stage

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.040 
matter the first stage
then<00:00:26.990> as<00:00:27.260> I<00:00:27.800> get<00:00:28.070> really<00:00:28.700> hot<00:00:29.090> from<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.540> Sun<00:00:29.750> I

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
then as I get really hot from the Sun I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.480 
then as I get really hot from the Sun I
go<00:00:30.470> through<00:00:30.680> the<00:00:30.770> first<00:00:31.010> stage<00:00:31.250> which<00:00:31.430> is

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
go through the first stage which is

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.850 
go through the first stage which is
called<00:00:31.610> evaporation<00:00:32.390> which<00:00:33.350> is<00:00:33.530> when<00:00:33.710> I<00:00:33.740> turn

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
called evaporation which is when I turn

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.950 
called evaporation which is when I turn
from<00:00:34.280> a<00:00:34.400> liquid<00:00:34.700> state<00:00:34.730> of<00:00:35.060> matter<00:00:35.240> to<00:00:35.720> a<00:00:35.750> gas

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
from a liquid state of matter to a gas

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.340 
from a liquid state of matter to a gas
they<00:00:36.260> in<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.410> matter<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:36.830> I<00:00:37.340> go<00:00:37.550> up<00:00:37.790> up<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:38.960> up

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
they in the matter and I go up up and up

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.299 
they in the matter and I go up up and up
in<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.860> stack

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
in the stack

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.490 
in the stack
the<00:00:42.309> next<00:00:42.820> stage<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:45.370> as<00:00:45.730> I<00:00:46.270> go<00:00:46.540> up<00:00:46.900> through

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
the next stage then as I go up through

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.090 
the next stage then as I go up through
the<00:00:47.620> air

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
the air

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.750 
the air
I<00:00:48.129> get<00:00:48.640> really<00:00:49.120> cool<00:00:50.020> and<00:00:50.440> I<00:00:50.739> go<00:00:50.920> through<00:00:51.220> next

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
I get really cool and I go through next

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.510 
I get really cool and I go through next
stage<00:00:51.940> which<00:00:52.360> is<00:00:52.390> called<00:00:52.600> condensation<00:00:53.520> which

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
stage which is called condensation which

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.549 
stage which is called condensation which
is<00:00:54.699> when<00:00:54.850> I<00:00:54.879> turn<00:00:55.150> back<00:00:55.180> to<00:00:55.690> a<00:00:55.720> liquid<00:00:56.020> state<00:00:56.199> of

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
is when I turn back to a liquid state of

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.740 
is when I turn back to a liquid state of
matter<00:00:56.710> from<00:00:57.430> a<00:00:57.580> gas<00:00:57.760> state<00:00:58.089> of<00:00:58.210> matter<00:00:58.420> you

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
matter from a gas state of matter you

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.439 
matter from a gas state of matter you
will<00:00:59.379> see<00:00:59.589> me<00:00:59.769> in<00:00:59.800> this<00:01:00.010> guy<00:01:00.280> as<00:01:00.580> a<00:01:00.760> form<00:01:01.210> of<00:01:01.360> a

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
will see me in this guy as a form of a

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.460 
will see me in this guy as a form of a
cloud<00:01:01.600> just<00:01:02.320> like<00:01:02.559> I<00:01:02.739> am<00:01:02.920> right<00:01:03.129> now<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:05.229> next

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
cloud just like I am right now the next

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.290 
cloud just like I am right now the next
stage<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:08.320> when<00:01:09.009> the<00:01:09.100> air<00:01:09.250> can<00:01:09.610> I<00:01:09.729> hold<00:01:10.090> me

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
stage then when the air can I hold me

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.899 
stage then when the air can I hold me
anymore<00:01:10.930> I<00:01:11.409> go<00:01:11.950> through<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.310> next<00:01:12.340> stage

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
anymore I go through the next stage

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.540 
anymore I go through the next stage
which<00:01:13.119> is<00:01:13.150> called<00:01:13.330> precipitation<00:01:14.399> which<00:01:15.399> is

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
which is called precipitation which is

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.700 
which is called precipitation which is
when<00:01:15.789> I<00:01:15.820> fall<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.479> ground<00:01:16.509> has<00:01:17.320> either<00:01:17.530> a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
when I fall to the ground has either a

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.400 
when I fall to the ground has either a
liquid<00:01:18.009> state<00:01:18.430> of<00:01:18.550> matter<00:01:18.759> such<00:01:19.210> as<00:01:19.240> rain<00:01:19.690> or<00:01:19.990> a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
liquid state of matter such as rain or a

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.279 
liquid state of matter such as rain or a
solid<00:01:21.009> state<00:01:21.250> of<00:01:21.399> matter<00:01:21.610> such<00:01:22.149> as<00:01:22.210> hail<00:01:22.690> or

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
solid state of matter such as hail or

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:30.150 
solid state of matter such as hail or
snow<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:26.229> last<00:01:26.560> stage<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.560> last<00:01:29.860> in

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
snow the last stage and the last in

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.790 
snow the last stage and the last in
final<00:01:30.580> stage<00:01:30.850> I<00:01:31.090> go<00:01:31.300> through<00:01:32.050> it's<00:01:32.350> called

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
final stage I go through it's called

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.520 
final stage I go through it's called
collection<00:01:33.490> which<00:01:34.179> is<00:01:34.360> when<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.660> go<00:01:34.960> back<00:01:35.259> to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
collection which is when I go back to

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.060 
collection which is when I go back to
where<00:01:35.800> I<00:01:35.830> started<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.360> ground<00:01:37.720> or<00:01:38.170> in<00:01:38.860> the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
where I started on the ground or in the

where I started on the ground or in the
ocean<00:01:39.340> or<00:01:39.880> rivers<00:01:40.539> I<00:01:40.929> can<00:01:41.740> either<00:01:41.920> stay<00:01:42.399> on<00:01:42.610> the
