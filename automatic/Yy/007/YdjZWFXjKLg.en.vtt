a<00:02:14.960> completely<00:02:15.379> different<00:02:15.680> order<00:02:16.159> at<00:02:16.220> that

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
a completely different order at that

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.100 
a completely different order at that
time<00:02:16.610> around<00:02:16.879> this<00:02:17.180> time<00:02:17.420> I'm<00:02:17.540> trying<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:17.989> do

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
time around this time I'm trying to do

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.670 
time around this time I'm trying to do
it<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.290> little<00:02:18.680> bit<00:02:18.980> more<00:02:19.190> in<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.489> logical<00:02:19.970> way

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
it a little bit more in a logical way

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.619

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:45.819 
tree the iOS version of GTA 3 there is

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.179 
tree the iOS version of GTA 3 there is
an<00:06:46.149> in-game<00:06:46.569> map<00:06:46.839> on<00:06:47.050> that<00:06:47.259> version<00:06:47.560> but<00:06:48.009> it

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:48.189 
an in-game map on that version but it

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:49.980 
an in-game map on that version but it
isn't<00:06:48.520> on<00:06:48.699> well<00:06:49.089> pretty<00:06:49.360> much<00:06:49.509> all<00:06:49.779> the<00:06:49.960> other

buildings<00:07:36.930> in<00:07:37.110> the<00:07:37.229> older<00:07:37.500> games<00:07:37.710> anyway<00:07:38.099> in

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.580 
buildings in the older games anyway in

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.610 
buildings in the older games anyway in
the<00:07:38.669> newer<00:07:38.819> games<00:07:39.060> you<00:07:39.330> pretty<00:07:39.750> much<00:07:39.870> die<00:07:40.199> when

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 
the newer games you pretty much die when

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.430 
the newer games you pretty much die when
you<00:07:41.030> jump<00:07:42.030> off<00:07:42.210> a<00:07:42.240> high<00:07:42.389> building<00:07:42.569> because<00:07:43.289> you

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 
you jump off a high building because you

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.110 
you jump off a high building because you
know<00:07:43.530> that's<00:07:43.740> way<00:07:43.949> more<00:07:44.220> realistic<00:07:44.610> but<00:07:45.030> in

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 
know that's way more realistic but in

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.580 
know that's way more realistic but in
the<00:07:45.210> older<00:07:45.479> games<00:07:45.660> that<00:07:45.960> really<00:07:46.229> doesn't

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:46.590 
the older games that really doesn't

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.920
