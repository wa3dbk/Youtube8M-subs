00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.599
 hi chachi, how are you, let's see 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.230
 this righi exercise had been a long time 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.900
 we did not play anything from jamaica and we're going to 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.629
 see this exercise tanchachÃ­n because 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:42.980
 we combine two little things on one side the 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:46.629
 strum this typical righi and on the other 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.629
 side line is below 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:56.450
 and 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:03.020
 very good on the one hand we have the ray 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:05.720
 if in a compass we have 1 2 3 4 1 and 2 and 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.650
 3 and 4 then we have to match 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:14.180
 the righi strum with the mishap is 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:23.060
 say up is worth with him and 1 and 2 and 3 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:26.840
 and 4 and 1 2 and 3 and 4 and 1 2 and 4 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.710
 very well I'm touching it on a 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.710
 C minor 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.610
 what is the minor chord 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.530
 and we play it partially we take advantage 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.670
 only the third string and the second 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.840
 rope is worth fret 5 and fret when 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.840
 we put with these two fingers 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.270
 because finger 1 and little finger we 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.070
 will serve to make the counterpoint the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.700
 line below is to say this 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:00.180
 we add the bass line and I think that 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.460
 it's much better if I explain everything 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.570
 together is worth the entire score or all the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.090
 ironing board hard so let there 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.090
 a zoom here the strings below 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.540
 rin played on radio with two fingers 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:22.880
 with your finger one and two we make like one 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:25.480
 Impingement species worth 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.550
 and now we are going to the middle of the matter 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.500
 we do this 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.370
 i 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.350
 Y 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.200
 to 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.150
 do not 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.050
 Y 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.000
 you 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.310
 Y 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.900
 do not 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.980
 OK 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.270
 slowly 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.080
 low 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.080
 strum 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.080
 fret three behind six rasgueo 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.700
 it's not under the 3 fifth fret 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.700
 strum rope 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:18.870
 now it's not under fret 3 above 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.870
 6 fifth string twice and strum 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.750
 we go back to the beginning 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.750
 the 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.769
 i 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.760
 and we stayed a little bit like that all 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:52.569
 and very very slowly 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.930
 look and also look at my hand 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.930
 right 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.770
 with a 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.310
 and 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.310
 ah 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.490
 and 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.880
 one 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.100
 as you see from my right hand of one and of 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.850
 two stay there nailed do not leave 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.160
 the second and third rope and the only 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.960
 that with the thumb you are playing between the 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.960
 fifth and the sixth rope for the line 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.350
 from under nothing else come again very 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.350
 slowly 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.880
 Y 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.110
 Y 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.280
 Y 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.949
 Y 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.949
 one 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:50.309
 and 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.050
 ah 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.590
 Y 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.590
 Y 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.379
 no more a detail of your hand 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.490
 right the bottom line what do you do 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:15.060
 with the thumb 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.520
 You could muhtar a little bit with your palm 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.229
 right and get that sound more 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.229
 off so it does not sound like that 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.200
 it sounds more mottled 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.419
 and 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.849
 much more soil and much more king and 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.819
