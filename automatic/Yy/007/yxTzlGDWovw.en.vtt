00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:07.370
 very good morning definitely one of 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.440
 The most beautiful things about women is their 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.660
 body so is the best way to 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.000
 show them using transparencies 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.060
 because we are neither subtle fashion 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.470
 loving without falling into the vulgar for that 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.869
 Today we are going to show you all the 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.189
 options in transparency marco Ã¡lvarez 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.329
 will tell us a little about the 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.159
 transparencies 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.169
 that's more basic and I want you to tell me 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.429
 If you are fashionable transparencies 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.539
 yes, since less are now 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.090
 Fashionable transparencies makes more 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.710
 of two years and let's say that fashion is going to 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.179
 depend on the style of the person of 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.320
 how you want to dress how you want to look 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:37.910
 I have also heard that 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.370
 transparencies sometimes if they are by 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.379
 in front there are no transparencies behind 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.480
 the back of the body and if it is at 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.280
 there is upside down or backwards passes is equal 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.230
 true because if you put a lot 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.899
 transparency in a garment turns to 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.070
 look vulgar the garment then that's why 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.079
 It is normally used in the part of 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.359
 front or in the back and if the 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.730
 person is a little past weights of 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.890
 new rubbers and I can not use the 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.019
 which crop top you use then you can use 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.869
 blouses with transparencies that are long 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.800
 that are used a little loose in this case 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.530
 it would be the siphon 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.780
 the very specific for that and these lights 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.850
 allow to hide those rubbers that 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.090
 sanity that person has if the 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.030
 The shirt is completely transparent 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.550
 piece below the bra what color should 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.680
 there can be a clear contrast 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.660
 You can combine colors if you want 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.550
 because that is very valid and it is in the 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.960
 Fashion trends can even be 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.090
 Contrast colors that do not combine 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.360
 as you can also put a piece 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.730
 under the blouse that corresponds to the 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.710
 color of the music we're going to not all 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.750
 fabrics are transparent as we see in 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.460
 this case but there is also lace 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.870
 those are also considered 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.400
 transparencies within what is the 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.820
 fashion transparencies transparency 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.130
 we have lace we have the chiffon that are 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.930
 totally transparent fabrics and also 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.700
 we have tights that are these as you see 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.710
 is showing here many marks 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.690
 thanks for all the support you gave us 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.520
 and I think that women already there 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.950
 at home they have more ideas of how 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.510
 use the transparencies true well 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.310
 it is I hope that it has served you in the 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.410
 options that dance 'we gave and the pits 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.410
 well let's go immediately to the study
