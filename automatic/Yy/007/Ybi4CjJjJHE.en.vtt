00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.290
 Welcome to our 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.330
 instructions from our farm source 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.110
 smart first, here you see the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.610
 Components the upper tank of the glass 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:18.420
 tank the socket the profit the ring the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.350
 faucet the mineral stones the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.730
 cartouche and the ceramics disposal 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.500
 First, we take the glass tank 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.030
 put him on the pedestal we have 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.090
 here the model chosen with the flower 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.570
 of life on the floor 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.129
 In addition the glass can on the base then 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.780
 the part comes in sight of the faucet 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.420
 Screw in the faucet with 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.409
 Two seals delivered a seal 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.649
 comes right to the faucet nice 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:49.260
 firmly put on the edge that it is beautiful 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.350
 seals through the hole in the glass 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.859
 stuck and the second seal of 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.639
 put them on the faucet for 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:02.089
 the close to the glass then comes the 

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:02.089
 screw 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.490
 please screw on so tightly that the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.260
 Easily displace seals 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:13.420
 then the water hand is so tight 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.000
 Small tip on the edge if you have this 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.650
 pushing the push lever forward is running 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.520
 water without break if you have a pot 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.740
 like to fill 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.930
 and if you fill then normal glass 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.470
 simply with the glass against the hanger 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.310
 press and water comes out so then 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.259
 Let's put the stones in the glass of the stones 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.990
 salt water in a himalaya salt to 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:38.280
 For example, do not boil it down 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.979
 live otherwise the glass could break 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.649
 then the cartridge comes into the profit 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.180
 the ring the cartridge is through before 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.280
 showered we work with one 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.590
 shaken coal no glued coal 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.390
 therefore, can be safe through the transport 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.460
 a bit of coal dust solve what 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.460
 with the shower by removing 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.540
 the cartouche comes with the cartridges 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.180
 hang up on glass buy put loose 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.890
 here is no seal no rubber ring 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.709
 you also need to see the holes 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.569
 inner thread ring so that here in the air 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.160
 glass could enter so would one 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.630
 make vacuum and it would not be 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.000
 water coming out of the faucet 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.750
 then comes as the next component of the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.670
 upper part 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.620
 here is the ceramic aprons 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.810
 screwed to the ceramic advance by 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.549
 the hole 7 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:35.010
 Then a seal comes on the wings 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.690
 mother and here already fixed 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.989
 draw with it an unfiltered water 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:46.530
 Then it can drip on the cartridge 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:49.530
 Upper tank towers the tank sits 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.470
 also loose on the glass with it too 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.519
 Here is how it can get into the glass 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.569
 the lid on it now he is caracalla 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.790
