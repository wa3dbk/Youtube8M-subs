 above all very happy because it starts is 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.790
 something that has to do with theater 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.160
 musical 'high is not an experience 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.080

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.660
 of the is one is an experience 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.890

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.649
 mine is from I'm the nephew of 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.450
 sports medicine also in the classic 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.930
 of musical theater that should not be 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.910
 simple suddenly to be included to the rhythm 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.829
 of the work of adults are like 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.219
 been for you the preparation as the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.340
 truth is that it is something the truth is not 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:57.050
 this is difficult but I have some shots 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:00.980
 it is actually very true father 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.460
 because they worked with months of actors and 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.460

 very nice

 It is a great success and also as I say 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.950
 has a discipline because the theater 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.080
 musical good requires the effort of 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.070
 to be singing to be acting and also 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.170
