00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.030
 is it a mess in your room or are you just right? 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.060
 everything looks at you to get through a ring he finds it 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.570
 It is important that things are properly arranged, so to speak, here 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.180
 CDs by alphabet if you are interested in the profession of mechanic tester 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.339
 mechatronics 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.749
 then it certainly won't hurt if you are pretty tidy 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:23.649
 the day begins for you with consultation with colleagues and managers about the 

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.239
 work of that day 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.399
 has compiled the machines that lead possibly together with colleagues 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.779
 must then be tested by you 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.079
 after that they have to get the approval to be put into use 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.900
 and that is not nothing from a colleague you get further explanation 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.960
 you ensure that you have the necessary tools and materials at hand 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.420
 have 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.710
 and starts installing a test program 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.850
 this allows the lathe to be tested both by telephone and mechanically 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.700
 the fitter tests assemble three accessory tools and they also close 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.380
 where necessary 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.390
 he makes use of special test equipment or measuring tools 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.300
 computer simulation 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.600
 he must become it in addition, the rule align and adjust 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.600
 and the results must be reported 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.910
 the bully usually takes place within the company 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.320
 It is clear that you must be able to speak, read and write Dutch properly 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.820
 and a reasonable knowledge of English and German can also be good in this book 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.780
 come 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.590
 when testing prototypes or are machines that meet very high accuracy 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.390
 season 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.640
 assisted programmer is the control technology or the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.920
 Project Manager 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.289
 you are also responsible for the quality of your own work 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.999
 and the result of the work of the engineers on the device 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.160
 built 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.490
 moreover, you must also ensure safety in the workplace 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.600
 such as taking precautionary measures with regard to harmful influences 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.600
 such as with static electricity 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.890
 and then it can start 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.920
 in this book you definitely need to be resistant to stress because you have to 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.510
 head very well 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.660
 inattention you cannot use accurate work in this work 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.990
 works x extremely important 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.539
 there will be no Christmas cards here, two points will be exactly opposite each other 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.629
 when the measuring equipment is placed, it can be delivered 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.419
 if you are going to do mechatronics engineering machine training 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.569
 you can choose from different directions 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.180
 if you are capable of solving problems that arise, you can 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.069
 Depending on the company where you are going to work, grow into specialist 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.229
 functions 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:33.559
 it may also be that you have to test prototypes that are so-called first 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:35.959
 test specimens of machines 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.959
 you do this in collaboration with others 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.339
 once everything has been tested, the checklist will be fully reviewed and cut 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:46.839
 he must of course not be forgotten 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:50.209
 it's handy that you can walk there that way 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.260
 really checked everything then the case valve and the checklist to the 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.599
 bring a technician who can now take over the business 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.209
 Of course there is still an oral report on what is going on 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.269
 done and the possible problems and solutions thereof that is the testing 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.599
 encountered 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.219
 so there is quite a bit involved with these questions and that works to a large extent 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.709
 independent 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.529
 m you can be quite proud that someone on a machine you have tested 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.039
 can work safely 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:22.569
 there are other characteristic examples of mechatronic machines 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.109
 for example a fully automatic milking machine welding robot center 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.489
 sorting machines copiers and alive 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.019
 here the mechanism is controlled by electronics chain that saves a lot 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.219
 many people work 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.729
 and ensures that companies can produce enough
