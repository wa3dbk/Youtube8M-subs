00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.140
 This is my first time playing with Christophe. Playing cards with people who have never played before, 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.779
 It is always more challenging. 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.300
 As you can see, he is a good player with a positive offense. 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.619
 A, 2, this card is not very good. 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.500
 But I have a positional advantage, 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.310
 And it feels good to win with a small flush with A. Sometimes you can win the big pot with such a card. 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.739
 Eric (Christoph) Seidel took the lead in action. 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.239
 I am in the small blind, the cards are A, K, and I raise again. 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.080
 I am very happy to see an A now. 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.940
 He must have at least one A or one J in his hand to defeat me. 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 I think that in most cases, A and K are on the flop. 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.230
 It’s a good card, so I bet, 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.830
 Players who are likely to have a pair, a short Zhang Shun, a top pair but a weaker kick will be called. 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.940
 He bet 18,000 and I called. 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.100
 This is a regular play. 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.110
 After the turn is issued, I feel the strength of my deck. 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.710
 Relatively low. So if I re-raise in the small blind, 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.250
 This means that I have a lot of cards that make up the biggest straight. 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.500
 Therefore, continuing to bet is a bit too much for the cards in my hand. 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.539
 So I decided 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.759
 Check in to make a value bet on the river. 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.159
 He checked. 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.730
 Then I checked. 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.930
 After the river issued Q, 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.850
 My deck strength is relatively low. if he 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.290
 If there is a lack of Zhang Shunzi on the flop and a wrestling play, he may become a card on the river. 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.670
 But I don’t think he will 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.040
 Often bluffing on the river, so if I want to 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.760
 Winning money in this card, I'd better be a value bet. 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.830
 If he raises, I will face a tough decision. 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.140
 It is now on the river and he bets 45. This is a big note. My guess is if his belt A 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.560
 Smaller than A, J, he should try 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.700
 Let me fold, because my play reveals my cards. 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.860
 Considering that he should think that I have J or A, 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.520
 I don't think he is bluffing. 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.270
 He has buried the card. 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.650
 The result of this hand is ideal for me, I guess 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.040
 Eric has an A, but the composition of the deck is weak. but, 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.040
 If Eric raises on the river, 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.300
 I will choose to fold. 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.340
 To be honest, I am not satisfied with this card. I should have folded it. 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.360
 This card is the kind of card that you will think "if you can repent". 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.810
 This is the most disappointing card I feel today.
