00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.009
 hi today i have this extra video 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.150
 a kind and boxing 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.980
 product review for you 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.030
 collaboration with then vinci 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.519
 I have some cool stuff 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.830
 sent and it is something 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.650
 what I am going to show you and what you are there 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.779
 can and with what is really an ideal tip 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.080
 for example to spend on 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.449
 someone's birthday or to use to 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.890
 for your mother's day gift 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.990
 kind of stuff even though it 's mothers day 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.800
 but good because I have this 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.840
 package sent and this package 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.190
 and so it is province and I knew it 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.690
 not at all but you can see it already 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.730
 of course this is not real either 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.860
 a little more for my age categories 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.350
 but maybe for your viewers 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.670
 hence i make a video about it 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.039
 thought that is very nice to 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.899
 show what it is exactly 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.190
 especially since I am also the one that is core 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.840
 I want it to be fun and the knowledge too 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.730
 and I'm just going to let you go 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.820
 see what's in it what's in you 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.530
 can join in and you have some tips with 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.910
 yes, more hour was actually good 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.379
 I just got everything out of this box 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.690
 met I would just show what here 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.000
 all in this is really a real one 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.320
 a whole child and you also see one here 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.750
 image of that you by so really 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.070
 can just make something of it 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.290
 a kind of picture frame flower power 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.110
 thing yes what is it all in if 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.180
 first you have four of these colors and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.640
 these are those teacup puppies 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.869
 so really decoration pop and how accidental 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.700
 is it that my channel really 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.860
 decoration food what i never met 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.990
 decoration but now finally 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.380
 so this would be the decobox in 4 colors 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.640
 these are then later in summer 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.500
 16 different colors available 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.540
 so you can really go in any direction 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.549
 but this time i sat in it and 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.840
 these are really that bright neon color 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.330
 really super cool 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.820
 then there is such a gun and 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.770
 So I've been such a teacup in 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.289
 done I say our doctor gun 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.689
 this is called this and therefore the styler tool 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.340
 so that styler tool and that is in it 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.080
 other package that I have is still there 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.729
 such a styler tool 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.380
 and also other colors and more 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.000
 figures and I will leave that later 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.479
 Seeing such a good deco doll so you can 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.409
 just put in that strider tool and then 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.819
 you actually spray the carter there 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.340
 squirting the can let me see what 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.640
 for snake 's substance it is I go 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:19.140
 just show it that way yes i am 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.299
 that's how i look it is actually yes 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.980
 what kind of a small but it 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.230
 is no small it is a kind of black 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.239
 I do n't know but you can do it whole 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.120
 a lot with it 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.860
 the superflex born to the fun is that 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.540
 you this is also a squirt and that you 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.609
 so can do all things with it 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.160
 on top of this whole cardboard 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.950
 assembly and what colors 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.510
 with service steiner tool and the decor puppies 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.340
 so then you can yes all this here 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.380
 then I must honestly say that 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.000
 I don't really like them that way 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.500
 liked to do my body it is 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.590
 much nicer to really put things in you 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.350
 house already have to decorate 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.930
 so I have a yes here for example 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.819
 kind of tea light holder and this one 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.920
 can really just really brighten up 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.540
 with is those colors and that styler tool 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.390
 because you can actually be a kind 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.220
 of yes paints or show with it 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.140
 but then it is a son of 3d paint yes 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.340
 I don't know it's hard to explain 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.410
 you used to have it all before 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.329
 really not hey this is really very nice 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.739
 for i i was my son of it 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.269
 crafting actually but good as what 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.680
 if you are younger this is really fun 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.319
 I'm going to test it now I already have it 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.239
 f tried and see how it worked 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.760
 but well I want the say you 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:31.040
 between such a piece 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.040
 well not a dot but smartphone 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:38.340
 so watch it just stick and it 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.959
 is still a bit soft but it 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.790
 is then on after two or three days 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.829
 it really is pretty hard and it stays that way 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.140
 just sit well and this concept 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.569
 consists of three steps of light 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.280
 pinch and design so you can do that whole 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.650
 easy to do with that steeper tool and 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.000
 that the stuff in it is so flexible 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.769
 in idea purchase option that is really ideal 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.819
 but i'm really a disaster with this 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.739
 kind of things are absolutely impossible 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.959
 creative and i can i was never good 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.239
 in the field of draftsman and art and so on 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.519
 Anyway this is really super cute 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.590
 look it really is such a neon orange that 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.849
 I'd really be totally hip now of course 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.980
 and if you don't like it it is 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.870
 super flexible and you can do it there 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.479
 just pick it up so as something and 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.320
 iodine has failed look then i have it 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.930
 so finished 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.370
 know how nice and these are really of those 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.470
 small things but you can really do the whole 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.900
 thing my people smoother of course 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.900
 but I do like a little minimal 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.979
 sometimes there really is a little something 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.039
 done too much with a high than just 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.410
 off and it takes a bit of it or something 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.750
 but as tomorrow so now very fast shipment 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.220
 decorated and how cute it is I think it is 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.740
