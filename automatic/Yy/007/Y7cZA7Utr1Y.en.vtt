00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:18.189
 hello good today in this video we are going to 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.450
 make a simple drawing that consists 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.600
 in drawing a cottage or a cabin 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.910
 we would start 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.230
 drawing the roof 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.230
 we would do so 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:38.360
 A) Yes 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:41.350
 and so we will draw a border 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.350
 up to this point 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.660
 another edge around here 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.840
 and other 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.680
 up to this point 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.280
 we draw a line like this for example 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.910
 more or less around here we will do so for 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.910
 make a fireplace 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.400
 well and so 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.450
 and for example 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.539
 and we draw 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.200
 another edge out there we will draw another 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:20.340
 little piece of this line 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.340
 and we will unite it 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.480
 with this way down here now we're going 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.690
 with the walls 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.550
 leaving a little here 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:36.350
 we go a straight line like this down 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.350
 another around here 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.909
 we put together 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.469
 and draw and we have another 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.469
 to draw this side of the house 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.800
 and so now let's make the doors 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.800
 they would be here in the middle 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.420
 we draw here a line 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.360
 and the doorknob 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.130
 the little circle 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.200
 and so now windows 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.069
 I for example in this part of 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.519
 make a round 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.519
 yes 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.550
 I am going to draw 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.550
 these forms 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.920
 well and I'm going to draw two windows 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.850
 lengthened here and two more 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.530
 wide on this side 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.530
 we will draw you like this 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:47.959
 we draw 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.959
 can open another window here 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.250
 equal of the other 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.159
 another rocket and so here we will look 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.030
 larger windows 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.800
 another window 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.640
 A) Yes 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.640
 and uneven 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.400
 and we would not do the frames we would do 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.400
 A) Yes 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.120
 so and so on the other three windows 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.930
 these if you look how it would treat a 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.110
 little the roof with 8 part of 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.110
 above 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.330
 another here 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.450
 and now let's do the following 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:55.230
 we will make a straight line asia down 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:58.330
 and two others from one side to the other 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.370
 so in this same 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:05.720
 one in half 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:08.140
 and two others from one side to the other of the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.140
 window 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:15.100
 well now on the roof 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.580
 we will draw lines 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.580
 A) Yes 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.170
 a lot of lines to fill everything 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.870
 the roof another 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.129
 one around here 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.649
 another here 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.649
 another here and another one 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.820
 and then for example let's make a 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.750
 A) Yes 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.750
 some bushes 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.510
 ej 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.510
 some taste around here 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.010
 yes 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.800
 we do so others we have some 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.900
 curvitas inside and for example 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.900
 here we will draw another 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.450
 A) Yes 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:18.320
 and so and we would have drawn our 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.670
 little house I hope you liked it 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.430
 It is also very simple to do 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.660
 you your house and we would see each other 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.660
 in my next videos
