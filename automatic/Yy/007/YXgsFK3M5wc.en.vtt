00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.180
 Actually everything is on the as always 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.930
 fan miles of the republic 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.269
 black-red-golden rudelbildung 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.460
 germany celebrates the wm rush 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.190
 but this euphoria she was in front of a few 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.130
 weeks still unthinkable injuries 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.439
 tactics staff the journey of the dfb team 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.140
 The semi-final was with constant criticism 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.930
 does not accompany any things we do 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.670
 track somehow but we see 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.920
 and to solutions and it makes jogi 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.450
 he is distinguished from all this 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.579
 drive the around it is at all 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.809
 not at all not take the yes 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.739
 first five games had so sensationally 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.020
 We are in the semifinals and work 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.500
 Everybody is proud of that 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.270
 and satisfied in the balanced rest 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.520
 the german team might be down 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.629
 most balanced on all positions 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.420
 heavily staffed 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.350
 the motherland of the exciting 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.930
 offensive football brazil suffers 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.280
 just at the front 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.289
 argentina and the netherlands with high 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.300
 prominent offensive departments though 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.090
 little world class on the defensive 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.070
 the dfb team at this wm certainly not 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.500
 with a football aesthetic evolution 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.330
 but the sovereignty of the players is 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.729
 grown 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.350
 the team is I think again 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.420
 will continue of course because everyone 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.250
 individual players not only at the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.740
 national team but also in the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.130
 club experience has gathered 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.400
 has evolved and the variety of 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.509
 good players has risen again 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.490
 That's why we are clearly one step 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.140
 continue 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.180
 the german election over years 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.579
 grown together just under half of the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.150
 kaders was already in 2010 in south africa 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.009
 there 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.740
 The Dutch are just around the corner 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.149
 seven players for love scolari has 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.000
 his team even last year at 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.590
 is confed-cup cast the 65-year-old 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.780
 the only one in the rows of cinestar 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.659
 he knows how to do a wm semi-final 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.540
 blooms In 2002, Brazil was under him 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.590
 last time too far in the tournament 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.170
 argentina is even longer ago 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.590
 since 1990 was always at the latest in 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.210
 quarter-final 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.770
 my dream finale would be against brazil 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.869
 argentina but germany plays 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.760
 already very good you were before the tournament 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.370
 one of the big favorites and they are 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.140
 it still and that was the running 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.299
 alignment has modified the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.150
 hurray football has been suspended 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.459
 for more defensive stability manuel 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.319
 newer with more than 85 percent held 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.750
 Balls also statistically the best keeper 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.150
 the tournament's defensive in front of him 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.610
 special and play in three out of five 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.010
 to zero and the goal against Algeria a lot 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.030
 when everything was over, yes in advance 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.940
 and always said that happened in 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:47.940
 special conditions also prevail 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.379
 someone experienced with 26 27 degrees and me 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.470
 the players believe that in the square 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:55.230
 stood the knew we have the am 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.629
 own body felt what that means 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.079
 also show then 90 minutes 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.190
 and as we always say we are judging 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.310
 of course , a little bit to us 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.769
 prerequisites the supposed factor 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.659
 climate of joachim löw spoils the 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.459
 National team has their game as well 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.160
 made weatherproof like the other one 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.030
 remaining European representatives 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.400
 holland and germany with 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.410
 footballing to kick off after almost 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.660
 already Italian-looking drifting on 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.400
 Effectiveness of that is who we are 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.709
 not a fantastic team but we are 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.540
 a team which is hard to beat 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:35.459
 this game we go through 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.109
 hopefully until the end of this 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.180
 By the way, one also already owns that 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.190
 standard ears not no says both 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.730
 Teams with five hits after dormant 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.889
 balls 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.280
 just for the dfb selection a whole 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:49.530
 new core competence had to be Löw 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.269
 system nominated from the beginning to the head 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.430
 for this position double and triple 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.829
 and can still from the bank still 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.290
 Inside the German players twelve to 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.090
 Fourteen luxury copies as 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.980
 brazil and argentina painfully 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.590
 miss after the failures of nena 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.879
 and di maria 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.300
 I think that's a big advantage 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.800
 is that one 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.620
 such alternatives still on the bank 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.760
 one has it, yes I believe in 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.700
 seen every game that the 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.860
 Substitutions for some swing 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.640
 and just at the 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.560
 Temperatures is something that is very important in 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.020
 The era Löw manages the dfb team 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.460
 so far always at least in the semifinals 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.170
 but only once again 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.060
 the em 2008 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.520
 now it is finally back in the final 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.480
 the signs are going to stand these days 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:42.430
 not for a long time 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.430
 wm currently we for 4
