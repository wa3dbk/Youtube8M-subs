back<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.750> little<00:02:33.570> it's<00:02:34.570> pretty<00:02:35.380> close<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:35.980> what

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
back a little it's pretty close to what

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.260 
back a little it's pretty close to what
I<00:02:36.670> want<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.480> looks<00:02:37.660> darker<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.320> camera<00:02:38.980> in

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.820 
I want it looks darker in the camera in
the<00:02:40.270> light<00:02:40.570> it's<00:02:40.810> much<00:02:41.110> brighter<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.620> best

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
the light it's much brighter the best

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.530 
the light it's much brighter the best
thing<00:02:45.010> for<00:02:45.040> me<00:02:45.340> would<00:02:46.000> be<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.150> show<00:02:46.450> you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
thing for me would be to show you

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.590 
thing for me would be to show you
outside<00:02:46.930> in<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:48.070> daylight<00:02:48.340> that's<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.240> true

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
outside in the daylight that's the true

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.170

light<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.070> mean<00:02:51.280> it's<00:02:51.430> not<00:02:51.580> bad<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:51.850> can't

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
light but I mean it's not bad I can't

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.740

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
growth and I mean I've been pulling the

hair a little bit because I rake through
my<00:03:29.620> hair<00:03:29.860> everyday<00:03:30.160> but<00:03:30.480> if<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.959> can<00:03:32.170> see

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
my hair everyday but if you can see

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:42.119 
my hair everyday but if you can see
they're<00:03:33.910> pretty<00:03:34.060> much<00:03:34.330> all<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.680> same

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.509 

some<00:03:42.730> longer<00:03:43.209> than<00:03:43.239> others<00:03:44.159> this<00:03:45.159> is<00:03:45.219> where

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
some longer than others this is where

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.649 
some longer than others this is where
the<00:03:45.640> braid<00:03:45.849> starts<00:03:47.909> so<00:03:48.909> I<00:03:48.939> mean<00:03:49.269> I<00:03:49.299> guess<00:03:49.510> my

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
the braid starts so I mean I guess my

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.319 
the braid starts so I mean I guess my
hair<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:49.930> definitely<00:03:50.650> growing<00:03:50.969> this<00:03:51.969> doesn't

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
hair is definitely growing this doesn't

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.670 
hair is definitely growing this doesn't
have<00:03:52.420> as<00:03:52.540> much<00:03:52.719> new<00:03:53.049> growth<00:03:53.230> over<00:03:53.499> here
