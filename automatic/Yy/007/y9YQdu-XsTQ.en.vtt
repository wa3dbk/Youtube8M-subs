replacement of yeast you use that by

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.699 
replacement of yeast you use that by

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
almond cake it's like a sucker taught

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.120 
almond cake it's like a sucker taught
but<00:04:13.879> actually<00:04:14.180> it's<00:04:14.269> a<00:04:14.299> flourless<00:04:14.629> cake<00:04:15.130> and

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
but actually it's a flourless cake and

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.680 
but actually it's a flourless cake and
you<00:04:16.280> make<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:16.489> meringue<00:04:16.759> and<00:04:16.909> then<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:17.359> mix<00:04:17.539> the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
you make a meringue and then you mix the

you make a meringue and then you mix the
chocolate<00:04:17.870> with<00:04:18.199> it<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.409> you<00:04:18.470> fold<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:18.889> all

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:19.009 
chocolate with it and you fold it all

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.529 
chocolate with it and you fold it all
together<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.459> make<00:04:19.609> it<00:04:19.699> nice<00:04:19.880> and<00:04:19.909> light<00:04:20.209> you

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
together to make it nice and light you

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.540 
together to make it nice and light you
bake<00:04:20.780> it<00:04:20.810> for<00:04:21.019> about<00:04:21.139> 40<00:04:21.560> minutes<00:04:21.590> at<00:04:21.889> 180<00:04:22.250> and

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
bake it for about 40 minutes at 180 and

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.089 
bake it for about 40 minutes at 180 and
then<00:04:23.360> you<00:04:23.630> basically<00:04:24.169> leave<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.770> to<00:04:24.889> cool

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
then you basically leave it to cool

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:25.420 
then you basically leave it to cool
there

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430
