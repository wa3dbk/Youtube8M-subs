00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
and it's actually pretty light I was

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.120 
and it's actually pretty light I was
kind<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.850> worried<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.680> gonna<00:01:37.860> be

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
kind of worried that it was gonna be

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.190 
kind of worried that it was gonna be
really<00:01:38.370> heavy<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.880> cost<00:01:39.300> a<00:01:39.450> lot<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.840> shipping

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
it's not so light for me to feel like it

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.620 
it's not so light for me to feel like it
was<00:01:44.880> cheaply<00:01:45.240> made<00:01:45.540> or<00:01:45.780> something<00:01:46.040> but<00:01:47.630> it's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630

it's<00:02:49.110> just<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.320> great<00:02:49.500> pose<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.980> think<00:02:50.130> his<00:02:50.220> face

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
it's just a great pose I think his face

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.870 
it's just a great pose I think his face
looks<00:02:50.730> great<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:52.320> arms<00:02:52.650> wiggle<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.400> little<00:02:53.700> bit

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
looks great the arms wiggle a little bit

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.460 
looks great the arms wiggle a little bit
but<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.180> don't<00:02:54.299> know<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:54.959> there's<00:02:55.200> much

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
but I don't know that there's much

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.250 
but I don't know that there's much
poseability<00:02:56.370> there<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.660> I'm<00:02:57.840> gonna<00:02:57.930> attempt

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
poseability there so I'm gonna attempt

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.870 
poseability there so I'm gonna attempt
to<00:02:58.320> take<00:02:58.590> his<00:02:58.739> head<00:02:58.950> off<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.370> see<00:02:59.519> how<00:02:59.670> hard

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
to take his head off and see how hard

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.759 
to take his head off and see how hard
this<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:03.170> that's<00:03:04.170> not<00:03:04.350> bad

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
this is that's not bad

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.230 
this is that's not bad
and<00:03:05.239> then

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
and then

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.710 
and then
and<00:03:07.450> give<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:07.780> puppy<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:09.310> head<00:03:09.550> in<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:09.970> that

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
and give a puppy this head in and that

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.340 
and give a puppy this head in and that
was<00:03:10.870> pretty<00:03:11.170> painless<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:12.940> his<00:03:13.810> waist<00:03:14.080> does

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
was pretty painless so his waist does

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.560 
was pretty painless so his waist does
pivot<00:03:14.770> his<00:03:15.130> legs<00:03:15.370> pivot<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.820> little<00:03:15.850> bit<00:03:16.210> like<00:03:16.450> I

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
pivot his legs pivot a little bit like I

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.750 
pivot his legs pivot a little bit like I
said<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.780> don't<00:03:16.930> know<00:03:17.170> how<00:03:17.350> you<00:03:17.410> would<00:03:17.650> how<00:03:18.550> else

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
said I don't know how you would how else

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.970 
said I don't know how you would how else
you<00:03:18.850> would<00:03:18.940> pose<00:03:19.270> it<00:03:19.480> but<00:03:19.710> these<00:03:20.710> are<00:03:20.770> all

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
you would pose it but these are all

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.520 
you would pose it but these are all
separate<00:03:21.340> pieces<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:22.660> might<00:03:22.840> have<00:03:22.990> been<00:03:23.200> for

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
separate pieces it might have been for

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.050 
separate pieces it might have been for
the<00:03:23.680> molding<00:03:24.010> process<00:03:24.070> that<00:03:24.730> they<00:03:24.850> did<00:03:25.030> that

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
the molding process that they did that

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
the molding process that they did that
but<00:03:25.480> it's<00:03:26.140> kind<00:03:26.350> of<00:03:26.380> nice<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:28.510> it's<00:03:28.690> also<00:03:28.840> nice

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
but it's kind of nice and it's also nice

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.160 
but it's kind of nice and it's also nice
that<00:03:29.140> it's<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.500> it's<00:03:29.800> a<00:03:29.950> flexible<00:03:30.490> plastic

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
that it's a it's a flexible plastic

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.290 
that it's a it's a flexible plastic
it's<00:03:32.170> yeah<00:03:32.800> it's<00:03:32.980> I'm<00:03:33.610> trying<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.030> think<00:03:34.210> of

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
it's yeah it's I'm trying to think of

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.880 
it's yeah it's I'm trying to think of
other<00:03:34.420> toys<00:03:34.720> that<00:03:34.900> I've<00:03:34.990> had<00:03:35.200> that<00:03:35.380> have<00:03:35.440> this

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
other toys that I've had that have this

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.680 
other toys that I've had that have this
but<00:03:36.160> basically<00:03:36.820> it's<00:03:37.060> hollow<00:03:37.240> and<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.540> can

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
but basically it's hollow and you can

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.410 
but basically it's hollow and you can
squeeze<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:39.250> I'm<00:03:39.580> actually<00:03:39.790> really<00:03:40.150> happy

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
squeeze it and I'm actually really happy

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.640 
squeeze it and I'm actually really happy
about<00:03:40.660> that<00:03:40.930> because<00:03:41.050> if<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.410> were<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.590> fall

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
about that because if it were to fall

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.020 
about that because if it were to fall
off<00:03:41.950> your<00:03:42.100> shelf<00:03:42.280> or<00:03:42.460> something<00:03:42.820> it's<00:03:42.970> not

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
off your shelf or something it's not

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.810 
off your shelf or something it's not
going<00:03:43.270> to<00:03:43.330> shatter<00:03:43.570> or<00:03:43.960> crack<00:03:44.670> because<00:03:45.670> it's

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
going to shatter or crack because it's

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.540 
going to shatter or crack because it's
so<00:03:45.970> flexible<00:03:46.950> like<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:48.070> said<00:03:48.250> it's<00:03:48.400> pretty

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
so flexible like I said it's pretty

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.680 
so flexible like I said it's pretty
light<00:03:49.380> so<00:03:50.550> I'm<00:03:51.550> not<00:03:51.730> sure<00:03:51.790> how<00:03:51.970> much<00:03:52.270> the<00:03:52.480> cost

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
light so I'm not sure how much the cost

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.810 
light so I'm not sure how much the cost
will<00:03:53.020> be<00:03:53.940> through<00:03:54.940> bluefin<00:03:55.890> through<00:03:56.890> amiami

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
will be through bluefin through amiami

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.360 
will be through bluefin through amiami
it<00:03:58.060> was<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:59.530> equivalent<00:03:59.800> of<00:04:00.100> about<00:04:00.390> $75<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:02.410> I

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
it was the equivalent of about $75 and I

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.490 
it was the equivalent of about $75 and I
bought<00:04:03.580> two<00:04:03.820> of<00:04:03.940> them<00:04:04.090> so<00:04:04.420> after<00:04:04.810> shipping<00:04:05.080> I

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
bought two of them so after shipping I

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.170 
bought two of them so after shipping I
think<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.460> was<00:04:07.290> 87<00:04:08.290> dollars<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.800> piece<00:04:09.180> so

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
think it was 87 dollars a piece so

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.880 
think it was 87 dollars a piece so
that's<00:04:10.810> probably<00:04:11.110> what<00:04:11.380> you<00:04:11.470> end<00:04:11.590> up<00:04:11.710> paying

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
that's probably what you end up paying

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.050 
that's probably what you end up paying
if<00:04:12.070> you<00:04:12.160> go<00:04:12.310> through<00:04:12.520> a<00:04:12.610> u.s.<00:04:12.850> distributor

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
if you go through a u.s. distributor

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.690 
if you go through a u.s. distributor
including<00:04:13.990> shipping<00:04:14.350> but<00:04:15.070> I<00:04:15.130> think<00:04:15.460> it<00:04:15.550> looks

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
including shipping but I think it looks

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.930 
including shipping but I think it looks
great<00:04:15.850> it's<00:04:16.780> got<00:04:16.989> a<00:04:17.049> great<00:04:17.260> face<00:04:17.549> great<00:04:18.549> molds

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
great it's got a great face great molds

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.980 
great it's got a great face great molds
and<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:20.320> have<00:04:20.770> I<00:04:21.070> have<00:04:21.610> no<00:04:21.790> complaints<00:04:22.360> all<00:04:22.630> the

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
and I have I have no complaints all the

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.870 
and I have I have no complaints all the
paint<00:04:23.230> looks<00:04:23.500> great<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:25.830> think<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:27.250> think<00:04:27.610> it's<00:04:27.760> a

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
paint looks great I think I think it's a

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.700 
paint looks great I think I think it's a
success<00:04:28.090> hopefully<00:04:28.870> my<00:04:29.020> next<00:04:29.050> video<00:04:29.530> will
