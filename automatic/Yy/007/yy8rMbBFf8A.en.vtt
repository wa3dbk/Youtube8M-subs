alarm system I just installed it is the
spy<00:00:08.730> 5000m<00:00:09.660> motorcycle<00:00:10.320> alarm<00:00:10.560> system<00:00:10.920> comes

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
spy 5000m motorcycle alarm system comes

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.390 
spy 5000m motorcycle alarm system comes
with<00:00:11.910> two<00:00:12.390> remotes<00:00:12.950> keep<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.070> mind<00:00:14.250> that's

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
with two remotes keep in mind that's

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.920 
with two remotes keep in mind that's
actually<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.760> great<00:00:14.880> feature<00:00:15.210> having<00:00:15.630> two

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
actually a great feature having two

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.650 
actually a great feature having two

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
remotes a lot of companies sell the same

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720 
remotes a lot of companies sell the same
system<00:00:19.200> or<00:00:19.380> similar<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.070> only<00:00:20.430> comes<00:00:20.610> with

alarm is armed armed so we're going to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.320 
alarm is armed armed so we're going to
test<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> proximity<00:01:11.610> sensor<00:01:11.940> I'm<00:01:12.180> going

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
test out the proximity sensor I'm going

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.560 
test out the proximity sensor I'm going
to<00:01:12.390> walk<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> my<00:01:12.930> motorcycle<00:01:14.270> get<00:01:15.270> really

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
to walk up to my motorcycle get really

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.929

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
me know that it was the microwave sensor

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.230 
me know that it was the microwave sensor
when<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.810> says<00:01:34.049> CD<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> bottom<00:01:38.000> it<00:01:39.000> does

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
when it says CD on the bottom it does

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.140 
when it says CD on the bottom it does
have<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> shock<00:01:39.810> sensor<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.380> it

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150

and now are showing hammer hitting my

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.330 
and now are showing hammer hitting my
gas<00:01:53.450> tank<00:01:53.480> which<00:01:53.960> means<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.740> was<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.130> shock

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
gas tank which means it was the shock

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.370 
gas tank which means it was the shock
sensor<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:59.630> beeping<00:01:59.990> sound<00:02:00.050> you're

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
sensor and that beeping sound you're

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.900 
sensor and that beeping sound you're
hearing<00:02:00.410> is<00:02:00.710> actually<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:01.100> remote<00:02:01.430> not<00:02:01.700> the

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
hearing is actually the remote not the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.720 
hearing is actually the remote not the
alarm<00:02:05.080> it's<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.200> great<00:02:06.380> little<00:02:06.530> feature<00:02:06.740> I'm

and my house is 20 yards past there so

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.710 
and my house is 20 yards past there so
if<00:04:35.430> my<00:04:35.550> alarm<00:04:35.789> goes<00:04:36.030> off<00:04:36.180> when<00:04:36.389> I'm<00:04:36.479> in<00:04:36.570> my

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
if my alarm goes off when I'm in my

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.180 
if my alarm goes off when I'm in my
house<00:04:36.870> which<00:04:37.289> is<00:04:37.320> through<00:04:37.740> this<00:04:37.889> concrete

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
house which is through this concrete

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.020 
house which is through this concrete
garage<00:04:38.729> with<00:04:39.090> all<00:04:39.120> these<00:04:39.419> cars<00:04:39.990> in<00:04:40.289> the<00:04:40.380> way<00:04:41.030> it

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
garage with all these cars in the way it

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.879 
garage with all these cars in the way it
still<00:04:42.330> works

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
still works

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.480 
still works
so<00:04:43.889> I'm<00:04:44.820> about<00:04:45.060> 1,500<00:04:45.990> or<00:04:46.139> 5000<00:04:46.860> M<00:04:47.010> if<00:04:47.250> that's

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
so I'm about 1,500 or 5000 M if that's

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.000 
so I'm about 1,500 or 5000 M if that's
the<00:04:47.669> distance<00:04:48.000> but<00:04:48.240> it's<00:04:49.050> a<00:04:49.169> strong<00:04:49.410> remote<00:04:49.770> I

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
the distance but it's a strong remote I

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.090 
the distance but it's a strong remote I
have<00:04:50.669> it<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:51.120> antenna<00:04:51.510> attached<00:04:52.139> to<00:04:52.560> my<00:04:52.740> frame

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
have it the antenna attached to my frame

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.400 
have it the antenna attached to my frame
or<00:04:53.310> close<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.580> my<00:04:53.850> metal<00:04:54.030> frame<00:04:54.450> to<00:04:55.050> increase

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
or close to my metal frame to increase

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.260 
or close to my metal frame to increase
the<00:04:55.590> signal<00:04:55.800> it's<00:04:56.550> on<00:04:56.639> the<00:04:56.760> outside<00:04:57.120> of<00:04:57.180> the
