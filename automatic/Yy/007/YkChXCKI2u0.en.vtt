well<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.469> interesting<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.249> see<00:01:50.369> if

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
well so this is interesting to see if

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:52.910 
well so this is interesting to see if
Apple<00:01:50.909> really<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.840> transforms<00:01:52.499> the<00:01:52.619> market

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
Apple really just transforms the market

Apple really just transforms the market
yet<00:01:53.069> again<00:01:53.310> by<00:01:53.520> doing<00:01:53.789> something<00:01:53.999> and<00:01:54.270> donate

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
yet again by doing something and donate

same sentiment because Apple has taken

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.100 
same sentiment because Apple has taken
something<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.829> simple<00:02:08.579> and<00:02:09.000> commonplace<00:02:09.569> as

something as simple and commonplace as

something as simple and commonplace as

cut and paste and
made<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.960> world's<00:02:11.990> most<00:02:12.410> revolutionary

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
made it the world's most revolutionary

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.480 
made it the world's most revolutionary
feature<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.790> cell<00:02:14.030> phone<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:14.870> clearly<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:16.280> is

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
feature a cell phone so clearly this is

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.160 
feature a cell phone so clearly this is
you<00:02:16.640> know<00:02:16.730> part<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.210> hype<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.480> goes<00:02:17.900> into

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
you know part of the hype that goes into

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.650 
you know part of the hype that goes into
iPhone<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.860> why<00:02:19.040> people<00:02:19.430> are<00:02:19.550> so<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:20.540> know

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
iPhone and why people are so you know

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.380 
iPhone and why people are so you know
crazy<00:02:20.990> about<00:02:21.380> this<00:02:21.560> device<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.310> but<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.270> do

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
crazy about this device and but I do

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.120 
crazy about this device and but I do
think<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.080> one<00:02:24.800> of<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.950> interesting

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
think that one of the interesting

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.890 
think that one of the interesting
capabilities<00:02:25.880> of<00:02:25.910> having<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:26.480> feature<00:02:26.750> is

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
capabilities of having this feature is

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.900 
capabilities of having this feature is
the<00:02:27.020> potential<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.620> having<00:02:27.770> that<00:02:27.950> API<00:02:28.400> open<00:02:28.820> to

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
the potential of having that API open to

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.640 
the potential of having that API open to
developers<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.660> create<00:02:29.690> iphone<00:02:30.140> apps<00:02:30.350> around

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
developers to create iphone apps around

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.740 
developers to create iphone apps around
it<00:02:30.950> because<00:02:31.070> this<00:02:31.820> is<00:02:31.970> something<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.630> know<00:02:32.720> I

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
it because this is something you know I

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.630 
it because this is something you know I
have<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.050> I<00:02:33.350> have<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.680> Prius<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.280> has<00:02:34.400> voice

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
have a I have a Prius that has voice

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.160 
have a I have a Prius that has voice
command<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:35.300> actually<00:02:35.450> use<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.930> quite

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
command and I actually use it quite

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.750 
command and I actually use it quite
frequently<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:36.890> car<00:02:37.100> whereas<00:02:37.430> on<00:02:37.610> I'm

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
frequently in the car whereas on I'm

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.370 
frequently in the car whereas on I'm
cell<00:02:38.000> phone<00:02:38.180> I've<00:02:38.300> never<00:02:38.450> used<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.990> so<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.260> think

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
cell phone I've never used it so I think

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.130 
cell phone I've never used it so I think
in<00:02:39.770> a<00:02:40.250> different<00:02:40.280> application<00:02:41.140> not

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
in a different application not

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.660 
in a different application not
necessarily<00:02:42.500> in<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.650> sense<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.160> software<00:02:43.550> but

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
necessarily in the sense of software but

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.850 
necessarily in the sense of software but
I<00:02:43.700> mean<00:02:43.910> different<00:02:44.540> use<00:02:44.750> of<00:02:44.959> it<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:45.290> could<00:02:45.680> be

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
I mean different use of it it could be

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.980 
I mean different use of it it could be
very<00:02:46.160> very<00:02:46.400> interesting<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.450> see<00:02:47.630> how<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:47.959> is

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
very very interesting to see how that is

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.600 
very very interesting to see how that is
integrated<00:02:48.470> into<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:48.890> phone<00:02:48.950> that's<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.520> great

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
integrated into the phone that's a great

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.190 
integrated into the phone that's a great
point<00:02:49.880> i<00:02:50.090> mean<00:02:50.209> i<00:02:50.330> think<00:02:50.390> that<00:02:50.750> like<00:02:50.930> you're

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
point i mean i think that like you're

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.530 
point i mean i think that like you're
saying<00:02:51.410> jeremy<00:02:51.820> using<00:02:52.820> voice<00:02:53.000> command<00:02:53.360> on<00:02:53.510> a

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
saying jeremy using voice command on a

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.600 
saying jeremy using voice command on a
cell<00:02:53.840> phone<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.170> itself<00:02:54.500> isn't<00:02:54.830> that<00:02:55.310> exciting

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
cell phone in itself isn't that exciting

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.460 
cell phone in itself isn't that exciting
but<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:56.420> know<00:02:56.510> maybe<00:02:56.690> those<00:02:56.900> application

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
but you know maybe those application

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.260 
but you know maybe those application
developers<00:02:57.830> can<00:02:58.130> create<00:02:58.459> something<00:02:58.700> it's<00:02:59.209> a

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
developers can create something it's a

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
developers can create something it's a
little<00:02:59.420> bit<00:02:59.510> more<00:02:59.600> unique<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.930> little<00:03:00.080> bit<00:03:00.170> more

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
little bit more unique a little bit more

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.170 
little bit more unique a little bit more

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
iphone came around and now Microsoft has

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.030 
iphone came around and now Microsoft has
a<00:03:23.660> lot<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:23.930> prove<00:03:24.170> ranna<00:03:24.560> do<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:24.769> think<00:03:24.950> the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
a lot to prove ranna do you think the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.620 
a lot to prove ranna do you think the
Microsoft<00:03:25.459> can<00:03:25.970> actually<00:03:26.209> pull<00:03:26.360> this<00:03:26.480> off

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
Microsoft can actually pull this off

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.960 
Microsoft can actually pull this off
with<00:03:26.810> windows<00:03:27.110> 7<00:03:27.410> or<00:03:27.650> windows<00:03:27.709> mobile<00:03:28.190> 6.5

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
with windows 7 or windows mobile 6.5

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.509 
with windows 7 or windows mobile 6.5
well<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.570> think<00:03:29.750> that<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.620> know<00:03:30.709> every<00:03:31.160> single

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
well I think that you know every single

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.060 
well I think that you know every single
manufacturer<00:03:32.480> out<00:03:32.690> there<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.500> everyone<00:03:33.860> in

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
manufacturer out there and everyone in

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.100 
manufacturer out there and everyone in
in<00:03:34.370> mobile<00:03:34.880> right<00:03:35.090> now<00:03:35.120> is<00:03:35.540> just<00:03:35.570> sort<00:03:36.080> of

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
in mobile right now is just sort of

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.140 
in mobile right now is just sort of
racing<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.799> catch<00:03:36.950> up<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.489> this<00:03:37.910> huge

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
racing to catch up to this huge

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.640 
racing to catch up to this huge
opportunity<00:03:38.720> they<00:03:38.870> miss<00:03:39.140> which<00:03:39.380> is<00:03:39.410> the

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
opportunity they miss which is the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.320 
opportunity they miss which is the
notion<00:03:39.830> of<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.130> centralized<00:03:40.640> application

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
notion of a centralized application

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.110 
notion of a centralized application
distribution<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:42.920> I<00:03:42.980> think<00:03:43.100> that<00:03:43.430> we

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
distribution and so I think that we

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.520 
distribution and so I think that we
shouldn't<00:03:44.390> count<00:03:44.600> Microsoft<00:03:45.110> out<00:03:45.290> yet

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
shouldn't count Microsoft out yet

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.670 
shouldn't count Microsoft out yet
ultimately<00:03:46.239> it's<00:03:47.239> between<00:03:47.540> rim<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.410> windows

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
ultimately it's between rim and windows

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.800 
ultimately it's between rim and windows
mobile<00:03:48.890> as<00:03:49.160> to<00:03:49.340> who's<00:03:49.519> got<00:03:49.760> more<00:03:50.120> share<00:03:50.600> of

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
mobile as to who's got more share of

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.500 
mobile as to who's got more share of
enterprise<00:03:51.310> devices<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.580> usage<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:53.360> I<00:03:53.390> think

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
enterprise devices and usage so I think

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.380 
enterprise devices and usage so I think
that<00:03:53.840> ultimately<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:55.130> Microsoft<00:03:56.030> had<00:03:56.180> the

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
that ultimately the Microsoft had the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.720 
that ultimately the Microsoft had the
impressive<00:03:57.230> ability<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.920> be<00:03:58.130> able<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.489> sit

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
impressive ability to be able to sit

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.449 
impressive ability to be able to sit
this<00:03:58.850> one<00:03:59.000> out<00:03:59.060> so<00:03:59.480> far<00:03:59.780> and<00:04:00.739> where<00:04:01.070> you<00:04:01.400> know

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
this one out so far and where you know

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.009 
this one out so far and where you know
that<00:04:01.610> might<00:04:01.790> be<00:04:01.970> such<00:04:02.180> a<00:04:02.269> deterrent<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:02.780> most

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
that might be such a deterrent to most

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.650 
that might be such a deterrent to most
people<00:04:03.350> it<00:04:04.250> also<00:04:04.459> might<00:04:05.060> have<00:04:05.239> given<00:04:05.360> them<00:04:05.570> the

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
people it also might have given them the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.750 
people it also might have given them the
opportunity<00:04:06.230> to<00:04:06.260> sort<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.769> learn<00:04:07.010> from<00:04:07.070> the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
opportunity to sort of learn from the

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.060 
opportunity to sort of learn from the
mistakes<00:04:07.910> of<00:04:08.360> others<00:04:08.630> and<00:04:08.989> potentially<00:04:09.860> come

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
mistakes of others and potentially come

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.920 
mistakes of others and potentially come
out<00:04:10.190> with<00:04:10.280> something<00:04:10.430> really<00:04:11.180> incredible<00:04:11.329> so

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
out with something really incredible so

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.380 
out with something really incredible so
I<00:04:12.200> would<00:04:12.769> really<00:04:12.920> like<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.190> see<00:04:13.250> what<00:04:13.850> happens

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
I would really like to see what happens

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.030 
I would really like to see what happens
I'm<00:04:14.690> if<00:04:14.870> it<00:04:14.989> is<00:04:15.110> that<00:04:15.290> date<00:04:15.530> or<00:04:15.739> if<00:04:15.860> it's<00:04:15.980> a

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
I'm if it is that date or if it's a

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.800 
I'm if it is that date or if it's a
little<00:04:16.160> bit<00:04:16.370> later<00:04:16.549> it's<00:04:17.090> definitely<00:04:17.600> you

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
little bit later it's definitely you

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.699 
little bit later it's definitely you
know<00:04:17.900> they're<00:04:18.049> they're<00:04:18.229> coming<00:04:18.500> in<00:04:18.590> behind

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
know they're they're coming in behind

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.589 
know they're they're coming in behind
just<00:04:19.459> based<00:04:19.609> on<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.760> fact<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.090> they

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
just based on the fact that they

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.870 
just based on the fact that they
everyone<00:04:21.109> else<00:04:21.289> has<00:04:21.410> mobilized<00:04:21.830> around<00:04:22.160> them

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
everyone else has mobilized around them

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.490 
everyone else has mobilized around them
and<00:04:22.970> you<00:04:23.270> know<00:04:23.360> this<00:04:23.480> is<00:04:23.540> a<00:04:23.780> shame<00:04:24.230> because

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
and you know this is a shame because

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.280 
and you know this is a shame because
they<00:04:24.860> they<00:04:25.310> have<00:04:25.520> a<00:04:25.550> great<00:04:25.850> product<00:04:26.150> as<00:04:26.810> far<00:04:27.140> as

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
they they have a great product as far as

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.110 
they they have a great product as far as
this<00:04:27.500> could<00:04:27.740> you<00:04:27.920> know<00:04:28.040> I<00:04:28.310> mean<00:04:28.550> they've<00:04:28.700> been

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
this could you know I mean they've been

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.730 
this could you know I mean they've been
doing<00:04:29.510> really<00:04:29.660> innovative<00:04:29.840> things<00:04:30.290> in<00:04:30.410> mobile

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
doing really innovative things in mobile

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.950 
doing really innovative things in mobile
for<00:04:30.920> a<00:04:30.950> long<00:04:31.160> time<00:04:31.520> yeah<00:04:31.970> and<00:04:32.150> ultimately<00:04:32.630> this

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
for a long time yeah and ultimately this

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.060 
for a long time yeah and ultimately this
could<00:04:33.230> be<00:04:33.320> an<00:04:33.380> opportunity<00:04:33.410> for<00:04:33.830> them<00:04:34.040> to

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
could be an opportunity for them to

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.190 
could be an opportunity for them to
catch<00:04:34.310> up<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.790> redeem<00:04:35.120> themselves<00:04:35.570> so<00:04:36.170> I

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
catch up and redeem themselves so I

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.750 
catch up and redeem themselves so I
think<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:36.620> remains<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:37.040> be<00:04:37.070> seen<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:37.610> and

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
think it remains to be seen and and

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.790 
think it remains to be seen and and
ultimately<00:04:38.450> you<00:04:38.600> know<00:04:38.720> if<00:04:38.840> they<00:04:39.020> if<00:04:39.320> they<00:04:39.650> have

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
ultimately you know if they if they have

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.470 
ultimately you know if they if they have
something<00:04:40.010> like<00:04:40.310> hardware<00:04:40.910> specs<00:04:41.240> that<00:04:41.450> are

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
something like hardware specs that are

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.980 
something like hardware specs that are
standardized<00:04:42.110> among<00:04:42.620> lots<00:04:43.220> of<00:04:43.430> different

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
standardized among lots of different

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.450 
standardized among lots of different
carriers<00:04:44.990> manufacturers<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:46.250> they're

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
carriers manufacturers and and they're

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.730 
carriers manufacturers and and they're
able<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.700> put<00:04:46.850> up<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.270> up<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.990> ante<00:04:48.260> that<00:04:48.470> way

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
able to put up the up the ante that way

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.720 
able to put up the up the ante that way
that<00:04:49.100> could<00:04:49.280> be<00:04:49.340> something<00:04:49.460> really

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
that could be something really

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.550 
that could be something really
interesting<00:04:50.030> because<00:04:50.300> if<00:04:51.050> you<00:04:51.200> look<00:04:51.380> at

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
interesting because if you look at

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.860 
interesting because if you look at
Android<00:04:52.130> and<00:04:52.460> you<00:04:52.700> look<00:04:52.880> at<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.120> g1<00:04:53.510> this

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
Android and you look at the g1 this

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.110 
Android and you look at the g1 this
device<00:04:54.200> is<00:04:54.530> really<00:04:54.950> a<00:04:54.980> beta<00:04:55.280> phone<00:04:55.580> it's<00:04:55.910> not

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
device is really a beta phone it's not

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.030 
device is really a beta phone it's not
it's<00:04:56.780> not<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:56.990> top-of-the-line<00:04:57.470> high-end

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
it's not a top-of-the-line high-end

one of the things I've always contended
is<00:06:28.880> maybe<00:06:29.060> Microsoft<00:06:29.270> should<00:06:29.780> just<00:06:29.930> kind<00:06:30.020> of

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
is maybe Microsoft should just kind of

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.200 
is maybe Microsoft should just kind of
scrap<00:06:30.440> windows<00:06:30.740> mobile<00:06:30.919> and<00:06:31.250> take<00:06:31.820> you<00:06:32.060> know<00:06:32.180> a

has<00:06:34.660> done<00:06:34.840> pretty<00:06:35.050> well<00:06:35.200> in<00:06:35.590> the<00:06:36.130> few<00:06:36.370> places

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
has done pretty well in the few places

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.070 
has done pretty well in the few places
that<00:06:36.790> it's<00:06:37.000> caught<00:06:37.180> on<00:06:37.210> which<00:06:37.510> are<00:06:37.720> kind<00:06:37.930> of

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
that it's caught on which are kind of

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.670 
that it's caught on which are kind of
this<00:06:38.760> teenage<00:06:39.760> market<00:06:40.300> that's<00:06:40.540> not<00:06:40.780> really<00:06:41.410> I

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
this teenage market that's not really I

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.140 
this teenage market that's not really I
mean<00:06:41.710> teenagers<00:06:42.370> who<00:06:42.490> aren't<00:06:42.670> going<00:06:42.910> for<00:06:43.090> the

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
mean teenagers who aren't going for the

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.460 
mean teenagers who aren't going for the
ipod<00:06:43.420> are<00:06:43.570> going<00:06:43.720> for<00:06:43.870> the<00:06:43.960> zoom<00:06:44.110> kind<00:06:44.410> of

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
ipod are going for the zoom kind of

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.170 
ipod are going for the zoom kind of
thing<00:06:44.650> and<00:06:44.890> you<00:06:45.370> know<00:06:45.460> I<00:06:45.490> think<00:06:45.610> if<00:06:45.940> they

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
thing and you know I think if they

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.700 
thing and you know I think if they
really<00:06:46.690> wanted<00:06:46.960> to<00:06:47.080> try<00:06:47.230> something<00:06:47.260> unique

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
really wanted to try something unique

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.530 
really wanted to try something unique
they<00:06:47.860> can<00:06:48.010> make<00:06:48.130> the<00:06:48.250> zune<00:06:48.490> interface<00:06:48.970> perfect

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
they can make the zune interface perfect

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.300 
they can make the zune interface perfect
and<00:06:49.780> kind<00:06:50.380> of<00:06:50.470> copy<00:06:50.680> all<00:06:50.860> the<00:06:50.890> things<00:06:51.190> they

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
and kind of copy all the things they

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.040 
and kind of copy all the things they
like<00:06:51.430> from<00:06:51.580> my<00:06:51.670> iphone<00:06:51.970> and<00:06:52.240> introduce<00:06:52.840> that

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
that I hope Microsoft will listen to

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.760 
that I hope Microsoft will listen to
