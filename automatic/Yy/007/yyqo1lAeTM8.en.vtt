00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
in it that's okay too I sometimes use as

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.000 
in it that's okay too I sometimes use as
well<00:00:51.300> depends<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.110> think<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.649> depends<00:00:52.980> on

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
well depends on if I think it depends on

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.709 
well depends on if I think it depends on
how<00:00:53.129> fast<00:00:53.340> eleven<00:00:53.820> how<00:00:54.000> many<00:00:54.180> times<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.510> want<00:00:54.690> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
how fast eleven how many times I want to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.400 
how fast eleven how many times I want to
press<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.020> boost<00:00:55.770> button<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:57.510> no<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.379> I

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
press that boost button so no so what I

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.840 
press that boost button so no so what I
think<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.739> another<00:00:58.920> upside<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.489> job<00:00:59.820> is

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
think is another upside on this job is

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.520 
think is another upside on this job is
that<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.390> actually<00:01:00.930> know<00:01:01.350> what

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that you have to actually know what

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.900 
that you have to actually know what
you're<00:01:01.680> doing<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.949> can't<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.340> press<00:01:02.670> any

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
you're doing you can't just press any

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.390 
you're doing you can't just press any
buttons<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.229> randomly<00:01:04.769> attack<00:01:05.129> stuff

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
buttons and just randomly attack stuff

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.520 
buttons and just randomly attack stuff
but<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.000> actually<00:01:06.119> need<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.420> make<00:01:06.630> combos<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
but you actually need to make combos and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.100 
but you actually need to make combos and
do<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.880> should<00:01:09.060> take<00:01:09.180> notes<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.689> when
