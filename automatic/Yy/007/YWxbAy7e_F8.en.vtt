00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
bit of setup but it's really easy and

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.740 
bit of setup but it's really easy and
it's<00:00:07.230> pretty<00:00:07.470> cool<00:00:07.620> so<00:00:07.980> let's<00:00:08.160> get<00:00:08.309> into<00:00:08.580> it

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
alright guys so this is the performance

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.770 
alright guys so this is the performance
of<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.280> ACE<00:00:11.429> rise<00:00:11.759> so<00:00:12.000> what<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.120> have<00:00:12.360> here<00:00:12.570> guys

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
of the ACE rise so what I have here guys

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.799 
of the ACE rise so what I have here guys
is<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.519> regular<00:00:14.519> deck<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.759> playing<00:00:14.969> cards<00:00:15.360> and

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
is a regular deck of playing cards and

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.960 
is a regular deck of playing cards and
obviously<00:00:16.260> before<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.619> start<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.310> want<00:00:17.940> to

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
obviously before I start I want to

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.750 
obviously before I start I want to
shuffle<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.480> stick<00:00:18.750> up<00:00:19.250> so<00:00:20.250> just<00:00:20.520> get<00:00:20.670> it

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
shuffle this stick up so just get it

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.480 
shuffle this stick up so just get it
nice<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.180> shuffled<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.220> and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
nice and shuffled and just like that and

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.390 
nice and shuffled and just like that and
we'll<00:00:23.730> even<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.150> guess<00:00:24.590> give<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.740> maybe<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.099> few

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
that you can simply just start off the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.020 
that you can simply just start off the
