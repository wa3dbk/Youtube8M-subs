00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:07.860 

now<00:00:04.029> as<00:00:04.450> we<00:00:04.750> look<00:00:04.990> in<00:00:05.560> between<00:00:06.040> the<00:00:06.910> villi<00:00:07.269> at

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.870 
now as we look in between the villi at

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.799 
now as we look in between the villi at
their<00:00:08.470> base<00:00:09.040> you'll<00:00:09.910> find<00:00:10.889> intestinal<00:00:11.889> glance

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
their base you'll find intestinal glance

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.140 
their base you'll find intestinal glance
here<00:00:13.809> you<00:00:14.019> have<00:00:14.230> an<00:00:14.499> intestinal<00:00:14.950> gland<00:00:15.490> these

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
here you have an intestinal gland these

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.270 
here you have an intestinal gland these
intestinal<00:00:17.020> glands<00:00:17.350> are<00:00:17.619> kind<00:00:17.860> of<00:00:17.980> hidden

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
intestinal glands are kind of hidden

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.810 
intestinal glands are kind of hidden
between<00:00:19.180> the<00:00:19.600> villi<00:00:19.870> at<00:00:20.140> their<00:00:20.350> base<00:00:20.590> and<00:00:20.950> so

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
between the villi at their base and so

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.850 
between the villi at their base and so
because<00:00:22.510> of<00:00:22.690> that<00:00:22.840> they're<00:00:23.200> also<00:00:23.500> referred<00:00:23.830> to

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
because of that they're also referred to

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.610 
because of that they're also referred to
as<00:00:24.010> crypts<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.570> you<00:00:25.630> can<00:00:25.930> call<00:00:26.170> this<00:00:26.410> an

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:26.620 
as crypts so you can call this an

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.430 
as crypts so you can call this an
intestinal<00:00:27.250> crypt<00:00:27.610> also<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:29.230> it<00:00:29.350> is

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
intestinal crypt also but it is

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.180 
intestinal crypt also but it is
basically<00:00:29.680> a<00:00:30.010> tubular<00:00:30.430> gland<00:00:31.000> and<00:00:31.829> if<00:00:32.829> we<00:00:33.010> look

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
basically a tubular gland and if we look

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.090 
basically a tubular gland and if we look
more<00:00:33.370> closely<00:00:33.550> at<00:00:34.000> it<00:00:34.289> you<00:00:35.289> can<00:00:35.469> see<00:00:35.710> that<00:00:35.949> the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
more closely at it you can see that the

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.479 
more closely at it you can see that the
cells<00:00:36.370> that<00:00:36.609> line<00:00:36.999> the<00:00:37.480> gland<00:00:37.749> are<00:00:38.320> similar<00:00:39.190> in

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
cells that line the gland are similar in

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.910 
cells that line the gland are similar in
appearance<00:00:40.120> to<00:00:40.690> what<00:00:40.929> we<00:00:41.050> saw<00:00:41.230> on<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.710> surface

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
appearance to what we saw on the surface

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.549 
appearance to what we saw on the surface
of<00:00:42.219> the<00:00:42.309> villas<00:00:42.609> but<00:00:43.420> these<00:00:43.659> cells<00:00:44.140> are

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
of the villas but these cells are

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.430 
of the villas but these cells are
serving<00:00:45.219> a<00:00:45.399> different<00:00:45.670> role<00:00:46.359> these<00:00:47.140> cells

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
serving a different role these cells

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.759 
serving a different role these cells
which<00:00:47.739> are<00:00:47.949> within<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:48.999> gland<00:00:49.300> are<00:00:49.929> secretory

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
which are within the gland are secretory

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.840 
which are within the gland are secretory
so<00:00:51.069> they're<00:00:51.249> producing<00:00:51.460> intestine<00:00:52.390> juice<00:00:52.780> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
so they're producing intestine juice and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.880 
so they're producing intestine juice and
what<00:00:54.850> happens<00:00:55.269> over<00:00:55.569> time<00:00:55.749> is<00:00:56.260> that<00:00:56.350> these

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
what happens over time is that these

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.770 
what happens over time is that these
cells<00:00:57.190> will<00:00:57.640> migrate<00:00:57.940> up<00:00:59.339> onto<00:01:00.389> the<00:01:01.389> surface

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
cells will migrate up onto the surface

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.490 
cells will migrate up onto the surface
of<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.079> villus<00:01:02.409> and<00:01:03.839> they'll<00:01:04.839> eventually<00:01:05.019> get

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
of the villus and they'll eventually get

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.690 
of the villus and they'll eventually get
to<00:01:05.620> the<00:01:05.740> tip<00:01:05.950> at<00:01:06.220> at<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:06.939> point<00:01:07.270> they're<00:01:07.600> old

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
to the tip at at that point they're old

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.069 
to the tip at at that point they're old
so<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:12.119> represents<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.270> lifespan<00:01:13.630> of<00:01:13.780> these

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 
so this represents the lifespan of these

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:16.560 
so this represents the lifespan of these
cells<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.530> cells<00:01:14.770> are<00:01:15.100> created<00:01:15.640> here<00:01:15.909> as<00:01:16.360> a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
cells the cells are created here as a

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.859 
cells the cells are created here as a
result<00:01:16.990> of<00:01:17.170> mitotic<00:01:17.500> division<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.280> as<00:01:19.060> they

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
result of mitotic division and as they

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.399 
result of mitotic division and as they
mature<00:01:20.680> they<00:01:21.579> change<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.240> function<00:01:22.719> as<00:01:22.869> they

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
mature they change and function as they

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.620 
mature they change and function as they
go<00:01:23.560> onto<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.009> surface<00:01:24.310> of<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.520> villas<00:01:24.759> on<00:01:25.479> the

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
go onto the surface of the villas on the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.359 
go onto the surface of the villas on the
surface<00:01:25.930> of<00:01:26.049> the<00:01:26.110> villas<00:01:26.409> they<00:01:26.740> go<00:01:27.100> from<00:01:27.219> a

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
surface of the villas they go from a

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.609 
surface of the villas they go from a
secretory<00:01:27.820> role<00:01:28.119> to<00:01:28.450> an<00:01:28.630> absorptive<00:01:29.049> function

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
secretory role to an absorptive function

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.849 
secretory role to an absorptive function
and<00:01:30.180> as<00:01:31.180> they<00:01:31.509> age<00:01:31.719> they're<00:01:32.109> eventually<00:01:32.320> going

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
and as they age they're eventually going

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.289 
and as they age they're eventually going
to<00:01:33.039> be<00:01:33.159> slopped<00:01:33.460> off<00:01:33.670> at<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:33.969> tip<00:01:36.180> before<00:01:37.180> we

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
to be slopped off at the tip before we

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.330 
to be slopped off at the tip before we
leave<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.630> intestinal<00:01:38.200> gland<00:01:38.740> which<00:01:39.070> is<00:01:39.189> also

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
leave the intestinal gland which is also

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.300 
leave the intestinal gland which is also
known<00:01:39.640> as<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.939> intestinal<00:01:40.539> crypt<00:01:41.130> also<00:01:42.130> known

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
known as the intestinal crypt also known

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.490 
known as the intestinal crypt also known
as<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.609> crypt<00:01:42.820> of<00:01:42.909> Lera<00:01:43.240> Kuhn<00:01:43.420> you'll<00:01:44.170> notice

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
as the crypt of Lera Kuhn you'll notice

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.709 
as the crypt of Lera Kuhn you'll notice
that<00:01:44.710> here<00:01:45.280> at<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.490> end<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:46.030> this<00:01:46.240> tube<00:01:46.539> you'll

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
that here at the end of this tube you'll

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.749 
that here at the end of this tube you'll
gland<00:01:46.990> we<00:01:47.500> have<00:01:47.679> some<00:01:47.920> cells<00:01:48.219> that<00:01:48.520> are

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
gland we have some cells that are

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.410 
gland we have some cells that are
colored<00:01:49.600> red<00:01:49.960> this<00:01:50.350> represents<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.420> Paneth

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
colored red this represents the Paneth

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.050 
colored red this represents the Paneth
cells<00:01:52.539> so<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.049> have<00:01:53.469> padded<00:01:54.159> cells<00:01:54.460> within

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
cells so you have padded cells within

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.630 
cells so you have padded cells within
the<00:01:55.390> gland<00:01:55.719> and<00:01:55.960> these<00:01:56.469> Paneth<00:01:56.950> cells<00:01:56.979> serve

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
the gland and these Paneth cells serve

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.350 
the gland and these Paneth cells serve
an<00:01:57.909> antibacterial<00:01:58.350> function
