00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.140
 Hello, today I propose to do 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.720
 pool with a small seating area for 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.620
 small pupae to us 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:00.510
 need a substrate for vegetables or 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.790
 fruit juice caps wooden 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.430
 beads 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:09.090
 bright paper adhesive tape 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.979
 scrapbooking or colored cardboard ruler 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.310
 pencil scissors hot glue or other 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.850
 adhesive that sticks plastic 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.640
 tubular plastic box round 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.710
 or rectangular 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.110
 shoe box cover when choosing 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.810
 boxes need to pay attention to 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.330
 so that it is the same size 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.460
 height as well as a shoe cover 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.909
 but unfortunately I did not have such 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.510
 my box is a little bit higher 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:46.970
 so I will later stick legs 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:52.979
 to level the level for a start I take 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:56.880
 box and lead it down 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.420
 now I cut this circle with this 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.890
 hand I paste the box 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:09.590
 self-adhesive film now I insert 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.590
 your box turned hole 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.480
 as you can see, I do not have a little match 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.440
 level so that my box was 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:23.120
 steady i glue the caps from here 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.120
 juices as legs 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.250
 if you managed to pick up a pair of barrel 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:35.510
 same size as shoe cover 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.510
 then legs will not be required 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.160
 now my design is enough 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.670
 steady I'll take two ducts 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.660
 cut them off tips less so tips 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.140
 suitable for height glue 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.140
 ladder 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.170
 now the resulting ladder will glue 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.170
 the pool 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.750
 Now we will make small chaise lounges for 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:34.890
 this we use 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:34.890
 We attach the substrate to the chaise lounge legs 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.890
 glue the chaise lounge in the recreation area 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.180

 I get an umbrella glue 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.040
 if you have no scrapbooking paper 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:21.970
 can be replaced with a regular bright color 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:25.660
 I take a cardboard I cut the straw 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.660
 sticking to umbrella 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.560
