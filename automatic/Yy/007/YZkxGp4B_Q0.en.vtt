00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.160
 and art production represents hi my 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.530
 loved ones 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.009
 this issue we will look at the second 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.889
 gyrocopter's ability a rocket and its 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.199
 certain rhymes 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.689
 well let's start from the beginning 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.939
 First anise and damage depends on 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.429
 distance traveled ie for example 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.900
 we put the rocket if it is straight 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:32.390
 close hit but minimal damage 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.520
 we put the rocket again and if on straight 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.340
 far palet i have spent great 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.100
 the distance it will cause the maximum 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:47.300
 possible damage 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:51.850
 apa so on further further further rocket 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.850
 does not break bkb note is logical 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.960
 you can also get away from the rocket by 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:04.780
 winds 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:09.280
 let's get going put the racket waiting 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:13.670
 use wind damage is not applied 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:18.110
 rocket does damage to invisible enemies and 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:26.720
 will become them, too, put a racquet pig 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:30.829
 goes to inviz opa and gets shchi on 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.240
 out of inviz brilliant so now 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:37.189
 let's say your ally has the force to 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.180
 with the help of force stuff you can accelerate 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.549
 rocket 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.549
 Well, not that u are more likely but you can move it 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:49.520
 let me show you 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:52.399
 put a rocket can be or when it is already 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.280
 flying in flight I will see her 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.729
 move accelerate or when it is still standing 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.789
 on earth the same can be done 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.729
 there is worth the racket we move it already on 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.829
 earth 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.670
 Well, such a trick, I do not know why this 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:15.790
 did the shafts what's the logic better 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.790
 Well, the rocket will fly faster. 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:24.250
 more and more for example put a gyrocopter 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:28.569
 rocket on the enemy and howls to put the dome 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:33.850
 the rocket will crash on the dome 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.850
 Vadim Serov show this interesting point 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:44.530
 dome site 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:52.180
 rocket crashes on coupe put like 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:52.180
