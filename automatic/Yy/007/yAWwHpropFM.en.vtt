00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
and they I guess used to be they would

big<00:00:39.960> dangerous<00:00:40.350> ladders<00:00:40.739> or<00:00:40.920> anything<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.340> I

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
big dangerous ladders or anything but I

was<00:00:41.670> doing<00:00:41.910> some<00:00:42.059> research<00:00:42.410> unusually<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:43.440> me

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
was doing some research unusually for me

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.340 
was doing some research unusually for me
and<00:00:44.579> found<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.239> they<00:00:45.420> now<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:46.170> big

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
and found that they now have just big

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.260 
and found that they now have just big
buildings<00:00:46.770> where<00:00:47.190> they<00:00:47.280> keep<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.640> birds<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
buildings where they keep the birds and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.020 
buildings where they keep the birds and
they<00:00:48.539> put<00:00:49.110> their<00:00:49.260> nests<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.710> things<00:00:50.030> there

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
they put their nests and things there

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.760 
they put their nests and things there
are<00:00:51.090> two<00:00:51.180> different<00:00:51.480> kinds<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.170> birds<00:00:52.440> nest

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
are two different kinds of birds nest

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.549 
are two different kinds of birds nest
there's<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.460> white<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.270> red<00:00:54.440> they<00:00:55.440> both

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
there's the white and the red they both

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.590 
there's the white and the red they both
come<00:00:55.739> from<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.949> same<00:00:56.039> bird<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.149> guess<00:00:57.360> one

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
come from the same bird but I guess one

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.979 
come from the same bird but I guess one
has<00:00:57.960> more<00:00:58.350> vitamins<00:00:58.980> or<00:00:59.160> some<00:00:59.370> such<00:00:59.579> nonsense

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
has more vitamins or some such nonsense

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.619 
has more vitamins or some such nonsense
there<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.320> wildly<00:01:02.309> expensive<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.420> was

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
there it is wildly expensive this was

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.390 
there it is wildly expensive this was
not<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.080> imagine<00:01:04.409> they<00:01:04.500> use<00:01:04.619> lower<00:01:04.860> quality

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
not I imagine they use lower quality

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.630 
not I imagine they use lower quality
birds<00:01:05.610> nests<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.360> know<00:01:07.220> maybe<00:01:08.220> like<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
birds nests you know maybe like the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.370 
birds nests you know maybe like the
cross<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.030> bear<00:01:09.240> admit<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> lopsided<00:01:09.930> one

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
cross I bear admit like a lopsided one

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
cross I bear admit like a lopsided one
or<00:01:10.530> something<00:01:10.650> those<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> ones<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.280> they

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
or something those the ones that they

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.010 
or something those the ones that they
use<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.850> because<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.600> only<00:01:12.840> like

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
use for this because this is only like

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.899 
use for this because this is only like
two<00:01:13.229> bucks<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:14.040> bird's<00:01:14.220> nest<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> whole

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
two bucks but bird's nest as a whole

two bucks but bird's nest as a whole
like<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.360> think<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.840> saw<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> picture<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.979> case

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
like I think I saw a picture of a case

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.030 
like I think I saw a picture of a case
that<00:01:17.820> seemed<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.360> 20<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.900> maybe<00:01:19.680> 30

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
that seemed to be like 20 for maybe 30

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.620 
that seemed to be like 20 for maybe 30
birds<00:01:20.369> nests<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> was<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.330> nine<00:01:21.600> hundred

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
birds nests and it was like nine hundred

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.190 
birds nests and it was like nine hundred
dollars<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:23.130> give<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.369> an<00:01:23.460> idea<00:01:23.520> um<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.960> is

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
dollars to give you an idea um this is

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.359
