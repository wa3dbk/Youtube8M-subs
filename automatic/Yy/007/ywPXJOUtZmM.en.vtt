00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
now I wondered what if the temp 7.7 had

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.400 
now I wondered what if the temp 7.7 had
just<00:00:39.059> been<00:00:39.210> released<00:00:39.450> now<00:00:40.020> how<00:00:40.200> would<00:00:40.260> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
just been released now how would it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.740 
just been released now how would it
stack<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:40.890> against<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> new<00:00:41.550> iPad<00:00:41.910> Mini<00:00:41.940> let's

now<00:00:47.370> both<00:00:47.550> tablets<00:00:47.789> are<00:00:48.030> designed<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.539> held

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
now both tablets are designed to be held

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.630 
now both tablets are designed to be held
naturally<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.320> portrait<00:00:49.680> mode<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.399> front

camera is positioned accordingly on both

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.290 
camera is positioned accordingly on both
devices<00:00:52.640> now<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:53.969> they've<00:00:54.149> both

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
devices now because they've both

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.029 
devices now because they've both
manufactured<00:00:54.899> with<00:00:55.050> such<00:00:55.260> precision<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
manufactured with such precision and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.279 
manufactured with such precision and
with<00:00:56.579> high<00:00:56.789> quality<00:00:56.850> materials<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.690> actually

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
with high quality materials is actually

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.689 
with high quality materials is actually
quite<00:00:58.469> hard<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.859> tell<00:00:59.010> them<00:00:59.129> apart

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
quite hard to tell them apart

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.479 
quite hard to tell them apart
truth<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.539> told<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.140> Tab<00:01:01.379> 7.7<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> little

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
truth be told the Tab 7.7 is a little

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.340 
truth be told the Tab 7.7 is a little
easier<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.969> hold<00:01:03.120> because<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> little

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
easier to hold because it is a little

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.950 
easier to hold because it is a little

thin compared to the 7.8 millimeters of
the<00:01:09.299> Tab<00:01:09.479> 7.7<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.500> we're<00:01:10.650> splitting<00:01:10.920> hairs

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070
