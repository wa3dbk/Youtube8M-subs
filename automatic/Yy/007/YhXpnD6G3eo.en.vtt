00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
already with the hammock so we're gonna

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.939 
already with the hammock so we're gonna
go<00:00:30.390> ahead<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.960> go<00:00:31.109> over<00:00:31.140> how<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.470> set<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.859> up

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
go ahead and go over how to set it up

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.950 
go ahead and go over how to set it up
first<00:00:32.700> thing<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.090> find<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.390> couple<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.719> trees

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
first thing you find a couple of trees

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.090 
first thing you find a couple of trees
so<00:00:34.170> we're<00:00:34.260> going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.500> using<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.860> tree

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
so we're going to be using this tree

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.160 
so we're going to be using this tree
right<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.820> then<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.329> about<00:00:36.750> 10<00:00:36.960> feet

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
right here and then just about 10 feet

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.590 
right here and then just about 10 feet
away<00:00:37.460> we're<00:00:38.460> gonna<00:00:38.550> be<00:00:38.700> using<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.390> tree

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
away we're gonna be using that that tree

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.470 
away we're gonna be using that that tree
right<00:00:39.629> over<00:00:40.050> there

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
right over there

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.090 
right over there
so<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.899> open<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> bag<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.980> is

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
so you open up the bag and this is

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.529 
so you open up the bag and this is
exactly<00:00:44.520> how<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.879> comes<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:47.090> you<00:00:48.090> grab<00:00:48.329> out

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
exactly how it comes and you grab out

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.060 
exactly how it comes and you grab out
the<00:00:48.570> first<00:00:48.930> set<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.200> quick<00:00:49.860> ropes<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:52.070> it's

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
the first set of quick ropes and it's

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.279 
the first set of quick ropes and it's
pretty<00:00:53.399> simple<00:00:53.730> all<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:57.289> find

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
pretty simple all you do is you find

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:07.000 
pretty simple all you do is you find
each<00:00:58.440> end<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:01.500> wrap<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.890> around<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.280> tree

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.500 

just<00:01:08.010> once<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.520> then<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.939> loop<00:01:09.270> it's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
just once and then this loop it's

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.310 
just once and then this loop it's
already<00:01:09.780> pre<00:01:09.960> tied<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:12.080> around<00:01:13.080> that

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
already pre tied in around that

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.890 
already pre tied in around that
retaining<00:01:13.890> pin<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:17.240> then<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.360> pull<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.570> top

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
retaining pin and then you pull the top

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.640 
retaining pin and then you pull the top
loop<00:01:19.170> tight<00:01:19.439> against<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.860> tree<00:01:21.350> if<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.409> need

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
loop tight against the tree if you need

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.800 
loop tight against the tree if you need
a<00:01:22.680> razor<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.189> drop<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.390> go<00:01:24.509> ahead<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
a razor to drop it you can go ahead and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.200 
a razor to drop it you can go ahead and
loosen<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.909> but<00:01:27.140> pretty<00:01:28.140> quick<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.560> easy<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
loosen it but pretty quick and easy and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.640 
loosen it but pretty quick and easy and
now<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.390> continues<00:01:31.020> coming<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
now it just continues coming out of the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.200 
now it just continues coming out of the
bag<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:33.530> when<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> middle<00:01:35.210> you'll

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
bag and when we get to the middle you'll

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.600 
bag and when we get to the middle you'll
notice<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.110> bag<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.799> actually<00:01:38.220> attached

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
notice that the bag is actually attached

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.690 
notice that the bag is actually attached
to<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> hammock<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:40.290> once<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.890> start

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
to the hammock so once you start

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.060 
to the hammock so once you start
sleeping<00:01:42.409> don't<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.710> tell<00:01:43.890> that

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
sleeping don't know if you can tell that

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.490 
sleeping don't know if you can tell that
once<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.430> start<00:01:44.670> sleeping<00:01:45.049> this<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.259> hold

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
once you start sleeping this can hold

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.170 
once you start sleeping this can hold
any<00:01:47.280> kind<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.670> gear<00:01:47.939> all<00:01:48.180> your<00:01:48.329> pocket<00:01:48.720> trees

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
any kind of gear all your pocket trees

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.789 
any kind of gear all your pocket trees
water<00:01:51.180> some<00:01:51.509> snacks<00:01:51.810> whatever<00:01:52.049> whatever<00:01:52.619> you

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
water some snacks whatever whatever you

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.520 
water some snacks whatever whatever you
need<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.250> hold<00:01:53.780> we<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:54.960> continue<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.409> over

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
need it to hold we just continue on over

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.670 
need it to hold we just continue on over
to<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:57.659> other<00:01:57.899> tree<00:01:58.200> right<00:01:58.409> over<00:01:58.439> here

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.190 

now<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.740> same<00:02:04.040> thing<00:02:04.690> we<00:02:05.690> just<00:02:05.930> wrap<00:02:06.170> it

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
now the same thing we just wrap it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.220 
now the same thing we just wrap it
around<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.770> tree<00:02:07.450> like<00:02:08.450> so<00:02:09.610> then<00:02:10.610> we<00:02:10.759> connect

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
around the tree like so then we connect

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.600 
around the tree like so then we connect
this<00:02:12.230> pin<00:02:12.590> here<00:02:14.050> inside<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.200> loop<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:16.400> pull

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
this pin here inside the loop you pull

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.090 
this pin here inside the loop you pull
the<00:02:16.730> top<00:02:16.940> loop<00:02:17.150> tight<00:02:17.450> against<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.840> tree

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
the top loop tight against the tree

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.059 
the top loop tight against the tree
now<00:02:19.970> before<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.330> walk<00:02:20.600> away<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:21.140> do<00:02:21.739> want<00:02:22.010> to

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
now before I walk away I do want to

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.699 
now before I walk away I do want to
mention<00:02:22.220> if<00:02:22.790> this<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.569> more<00:02:23.900> narrow<00:02:24.170> or<00:02:24.620> you

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
mention if this is more narrow or you

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.850 
mention if this is more narrow or you
