new-agey<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.530> it's<00:02:34.680> more<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:36.510> can<00:02:36.630> look<00:02:36.810> at

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
new-agey but it's more you can look at

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.330 
new-agey but it's more you can look at

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
it more pragmatically as far as

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.280 
it more pragmatically as far as
behavioral<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.450> thought<00:02:39.630> patterns<00:02:40.050> in<00:02:40.230> the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
behavioral and thought patterns in the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.780 
behavioral and thought patterns in the
psychology<00:02:40.950> rather<00:02:41.160> than<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.580> know<00:02:41.670> the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
psychology rather than you know the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.690 
psychology rather than you know the
esoteric<00:02:42.269> kind<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.050> metaphysical<00:02:43.590> stuff<00:02:43.709> so

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
esoteric kind of metaphysical stuff so

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.900 
esoteric kind of metaphysical stuff so
you<00:02:45.090> know<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:46.470> have<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:47.010> certain<00:02:47.459> outcome

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
you know to have a certain outcome

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.790 
you know to have a certain outcome
whether<00:02:48.330> it's<00:02:48.540> happiness<00:02:48.900> or<00:02:49.230> health<00:02:49.440> or

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
whether it's happiness or health or

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.259 
whether it's happiness or health or
whatever<00:02:50.459> there's<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.850> certain<00:02:51.120> thought

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
whatever there's a certain thought

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.850 
whatever there's a certain thought
patterns<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.780> certain<00:02:52.080> belief<00:02:52.230> pattern<00:02:52.650> that

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
patterns a certain belief pattern that

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.030 
patterns a certain belief pattern that
is<00:02:53.280> likely<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.180> achieve<00:02:54.390> those<00:02:54.840> things<00:02:55.140> so

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
is likely to achieve those things so

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.199 
is likely to achieve those things so
through<00:02:56.280> meditation<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.910> can<00:02:57.030> gain<00:02:57.180> the

through meditation you can gain the

through meditation you can gain the
awareness<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.110> can<00:02:58.260> recondition
