00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hey i wanted to show you today how 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.309
 I apply pigment mixing solution 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.620
 by posting a photo at instagram 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.790
 and i dont know i wanted on everyone 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.130
 case again show 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.250
 I have the kiko mixing solution here 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.199
 then a pigment report from mac that 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.060
 I've been in the sample size, the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.910
 I order both body meets I can 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.080
 link the video and I will 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.949
 take the brush help that is de 55 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.300
 I always do it this way 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.719
 pigments I like that very well 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.399
 a little bit of holes are in there then 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.360
 I believe that a few times out with it 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.860
 a bit of pigment comes out and then 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.600
 if I do that then you have one 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.760
 because there is something inside with the brush 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.940
 go super pure I take my mixing 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.690
 solution so generally I do always there 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.879
 a little something on my hand from 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.500
 small drops 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.789
 Unfortunately, I can not do it differently 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.910
 and as another page here 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.299
 a bit pure makes the nas actual 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:12.030
 into the pigment and then I would 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.740
 to pack that from eyelid what is that and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.030
 if that is not enough wet 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.189
 then you have then in the morning on the hand 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.950
 make the brush gauge the same 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.450
 again moisten page so and then 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.830
 go over it again or new segment 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.380
 I was actually one 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.820
 pretty intense result and if you can 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.250
 that would do in other brush now 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.500
 or with your finger looks bad 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.090
 you will not be such a result 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.079
 You get a brush at the time 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.560
 even less on it I show you 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.970
 the whole time now a shadow of the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.970
 left here that is from douglas one 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:56.250
 on the right is the style file of the douglas 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.500
 is in the color time to go the 20 and 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.479
 they are already quite similar to those 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.520
 Both shimmer pretty much, I think 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.869
 Douglas is a bit lucky for you 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.509
 The carrier is sometimes crumbled 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.129
 I have the new pressed 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.960
 at the instagram picture what I did 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.280
 I had them stalker 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.660
 and is really great came out 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.110
 I'll show you this one here 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.000
 douglas and that if you like that 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.040
 So you do not really see it that way 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.330
 much of it 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.590
 then he looks like this is probably 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
 not even so many of the last 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.630
 maybe that's how I'll take it back here 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.100
 We take the mixing solution on it 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.860
 now the other side of mine 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.910
 Brush for the s is unused 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.870
 actually still dry 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.430
 I first go into the eyeshadow 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.280
 and then I go to the mixing solution 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.910
 and then i would put that on my song 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.910
 apply 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.720
 I hope you see that now 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.970
 a bit more intense what we are about 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.310
 maybe with brush again and maybe 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.450
 then over it again 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.460
 I mostly do not use wet brushes 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.810
 so like to go into the files again because 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.120
 if the brush is really wet then 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.340
 the eyeshadow will be so funny but me 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.690
 hope you can see that now that 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.250
 that is the total difference I am 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.190
 believe the eyeshadow here is also 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.550
 he is for effects you still do 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.600
 So not alone to apply 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.580
 I'll just show it to you now 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.530
 times the style eyeshadow 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.510
 I have a brush here now 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.989
 so a bit diversified 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.770
 minimal only wet again the meeting 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.750
 solution on it first go into the 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.280
 eyeshadow if the brush is still on 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.510
 very little what should be he is yes 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.459
 a bit wet you can see that too 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.080
 already here after donation tried that 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.430
 measure how to do so on the edge 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.209
 so and not over a large area then 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.459
 to take on 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:51.760
 I'll go into the mixing solution for a moment 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:54.610
 and there is the lead already it is still possible 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.370
 times just over it is recommended 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.050
 I now also with the pigments 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.060
 then a second time over it 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.760
 because that's the first shift if 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.450
 that is still wet then that is not so 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.430
 intense and if you then again 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.910
 someone or liter takes up again 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.400
 it always looks over it 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.480
 more intense from the whole now again 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.989
 what that would look like 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.979
 just so i hope you can do that too 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.660
 see a little difference 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.669
 of course I have the wipe test 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.889
 i made the style a bit 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.169
 let it dry 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.550
 and that was wiped off and you can tell 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.289
 definitely with the mixing solution 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.810
 it really stays that way longer 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:34.349
 It's not so easy to get rid of 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.900
 as without the field but then everything 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.129
 a little more 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.020
 And the advantage is with this mixing 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:44.490
 Solution that the pigment is not everywhere 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.229
 flies around and really intense 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.240
 of course I have that too 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.580
 Just do it with this acker 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.590
 spray from rival de loop there you linked 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.090
 synonymous videos synonymous times I have synonymous 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.110
 once made that actually goes well 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.370
 very good why does not need that 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.840
 necessarily the mixing solution 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.969
 However, it has only for euro 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.909
 costs or sauce or five I mean 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:04.199
 I took it with me and tried it 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:05.610
 a try if someone at home you 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.259
 I hope the video was 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.939
 reasonably helpful tasted for you 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.110
 Just a little bit out and me 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:12.590
 hope you turn off and not even there 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.590
 pure her
