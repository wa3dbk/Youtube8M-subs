one would go on the black and it threads

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.630 
one would go on the black and it threads
in<00:01:36.840> only<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.409> way<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.009> can't<00:01:38.340> go<00:01:38.460> wrong

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
in only one way so you can't go wrong

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.810 
in only one way so you can't go wrong
there<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.150> set<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.920> balancer<00:01:41.610> is

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
there I set it on and this balancer is

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.300 
there I set it on and this balancer is
nice<00:01:42.119> because<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.960> will<00:01:43.170> with<00:01:43.740> almost<00:01:44.070> no

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
nice because it will with almost no

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.700 
nice because it will with almost no
movement<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:44.970> all<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.630> rollers<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.350> there<00:01:46.530> are

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
movement at all the rollers in there are

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.160 
movement at all the rollers in there are
very<00:01:47.009> sensitive<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.479> go<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.930> right

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
very sensitive so you can go like right

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.170 
very sensitive so you can go like right
now<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.710> running<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.520> heavy<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:50.909> this

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
now it's running a little heavy on this

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.210 
now it's running a little heavy on this
side<00:01:51.450> what<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:51.990> would<00:01:52.229> basically<00:01:52.470> do<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:52.920> just

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
side what I would basically do is just

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.520 
side what I would basically do is just
take<00:01:53.430> some<00:01:53.670> sandpaper<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.720> underside<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
take some sandpaper on the underside and

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.700 
take some sandpaper on the underside and
sand<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.579> down<00:01:56.640> till<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.570> balances<00:01:58.140> out<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
sand that down till it balances out and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.910 
sand that down till it balances out and
then<00:01:59.399> where<00:02:00.030> people<00:02:00.420> ran<00:02:00.600> into<00:02:00.899> problems<00:02:01.020> you

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
then where people ran into problems you

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.580 
then where people ran into problems you
couldn't<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:03.180> silver<00:02:03.570> prop<00:02:03.869> or<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> black

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
couldn't do the silver prop or the black

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.560 
couldn't do the silver prop or the black
prop<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.130> driver<00:02:05.369> or<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.579> opposite<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.329> was

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
prop the driver or the opposite one was

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.680 
prop the driver or the opposite one was
so<00:02:06.990> all<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.170> do<00:02:07.290> now<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.979> flip<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.670> over<00:02:08.819> with<00:02:09.569> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
so all I do now is flip it over with the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.790 
so all I do now is flip it over with the
silver<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.259> silver

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
silver to silver

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.950 
silver to silver
and<00:02:11.930> tighten<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:12.960> in<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.830> again<00:02:14.720> you're<00:02:15.720> good

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
and tighten it in and again you're good

telling<00:02:21.150> other<00:02:21.450> people<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:22.260> once<00:02:23.100> you

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
telling other people this but once you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.660 
telling other people this but once you
get<00:02:23.400> your<00:02:23.550> balance<00:02:23.990> correct<00:02:24.990> what<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:26.550> know

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
get your balance correct what you know

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.330 
get your balance correct what you know
could<00:02:26.970> still<00:02:27.270> be<00:02:27.420> wrong<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:28.050> what<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:28.770> what<00:02:29.220> up

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
could still be wrong is what if what up

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.670 
could still be wrong is what if what up
the<00:02:29.520> one<00:02:29.700> end<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.030> prop<00:02:30.330> was<00:02:30.660> down<00:02:30.930> here<00:02:31.500> a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the one end of the prop was down here a

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.890 
the one end of the prop was down here a
one<00:02:32.070> was<00:02:32.250> up<00:02:32.460> here<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:33.060> need<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.360> check<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.660> I

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
one was up here you need to check that I

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.140 
one was up here you need to check that I
believe<00:02:34.350> because<00:02:34.590> even<00:02:35.280> though<00:02:35.400> your<00:02:35.580> balance

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
believe because even though your balance

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.660 
believe because even though your balance
you're<00:02:36.720> not<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> perfect<00:02:37.320> spin<00:02:37.920> on<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.490> what

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
you're not a perfect spin on it so what

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.570 
you're not a perfect spin on it so what
I've<00:02:38.820> done<00:02:38.850> on<00:02:39.330> my<00:02:39.870> phantom<00:02:40.440> for<00:02:40.680> example<00:02:41.190> if<00:02:41.430> i

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
I've done on my phantom for example if i

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.460 
I've done on my phantom for example if i
can<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.970> down<00:02:42.090> here<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.840> show<00:02:43.410> you

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
can get it down here and and show you

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.600 
can get it down here and and show you
what<00:02:44.340> i<00:02:44.370> usually<00:02:44.700> do<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.650> sometimes<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:47.400> may

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
what i usually do and sometimes you may

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.850 
what i usually do and sometimes you may
be<00:02:47.670> off<00:02:48.000> from<00:02:48.300> one<00:02:48.540> side<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.110> other<00:02:49.230> but

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
be off from one side to the other but

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.860 
be off from one side to the other but
you<00:02:50.010> can<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.670> can<00:02:50.850> measure<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.240> basically

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
you can you can measure it basically

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.840 
you can you can measure it basically
measure<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.680> make<00:02:52.830> sure<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.280> your<00:02:53.460> your

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
measure to make sure that your your

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.790 
measure to make sure that your your
motors<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.570> everything<00:02:54.990> are<00:02:55.170> at<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.620> right

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
motors and everything are at the right

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.400 
motors and everything are at the right
point<00:02:56.070> but<00:02:56.490> what<00:02:56.640> i<00:02:56.670> do<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:57.300> i<00:02:57.660> bring<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.110> prop

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
point but what i do is i bring the prop

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.910 
point but what i do is i bring the prop
over<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.070> i<00:02:59.580> find<00:02:59.880> a<00:02:59.970> marking<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:00.690> my<00:03:01.080> tape

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
over and i find a marking on my tape

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.130 
over and i find a marking on my tape
measure<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.400> then<00:03:03.030> what<00:03:03.270> i<00:03:03.300> do<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.600> i<00:03:03.900> bring

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
measure and then what i do is i bring

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.350 
measure and then what i do is i bring
the<00:03:04.260> other<00:03:04.410> side<00:03:04.770> around<00:03:05.160> make<00:03:05.910> sure<00:03:05.940> that

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
the other side around make sure that

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.630 
the other side around make sure that
it's<00:03:06.510> hitting<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.840> exact<00:03:07.380> same<00:03:07.650> spot<00:03:07.890> if<00:03:08.370> it

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
it's hitting the exact same spot if it

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.060 
it's hitting the exact same spot if it
isn't<00:03:08.820> I'll<00:03:09.240> figure<00:03:09.690> out<00:03:09.870> after<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.500> test<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.040> few

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
isn't I'll figure out after I test a few

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.450 
isn't I'll figure out after I test a few
which<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.930> wrong<00:03:13.170> side<00:03:13.590> if<00:03:13.950> everything's

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
which is the wrong side if everything's

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.490 
which is the wrong side if everything's
say<00:03:14.790> for<00:03:15.000> example<00:03:15.090> coming<00:03:15.690> at<00:03:15.810> eight<00:03:16.050> inches

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
say for example coming at eight inches

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.920 
say for example coming at eight inches
and<00:03:16.739> this<00:03:17.130> one's<00:03:17.400> coming<00:03:17.850> at<00:03:18.000> seven<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.870> a

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
and this one's coming at seven and a

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.380 
and this one's coming at seven and a
half<00:03:18.959> then<00:03:19.800> I<00:03:20.010> know<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.640> this<00:03:20.760> one<00:03:21.030> needs<00:03:21.239> to

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
half then I know that this one needs to

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.990 
half then I know that this one needs to
be<00:03:21.540> bent<00:03:21.780> up<00:03:22.020> a<00:03:22.170> little<00:03:22.440> bit<00:03:22.620> until<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:23.520> reaches

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
be bent up a little bit until it reaches

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.270 
be bent up a little bit until it reaches
the<00:03:24.150> same<00:03:24.390> amount<00:03:24.570> but<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.350> if<00:03:25.590> you've<00:03:26.040> got<00:03:26.250> a

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
the same amount but that if you've got a

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.340 
the same amount but that if you've got a
balanced<00:03:26.820> prop<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.390> your<00:03:27.750> prop<00:03:28.080> is

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
balanced prop and your prop is

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.000 
balanced prop and your prop is
completely<00:03:29.030> level<00:03:30.080> exactly<00:03:31.080> from<00:03:31.560> side<00:03:31.800> to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
completely level exactly from side to

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.070 
completely level exactly from side to
side<00:03:32.040> you're<00:03:32.850> going<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.090> get<00:03:33.239> an<00:03:33.390> amazing

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
side you're going to get an amazing

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.010 
side you're going to get an amazing
amazing<00:03:34.860> flight<00:03:35.790> first<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.390> all<00:03:36.480> it's<00:03:36.780> going

amazing flight first of all it's going

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.810 
amazing flight first of all it's going
to<00:03:37.110> allow<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.680> batteries<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.430> go<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:38.610> little

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
to allow the batteries to go a little

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.390 
to allow the batteries to go a little
bit<00:03:39.030> better<00:03:39.180> if<00:03:39.540> you're<00:03:39.900> filming<00:03:40.650> or<00:03:41.070> video

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
bit better if you're filming or video

bit better if you're filming or video
eight<00:03:41.670> you're<00:03:42.150> not<00:03:42.270> going<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.480> get<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.810> jello

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
eight you're not going to get the jello

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.160 
eight you're not going to get the jello
effect<00:03:43.260> as<00:03:43.680> much<00:03:44.630> depending<00:03:45.630> on<00:03:45.780> on<00:03:46.050> the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
effect as much depending on on the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.990 
effect as much depending on on the
conditions<00:03:46.680> but<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.190> will<00:03:47.459> definitely<00:03:47.670> help

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
conditions but it will definitely help

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.510 
conditions but it will definitely help
