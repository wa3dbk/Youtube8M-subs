00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 If you stop the car, it's a very 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.670
 common is the kind of mess that gives 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.670
 speak 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.710
 the search pulls into the car more than 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.689
 has doubled in recent times 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.009
 all this in workshops and 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.230
 preparers and what you think is you 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:30.910
 reprogram the injection module to 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.910
 gain power and torque 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.280
 the electronic injection module in general 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.520
 is in the engine safe but depending on the 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.070
 the position changes that are normally 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.600
 reaches the module through cables that 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.809
 are connected to a program of 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.329
 computer besides understanding mechanics 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.789
 you need to know about programming because 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.539
 a change that has effects on the exchange rate 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:59.329
 in the acceleration of the debate on 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:03.109
 chipboard will be around two cars one 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.620
 of them is the a3 2015 that went from 180 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:09.050
 horses in the original to 230 after 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.580
 change of workshop the car is 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.010
 government and wants to know 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.170
 he gave himself too bad that he broke into 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.540
 car broke the exchange 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.210
 the priest who, on the contrary, is happy 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.380
 life with chipboard tracing I never had 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.960
 problem 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.299
 the patric the car like a toilet 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.659
 in the city but also loves to go to the 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.469
 of the so-called three CDs in a day-to-day 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:37.090
 city a normal car at the time it 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:40.250
 precise power is available 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.600
 with twenty thousand reais the patrik managed to 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.600
 almost double the power 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.229
 the work is of the legitimate sucking marten 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.880
 how do you say in popular 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.429
 his car a gesture until he 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.860
 originally with 200 horses in is the 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:58.429
 We took this car to 388 and a half. 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.659
 measured in dynamometer with 58 kg 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.479
 torque force 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.770
 but a project was done and the whole study 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.200
 an upgrade was not a simple thing and 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.380
 counting on the safety springs brakes 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.090
 basically this i walked on the jetta 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.569
 Patrick wants to take a look at what 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.569
 It happened 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:34.370
 the first singer tried second 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:38.390
 reduced only half a pedal 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.610
 tires do not withstand so much force that 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.860
 car leaves ipatinga what is 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.460
 happening I have a lot of power to 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.460
 be a little tack 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.270
 the expectation of seeing the child 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.270
 This nobody can deny 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.920
 now the brake 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.720
 léo caroto the tablets netão shares 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.670
 softer 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.670
 are matches that stick further in the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.650
 tweezers really made a difference 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.650
 between you have a good braking 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.490
 nothing of this conversation pleases henrique 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.500
 who is an engineer and thinks as a manufacturer 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.960
 in industry and in general it is important 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.560
 talking does not work on some 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.770
 pillar fuel consumption 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.020
 the safety of the car's durability and 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.760
 emissions which is 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.410
 regulated by law once you 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.850
 starts making all these modifications 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.130
 in the engine 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.600
 the suspension in the car you end up mocking 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.460
 these parameters 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.800
 taking the car into a legality 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.380
 has a car that consumes 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.680
 more and may even last 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.380
 least modified the car of the kingdom by 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.700
 example lasted two months and the joke 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.860
 it was expensive you had a loss of 54 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.920
 thousand with exchange is also lost to 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.450
 lost car warranty guarantees the 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.120
 Martin thinks the river only had problems 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.100
 because who made the chipboard worked badly 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.930
 an increase of power of the 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.490
 its engine has gained a touch only 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.500
 has not been resized for this. 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.209
 the exchange has another module that module 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.390
 did not receive change information from 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.730
 torque and so he broke the henrique 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.950
 I insisted that I should not opt ​​for 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.350
 It is more interesting to invest a 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.590
 really sporty car 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.600
 but the chipboard staff disagree 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.720
 they do not just come ready 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.020
 because the customer wants more pure taste 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.320
 for vanity for passion is each one has the 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.320
 your reason 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.479
 there is each his point of view 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.819
 the only calibration allowed by the 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.009
 henrique is the automaker's own 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:55.669
 when some companies have the same 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:58.440
 engine with two levels of performance 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.380
 motor power 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.360
 She's there and the car is calculated and comes back. 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.259
 of this power there is a maximum limit 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.819
 for that particular set of the 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.580
 Martyr does not give up 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:14.400
 he defends the right to dream treading 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.259
 background on closed lane is that dream 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.759
 pilot, so I'm going to prepare the 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.919
 I'm going to take this machine to 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.720
 track and I will know my limit is the 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.759
 limit of the machine within the standard 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:29.039
 safety with ambulance circuit 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:30.240
 closed and with all that be you are 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.550
 the one who wants a car totally 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.430
 original are you that want 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:39.409
 car fully training is only judicious 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.409
 Where are you going to use that?
