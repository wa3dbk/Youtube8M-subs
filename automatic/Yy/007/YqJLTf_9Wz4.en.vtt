cool<00:05:26.030> tones<00:05:26.419> I<00:05:26.750> would<00:05:26.930> kind<00:05:27.139> of<00:05:27.229> stick<00:05:27.500> to<00:05:27.740> a

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
cool tones I would kind of stick to a

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.809 
cool tones I would kind of stick to a
few<00:05:29.270> blues<00:05:29.569> and<00:05:29.930> stuff<00:05:30.110> like<00:05:30.259> that<00:05:30.319> in<00:05:30.949> the<00:05:31.460> lip
