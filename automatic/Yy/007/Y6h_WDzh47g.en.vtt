 the horses competed and continue 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.580
 and the grace of their horse speed and pride 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.770
 posture horses breeders in between times 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.539
 competed in the cost of wards 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.820
 in parallel, arguing that their 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.519
 breeding should be spurred in the country 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.109
 no more than two dozen tenants left 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:32.430
 able to improve the breed of Sergey Savin 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.530
 went to the races in the champion everything should 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.930
 be fine from mane to tip 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.210
 tail truth is not complete without stellar 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.960
 manners at the exit of the stables peony loud 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.730
 tells everyone who is number one here 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.649
 nine year old Orlov trotter 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.440
 recognized as the absolute champion of Russia 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.899
 looks great and runs fast 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.329
 good adequate over the years becomes 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.660
 even so have I said in a small side 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.309
 56 merchant also the baby is about to peonies 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.840
 let's say better in the juice itself 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.430
 the very best if all goes well 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.260
 thought on this running career you 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.659
 may finish our beards 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.030
 last year the pylon was estimated from 100 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.250
 thousand dollars in this is even more expensive but 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.470
 runner maker is not for sale 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.780
 what money is the whole selection on it 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.549
 will hold this can cause chance 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.420
 stop such a tenant on tasks 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.070
 make up 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.509
 Well, I will turn happiness in any All-Russian 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.430
 the festival is held to support 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.310
 the most famous Russian breed 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.159
 horses and and led the eagles count over 230 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.060
 years ago but until recently 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.830
 national pride of horse breeding 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.159
 balanced on the verge of hitting 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.000
 red book all over the world she 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:48.170
 really represents Russia everywhere 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.170
 where were they said 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:02:01.380
 now disguises the festival every year 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:03.479
 passes in the new region 78-year-old Lisa 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.789
 Barents in Russia for the first time in quality 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.830
 rider mixed run format 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.750
 suggests random draw 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.619
 so the Slovenian was a little upset that 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.260
 failed to get 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.269
 Orlov trotter for 50 years of career 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.640
 compete on such a horse is not 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.459
 never liked 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.069
 inside and this is a lottery championship total 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.049
 eight horses to whom which will fall first 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.790
 business acquaintance with stroller inventory 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:33.180
 need to customize 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:36.870
 then a stallion and finally nuances of tactics 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.829
 and strategies if the lion is the author maybe I 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.750
 sing 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.820
 And this performance triples first 10 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.400
 second greeting then turn and 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.859
 eight to the final Russian troika on 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.109
 full speed only this combination trot 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.370
 and gallop give maximum speed at 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.260
 maximum comfort 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.400
 I then was one of the main problems 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.370
 collect the required amount 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.079
 participants but a minimum set in order 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.390
 just to hold competitions to 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.370
 the dot can be considered as crucial 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.799
 questions did not even 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.109
 quality breed no run malinovsky 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.150
 more than healthy competition and here 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.720
 bad weather like this but not at all 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.269
 interferes 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.609
 but when the rain is still increasing 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.170
 the organizers first take a pause and then 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.600
 reduce the competitive program 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.410
 the racetrack turns into a lane 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.920
 obstacles 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.200
 before 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.940
 everything passes with a touch of extreme whether 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.190
 demonstration performance or 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.319
 the final race however 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.630
 impressive layer of dirt does not hide 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.670
 joy on the faces of the winners Sergey 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.390
 players were wriggling Argentine Vladimir Hazov
