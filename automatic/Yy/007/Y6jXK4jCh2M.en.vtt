cases and then the fourth mistake that

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.310 
cases and then the fourth mistake that
they<00:02:17.970> make<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.420> they<00:02:18.930> don't<00:02:19.110> know<00:02:19.170> how<00:02:19.290> to

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
they make is they don't know how to

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.860 
they make is they don't know how to

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
do I invest it in the highest growth

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.360 
do I invest it in the highest growth
lowest<00:02:53.040> risk<00:02:53.630> areas<00:02:54.630> based<00:02:55.050> on<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:56.100> know<00:02:56.220> the
