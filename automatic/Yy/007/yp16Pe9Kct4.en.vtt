00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.000 
importantly when you flip you need the
right<00:01:50.840> kind<00:01:50.900> of<00:01:51.230> tip<00:01:51.530> now<00:01:52.370> this<00:01:53.240> rod<00:01:53.540> here<00:01:54.020> 7:11

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
right kind of tip now this rod here 7:11

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.190 
right kind of tip now this rod here 7:11
that's<00:01:55.550> pretty<00:01:55.880> strong<00:01:56.180> but<00:01:56.900> look<00:01:57.020> at<00:01:57.110> the

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
that's pretty strong but look at the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.350 
that's pretty strong but look at the
backbone<00:01:57.590> on<00:01:57.740> that<00:01:57.920> see<00:01:58.400> as<00:01:58.520> my<00:01:58.640> tip<00:01:58.910> starts<00:01:59.210> to

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
backbone on that see as my tip starts to

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.140 
backbone on that see as my tip starts to
bend<00:01:59.480> here<00:02:00.040> right<00:02:01.040> out<00:02:01.190> in<00:02:01.280> this<00:02:01.430> area<00:02:01.820> it's

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
bend here right out in this area it's

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.520 
bend here right out in this area it's
still<00:02:02.420> staying<00:02:02.660> pretty<00:02:02.900> straight<00:02:03.350> that's

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
still staying pretty straight that's

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.430 
still staying pretty straight that's
called<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.860> backbone<00:02:04.210> okay<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:06.200> that

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
called the backbone okay so that

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.530 
called the backbone okay so that
backbone<00:02:07.070> is<00:02:07.280> staying<00:02:07.550> real<00:02:07.880> strong<00:02:08.210> this

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
backbone is staying real strong this

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.300 
backbone is staying real strong this
area<00:02:08.869> from<00:02:09.020> here<00:02:09.320> to<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.560> reel<00:02:09.740> seat<00:02:09.980> is<00:02:10.160> not

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
area from here to the reel seat is not

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.700 
area from here to the reel seat is not
bending<00:02:10.730> much<00:02:10.910> that's<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.080> backbone<00:02:12.290> then

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
bending much that's the backbone then

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.620 
bending much that's the backbone then
you<00:02:12.800> have<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.100> tip<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:14.030> want<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.300> little<00:02:14.540> bit

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
you have the tip you want a little bit

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.160 
you have the tip you want a little bit
of<00:02:14.840> tip<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:16.430> want<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.640> lot<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:16.940> backbone<00:02:17.630> on

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
of tip and you want a lot of backbone on

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.720 
of tip and you want a lot of backbone on
a<00:02:18.200> rod<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:18.920> you're<00:02:19.100> going<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.250> flip<00:02:19.430> with

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
a rod that you're going to flip with

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.810 
a rod that you're going to flip with
very<00:02:20.660> important<00:02:21.170> because<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.650> backbone<00:02:22.190> is

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
very important because the backbone is

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.660 
very important because the backbone is
what<00:02:23.090> gets<00:02:23.300> those<00:02:23.480> fish<00:02:23.690> at<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:23.870> heavy<00:02:24.080> cover

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
what gets those fish at a heavy cover

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.040 
what gets those fish at a heavy cover
picking<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.760> right<00:02:25.940> rod<00:02:26.180> for<00:02:26.510> flipping<00:02:26.750> it's

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
picking the right rod for flipping it's

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.750 
picking the right rod for flipping it's
very<00:02:27.320> very<00:02:27.590> important<00:02:28.010> again<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.220> got<00:02:28.520> down

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
very very important again I got down

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.860 
very very important again I got down
here<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.030> like<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.150> good<00:02:29.360> should<00:02:29.540> be<00:02:29.630> quite<00:02:29.840> a

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
here and like a good should be quite a

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.960 
here and like a good should be quite a
bit<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.320> it's<00:02:30.740> a<00:02:30.800> mistake<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.310> see<00:02:31.490> people<00:02:31.520> make

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
bit and it's a mistake I see people make

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.200 
bit and it's a mistake I see people make
commonly<00:02:33.520> they<00:02:34.520> just<00:02:34.730> bring<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.030> wrong

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
commonly they just bring the wrong

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.360 
commonly they just bring the wrong
sticks<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.840> game<00:02:35.990> it's<00:02:36.470> about<00:02:36.680> like<00:02:36.980> if<00:02:37.190> we

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
sticks to the game it's about like if we

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.720 
sticks to the game it's about like if we
if<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:37.670> gave<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.290> pitching<00:02:39.290> wedge<00:02:39.500> on<00:02:39.860> the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
if I gave you a pitching wedge on the

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.030 
if I gave you a pitching wedge on the
driving<00:02:40.970> range<00:02:41.260> or<00:02:42.260> on<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.500> driving<00:02:42.830> box

there<00:02:43.280> where<00:02:43.580> you're<00:02:43.730> going<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:43.910> tee<00:02:44.060> off<00:02:44.209> from

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
there where you're going to tee off from

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.120 
there where you're going to tee off from
you're<00:02:45.080> not<00:02:45.110> going<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:45.380> hit<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.530> very<00:02:45.770> far<00:02:46.010> so

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
you're not going to hit it very far so

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.370 
you're not going to hit it very far so
it's<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.520> wrong<00:02:46.730> tool<00:02:47.090> for<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.360> job<00:02:47.600> so<00:02:48.290> you

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
it's the wrong tool for the job so you

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.280 
it's the wrong tool for the job so you
need<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.560> have<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.740> big<00:02:49.120> driver<00:02:50.120> Big<00:02:50.810> Bertha

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
again I even like a high speed rail for

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.950 
again I even like a high speed rail for
flipping<00:04:01.070> but<00:04:01.580> picking<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:02.030> right<00:04:02.210> tools<00:04:02.570> and

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
understanding which ones do use for

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.470 
understanding which ones do use for
which<00:04:05.960> application<00:04:06.140> is<00:04:07.010> very<00:04:07.550> important<00:04:08.210> so

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
which application is very important so

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.910
