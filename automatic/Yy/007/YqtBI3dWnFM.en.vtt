so it's two years after aim and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.820 
so it's two years after aim and
evolution<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:06.990> decided<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.500> do<00:01:07.650> is

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
evolution and what we decided to do is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.149 
evolution and what we decided to do is
to<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.850> before<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.840> endings<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.320> just

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
to just before the the endings just just

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.730 
to just before the the endings just just
before<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> player<00:01:11.880> has<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.119> choose<00:01:12.590> there<00:01:13.590> is

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
before the player has to choose there is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.980 
before the player has to choose there is
what<00:01:13.950> we<00:01:13.979> call<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.520> Augmented<00:01:15.060> incident

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
what we call the Augmented incident

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.170 
what we call the Augmented incident
where<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.220> young<00:01:17.310> lamented<00:01:17.610> people<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.060> know

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
where the young lamented people you know

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.580 
where the young lamented people you know
of<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.420> they<00:01:18.780> are<00:01:18.840> crazy<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.320> stuff<00:01:19.409> like

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
of the they are crazy and stuff like

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.679 
of the they are crazy and stuff like
this<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.369> decided<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> start<00:01:21.060> from<00:01:21.150> this

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
this so we decided to start from this

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.960 
this so we decided to start from this
event<00:01:22.020> okay<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.220> now<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.580> two<00:01:23.759> years

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
event okay so it now it's two years

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.240 
event okay so it now it's two years
later<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.869> human<00:01:25.290> evolution<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.979> see<00:01:26.159> it

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
later so human evolution you can see it

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.160 
later so human evolution you can see it
as<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.939> Golden<00:01:27.299> Age<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> young<00:01:27.840> lamented

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
as the Golden Age of the young lamented

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.530 
as the Golden Age of the young lamented
people<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.909> two<00:01:29.909> years<00:01:30.150> later<00:01:30.329> it's

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
people and two years later it's

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.539 
people and two years later it's
completely<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.079> opposite<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.369> young

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
completely the opposite it's the young

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.789 
completely the opposite it's the young
man<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.820> people<00:01:33.000> looks<00:01:33.450> dangerous<00:01:34.140> they<00:01:34.770> are

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
packed in a kind of ghetto you know we

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.749 
packed in a kind of ghetto you know we
