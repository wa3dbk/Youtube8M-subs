infidelity<00:01:30.490> creative<00:01:31.120> I<00:01:31.270> have<00:01:31.480> no<00:01:31.900> idea<00:01:32.380> it's

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
infidelity creative I have no idea it's

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.200 
infidelity creative I have no idea it's
a<00:01:32.800> great<00:01:32.980> question<00:01:33.430> and<00:01:33.580> I<00:01:33.670> think<00:01:33.730> it's<00:01:33.970> quite

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
a great question and I think it's quite

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.090 
a great question and I think it's quite
simple<00:01:34.600> it's<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.230> bit<00:01:35.410> before<00:01:35.740> you<00:01:35.830> have<00:01:36.010> to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
simple it's the bit before you have to

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.130 
simple it's the bit before you have to
start<00:01:36.280> lying<00:01:36.610> but<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:36.940> think<00:01:37.270> with<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.780> films

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
start lying but I think with the films

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.900 
start lying but I think with the films
that<00:01:38.200> last<00:01:38.500> night<00:01:38.740> deals<00:01:39.040> with<00:01:39.250> but<00:01:39.760> yeah<00:01:39.880> I

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
that last night deals with but yeah I

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.490 
that last night deals with but yeah I
should<00:01:40.180> imagine<00:01:40.360> so<00:01:40.570> you're<00:01:40.840> right<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.320> right

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
should imagine so you're right the right

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.050 
should imagine so you're right the right
you<00:01:41.680> do<00:01:41.830> have<00:01:41.980> to<00:01:42.070> be<00:01:42.160> very<00:01:42.340> creative<00:01:42.550> with<00:01:42.820> you

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
you do have to be very creative with you

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.540 
you do have to be very creative with you
