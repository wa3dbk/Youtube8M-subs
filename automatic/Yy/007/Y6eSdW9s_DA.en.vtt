00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.590 
ISI canister and I split the cherries in
half<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.430> then<00:03:24.519> I<00:03:24.609> soaked<00:03:24.910> them<00:03:25.090> in<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.329> little

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
half and then I soaked them in a little

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.720 
half and then I soaked them in a little
bit<00:03:25.690> of<00:03:25.720> water<00:03:25.989> just<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.500> add<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:27.010> up<00:03:27.430> their

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
bit of water just to add to up their

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.879 
bit of water just to add to up their
water<00:03:28.000> content<00:03:28.269> because<00:03:29.139> if<00:03:29.290> any<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.769> have

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
water content because if any of you have

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.949 
water content because if any of you have
ever<00:03:29.980> had<00:03:30.190> carbonated<00:03:30.790> grapes<00:03:31.060> things<00:03:31.810> that

ever had carbonated grapes things that
carbonate<00:03:32.380> you<00:03:32.950> want<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.190> have<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.310> lot<00:03:33.519> of

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
carbonate you want to have a lot of

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.449 
carbonate you want to have a lot of
water<00:03:33.819> content<00:03:34.299> to<00:03:34.359> them<00:03:34.630> so<00:03:35.350> then<00:03:35.650> I<00:03:35.680> put<00:03:36.370> them

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
water content to them so then I put them

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.309 
water content to them so then I put them
in<00:03:36.579> my<00:03:36.609> ice<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:37.299> I<00:03:37.359> charge<00:03:37.630> them<00:03:37.870> with<00:03:37.930> two

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
in my ice I and I charge them with two

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
and I am using a look here now some

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.770 
and I am using a look here now some
people<00:04:38.640> think<00:04:38.880> about<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.180> old<00:04:39.330> fashioned<00:04:39.660> is

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
people think about the old fashioned is

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.420 
people think about the old fashioned is
sugar<00:04:40.200> just<00:04:40.350> means<00:04:40.560> pretty<00:04:41.040> much<00:04:41.130> anything

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
sugar just means pretty much anything

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.580 
sugar just means pretty much anything
sweet<00:04:41.850> you<00:04:42.180> can<00:04:42.300> argue<00:04:42.510> that<00:04:42.660> Manhattan<00:04:43.230> is<00:04:43.410> a

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
sweet you can argue that Manhattan is a

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.950 
sweet you can argue that Manhattan is a
variation<00:04:43.860> of<00:04:44.250> an<00:04:44.700> old<00:04:44.850> fashioned<00:04:45.240> so<00:04:45.690> I'm

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
variation of an old fashioned so I'm

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.740 
variation of an old fashioned so I'm
going<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.110> use<00:04:46.230> creme<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.500> bet<00:04:47.480> just<00:04:48.480> because

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
going to use creme you bet just because

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.270 
going to use creme you bet just because
it's<00:04:48.990> not<00:04:49.080> because<00:04:49.290> that<00:04:49.410> reporter<00:04:49.860> my

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
it's not because that reporter my

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.850 
it's not because that reporter my
spirits<00:04:50.730> in<00:04:51.330> st.<00:04:51.570> Germain<00:04:51.810> just<00:04:52.560> because<00:04:52.770> I

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
spirits in st. Germain just because I

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.930 
spirits in st. Germain just because I
happen<00:04:53.130> to<00:04:53.160> have<00:04:53.250> free<00:04:53.490> access<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.910> it<00:04:54.030> okay<00:04:54.720> so

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
happen to have free access to it okay so

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.840 
happen to have free access to it okay so
so<00:04:56.940> we<00:04:57.060> use<00:04:57.300> so<00:04:58.080> exactly<00:04:58.530> so<00:04:58.650> we<00:04:58.770> put<00:04:59.460> in<00:04:59.580> three

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
so we use so exactly so we put in three

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.910 
so we use so exactly so we put in three
spirits<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.570> make<00:05:00.690> really<00:05:00.990> one<00:05:01.140> spirit<00:05:01.500> we've

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
spirits to make really one spirit we've

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.940 
spirits to make really one spirit we've
added<00:05:02.160> our<00:05:02.340> sugar<00:05:02.640> and<00:05:03.470> still<00:05:04.470> on<00:05:04.590> enough<00:05:04.800> for

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
added our sugar and still on enough for

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.400 
added our sugar and still on enough for
me<00:05:05.040> we<00:05:05.220> have<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.460> add<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.700> bitters<00:05:05.940> but<00:05:06.720> you

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
me we have to add the bitters but you

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.810 
me we have to add the bitters but you
know<00:05:07.560> it'd<00:05:07.800> be<00:05:07.830> boring<00:05:08.040> if<00:05:08.340> I<00:05:08.400> just<00:05:08.550> did<00:05:08.670> one

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
know it'd be boring if I just did one

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.900 
know it'd be boring if I just did one
bitter<00:05:09.240> so<00:05:09.540> we're<00:05:09.690> going<00:05:09.780> to<00:05:09.840> do<00:05:09.960> one<00:05:10.910> aromatic

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
bitter so we're going to do one aromatic

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.360 
bitter so we're going to do one aromatic
bitters<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:12.510> chocolate<00:05:13.050> mole<00:05:13.200> egg<00:05:13.380> as<00:05:14.250> soon

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
bitters and chocolate mole egg as soon

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.620 
bitters and chocolate mole egg as soon
as<00:05:14.490> I<00:05:14.550> fell<00:05:14.730> meal<00:05:14.880> let's<00:05:15.150> just<00:05:15.270> pretend<00:05:15.420> that

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
as I fell meal let's just pretend that

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.000 
as I fell meal let's just pretend that
this<00:05:15.780> matters

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.680 

so<00:05:21.010> we<00:05:21.100> have<00:05:21.190> quite<00:05:21.370> a<00:05:21.400> complex<00:05:21.760> um<00:05:22.120> we<00:05:22.510> gotta

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
so we have quite a complex um we gotta

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.960 
so we have quite a complex um we gotta
put<00:05:22.900> a<00:05:22.930> complex<00:05:23.670> old-fashioned<00:05:24.670> happening

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
put a complex old-fashioned happening

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.300 
put a complex old-fashioned happening
right<00:05:25.090> now<00:05:25.240> I<00:05:25.300> think<00:05:25.750> we'd<00:05:25.840> all<00:05:25.930> agree<00:05:25.990> yes<00:05:26.650> yes

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
right now I think we'd all agree yes yes

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.360 
right now I think we'd all agree yes yes
complex<00:05:27.880> yes<00:05:28.090> okay<00:05:28.660> not<00:05:29.260> good<00:05:29.530> enough

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
complex yes okay not good enough

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.490 
complex yes okay not good enough
must<00:05:31.060> make<00:05:31.210> it<00:05:31.270> more<00:05:31.480> complex<00:05:31.900> so<00:05:32.350> what<00:05:32.440> I

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
must make it more complex so what I

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.700 
must make it more complex so what I
decide<00:05:32.710> to<00:05:32.740> do<00:05:32.980> is<00:05:33.220> let's<00:05:33.700> take<00:05:33.940> this<00:05:34.180> and
