00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.990
This video introduces the new web BLAST results
page available in October 2012.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.410
Subsequent videos will go into more depth
about how to use certain features and programs.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.599
Some of the features that I will discuss here
are:

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.110
Customizable table in the Descriptions section
Navigation within the page

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.490
Download the aligned region of a hit in FASTA
format

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.760
Display a new Graphics view of the aligned
region

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.230
Faster loading of the results
Links to other resources

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.160
Let’s take a look at the new Descriptions
section.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.719
First, note that more of the description,
or definition line, is available.

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.219
In addition, this table can be customized
to remove columns you may not need; use the

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.420
gear icon to make your selections.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.929
For example, after removing the accessions,
I can now see which transcript variants were

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.069
found.

00:00:55.069 --> 00:01:00.100
The number of descriptions displayed is still
limited by the setting in “Max target sequences”

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.739
on the submit page, which is 100 by default.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.700
To view a specific alignment within this page,
you would click on the description, or you

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.700
can click on Alignments.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.310
I’ll stay here in the Descriptions section,
and notice that many options are unavailable,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.479
see the grayed out text, until at least one
description is selected.

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.719
One of the most important new features is
that you can now download only the aligned

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.350
region of the subject (hit) sequence.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.200
And, although not new, these columns can be
sorted by clicking the column name.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.770
The Graphics link takes you to a Sequence
Viewer display of the alignment that may include

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:47.509
known features on the query, such as the exon
structure, protein product, and SNPs.

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.390
The alignments are represented here.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.460
You will only see such features when using
an NCBI accession or gi identifier as your

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.270
query, particularly RefSeq identifiers.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.049
Use this help icon to access Sequence Viewer
help, including video tutorials.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.470
Be aware that the Graphics links from the
Alignments section, which I’ll move to next,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.680
show features of the hit sequence, not the
query.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.100
I’m now in the Alignments section.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.569
Here, the Download menu acts only on this
one alignment.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.010
In cases where more than one alignment is
made to the subject sequence, you can sort

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.120
the alignments, and the different Graphics
or GenBank links optimize the intial view

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.950
for either the whole subject sequence or for
the specific alignment.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.580
A key change is that the results page will
often load into your browser more quickly,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.379
because not all alignments are initially loaded.

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.610
As you scroll down the page, more alignments
are loaded, or clicking on a hit the Description

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.010
section will load that alignment if it is
not initially displayed.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.800
Finally, the icons representing linkouts to
other NCBI resources are now links in the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.470
Related Information section.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.689
