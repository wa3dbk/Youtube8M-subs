00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
we're going to look at cropping a few of

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
we're going to look at cropping a few of
these<00:00:18.320> to<00:00:18.530> make<00:00:18.650> them<00:00:18.800> stronger<00:00:20.770> we<00:00:21.770> may<00:00:21.950> look

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
these to make them stronger we may look

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.640 
these to make them stronger we may look
at<00:00:22.430> a<00:00:22.460> bit<00:00:22.760> of<00:00:22.880> contrast<00:00:23.420> issues<00:00:23.990> but<00:00:24.470> she's

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
at a bit of contrast issues but she's

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.970 
at a bit of contrast issues but she's
got<00:00:24.860> pretty<00:00:25.040> good<00:00:25.280> on<00:00:25.490> her<00:00:25.610> contrast<00:00:26.120> actually

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
got pretty good on her contrast actually

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.430 
got pretty good on her contrast actually
and<00:00:28.450> we've<00:00:29.450> talked<00:00:29.720> about<00:00:29.840> how<00:00:30.140> to<00:00:30.200> present

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
and we've talked about how to present

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.290 
and we've talked about how to present
better<00:00:30.980> so<00:00:31.310> we<00:00:31.400> really<00:00:31.610> understand<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.119> good

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
better so we really understand the good

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.579 
better so we really understand the good
stuff<00:00:32.570> she's<00:00:32.780> got<00:00:32.960> here<00:00:33.320> so<00:00:34.390> she<00:00:35.390> does<00:00:36.320> have

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:36.589 
stuff she's got here so she does have

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:39.459 
stuff she's got here so she does have
some<00:00:36.620> 3d<00:00:37.359> with<00:00:38.359> some<00:00:38.480> interesting<00:00:38.660> texture

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
some 3d with some interesting texture

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.200 
some 3d with some interesting texture
that's<00:00:39.800> great<00:00:40.070> she's<00:00:40.280> got<00:00:40.460> some<00:00:40.609> color<00:00:40.879> work

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
that's great she's got some color work

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.329 
that's great she's got some color work
with<00:00:41.480> some<00:00:41.629> interesting<00:00:42.019> ideas<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:42.649> it<00:00:43.190> won't

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
with some interesting ideas and it won't

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.040 
with some interesting ideas and it won't
take<00:00:43.460> too<00:00:43.519> much<00:00:43.789> effort<00:00:43.850> to<00:00:44.210> explain<00:00:44.809> that<00:00:44.989> a

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
take too much effort to explain that a

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.189 
take too much effort to explain that a
little<00:00:45.109> bit<00:00:46.659> she's<00:00:47.659> got<00:00:47.839> a<00:00:47.870> piece<00:00:48.079> you<00:00:48.170> can

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
little bit she's got a piece you can

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.069 
little bit she's got a piece you can
easily<00:00:48.620> get<00:00:49.190> a<00:00:49.219> bigger<00:00:49.460> print<00:00:49.819> of<00:00:50.059> that<00:00:50.420> won't

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
easily get a bigger print of that won't

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.079 
easily get a bigger print of that won't
be<00:00:51.199> too<00:00:51.379> hard<00:00:51.559> to<00:00:51.679> clean<00:00:51.920> up<00:00:54.280> this<00:00:55.280> one<00:00:55.699> we<00:00:55.940> can

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
be too hard to clean up this one we can

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.639 
be too hard to clean up this one we can
probably<00:00:56.300> make<00:00:56.659> look<00:00:56.960> just<00:00:57.199> a<00:00:57.289> little<00:00:57.530> better

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
probably make look just a little better

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.540 
probably make look just a little better
by<00:00:57.890> how<00:00:58.039> we<00:00:58.100> crop<00:00:58.489> it<00:00:58.699> this<00:00:59.539> one<00:00:59.809> as<00:01:00.109> well<00:01:00.550> you

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
by how we crop it this one as well you

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.829 
by how we crop it this one as well you
know<00:01:01.639> this<00:01:01.760> is<00:01:01.909> a<00:01:01.940> good<00:01:02.089> drawing<00:01:02.329> she's<00:01:02.629> got

could see what you could do to be able
to<00:01:48.890> go<00:01:49.009> to<00:01:49.070> one<00:01:49.280> what<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:50.359> need<00:01:50.539> life<00:01:50.840> drawing

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
to go to one what you need life drawing

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.490 
to go to one what you need life drawing
for<00:01:51.289> illustration<00:01:52.189> okay<00:01:52.909> so<00:01:52.969> and<00:01:53.659> it<00:01:53.780> has<00:01:54.350> to

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
for illustration okay so and it has to

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.120 
for illustration okay so and it has to
be<00:01:54.530> strong<00:01:55.009> life<00:01:55.460> drawing<00:01:55.729> okay<00:01:56.409> so<00:01:57.409> that's

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
be strong life drawing okay so that's

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.069 
be strong life drawing okay so that's
what's<00:01:58.909> missing<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.390> maybe<00:01:59.659> something

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
what's missing and maybe something

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.779 
what's missing and maybe something
that's<00:02:00.350> just<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.649> little<00:02:00.829> more<00:02:00.950> graphic<00:02:01.399> if<00:02:01.609> you

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
that's just a little more graphic if you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:02.410 
that's just a little more graphic if you
could<00:02:01.939> pull<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.119> off

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
could pull that off

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.260 
could pull that off
