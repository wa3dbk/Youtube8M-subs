ready to plug into my computer for a

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.009 
ready to plug into my computer for a
vision<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.280> recognize<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:14.880> just<00:02:15.840> gonna

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
vision to recognize it so just gonna

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:22.670 
vision to recognize it so just gonna
pull<00:02:16.620> again<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:20.360> now<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.140> plug<00:02:22.350> is<00:02:22.500> in

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680

gonna<00:02:24.570> wait<00:02:24.720> for<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.079> computer<00:02:25.260> recognizing

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
gonna wait for the computer recognizing

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.380 
gonna wait for the computer recognizing
and<00:02:27.570> there<00:02:27.810> we<00:02:27.870> go<00:02:28.519> so<00:02:29.519> right<00:02:29.640> now<00:02:29.760> evasion<00:02:30.209> has

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
I'm gonna go to my device and let's see

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.020 
I'm gonna go to my device and let's see
what<00:03:11.190> we<00:03:11.250> can<00:03:11.280> do<00:03:12.260> yes<00:03:13.260> lights<00:03:13.500> out<00:03:13.650> lock

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.670 

and<00:03:17.030> we<00:03:17.420> should<00:03:17.660> have<00:03:17.870> this<00:03:18.080> new<00:03:18.350> jailbreak

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
and we should have this new jailbreak

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.470 
and we should have this new jailbreak
but<00:03:18.980> it<00:03:19.100> apparently<00:03:19.340> here<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:19.940> go<00:03:20.060> jewelry

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
but it apparently here you go jewelry

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.870 
but it apparently here you go jewelry
right<00:03:20.750> here<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.290> as<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.740> Bayesian<00:03:22.070> icon<00:03:22.400> so

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
right here and as the Bayesian icon so

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.120 
right here and as the Bayesian icon so
we're<00:03:23.540> gonna<00:03:23.660> press<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.290> all<00:03:24.740> the<00:03:24.830> type<00:03:24.980> it

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
we're gonna press it and all the type it

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.350 
we're gonna press it and all the type it
once<00:03:25.280> they<00:03:25.460> said<00:03:25.960> so<00:03:26.960> we<00:03:27.290> can<00:03:27.410> go<00:03:27.530> back<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.920> this

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
once they said so we can go back to this

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.390 
once they said so we can go back to this
and<00:03:29.360> we<00:03:29.480> see<00:03:29.690> that<00:03:29.870> it's<00:03:30.470> basically<00:03:30.710> finishing

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
and we see that it's basically finishing

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.780 
and we see that it's basically finishing
up<00:03:31.550> injecting<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.990> remount<00:03:33.290> payload<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.980> we

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
up injecting the remount payload and we

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.680 
up injecting the remount payload and we
should<00:03:34.940> be<00:03:35.060> done<00:03:35.180> soon

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
should be done soon

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.240 
should be done soon
all<00:03:36.590> right<00:03:36.710> now<00:03:36.830> I've<00:03:36.950> actually<00:03:37.040> just

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
all right now I've actually just

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.010 
all right now I've actually just
unplugged<00:03:37.820> my<00:03:37.970> device<00:03:38.270> from<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.510> computer

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
unplugged my device from the computer

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.290 
unplugged my device from the computer
and<00:03:39.140> I'm<00:03:39.860> seeing<00:03:40.100> that<00:03:40.340> it's<00:03:40.940> going<00:03:41.150> through

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
and I'm seeing that it's going through

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.030 
and I'm seeing that it's going through
this<00:03:41.360> process<00:03:41.810> on<00:03:41.960> the<00:03:42.080> iPad<00:03:42.380> actually<00:03:42.800> it's

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
this process on the iPad actually it's

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.600 
this process on the iPad actually it's
saying<00:03:43.280> done<00:03:43.580> continuing<00:03:44.300> reboot<00:03:44.660> so<00:03:45.650> it's

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
saying done continuing reboot so it's

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.120 
saying done continuing reboot so it's
