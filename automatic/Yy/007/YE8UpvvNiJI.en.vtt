players<00:00:39.900> which<00:00:40.900> brought<00:00:41.199> me<00:00:41.230> to<00:00:41.410> thought<00:00:41.920> that

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
players which brought me to thought that

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.160 
players which brought me to thought that
maybe<00:00:42.460> they're<00:00:42.760> not<00:00:42.790> all<00:00:42.970> that<00:00:43.449> good<00:00:43.720> maybe

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
maybe they're not all that good maybe

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.000 
maybe they're not all that good maybe
they<00:00:44.410> have<00:00:44.620> a<00:00:44.650> trick<00:00:45.100> so<00:00:45.430> I<00:00:45.960> started

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
they have a trick so I started

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.110 
they have a trick so I started
experimenting<00:00:48.010> on<00:00:48.280> different<00:00:48.670> things<00:00:48.910> and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
experimenting on different things and

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.970 
experimenting on different things and
found<00:00:49.360> out<00:00:49.629> that<00:00:49.660> this<00:00:50.019> might<00:00:50.320> be<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.739> way<00:00:50.920> you

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
found out that this might be the way you

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.570 
found out that this might be the way you
can<00:00:51.430> improve<00:00:51.760> your<00:00:52.030> range<00:00:52.530> quickly<00:00:53.530> in<00:00:53.830> this

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
can improve your range quickly in this

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.180 
can improve your range quickly in this
case<00:00:54.850> only<00:00:55.089> three<00:00:55.510> minutes<00:00:55.870> of<00:00:56.080> work<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:56.650> no

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
case only three minutes of work and no

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.600 
case only three minutes of work and no
practice<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:59.260> increase<00:00:59.799> your<00:00:59.830> range<00:01:00.129> up<00:01:00.400> to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
practice and increase your range up to

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.750 
practice and increase your range up to
in<00:01:00.699> this<00:01:00.820> case<00:01:01.120> a<00:01:01.150> high<00:01:01.540> G<00:01:02.220> first<00:01:03.220> we<00:01:03.460> start

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
in this case a high G first we start

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.690
