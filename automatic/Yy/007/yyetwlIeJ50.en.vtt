00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.710

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.470
 with the cuckoo I want to tell you that this 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.630
 it works for version 1.7 up not 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.250
 I tried it the 1.8 but as always 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.870
 I say I invite you all to each 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.789
 break west permanent butler to go 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.800
 testing it as I go 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.120
 doing first of all guys and arrivals 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.010
 I hope you can support me very much 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.870
 aesthetic with the little hand above that is 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.940
 it really does not cost anything anymore 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.370
 very much and I hope that you can also 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.960
 leave a comment to know what else 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.839
 tricks hides our dearest 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.309
 minecraft and be able to teach it is to say that 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.870
 this trick was found thanks to a 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.850
 Spanish that under the description I will leave 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.800
 his video so you can go visit him 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.600
 good what he does once all said 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.550
 this we are going to start is to say that this 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.649
 tube kitchens through a command that 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.300
 really yes it is very, very useful 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.230
 for all the people who are most may 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.000
 what is to say 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.530
 creators of maps and good if a 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.570
 person wants to do it on your map 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.730
 your rival the good can do it without 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.620
 no problem but I repeat only 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.990
 can be done with a command goes by 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.270
 there the tag according to boys and girls 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.580
 let's start to differentiate the types 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.860
 of chests worth we have the normal chest 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.850
 that this is the coffer of 27 spaces 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.560
 27 is the only thing and we have the chest 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.110
 so to speak the double chest that has 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.850
 only 54 space as you are seeing vale 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.310
 have the spaces that I have told them 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.870
 all and then we have the 80's and a 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.210
 space that is the triple chest that is 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.160
 really amazing that fits in what 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.740
 we want social imagine you go 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.930
 filling all this without stopping 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.120
 objects not only diamond everything 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.500
 that we can and it's really useful then 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.020
 you will be asking good this as 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.090
 it happens basically it's going well it's good it's 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.820
 for a command that we're going to see around here 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.830
 up we are going to uncover all this and here 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.180
 there is another girl the girl remove all this if 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.580
 you allow me, I 'm still explained so that 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.620
 You can see it more quietly there 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.780
 we have all this we remove it is so 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.330
 so so perfect because basically this 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.950
 it happens because when you put a command it 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.959
 join will play the two chests 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.069
 it becomes a clichÃ© and then it happens 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.900
 this for example I'm seeing here that 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.220
 this is chest are normal there is no 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.540
 no kind of generic but I've 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.220
 thrown around but you take them for 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.870
 cure and I put you then nothing can 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.530
 basically teach us how this is done 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.810
 ok let's put two blocks good two 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.480
 chests and tell you that if we put here 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.090
 and we put this command the set block the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.800
 pads that are here because it's not going to 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.320
 to work 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.120
 it does not work well it works but this 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.260
 chest not not seen but we do not 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.770
 interesting because we want 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.970
 have it in that position you see it does not work 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.860
 the way I want it I 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.060
 I want the congress to be like that then 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.040
 what we will do the following we remove 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.640
 this chest this and this and we go back to 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.170
 place it 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.170
 then we place ourselves in this part 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.880
 they put the block the armadillos and 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.460
 we put this then chests and it 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.630
 will see and so we have the triple chest in 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.740
 the position that we want but 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.780
 good if we want to have it in this 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.970
 position is good you 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.650
 welcome to your position the only thing 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.780
 bad that you are a lawyer and you are going to see this 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.040
 ahead but well I'll explain it 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.220
 more or less how do you put this 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.260
 I'm basically seeing that it's set blog 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.490
 and to put the we put space for 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.990
 put the yellow ones we will have to give 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.260
 control alt and number four for two 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.200
 times 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.780
 and by then we put 54 space 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.390
 one that is the air of the chest that is the 54 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.829
 and one that we only want one block I do not know 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.209
 if this is going to work in plan we put 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.799
 here 3 for example no no it's not going to 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.450
 work but well let's go back if we can 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.400
 put them to similar that is that you can 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.930
 do everything and nothing boys and girls there 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.150
 you are seeing warning to use ideas 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.440
 numerical will not be admitted in the future 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.739
 please use the name as you know 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.700
 how to look craft two dots that is not 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.210
 for example I think that also if 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.060
 we put instead of 54 we put test 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.220
 I mean, I think if we're not going to do the 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.440
 test not since we are here we are in 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.810
 the cheat map now let's do the 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.670
 test and if it works perfectly without 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.080
 no kind of problem and many 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.430
 people are asking me the idea of 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.900
 this map but I love this 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.970
 map I want to leave it private for me 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.350
 someday I will put it but for the moment 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.060
 I 'm going to put it because I love it 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.610
 in the future in a future future future 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.650
 very far so I'll put it and nothing guys 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.360
 and girls here ends the episode of 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.820
 triple chest I hope you can 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.560
 support a lot with the little hand up 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.080
 that really costs nothing and we 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.570
 we'll see in the next trick and remember 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.710
 that tonight there are many direct
