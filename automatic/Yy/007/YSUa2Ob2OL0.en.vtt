00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.040
 Hi everyone guys here for fans and I know 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.470
 I did not feel it for a while 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.610
 but I saw your requests up su 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.830
 youtube 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.750
 I saw what you want hashmi looks like and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.590
 trinity I'm working on it right now 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.050
 see I've already put these to work 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.580
 two pieces I have already created the helmet e 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.590
 so next videos will be 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:38.710
 focus on that, I'm sorry though 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.290
 I was already under construction working in the 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.070
 balkans so for now though these 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:49.510
 two before making more videos 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.370
 then let's start with the usual 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.360
 history in the sense that we are going to see each other 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.250
 as oberon then I mean as you see 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.360
 here these are his colors 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.829
 original 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.180
 I haven't changed to me yet 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:09.660
 aesthetically enough like we say 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.660
 but let's focus on fashions then 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.899
 these are his usual three 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:21.280
 four skills then punishment house of 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:26.009
 accounts for consecrated land and healing as 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:30.220
 you see a bit of a mixture between 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:35.350
 healer and destroyer in the sense that 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:38.049
 earth consecrated ground and reckoning 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.460
 they manage to kill quite a lot 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.750
 people while healing is more useful to 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.009
 survive in the sense that in the moment 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.080
 where we're going to have little life thanks 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.780
 to healing 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.619
 lari we will acquire all then but 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:01.479
 let's look at skills as usual 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:03.820
 then punishment exorcises the energy 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.430
 negative from an enemy and projects it as 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.440
 kinetic energy sphere damaging 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:18.010
 the target the enemies hit by 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:19.060
 spheres ok then we have healing every e 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.330
 of energy 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.860
 they flow towards oberon and his allies 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.040
 regenerating health with the passage of 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.040
 time 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.570
 consecrated ground sanctifies the ground 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.100
 front oberon with a little virtuoso 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.570
 inflicting damage to every enemy that is 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.570
 located in the squares 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.490
 politics 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.920
 showdown lifts all enemies 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.380
 surrounding towards the heavens then hurl them 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.480
 on the ground to condemn the killed enemies 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.560
 in this way they can make appear 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.560
 a sphere of health 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.480
 ok as you can see, that's enough 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.910
 however useful as a life support 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.740
 we say for the other world friends 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:55.710
 because however general health spheres 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:04:00.000
 to healing that helps other war 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:02.250
 frame to heal and then we say it is 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.610
 quite useful in battle if yes 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:09.720
 plays with other players but like al 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:13.050
 usually we go to see the fashions that I 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.580
 personally put then how to 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.790
 usually rejected I also recommend it 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.670
 because that is why it is not so dark therefore 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.670
 the more we are going to increase it better 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.890
 then as usual extensions also 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.320
 because thanks to showdowns 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.740
 we will reach the enemies more 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.660
 far away and then to kill more 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.840
 flow as usual for the obvious reason 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.640
 that at least we can use more skill la 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.670
 usual classroom fashion in the sense that at least 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:47.400
 as you can see I am at 13 but I can already 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:51.440
 put all these optimization fads 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:57.300
 as usual because it will cost less 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:59.250
 obviously our skills and then second 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.280
 me is another pretty useful fashion is 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.980
 vigor that I recently found that 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.260
 increases the capacity of the 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.520
 shield and health 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.680
 so this is also not to be 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:16.140
 underestimate it and then for those for whom 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.260
 it can be safer and whoever maybe 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.310
 to exist more during 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.680
 maybe during a game 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:28.760
 put vitality 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.570
 that's fine then this is oberon 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.990
 I hope you like it and the next video 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.990
 boys
