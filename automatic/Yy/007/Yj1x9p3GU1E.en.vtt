what the insular have Funchal the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.840 
what the insular have Funchal the
character<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.820> mustn't<00:01:12.299> um<00:01:12.570> I

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
character is and so you mustn't um I

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.249 
character is and so you mustn't um I
guess<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.210> mean<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.509> say<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.930> mustn't

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.039 
guess what I mean to say is you mustn't
take<00:01:16.409> me<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.740> literally<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.880> inn<00:01:21.360> there's<00:01:21.900> an

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
take me to literally the inn there's an

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.179 
take me to literally the inn there's an
interesting<00:01:22.290> thing<00:01:22.619> that's<00:01:22.740> happening<00:01:23.130> with

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
interesting thing that's happening with

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.010 
interesting thing that's happening with
the<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.570> has<00:01:24.750> what<00:01:24.990> is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the a and that is that it has what is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.630 
the a and that is that it has what is
called<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.560> pulled<00:01:25.950> curve<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:29.250> that's<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
called a pulled curve so that's the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.789 
called a pulled curve so that's the
first<00:01:29.880> stroke<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> maybe<00:01:31.259> goes<00:01:31.470> around

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
first stroke of the a maybe goes around

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.310 
first stroke of the a maybe goes around
to<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.070> there<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.420> then<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.200> goes

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
to about there and then and then it goes

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.789 
to about there and then and then it goes
like<00:01:34.530> this

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
like this

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.749 
like this
it's<00:01:35.369> basically<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.280> comes<00:01:38.490> around

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
it's basically and then it comes around

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.330 
it's basically and then it comes around
like<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.710> then<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.799> comes<00:01:41.009> off<00:01:41.220> like

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
like this and then it comes off like

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.480 
like this and then it comes off like
that<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.840> bit<00:01:43.079> odd<00:01:43.290> looking<00:01:43.740> it's

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that so it's a bit odd looking it's

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.649 
that so it's a bit odd looking it's
basically<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.310> consider<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:48.829> well

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
basically you can consider this well

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.120 
basically you can consider this well
it's<00:01:51.659> still<00:01:52.049> pretty<00:01:52.320> much<00:01:52.530> considered

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
it's still pretty much considered

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.770 
it's still pretty much considered
capitals<00:01:53.640> even<00:01:54.119> though<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.390> starting<00:01:54.689> to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
capitals even though it's starting to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.310 
capitals even though it's starting to
look<00:01:54.899> more<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.170> small<00:01:55.590> letters<00:01:56.119> now<00:02:00.320> it's

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
look more like small letters now it's

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.040 
look more like small letters now it's
sort<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.530> halfway<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.979> between
