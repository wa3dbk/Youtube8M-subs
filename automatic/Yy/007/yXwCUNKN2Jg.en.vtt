had<00:00:16.700> a<00:00:16.730> project<00:00:17.210> bike<00:00:17.420> I've<00:00:18.020> done<00:00:18.200> a<00:00:18.230> lot<00:00:18.410> of

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
had a project bike I've done a lot of

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.280 
had a project bike I've done a lot of
miles<00:00:18.770> on<00:00:19.040> the<00:00:19.160> previous<00:00:19.550> verses<00:00:19.820> so<00:00:20.300> it's

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
miles on the previous verses so it's

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.650 
miles on the previous verses so it's
sort<00:00:21.529> of<00:00:21.560> a<00:00:21.680> familiar<00:00:22.430> ride<00:00:22.670> to<00:00:22.910> us<00:00:23.060> once<00:00:23.540> you

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
sort of a familiar ride to us once you

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.240 
sort of a familiar ride to us once you
get<00:00:23.779> the<00:00:23.900> revs<00:00:24.110> up<00:00:24.380> it<00:00:24.529> feels<00:00:24.710> like<00:00:24.950> the<00:00:25.099> most

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
get the revs up it feels like the most

get the revs up it feels like the most
powerful<00:00:25.520> bike<00:00:25.910> in<00:00:26.119> this<00:00:26.270> test<00:00:26.570> in<00:00:26.960> my<00:00:27.140> opinion

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.560 

the<00:00:30.800> riding<00:00:31.130> position<00:00:31.250> on<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:31.760> verses<00:00:32.180> to<00:00:32.419> me

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
the riding position on the verses to me

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.740 
the riding position on the verses to me
feels<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:33.290> most<00:00:34.120> distinctive<00:00:35.120> in<00:00:35.390> that<00:00:35.420> it

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
feels the most distinctive in that it

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.160 
feels the most distinctive in that it
feels<00:00:36.110> tall<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:38.210> bike<00:00:38.390> feels<00:00:38.690> tall<00:00:38.960> and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
feels tall and the bike feels tall and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.140 
feels tall and the bike feels tall and
narrow<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:40.160> you<00:00:40.220> feel<00:00:40.460> like<00:00:40.580> you're<00:00:40.730> riding<00:00:41.030> up

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
narrow so you feel like you're riding up

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.119 
narrow so you feel like you're riding up
more<00:00:41.420> than<00:00:41.629> on<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:41.780> other<00:00:41.900> bikes<00:00:42.230> it<00:00:42.650> feels<00:00:42.949> a

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
more than on the other bikes it feels a

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.650 
more than on the other bikes it feels a
narrower<00:00:43.489> list<00:00:43.699> and<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.000> slimmest<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.600> the
