 drove the dye for silicone 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:32.690
 baits we use gel posts in 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.630
 as lubricant we use 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.530
 vegetable oil form 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.660
 we use gypsum fiber polymer form 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.540
 2 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:53.840

 I will fill with two syringes at once 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.510
 it needs to be done very quickly that 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.179
 bait spilled preparation 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.610

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.000
 the form clamped my clamp in the form 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.349
 strong I do not pinch 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.349
 so that it does not burst 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:35.460

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.070
 living force 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.380
 Dosing with marks of red silicone can 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.580
 achieve to lure poured one 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.670
