00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:10.740
 here you are seeing the protection of 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.730
 areas of rain that grow between the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.640
 Paraguay and Brazil are the Argentine 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.189
 organizing as a new cold front and 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.720
 there advancing on the southeast the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.230
 center-west of the country 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.359
 z all this happens here 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.359
 next 48 hours right? 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.949
 then this cold front is organized 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.780
 we already have these areas of 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.660
 instability I have a system of 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.600
 low pressure here in paraguay that goes 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.899
 then gaining strength and this here then 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.059
 is organized as a cold front with a 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.450
 extratropical cyclone 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.079
 already from Wednesday in this 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.899
 organization of the intensification of this 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.219
 area of â€‹â€‹low pressure forming the cyclone 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.620
 extratropical 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.219
 he should organize himself exactly in the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.539
 coast between the holy catarina river 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.330
 great southern 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.350
 precisely because of this new area of 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.420
 low pressure 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.810
 the expectation that we will have there 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.689
 very windy again on Wednesday in 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.720
 Thursday in the north coast region 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.630
 of the state of rio grande do sul 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.119
 again on the south coast of santa catarina 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.829
 the mountain areas of Santa Catarina and 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.930
 also of the Southern Great 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.820
 suffering from these winds is possible 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.430
 until we get a few bursts 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.840
 wind speed up to 100 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.840
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.299
 I have a combination of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.689
 pressure of events at various levels of 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.700
 atmosphere that will force the training 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.850
 of these very cloud nuclei 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.070
 loaded here in paraguay in the northeast 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.680
 of argentina and in the south in brazil 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.610
 then this entire area is subject to 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.030
 storm 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.130
 these storms are starting to happen 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.159
 from Tuesday more 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.850
 mainly during the fourth and fifth 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.850
 market
