guys<00:00:06.870> my<00:00:07.410> favorite<00:00:08.220> build<00:00:08.460> from<00:00:08.730> my<00:00:08.910> first<00:00:09.240> day

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
guys my favorite build from my first day

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.680 
guys my favorite build from my first day
on<00:00:09.510> hots<00:00:09.900> so<00:00:10.590> it's<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.860> zbt<00:00:11.190> build<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.790> it

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
on hots so it's a zbt build and it

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.099 
on hots so it's a zbt build and it
utilizes<00:00:12.929> borough<00:00:13.889> on<00:00:14.219> hashtag<00:00:14.790> Stefano<00:00:15.780> did

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
utilizes borough on hashtag Stefano did

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.320 
utilizes borough on hashtag Stefano did
something<00:00:16.470> similar<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:17.070> IEM<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.000> try<00:00:18.270> to

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
something similar in IEM and I try to

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.450 
something similar in IEM and I try to
you<00:00:19.109> know<00:00:19.140> copy<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:19.949> haven't<00:00:20.070> copied<00:00:20.310> out

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
you know copy that I haven't copied out

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.920 
you know copy that I haven't copied out
identically<00:00:21.090> like<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.420> never<00:00:21.600> checked<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
identically like I never checked the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.840 
identically like I never checked the
void<00:00:22.170> or<00:00:22.289> anything<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.490> kind<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.789> just

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
void or anything so this is kind of just

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.179 
void or anything so this is kind of just
my<00:00:24.150> own<00:00:24.300> version<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.050> it's<00:00:25.560> kind<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.830> like<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
my own version and it's kind of like the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.400 
my own version and it's kind of like the
old<00:00:26.369> school<00:00:26.670> Roach<00:00:27.539> pressure<00:00:27.869> builds<00:00:28.260> but

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
old school Roach pressure builds but

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.650 
old school Roach pressure builds but
instead<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.699> with<00:00:29.939> heavy<00:00:30.449> Roach

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
instead of just going with heavy Roach

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.780 
instead of just going with heavy Roach
you<00:00:31.260> go<00:00:31.410> with<00:00:31.590> Les<00:00:31.800> Roches<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.610> get

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
you go with Les Roches and you get

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.209 
you go with Les Roches and you get
burrow<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.750> know<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.050> burrow<00:00:34.260> forces

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
burrow and you know that burrow forces

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.030 
burrow and you know that burrow forces
scans<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:36.480> know<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.899> micro<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
scans you know you can micro it so the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.580 
scans you know you can micro it so the
roaches<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.790> do<00:00:39.000> make<00:00:39.270> become<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.320> lot

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
roaches that you do make become a lot

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.680 
roaches that you do make become a lot
more<00:00:40.620> efficient<00:00:41.399> than<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.270> having<00:00:42.450> a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
more efficient than just having a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.930 
more efficient than just having a
massive<00:00:42.989> bunch<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.100> roaches<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.789> can

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
massive bunch of roaches like you can

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.970 
massive bunch of roaches like you can
force<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.510> lift<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.260> then<00:00:46.350> put<00:00:46.559> your<00:00:46.590> road<00:00:46.860> to

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
force a lift and then put your road to

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.350 
force a lift and then put your road to
under<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.190> command<00:00:47.489> center<00:00:47.700> that's<00:00:48.090> what's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
under the command center that's what's

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.750 
under the command center that's what's
the<00:00:48.539> far<00:00:48.750> no<00:00:48.960> did<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.219> also<00:00:50.340> force

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
the far no did and you can also force

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.430 
the far no did and you can also force
turret<00:00:51.149> scans<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.840> they've<00:00:52.020> got<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> deal

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
turret scans like they've got a deal

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.950 
turret scans like they've got a deal
with<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> borough<00:00:52.920> somehow<00:00:53.539> so<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.570> think<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
with the borough somehow so I think is a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.619 
with the borough somehow so I think is a
lot<00:00:55.170> more<00:00:55.320> efficient<00:00:55.789> as<00:00:56.789> long<00:00:56.969> as<00:00:57.090> your<00:00:57.210> micro

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
lot more efficient as long as your micro

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.650 
lot more efficient as long as your micro
is<00:00:57.750> good<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.559> get<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.890> borough<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.539> you<00:01:00.539> know

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
is good to get the borough and you know

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.569 
is good to get the borough and you know
you<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:00.960> multitask<00:01:01.590> borough<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.460> know

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
you can just multitask borough you know

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.609 
you can just multitask borough you know
you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.969> keep<00:01:03.120> all<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.449> roaches<00:01:03.899> alive<00:01:04.379> when

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
you can keep all the roaches alive when

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.950 
you can keep all the roaches alive when
you<00:01:04.710> need<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.489> split<00:01:05.880> roaches<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.630> so

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you need to you can split roaches up so

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.289 
you need to you can split roaches up so
that<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:08.070> they<00:01:08.220> use<00:01:08.430> one<00:01:08.670> scan<00:01:09.000> over

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that you know if they use one scan over

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.260 
that you know if they use one scan over
there<00:01:09.590> then<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.400> rest<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.670> your<00:01:11.790> roaches<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
there then the rest of your roaches the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.000 
there then the rest of your roaches the
borough<00:01:12.479> over<00:01:12.810> there<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.830> know<00:01:13.950> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
borough over there that you know you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.679 
borough over there that you know you
isn't<00:01:14.549> good<00:01:14.640> another<00:01:14.820> scan<00:01:15.150> or<00:01:15.360> he's<00:01:15.479> got<00:01:15.600> to

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
isn't good another scan or he's got to

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.600 
isn't good another scan or he's got to
save<00:01:15.840> up<00:01:16.020> another<00:01:16.259> scan<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.979> think<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.490> makes

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
save up another scan so I think it makes

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.719 
save up another scan so I think it makes
some<00:01:17.880> really<00:01:18.060> interesting<00:01:18.770> micro<00:01:19.770> bottles<00:01:20.549> in

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
some really interesting micro bottles in

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.130 
some really interesting micro bottles in
the<00:01:20.820> early<00:01:21.060> game<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> really<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the early game and I really like the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.840 
the early game and I really like the
borough<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.680> hatch<00:01:22.860> tech<00:01:23.100> now<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.700> gonna

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
borough is on hatch tech now it's gonna

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.100 
borough is on hatch tech now it's gonna
make<00:01:24.060> some<00:01:24.240> really<00:01:24.390> interesting<00:01:24.689> bills

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
make some really interesting bills

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.170 
make some really interesting bills
anyway<00:01:25.799> guys<00:01:25.950> let's<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.520> straight<00:01:26.790> into<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
anyway guys let's get straight into the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.740 
anyway guys let's get straight into the
build<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.920> first<00:01:29.220> off<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> main<00:01:30.090> requirement

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
build so first off the main requirement

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.149 
build so first off the main requirement
for<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.110> build<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.799> needs<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> be

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
for this build is that it needs to be

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.859 
for this build is that it needs to be
against<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.549> fast<00:01:32.909> expand<00:01:33.329> build<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.689> don't

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
against a fast expand build you don't

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.450 
against a fast expand build you don't
want<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.079> be<00:01:34.140> doing<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.470> against<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.220> one

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
want to be doing this against the one

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.429 
want to be doing this against the one
base<00:01:35.640> play<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.720> want<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:36.960> looking<00:01:37.110> for

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
base play so you want to be looking for

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.679 
base play so you want to be looking for
CC<00:01:37.829> first<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:38.850> Rex<00:01:39.060> expand<00:01:39.540> or<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:41.490> rack<00:01:42.299> space

with<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> fairly<00:01:43.619> fast<00:01:43.829> expand<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.460> game

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670

with a fairly fast expand in this game
the<00:01:44.820> guy<00:01:44.970> goes<00:01:45.290> racks<00:01:46.290> gas<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> fairly

the guy goes racks gas with a fairly
fast<00:01:47.970> expanding<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.720> expanse<00:01:49.290> that's<00:01:49.560> about

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
fast expanding the expanse that's about

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.950 
fast expanding the expanse that's about
just<00:01:50.340> before<00:01:50.610> four<00:01:50.850> minutes<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.329> guess

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
just before four minutes so I guess

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.030 
just before four minutes so I guess
that's<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> latest<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.649> wanna<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.829> looking

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
that's the latest you wanna be looking

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.100 
that's the latest you wanna be looking
for<00:01:53.189> an<00:01:53.310> expand<00:01:53.610> because<00:01:53.820> any<00:01:54.240> later<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.020> it's

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
for an expand because any later and it's

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.859 
for an expand because any later and it's
probably<00:01:55.350> gonna<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.549> one<00:01:56.880> base<00:01:57.210> build<00:01:57.600> so

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
probably gonna be a one base build so

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.440 
probably gonna be a one base build so
look<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> fast<00:01:59.399> expand<00:01:59.729> bill<00:01:59.969> before<00:02:00.210> you

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
look for a fast expand bill before you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.880 
look for a fast expand bill before you
go<00:02:00.570> ahead<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.110> build<00:02:01.320> then<00:02:01.649> after

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
go ahead and do this build then after

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.649 
go ahead and do this build then after
that<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.219> as<00:02:02.340> always<00:02:02.520> we<00:02:02.670> want<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.060> get<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.360> 9

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.499

pool<00:02:08.099> first<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.789> does<00:02:08.910> allow<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.360> deny

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
went for a fast third and then he just

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.890 
went for a fast third and then he just
went<00:04:42.010> new<00:04:42.250> orlean<00:04:42.550> Bay<00:04:42.700> like<00:04:42.910> normal<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:43.450> there

were<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.020> lot<00:04:44.170> of<00:04:44.200> transitions<00:04:44.830> you<00:04:44.920> can<00:04:44.980> do

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
were a lot of transitions you can do

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.400

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
speed reg follow up because it can do a

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.910 
speed reg follow up because it can do a
lot<00:04:49.090> of<00:04:49.390> damage<00:04:49.690> and<00:04:49.990> then<00:04:50.440> behind<00:04:50.590> that<00:04:50.890> I
