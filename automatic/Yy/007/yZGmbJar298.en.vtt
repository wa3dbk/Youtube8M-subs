00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 difficult decisions crazy 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.740
 remember that a few days ago I told them 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.960
 that we were going to play as 2015 the uefa 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.080
 europa league and we finish with the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.650
 champions and then I think it's time to 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.330
 play a new series in three and then the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.760
 My idea is to play the Europa League 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.090
 many what they saw the video and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.880
 Well, I told them in the comments 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.150
 the teams with whom they want to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.700
 james warrior well good very obedient 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.500
 many what they commented we can 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.329
 see that there are 478 comments 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.670
 obviously thank you for your opinion and 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.010
 by tomÃ¡s at the time of writing there 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.570
 a hug for all 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.969
 but children for me has been something 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.199
 choose complicated by the team why 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.510
 what a reason why, obviously 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.320
 they left many comments many 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.190
 teams 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.659
 it seems complicated the thing as for 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.090
 choose the equipment we can already see that 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:12.369
 some say that the bayern of Barcelona 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.189
 what I brought says that the napoli but 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:19.030
 because you only have one another like that 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:21.789
 the psg but between I started to look at the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.340
 the teams most repeated texts 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.259
 what else they left in the comments and 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.969
 you can come to a conclusion already 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.829
 after choosing between the 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.869
 most watched teams because there are many 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:35.649
 teams that let me look around here 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.959
 Seville has 15 like things that are 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:41.140
 pleases many many comments for 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:43.569
 she months to the bayern she has like 29 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.050
 how many likes in the comment of a 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.200
 loquillo 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.930
 of serious there are many teams is the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.420
 chelsea el united the one of those who 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.400
 more are repeated 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.090
 obviously there are some teams that we 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.260
 says one another pink but but no 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.200
 many people tell him 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.510
 palermo zoolÃ³gico 12 loquillos sports 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.000
 the coruÃ±a in only one comment is the 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.830
 first I see we have here the liverpool 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.850
 that also just a comment on 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.040
 seville repeated it a lot the united 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.129
 city 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.099
 on issues that more than minimum for the 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.530
 athletic of madrid but also very little 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.340
 it appeared so what I got to the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.909
 conclusion that I'm going to leave you the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.250
 link on this page where you create a 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.290
 survey what happens with this survey here 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.870
 Well, as you can see it says equipment for the 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.269
 europa league and what you should do 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.069
 you are simply choosing the equipment 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:48.139
 they want to see in the series and so 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.689
 they simply select it and they have 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.790
 vote I'm not going to vote because I 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.489
 there are posts already made but 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.859
 they just do that, I'm going to leave them 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.950
 link here in the video description 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:03.950
 just give click and we will 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.620
 give directly to this page is very 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.530
 easy very simple what they do not know 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.109
 they lose there is nothing strange here they do not 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.939
 I'm going to steal the passwords, nothing at all 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.040
 so they willax yes that I 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:19.090
 just do that I like 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.950
 those that are going to play with the pspc 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.379
 vote and vote 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.769
 all the loquillo and your opinion was left 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.599
 said and done simply when I say 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.370
 how good is the voting 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.620
 so hurry up is also why not 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.379
 I know how long I will leave that vote 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.010
 I'm just going to the results already 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:42.590
 that the results will show me the 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.610
 percentage of each team that has this 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.630
 100 votes 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.750
 this is 200 votes this 50 this 10 this 1 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.500
 this and obviously so we come to the 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.170
 conclusion and then we group all the 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.840
 ideas much easier here and there is not so 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.250
 difficult with a team already because I know 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.200
 that if it's like a team that I 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.360
 they left there I can go with say with 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.170
 seville or get one with the 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.060
 bayern 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.470
 but I'm here to live more comments 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.150
 from the lubo neighborhood to live more 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.950
 Seville comments me out there more 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.870
 comments from chelsea because this one was 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.979
 with the team instead here 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.900
 it is of as it were to say it of jury 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.020
 that has verified that gives the information 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.500
 here it is true that this team was the 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.080
 who won with 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.600
 with the total votes easy and so we do not 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.160
 we complicated so much much simpler 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.450
 So what were the teams that 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.180
 more were repeated in the comments 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.430
 for the bayern munich the barcelona 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.700
 psc the chelsea the manchester united the 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:47.500
 manchester city el villarreal sevilla el 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.860
 inter milan and wolfsburg 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.370
 if that team is napping so the 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.100
 crickets there have 11 options 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.170
 just couple leave the like in the 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.120
 who want the same version from 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.810
 back they can also do those 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.760
 kids before voting if suddenly 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.980
 have any questions and want to look more or 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.060
 less the results do not have to vote 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.820
 to see the results simply 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:19.780
 can go first results and has 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.790
 100 votes is the most we have the 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.710
 Inter barely has one and I bacon is 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.140
 imminent since it holds another for the 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.419
 inters that there I leave the doubt then 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.010
 they simply give it back again and already 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.870
 can choose or just read from 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.870
 new line that I from a description 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.540
 is very good with that we vote and 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.730
 ready for them a hug for 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.640
 I think I will now stream 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.790
 a streaming point of double w tosca 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.310
 15 I feel like playing an event that 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:52.270
 they like pretty blocks I think it's going 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.590
 to be a royal rumble with desire so 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.390
 let's see 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.180
 later kids take care 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.680
 I hope your vote for me is very 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.330
 important to be able to start with the 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:06.330
 series and see you in the next video 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.330
 rearte
