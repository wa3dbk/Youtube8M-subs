00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.610 
my non-technical report on what
think<00:06:37.539> of<00:06:37.629> this<00:06:37.780> and<00:06:37.960> so<00:06:38.080> the<00:06:38.169> question<00:06:38.500> is

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
think of this and so the question is

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.980 
think of this and so the question is
well<00:06:38.830> since<00:06:39.069> I<00:06:39.220> use<00:06:39.520> all<00:06:39.849> Google<00:06:40.449> stuff<00:06:40.720> does

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
well since I use all Google stuff does

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.480 
well since I use all Google stuff does
it<00:06:41.110> make<00:06:41.259> sense<00:06:41.470> just<00:06:41.770> to<00:06:41.830> use<00:06:42.069> the<00:06:42.220> Google

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
it make sense just to use the Google

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.029 
it make sense just to use the Google
phone<00:06:42.669> or<00:06:42.940> keep<00:06:43.479> with<00:06:43.840> the<00:06:43.960> one<00:06:44.169> that<00:06:44.409> to<00:06:44.650> me<00:06:44.830> is

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 
phone or keep with the one that to me is

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:47.640 
phone or keep with the one that to me is
still<00:06:45.250> more<00:06:45.669> nicely<00:06:46.150> built<00:06:46.449> and<00:06:46.870> still<00:06:47.229> just
