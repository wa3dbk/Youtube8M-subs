00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
together and just started to untwist

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.130 
together and just started to untwist
them<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.160> they're<00:00:44.309> all<00:00:44.340> untwist<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.480> now<00:00:46.109> I

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
them so they're all untwist it and now I

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.529 
them so they're all untwist it and now I
just<00:00:46.350> start<00:00:46.829> from<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> back<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.609> I<00:00:47.730> tug<00:00:48.510> on

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
just start from the back and I tug on

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.939 
just start from the back and I tug on
them<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:50.030> then<00:00:51.030> look<00:00:51.269> for<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> natural

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
them and then look for a natural

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.349 
them and then look for a natural
separation<00:00:53.750> just<00:00:54.750> kind<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:54.989> harder<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
separation just kind of harder in the

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.590 
separation just kind of harder in the
pulling<00:00:57.359> the<00:00:57.449> ones<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.899> back<00:00:58.109> apart<00:00:58.739> so

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
pulling the ones in the back apart so

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.330 
pulling the ones in the back apart so
the<00:01:00.600> ones<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.079> can't<00:01:01.410> see<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:02.070> kind<00:01:02.280> of

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the ones that I can't see I just kind of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.450 
the ones that I can't see I just kind of
feel<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.379> go<00:01:04.589> kind<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.980> row<00:01:05.190> by

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
feel for it and I just go kind of row by

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.000 
feel for it and I just go kind of row by
row<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.940> I<00:01:06.090> put<00:01:06.390> them<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.690> and<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.350> start<00:01:07.770> put

them<00:01:08.130> pulling<00:01:08.490> them<00:01:08.670> apart<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.330> again<00:01:10.080> I

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
them pulling them apart and again I

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.510 
them pulling them apart and again I
really<00:01:11.100> don't<00:01:11.130> care<00:01:11.490> about<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:14.100> frizz

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
really don't care about the frizz

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.430 
really don't care about the frizz
because<00:01:15.120> I'm<00:01:15.300> trying<00:01:15.510> to<00:01:15.600> get<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.170> look

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440
