00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.261
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amen: Hi, I’m Dr. Daniel Amen.

00:00:02.261 --> 00:00:03.620
&gt;&gt; Tana: And I’m Tana Amen.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.790
Welcome to Change Your Brain, Change Your
life.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.769
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amen: We’re so excited to have you
with us.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.480
Every week we’re going to give you tips
and tools to help you have a better brain

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.550
and a better life.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.700
&gt;&gt; Tana: You’re not stuck with the brain
you have.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.460
You can actually make it better and we can
prove it.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.640
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amen: So, at the Amen Clinics, over
the last, goodness, 23 years, we’ve been

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.610
doing brain imaging.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.950
We do a study called brain SPECT imaging.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.250
SPECT looks at blood flow and activity.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.110
It looks at how your brain works.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.829
We’ve done nearly a hundred thousand scans
on people from 111 countries and just what

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.829
Tana said, the theme of our work is ‘You’re
not stuck with the brain you have.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.150
You can make it better and we’ve proven
it over and over again.’

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.750
So, these are SPECT scans.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.000
SPECT scans are what we do at Amen Clinics.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.380
It looked at blood flow and activity.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.869
Healthy on the left, someone with Alzheimer’s
disease on the right who was diagnosed at

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.170
the age of 59.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.850
So, even in her 20’s or 30’s or 40’s,
her brain is deteriorating and nobody knows

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.090
because virtually nobody looked.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.609
&gt;&gt; Tana: For a long time now we’ve said
we’re going after Alzheimer’s.

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:25.539
We have an Alzheimer’s prevention program
and that’s sort of made some waves but it’s

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.259
true because people never make the connection
or they didn’t until more recently between

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.580
lifestyle, what you’re doing everyday and
its effect on diseases like Alzheimer’s.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.859
In other words, as your weight goes up, the
size and function of your brain goes down.

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:50.090
Obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, all
of these things actually contribute to Alzheimer’s

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.090
disease.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.199
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amen: All of these things that are
preventable.

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:54.199
&gt;&gt; Tana: Preventable.

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:58.159
And so that’s why when we say we are, we
have an Alzheimer’s prevention program and

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.450
we’re going after it, we’re going after
all of those things that lead to Alzheimer’s

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.450
disease.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.979
So, we’re going to teach you that connection
between your body and your brain and how do

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.150
you prevent these things.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.620
It’s actually much easier than you might
think.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.670
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amen: That it requires focus and we’re
going to give you those right things to focus

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.670
on.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.390
So here’s the big idea for the Change Your
Brain, Change Your Life series.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.299
With a little forethought and our methods
that we call it The Amen Clinics Methods that

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.459
we’re going to talk you about coming up
quickly you can boost your brain and improve

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.959
everything in your life.

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.540
You are not stuck with the brain you have.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.639
We can make it better and we can prove it.

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:42.620
&gt;&gt; Tana: Thank you.
