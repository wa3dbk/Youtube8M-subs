when the steaks were done I put them on
a<00:01:52.170> plate<00:01:52.440> and<00:01:52.680> stirred<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.250> marrow<00:01:53.490> into<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
a plate and stirred the marrow into the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.210 
a plate and stirred the marrow into the
buttery<00:01:54.270> pan<00:01:54.600> juices<00:01:54.930> then<00:01:55.620> I<00:01:55.740> doll<00:01:55.950> upped<00:01:56.130> a

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
buttery pan juices then I doll upped a

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.800 
buttery pan juices then I doll upped a
spoonful<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.730> the<00:01:56.850> marrow<00:01:57.060> sauce<00:01:57.330> onto<00:01:57.660> each

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
steak and dinner was served if I had

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.640 
steak and dinner was served if I had
thought<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.510> beef<00:02:00.690> marrow<00:02:00.960> might<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> hell

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
thought the beef marrow might be a hell

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.290 
thought the beef marrow might be a hell
of<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.830> lot<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.070> work<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.520> not<00:02:02.670> much<00:02:02.820> difference

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
of a lot of work for not much difference

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.780 
of a lot of work for not much difference
I<00:02:03.540> needn't<00:02:04.260> have<00:02:04.320> worried<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.370> taste<00:02:05.610> of

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
I needn't have worried the taste of

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.169 
I needn't have worried the taste of
marrow<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.360> rich<00:02:06.840> meaty<00:02:07.620> intense<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.790> a<00:02:08.880> nearly

state<00:02:12.210> I<00:02:12.450> could<00:02:12.810> think<00:02:12.960> of<00:02:13.050> nothing<00:02:13.170> at<00:02:13.470> first

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
state I could think of nothing at first

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.730 
state I could think of nothing at first
but<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.160> tasted<00:02:14.490> like<00:02:14.520> really<00:02:14.970> good<00:02:15.150> sex

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
but there was something more than that

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.080 
but there was something more than that
even<00:02:18.270> what<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.080> really<00:02:19.440> tastes<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.640> life
