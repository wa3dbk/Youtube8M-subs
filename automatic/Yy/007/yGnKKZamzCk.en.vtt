00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:45.150
 In 1992, when I walked in the street, 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:49.080
 It was about trying to look so boring news 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:54.090
 Because there is some room for competition 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.490
 2 Step 3 is also possible before I lived here, rented and argued 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.210

 In the future, he would be a cozy home for him. 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:35.640

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.550
 Place'd Come For 60 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.890

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.240
 So I write'll hit a good look at the treatment home harder then you do 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.480
