00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.310 
one mistake to avoid and that happens
with<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.150> lot<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.299> people<00:00:15.599> when<00:00:16.109> they<00:00:16.289> are

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
with a lot of people when they are

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.900 
with a lot of people when they are
trying<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.920> hit<00:00:17.010> toss<00:00:17.250> when<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.609> they<00:00:17.760> hit

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
trying to hit toss when that they hit

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.689 
trying to hit toss when that they hit
the<00:00:18.000> ball<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.960> net<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.619> he<00:00:20.220> said<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.580> that

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the ball in the net so he said that that

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.370 
the ball in the net so he said that that
tip<00:00:20.939> really<00:00:21.090> helped<00:00:21.420> him<00:00:21.539> but<00:00:21.750> he<00:00:21.869> tends<00:00:22.170> to

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
tip really helped him but he tends to

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.340 
tip really helped him but he tends to
hit<00:00:22.590> some<00:00:23.340> balls<00:00:23.490> deep<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.570> he<00:00:24.930> doesn't<00:00:25.230> know

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
hit some balls deep and he doesn't know

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.980 
hit some balls deep and he doesn't know
why<00:00:25.670> he<00:00:26.670> says<00:00:26.820> when<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.029> start<00:00:27.420> adding<00:00:27.630> more

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
why he says when I start adding more

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.660 
why he says when I start adding more
power<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> ball<00:00:28.920> when<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.130> try<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.460> hit<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
power to the ball when I try and hit the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.640 
power to the ball when I try and hit the
ball<00:00:29.820> harder<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.390> add<00:00:30.539> more<00:00:30.779> power<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.289> get<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
ball harder to add more power to get the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.580 
ball harder to add more power to get the
ball<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.980> go<00:00:32.009> deeper<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.910> end<00:00:33.660> up<00:00:33.870> missing<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
ball to go deeper I end up missing the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.240 
ball to go deeper I end up missing the
ball<00:00:34.770> long<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.620> right<00:00:37.620> there<00:00:37.950> there's<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
ball long so right there there's a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.369 
ball long so right there there's a
couple<00:00:38.460> key<00:00:39.120> obviously<00:00:39.329> I've<00:00:39.750> never<00:00:39.960> seen<00:00:40.230> you

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
couple key obviously I've never seen you

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.260 
couple key obviously I've never seen you
stroke<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.739> ball<00:00:41.040> Benjamin<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.059> don't

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
stroke the ball Benjamin so I I don't

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
stroke the ball Benjamin so I I don't
know<00:00:42.360> about<00:00:42.450> 100<00:00:43.440> percent<00:00:43.739> right<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.100> just

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
know about 100 percent right but just

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.779 
know about 100 percent right but just
based<00:00:44.700> off<00:00:44.879> what<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.239> said<00:00:45.539> I'm<00:00:45.899> thinking

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
based off what you said I'm thinking

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.310 
based off what you said I'm thinking
you're<00:00:47.789> probably<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.750> you're<00:00:48.870> trying<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
you're probably if you're trying it the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.700 
you're probably if you're trying it the
ball<00:00:49.469> harder<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:51.030> know<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.530> know<00:00:52.559> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
ball harder you know to you know you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.229 
ball harder you know to you know you
think<00:00:52.980> hitting<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.489> ball<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.760> more<00:00:53.940> power

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
think hitting the ball with more power

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.060 
think hitting the ball with more power
is<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> make<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> ball<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.140> deeper<00:00:55.829> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
is going to make the ball go deeper it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.160 
is going to make the ball go deeper it
sounds<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.760> me<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.090> might<00:00:57.120> start<00:00:57.629> muscle

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
sounds to me like you might start muscle

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.200 
sounds to me like you might start muscle
in<00:00:58.320> your<00:00:58.469> shots<00:00:58.770> does<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.219> make<00:00:59.399> sense<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.030> I

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
in your shots does that make sense so I

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.819 
in your shots does that make sense so I
think<00:01:00.539> you're<00:01:00.960> probably<00:01:01.109> muscle<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.800> your

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
think you're probably muscle in your

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.230 
think you're probably muscle in your
shot<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:03.650> hitting<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> ball<00:01:05.030> harder<00:01:06.030> or

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
shot and hitting the ball harder or

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.539 
shot and hitting the ball harder or
trying<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> add<00:01:06.720> more<00:01:06.930> power<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.770> your<00:01:07.830> mind<00:01:08.280> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
trying to add more power in your mind is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.280 
trying to add more power in your mind is
not<00:01:09.270> necessary<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> make<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> ball<00:01:10.260> go

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
not necessary going to make the ball go

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.280 
not necessary going to make the ball go
deeper<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.520> fact<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.720> may<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:12.900> frustrating

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
deeper you in fact it may be frustrating

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.600 
deeper you in fact it may be frustrating
for<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> beginning<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.310> got<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
for you the beginning if you got the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.980 
for you the beginning if you got the
semi-western<00:01:15.060> grip<00:01:15.090> while<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.570> say<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
semi-western grip while you say and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.109 
semi-western grip while you say and
you're<00:01:16.710> kind<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.040> trying<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.610> imitate<00:01:17.850> what

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
you're kind of trying to imitate what

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.359 
you're kind of trying to imitate what
you<00:01:18.180> see<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.630> TV<00:01:19.080> where<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.189> know<00:01:20.250> you

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
you see on the TV where you know you

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.679 
you see on the TV where you know you
always<00:01:20.580> see<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> pros<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.360> looks<00:01:21.509> like

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
always see the pros and it looks like

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.200 
always see the pros and it looks like
they're<00:01:21.869> doing<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.619> real<00:01:22.830> fast<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
they're doing this real fast and you

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.399 
they're doing this real fast and you
know<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.659> see<00:01:24.810> right<00:01:24.990> there<00:01:25.020> that's<00:01:25.320> a

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
know you can see right there that's a

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.190 
know you can see right there that's a
short<00:01:25.830> swing<00:01:26.580> they're<00:01:27.420> not<00:01:27.570> actually<00:01:27.960> doing

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
short swing they're not actually doing

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.660 
short swing they're not actually doing
that<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.740> watch<00:01:28.890> them<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.159> slow<00:01:29.400> motion

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
that if you watch them in slow motion

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.730 
that if you watch them in slow motion
even<00:01:30.659> though<00:01:30.750> they're<00:01:30.990> finishing<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.619> know

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
even though they're finishing you know

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.399 
even though they're finishing you know
here<00:01:32.340> they're<00:01:33.270> reaching<00:01:33.630> out<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.259> their

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
here they're reaching out to their

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.490 
here they're reaching out to their
target<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.820> coming<00:01:36.299> over<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:37.290> last

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
target and then coming over but last

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.469 
target and then coming over but last
people<00:01:37.710> watch<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.820> they<00:01:38.880> see<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.270> so

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
people watch that and they see that so

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.179 
people watch that and they see that so
they<00:01:39.600> start<00:01:39.869> doing<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.740> then<00:01:40.890> actually

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
they start doing that and then actually

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.520 
they start doing that and then actually
in<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> beginning<00:01:41.729> like<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.750> start<00:01:43.290> hitting

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
in the beginning like that start hitting

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.219 
in the beginning like that start hitting
the<00:01:43.619> ball<00:01:43.799> short<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.659> may<00:01:45.780> go<00:01:45.960> well<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the ball short so you may go well that

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.899 
the ball short so you may go well that
didn't<00:01:46.470> work<00:01:46.530> let<00:01:46.799> me<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.009> got<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.369> maybe<00:01:47.520> swing

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
didn't work let me I got to maybe swing

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.319 
didn't work let me I got to maybe swing
even<00:01:48.659> faster<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.579> so<00:01:50.579> I'm<00:01:50.729> thinking<00:01:51.180> you're

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
even faster and so I'm thinking you're

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.690 
even faster and so I'm thinking you're
doing<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:52.040> muscling<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.369> then<00:01:53.520> probably

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
doing is muscling and then probably

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.789 
doing is muscling and then probably
opening<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> frame<00:01:54.780> without<00:01:55.110> being<00:01:55.500> aware<00:01:55.590> of

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
opening the frame without being aware of

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.920 
opening the frame without being aware of
it<00:01:55.979> because<00:01:56.579> then<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.119> know<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.420> ball<00:01:57.689> will

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it because then you know that ball will

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.690 
it because then you know that ball will
start<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.350> go<00:01:58.469> further<00:01:58.740> when<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.130> open<00:01:59.490> up<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
start to go further when you open up the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.580 
start to go further when you open up the
frame<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.570> if<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.719> do<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> little<00:02:01.439> bit

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
frame but if you do that a little bit

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.080 
frame but if you do that a little bit
and<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.950> swing<00:02:02.219> fast<00:02:02.549> you're<00:02:02.790> really<00:02:02.969> trying

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and you swing fast you're really trying

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.200 
and you swing fast you're really trying
to<00:02:03.180> add<00:02:03.329> power<00:02:03.659> well<00:02:04.290> then<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.920> ball<00:02:05.210> can

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
to add power well then the ball can

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.229 
to add power well then the ball can
launch<00:02:06.509> out<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.580> suggest<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
launch out on you so what I suggest you

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.210 
launch out on you so what I suggest you
start<00:02:09.539> doing<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.110> hit<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.289> ball<00:02:10.440> deeper<00:02:11.009> is

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
start doing to hit the ball deeper is

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.130 
start doing to hit the ball deeper is
not<00:02:11.459> think<00:02:11.730> about

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
not think about

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.410 
not think about
you've<00:02:12.260> got<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.530> hit<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.680> harder<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.580> add<00:02:14.180> more

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
you've got to hit it harder and add more

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.830 
you've got to hit it harder and add more
power<00:02:14.690> but<00:02:15.140> actually<00:02:15.770> adding<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.880> length<00:02:17.450> to

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
power but actually adding the length to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.980 
power but actually adding the length to
your<00:02:18.020> shot<00:02:19.000> relaxing<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.180> staying<00:02:20.570> long

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
your shot relaxing and staying long

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.200 
your shot relaxing and staying long
through<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.440> hitting<00:02:21.650> zone<00:02:21.770> so<00:02:22.340> let's<00:02:23.000> say

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
through the hitting zone so let's say

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.060 
through the hitting zone so let's say
I'm<00:02:23.330> starting<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.350> where<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.530> can<00:02:24.680> hit<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.920> ball

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
I'm starting to where I can hit the ball

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.250 
I'm starting to where I can hit the ball
here<00:02:25.490> see<00:02:26.270> how<00:02:26.480> long<00:02:26.720> see<00:02:26.960> if<00:02:27.020> I<00:02:27.080> can<00:02:27.200> hit

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
here see how long see if I can hit

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.760 
here see how long see if I can hit
through<00:02:27.440> one<00:02:27.740> two<00:02:28.310> three<00:02:29.090> balls<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.900> then

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
through one two three balls and then

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.830 
through one two three balls and then
start<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.220> come<00:02:31.430> into<00:02:31.610> whatever<00:02:31.880> fall<00:02:32.390> through

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
start to come into whatever fall through

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.990 
start to come into whatever fall through
you<00:02:32.990> like<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.320> do<00:02:33.470> whether<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.890> come<00:02:34.190> across

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
you like to do whether you come across

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.520 
you like to do whether you come across
the<00:02:35.270> shoulder<00:02:35.780> or<00:02:35.930> whether<00:02:36.170> you're<00:02:36.320> more

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
the shoulder or whether you're more

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.530 
the shoulder or whether you're more
traditional<00:02:37.430> over<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.910> shoulder<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:38.330> don't

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
traditional over the shoulder I don't

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.010 
traditional over the shoulder I don't
know<00:02:38.660> what<00:02:38.780> your<00:02:38.900> stroke<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.970> but<00:02:40.970> try<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:41.810> add

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
know what your stroke is but try and add

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.220 
know what your stroke is but try and add
the<00:02:42.230> length<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:43.070> can<00:02:43.250> even<00:02:43.490> think<00:02:43.760> about

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
the length you can even think about

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.449 
the length you can even think about
slowing<00:02:45.230> down<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.440> little<00:02:45.650> bit<00:02:46.010> just<00:02:46.190> going

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
slowing down a little bit just going

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.760 
slowing down a little bit just going
slower<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:46.940> smoother<00:02:47.630> lots<00:02:48.410> of<00:02:48.500> times<00:02:48.680> you

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
slower and smoother lots of times you

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.590 
slower and smoother lots of times you
will<00:02:48.890> actually<00:02:49.100> hit<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.550> ball<00:02:49.700> harder<00:02:50.209> doing

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
will actually hit the ball harder doing

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.750 
will actually hit the ball harder doing
that<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:51.020> know<00:02:51.110> that<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.500> thing<00:02:51.950> timing<00:02:52.670> you

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
that you know that that thing timing you

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.670 
that you know that that thing timing you
catch<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.209> out<00:02:53.270> in<00:02:53.420> front<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:54.470> you're<00:02:54.650> going

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
catch it out in front and you're going

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.430 
catch it out in front and you're going
smooth<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:55.610> through<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.940> ball<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:57.020> may<00:02:57.230> go

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
smooth and through the ball you may go

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.840 
smooth and through the ball you may go
wow<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.830> just<00:02:57.860> hit<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.190> lot<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.520> power<00:02:58.670> without

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
wow I just hit a lot of power without

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.640 
wow I just hit a lot of power without
even<00:02:59.120> trying<00:02:59.420> usually<00:03:00.170> when<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.350> teach<00:03:00.530> a

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
even trying usually when I teach a

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.070 
even trying usually when I teach a
lesson<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:01.220> ask<00:03:01.400> somebody<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:02.150> know<00:03:02.390> when

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
lesson and I ask somebody you know when

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.060 
lesson and I ask somebody you know when
they<00:03:03.170> hit<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.320> really<00:03:03.560> good<00:03:03.680> shot

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
they hit a really good shot

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.729 
they hit a really good shot
I<00:03:04.310> say<00:03:04.880> how'd<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.300> feel<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.900> lot<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.620> times

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
I say how'd that feel a lot of times

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.290 
I say how'd that feel a lot of times
they<00:03:06.860> say<00:03:07.010> well<00:03:07.130> that<00:03:07.160> felt<00:03:07.400> effortless<00:03:08.060> Pete

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
they say well that felt effortless Pete

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.360 
they say well that felt effortless Pete
that<00:03:08.480> felt<00:03:08.720> great

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
that felt great

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.540 
that felt great
so<00:03:10.370> think<00:03:10.970> about<00:03:11.270> that<00:03:11.540> just<00:03:12.160> going<00:03:13.160> nice<00:03:13.520> and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
so think about that just going nice and

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
so think about that just going nice and
smooth<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.500> reaching<00:03:15.500> out<00:03:15.940> for<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.060> target

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
smooth and reaching out for the target

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.150 
smooth and reaching out for the target
you<00:03:17.780> can<00:03:17.930> see<00:03:18.080> I<00:03:18.110> pretty<00:03:18.410> much<00:03:18.500> put<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:18.980> ball

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
you can see I pretty much put that ball

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160 
you can see I pretty much put that ball
right<00:03:19.910> at<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.209> baseline<00:03:20.600> think<00:03:20.959> about

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
right at the baseline think about

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.770 
right at the baseline think about
reaching<00:03:21.980> your<00:03:22.130> hand<00:03:22.430> out<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.480> other

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
reaching your hand out to the other

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.740 
reaching your hand out to the other
person's<00:03:24.440> feet<00:03:25.160> almost<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:25.970> you'll<00:03:26.510> find

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
person's feet almost and you'll find

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.960 
person's feet almost and you'll find
that<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:26.959> can<00:03:27.110> put<00:03:27.260> that<00:03:27.410> ball<00:03:27.730> right<00:03:28.730> at<00:03:28.760> the

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
that you can put that ball right at the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.360 
that you can put that ball right at the
baseline<00:03:29.510> you<00:03:30.260> don't<00:03:30.440> need<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.709> swing<00:03:30.950> super

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
baseline you don't need to swing super

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.160 
baseline you don't need to swing super
hard<00:03:31.640> you<00:03:31.730> don't<00:03:32.090> push<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.750> either

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
hard you don't push it either

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.320 
hard you don't push it either
I'm<00:03:33.380> not<00:03:33.560> saying<00:03:33.799> to<00:03:33.890> push<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:34.850> you<00:03:35.180> want

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
I'm not saying to push it you you want

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.580 
I'm not saying to push it you you want
you<00:03:35.480> still<00:03:35.720> want<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:35.989> nice<00:03:36.170> acceleration

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
you still want a nice acceleration

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.740 
you still want a nice acceleration
because<00:03:36.980> when<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.250> start<00:03:37.549> to<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:38.299> know<00:03:38.330> push

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
because when you start to you know push

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.870 
because when you start to you know push
then<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.260> ball<00:03:39.440> can<00:03:39.709> also<00:03:39.920> take<00:03:40.280> off<00:03:40.549> people

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
then the ball can also take off people

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.090 
then the ball can also take off people
also<00:03:41.060> tend<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.480> open<00:03:41.780> up<00:03:41.870> their<00:03:42.019> racket<00:03:42.920> face

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
also tend to open up their racket face

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.500 
also tend to open up their racket face
when<00:03:43.280> they<00:03:43.370> start<00:03:43.640> pushing<00:03:44.120> they<00:03:44.239> start

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
when they start pushing they start

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.810 
when they start pushing they start
getting<00:03:44.630> really<00:03:44.930> wobbly<00:03:45.230> at<00:03:45.769> the<00:03:46.250> contact

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
getting really wobbly at the contact

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.460 
getting really wobbly at the contact
point<00:03:46.970> when<00:03:47.720> you're<00:03:47.810> trying<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.049> be<00:03:48.170> extra

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
point when you're trying to be extra

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.870 
point when you're trying to be extra
careful<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:49.010> you<00:03:49.040> do<00:03:49.340> want<00:03:49.580> a<00:03:49.670> nice

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
careful so you do want a nice

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.640 
careful so you do want a nice
acceleration<00:03:50.660> but<00:03:50.750> it's<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:50.959> relaxed

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
acceleration but it's a relaxed

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.280 
acceleration but it's a relaxed
acceleration<00:03:52.519> all<00:03:53.390> right<00:03:53.600> so<00:03:53.810> Benjamin<00:03:54.230> I

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
acceleration all right so Benjamin I

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.050 
acceleration all right so Benjamin I
hope<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.650> helped<00:03:55.070> hope<00:03:55.489> that<00:03:55.700> helps<00:03:55.940> people
