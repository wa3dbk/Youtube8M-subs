first on a 12 21 or 12 22 all you have

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.830 
first on a 12 21 or 12 22 all you have
to<00:00:28.349> do<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.590> lift<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.039> top<00:00:29.250> off<00:00:30.830> and<00:00:32.480> then<00:00:33.480> right

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
to do is lift the top off and then right

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.819 
to do is lift the top off and then right
down<00:00:37.190> here<00:00:38.960> you'll<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.079> there's<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.379> bar<00:00:40.620> that

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
down here you'll see there's a bar that

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.440 
down here you'll see there's a bar that
goes<00:00:40.860> back<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.460> little<00:00:41.700> nut<00:00:41.940> right<00:00:42.239> back

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
goes back to a little nut right back

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.040 
goes back to a little nut right back
here<00:00:43.070> if<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> push<00:00:44.399> down<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.940> bar<00:00:45.780> right

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
here if you push down on this bar right

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.170 
here if you push down on this bar right
here<00:00:46.110> that's<00:00:47.039> how<00:00:47.190> much<00:00:47.370> pressure<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.969> being

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
here that's how much pressure is being

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.319 
here that's how much pressure is being
put<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.719> your<00:00:49.050> pressure<00:00:49.320> foot<00:00:49.469> pressure<00:00:50.329> that

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
put on your pressure foot pressure that

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.080 
put on your pressure foot pressure that
little<00:00:51.600> nut<00:00:51.809> back<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.530> rides<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> flat

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
little nut back there rides on a flat

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.420 
little nut back there rides on a flat
surface<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.620> flat<00:00:55.829> surface<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.399> be

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
surface and the flat surface can be

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.119 
surface and the flat surface can be
raised<00:00:56.789> or<00:00:57.059> lowered<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.600> adjust<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.829> pressure

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
raised or lowered to adjust the pressure

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.310 
raised or lowered to adjust the pressure
on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> pressure<00:00:59.760> foot<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.539> has<00:01:00.719> about<00:01:00.960> six

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
on the pressure foot it has about six

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.720 
on the pressure foot it has about six
settings<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.129> move<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.579> little

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
settings so you just move this little

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.270 
settings so you just move this little
nut<00:01:03.120> by<00:01:03.420> pushing<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> front<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.530> you're

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
nut by pushing on the front of it you're

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.250 
nut by pushing on the front of it you're
going<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.519> move<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> nut<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> different

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
going to move the nut to a different

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.020 
going to move the nut to a different
position<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.830> increase<00:01:08.340> or<00:01:08.549> decrease<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
position to increase or decrease the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.380 
position to increase or decrease the
pressure<00:01:10.640> that's<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.850> inside<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
pressure that's going to inside the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.840 
pressure that's going to inside the
machine<00:01:12.689> underneath<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.229> cover<00:01:13.670> so<00:01:14.670> we're<00:01:14.760> to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
machine underneath the cover so we're to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.999 
machine underneath the cover so we're to
put<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> cover<00:01:15.240> back<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.630> here<00:01:18.619> I'm<00:01:19.619> trying<00:01:19.860> to

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
put the cover back on here I'm trying to

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.620 
put the cover back on here I'm trying to
do<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.220> simultaneously<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:27.210> other<00:01:27.360> thing

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
do this simultaneously the other thing

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.070 
do this simultaneously the other thing
you<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.320> adjust

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
you can do is adjust

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.230 
you can do is adjust
zigzag<00:01:30.890> widths<00:01:31.370> and<00:01:31.900> lengths<00:01:33.040> independently

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
zigzag widths and lengths independently

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.850 
zigzag widths and lengths independently
by<00:01:35.240> picking<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.080> diamond<00:01:38.470> ditch<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:42.500> set

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
by picking the diamond ditch you set

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.170 
by picking the diamond ditch you set
your<00:01:43.960> front<00:01:44.960> dial<00:01:45.230> to<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:48.940> diamond<00:01:49.940> there

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
your front dial to the diamond there

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.440 
your front dial to the diamond there
that<00:01:50.750> makes<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.520> stitch<00:01:52.520> elongation<00:01:52.850> stay<00:01:53.390> in

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
that makes the stitch elongation stay in

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.630 
that makes the stitch elongation stay in
position<00:01:53.690> and<00:01:54.200> then<00:01:54.890> what<00:01:55.070> you're<00:01:55.250> doing<00:01:55.280> with

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
position and then what you're doing with

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.730 
position and then what you're doing with
this<00:01:55.820> dial<00:01:56.120> in<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.420> back<00:01:56.630> here<00:01:57.020> is<00:01:57.440> you're

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
this dial in the back here is you're

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.020 
this dial in the back here is you're
dialing<00:01:58.430> in<00:01:58.760> that<00:01:59.000> diamond<00:01:59.510> stitch<00:02:00.670> I've<00:02:01.670> put

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
dialing in that diamond stitch I've put

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.910 
dialing in that diamond stitch I've put
marks<00:02:02.330> on<00:02:02.540> it<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:02.870> be<00:02:02.990> 1/4<00:02:05.260> 2/4<00:02:07.929> 3/4<00:02:08.929> or<00:02:09.170> back<00:02:09.890> to

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
marks on it to be 1/4 2/4 3/4 or back to

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.130 
marks on it to be 1/4 2/4 3/4 or back to
the<00:02:10.220> beginning<00:02:10.790> so<00:02:10.970> if<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:11.750> look<00:02:11.930> at<00:02:12.050> the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
the beginning so if you look at the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.310 
the beginning so if you look at the
diamond<00:02:12.530> stitch<00:02:13.390> literally<00:02:14.390> you're<00:02:14.600> you're

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
diamond stitch literally you're you're

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.870 
diamond stitch literally you're you're
varying<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.250> from<00:02:16.640> wide<00:02:17.590> narrow<00:02:18.590> back<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.670> wide

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
varying it from wide narrow back to wide

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.560 
varying it from wide narrow back to wide
back<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.570> narrow<00:02:21.850> through<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:22.880> whole<00:02:23.120> pattern

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
back to narrow through the whole pattern

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.570 
back to narrow through the whole pattern
and<00:02:23.720> all<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.470> have<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.590> do<00:02:24.740> is<00:02:24.860> set<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:25.340> wheel

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
and all you have to do is set this wheel

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.970 
and all you have to do is set this wheel
back<00:02:25.880> here<00:02:26.360> where<00:02:26.990> you<00:02:27.170> want<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.560> be<00:02:27.740> in

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
back here where you want it to be in

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.580 
back here where you want it to be in
that<00:02:28.280> diamond<00:02:28.730> pattern<00:02:29.020> let<00:02:30.020> me<00:02:30.080> see<00:02:30.290> if<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.440> can

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
that diamond pattern let me see if I can

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:46.750 
that diamond pattern let me see if I can
show<00:02:30.770> you<00:02:30.830> that

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.199 

if<00:02:47.269> I<00:02:47.480> dial<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.129> pattern<00:02:49.129> in<00:02:49.400> pressing<00:02:49.790> the

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
if I dial that pattern in pressing the

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.539 
if I dial that pattern in pressing the
diamond<00:02:50.900> pattern<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.950> put<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.310> in<00:02:52.430> the

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
diamond pattern and I put it in the

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.100 
diamond pattern and I put it in the
middle<00:02:52.819> of<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.180> pattern<00:02:53.569> it's<00:02:53.810> going<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:54.019> be

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
middle of the pattern it's going to be

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.770 
middle of the pattern it's going to be
the<00:02:54.230> widest<00:02:54.650> zigzag<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:56.239> set<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.540> stitch

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
the widest zigzag and you set the stitch

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.649 
the widest zigzag and you set the stitch
length<00:02:57.049> like<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:57.680> normally<00:02:57.950> would<00:02:58.540> set<00:02:59.540> the

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
length like you normally would set the

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:06.940 
length like you normally would set the
stitch<00:02:59.870> length<00:03:00.080> on<00:03:00.290> this<00:03:00.440> dial<00:03:00.739> here

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:18.450 

let<00:03:07.950> me<00:03:08.040> zoom<00:03:08.069> in<00:03:08.550> there<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> little<00:03:08.879> bit

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.620 

I'm<00:03:19.460> going<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.670> shorten<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.060> up<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.270> little<00:03:20.390> bit

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
I'm going to shorten it up a little bit

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.190 
I'm going to shorten it up a little bit
I<00:03:20.990> want<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.380> make<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.530> little<00:03:21.980> firm<00:03:23.020> I'm<00:03:24.020> going

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
I want to make a little firm I'm going

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.490 
I want to make a little firm I'm going
to<00:03:24.290> narrow<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.770> out

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.420 

by<00:03:31.010> turning<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.580> dial<00:03:31.610> on<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.180> back<00:03:33.190> earn<00:03:34.190> it

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
by turning the dial on the back earn it

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.850 
by turning the dial on the back earn it
and<00:03:34.670> earn<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.300> widen<00:03:35.990> this<00:03:36.200> lines<00:03:36.800> it

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.770 

so<00:03:41.860> you've<00:03:42.040> completely<00:03:42.610> independent<00:03:43.390> control

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
so you've completely independent control

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.740 
so you've completely independent control
of<00:03:44.200> zigzag<00:03:45.160> width<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.640> length<00:03:45.670> now<00:03:46.390> I'm<00:03:46.570> going

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
of zigzag width and length now I'm going

00:03:46.750 --> 00:04:00.399 
of zigzag width and length now I'm going
to<00:03:46.810> lengthen<00:03:46.960> it<00:03:47.320> and<00:03:47.500> did<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.460> same<00:03:48.640> thing

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:13.550 

aim

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.810 

it's<00:04:14.070> wider<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.790> narrower<00:04:15.210> as<00:04:15.540> it<00:04:16.820> works

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
it's wider and narrower as it works

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.550 
it's wider and narrower as it works
through<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.390> pattern<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.109> diamond

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
through the pattern of the diamond

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.800 
through the pattern of the diamond
stitch<00:04:19.920> and<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:21.030> set<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.359> stitch<00:04:21.600> length

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
stitch and you set the stitch length

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.400 
stitch and you set the stitch length
independently<00:04:23.990> when<00:04:24.990> you're<00:04:25.140> doing<00:04:25.380> your

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
independently when you're doing your

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.770 
independently when you're doing your
ornamental<00:04:25.950> stitches<00:04:26.610> I<00:04:27.320> hope<00:04:28.320> this<00:04:28.500> helped
