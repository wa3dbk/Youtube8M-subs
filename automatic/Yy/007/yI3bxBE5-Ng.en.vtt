00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
well so there are two levels of

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.720 
well so there are two levels of
protection<00:02:56.170> you've<00:02:56.380> got<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.740> slipcover<00:02:57.250> here

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
protection you've got the slipcover here

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.520 
protection you've got the slipcover here
and<00:02:57.910> then<00:02:58.030> you've<00:02:58.150> got<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.480> hardshell<00:02:59.020> here

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
and then you've got the hardshell here

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.860 
and then you've got the hardshell here
the<00:03:00.010> slipcover<00:03:00.580> wraps<00:03:01.090> around<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.750> iPhone

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
the slipcover wraps around the iPhone

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.340 
the slipcover wraps around the iPhone
quite<00:03:02.350> nicely<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:03.330> gives<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.660> really<00:03:04.990> nice

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
quite nicely and gives it a really nice

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.790 
quite nicely and gives it a really nice
thick<00:03:05.860> amount<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.550> protection<00:03:07.290> there<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.500> a

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
thick amount of protection there is a

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.970 
thick amount of protection there is a
vanity<00:03:09.460> window<00:03:09.820> here<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:11.080> point<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.770> this

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
vanity window here and the point of this

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.220 
vanity window here and the point of this
is<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.310> fact<00:03:12.520> that<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.820> can<00:03:13.030> use<00:03:13.300> this<00:03:13.960> shell

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
is the fact that you can use this shell

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.540 
is the fact that you can use this shell
which<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.560> wallet<00:03:14.950> shell<00:03:15.160> but<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.400> can

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
which is the wallet shell but you can

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.760 
which is the wallet shell but you can
use<00:03:15.760> other<00:03:16.060> commuters<00:03:16.690> series<00:03:17.140> shells<00:03:17.500> as

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
use other commuters series shells as

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
use other commuters series shells as
well<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:18.520> you<00:03:19.060> can<00:03:19.090> mix<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.570> match<00:03:20.610> when<00:03:21.610> you

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
well and you can mix and match when you

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:31.460 
well and you can mix and match when you
want<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.060> use<00:03:22.240> the<00:03:22.390> Commuter<00:03:22.690> Series<00:03:22.720> shell

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.560 

you<00:03:32.010> stick<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.400> phone<00:03:32.610> inside<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.360> then

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
you stick the phone inside and then

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.220 
you stick the phone inside and then
slowly<00:03:34.080> get<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.950> shell<00:03:35.220> up<00:03:35.460> and<00:03:35.700> over<00:03:36.110> it's<00:03:37.110> a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
slowly get the shell up and over it's a

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.320 
slowly get the shell up and over it's a
fairly<00:03:37.470> easy<00:03:37.800> process<00:03:37.980> just<00:03:38.790> takes<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.180> little

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
fairly easy process just takes a little

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.900 
fairly easy process just takes a little
bit<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.660> moving<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.050> shell<00:03:40.290> around<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.880> that

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
bit of moving the shell around so that

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.940 
bit of moving the shell around so that
you<00:03:42.120> get<00:03:42.300> them<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.570> sit<00:03:42.780> properly<00:03:42.960> and<00:03:43.470> then

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
you get them to sit properly and then

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.620 
you get them to sit properly and then
when<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.430> want<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.760> use<00:03:45.060> something<00:03:45.510> that's

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
when you want to use something that's

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.480 
when you want to use something that's
thinner<00:03:45.990> you<00:03:46.470> can<00:03:46.590> actually<00:03:46.710> take<00:03:47.010> this<00:03:47.220> shell

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
thinner you can actually take this shell

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.920 
thinner you can actually take this shell
off<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.880> put<00:03:48.030> one<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.330> other<00:03:48.480> commuter

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
off and put one of the other commuter

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.540 
off and put one of the other commuter
series<00:03:49.260> shells<00:03:49.560> on<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:50.010> if<00:03:50.160> you've<00:03:50.310> purchased
