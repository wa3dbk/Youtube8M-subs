00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 what then are very much in tone today 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.549
 very dark on black but actually sees it 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.480
 a happy thing is mario kart 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.450
 for ok it would be the remake of the one for i 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.070
 However, 64 made with the script therefore 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.020
 I don't know I am very very very very much 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.359
 very very curious because various cantons 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.800
 like a lot it was done by a fan 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.080
 so it's not not nintendo stuff 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.519
 however, a bit of magic will be missing everywhere 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:31.920
 we go immediately to see it because I am 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:33.540
 really excited ok majorca hartson 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.270
 here a nice area is right here 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.219
 practically and by the boys something 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.629
 exciting you have no idea you played 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.070
 so much 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.550
 this will also be on the ds version 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.809
 mifare smooth taught spins after lithium 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.680
 I do n't understand in the rearview mirror 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.879
 how to make it be different than 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.950
 television but amen 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.180
 there is another screen there is some 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.090
 problem with textures but it all seems 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.500
 very very very cool especially the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.809
 fact that a verona then we see of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.789
 understanding classic has always punished venice 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.350
 this problem guys that when one 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.650
 clean nose is no way to 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.220
 catharsis that fast eggs not baricos 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.970
 I was expecting so the other from itself ok ok ok 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.409
 However, much of it is in the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.210
 oki kong mountain trail 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.850
 tool remember the morality set 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.729
 but that one will shoot us in a cannon 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.229
 yes I remember well anyway it's something 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.790
 strange because I'm used to seeing 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.740
 mario kart definitely in another way 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.290
 even the proportions are there 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.930
 fact that it is as big as life where 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.570
 is also going with the fact that it is 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.880
 what made it very badly pulled the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.229
 fact that it is like real life, i.e. 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.210
 promotions are similar to those of the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.320
 real life except for my giving nose 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.860
 Also in mined Viterale 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.600
 exponentially large 15 st I can 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.270
 for your aunt no you can't kaki this 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.450
 still they haven't put it but that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.829
 drift though they put me knows 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.270
 or mum, look at the textures on the bottom 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.460
 how are they dancing just a 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.469
 fun is from me can not not 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.869
 maybe they can do the prepared 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.360
 impossible that they did not put 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.650
 tv evening a pre alpha a few good 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.320
 letter of the alphabet 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:15.900
 them what my mom said de 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.620
 parma vera parma are dyslexic 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.260
 guys I'm dyslexic anyway 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.550
 it is strange however I assure you that 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.900
 quite strange 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.860
 I think my nose is very beautiful 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.610
 very sexy ties every hat up there 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.950
 ok i do n't understand why you find yourself alone e 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.610
 there it is a bit fascinating but if it fell that 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.650
 It happens 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.030
 let's see if you please do that they have 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.290
 that throws fishing type like 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.130
 happens in the original version and am 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.310
 out of my side 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:52.560
 no someone help me but no you can't 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.580
 end up like that and they are like turtles 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.650
 turned on the other hand help and that 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.959
 I don't guys there is a way like one 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.870
 re start help ok guys the only one was 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.880
 he was basically starting over 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.100
 I practically only gave definitely the 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.209
 demo thesis actually we are still ai 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.130
 so I don't know if I know it's there 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.870
 only this track despite having 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.940
 read that there was something else goes well yes 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.410
 sees that one if you let it start maybe 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.340
 somehow to open the console e 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.630
 to start the maps is not idea 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.630
 still cool regardless 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.800
 we hope so if he does it this time at 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.980
 obvious good pull of the boys becomes 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.010
 very hard however it is yes I expected that 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.620
 I would have taken so much if you were 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.500
 was the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.810
 what is the name of the turtle with 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:54.379
 taxis don't tell me the term la 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:56.330
 yellow cup with today I am dyslexic 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.629
 in other words , fashion does not come to me 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.849
 peach clones came that fished you from 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.799
 from the outside but wedding premises are left 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.569
 there upside down like a turtle 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:09.950
 practically that to use it on youtube 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:13.870
 so no new for those who put them at 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:22.460
 speak for whom I start talking here 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:24.139
 little boy are turned upside down above 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.449
 the water that by the way the law but me 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:30.710
 then, however, there must also be a key 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.330
 look better that it is the purpose of mirror 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.180
 in water 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.220
 wow so this is the bitter papers though 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.949
 plus trip hop still lacks the 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.330
 question of having the big nose he was 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.820
 quite satisfactory perhaps still of 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.380
 more than it was called yes you want that 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.419
 that I owed the beak to that presence 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.430
 without having at home in the super mario who 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.440
 the view is already occupied three quarters 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.539
 so I never saw it from the point of 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.010
 given his world and let me know this 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.720
 what do you think other classics 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.430
 maybe always for nintendo 64 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.020
 would you like to see played on cruz lift 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.419
 because there are several demola around 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.720
 and come to the next video show 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.720
 gamer
