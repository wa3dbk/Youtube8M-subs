00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.340
 hello very good to all how about how 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.900
 you are and welcome 6 to the channel 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.369
 You August St Augustine and I am 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.220
 that you can not find on twitter for 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.869
 new 10 on facebook you can anaco and in 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.880
 our website the sun 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.380
 and good this video I will try to 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.829
 explain how to improve performance 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.390
 of the battery with ios 7 there are many things 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.739
 to improve it but against a 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.689
 which is nothing special 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.640
 because you already have the settings but 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.739
 The truth is that I have found that 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.020
 battery because it lasts a lot longer almost me 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.180
 the same radios that I had 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.039
 with ios 6 such which does not stop being 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.620
 surprising because we're going to have everything 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.180
 everything good that brings us 97 but 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.460
 practically with the same autonomy that 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.899
 we had in years 6 I will tell you how 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.699
 I've done it well, so let's make a 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.140
 review for the adjustments because from here 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.600
 we have to configure our 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.309
 device with ios 7 in a way 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.379
 determined for the battery to last us 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.030
 the ratios that I was teaching you before 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.649
 see how I have it now we are going to 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.239
 go the adjustments let's go to 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.160
 generate touch tell you who recorded the video 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.150
 then this spends more battery but 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.520
 see that I am 85% and I have a 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.440
 hour and 23 minutes I think it's 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.770
 relatively well although I already tell you that 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.409
 when you record 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.570
 Spent the battery faster in these 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.219
 ratios should be more or less 90% 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.740
 If I had not recorded video in agreement 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.450
 but what you have to notice and this is 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.429
 very important to really know the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.869
 use of the battery is to go here as 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:32.819
 you have seen, you do not just have to 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.460
 go the settings you are going to generate and you 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:38.520
 You are going to use it and from here, here you put the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.289
 time of use of the device that is 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.579
 the most important resting time 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.740
 man also influences also not 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.819
 is important but what influences most is 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.069
 that when you are using the 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.140
 device because you last a long time 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.569
 battery is not the most important I tell you 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.549
 the time of use the time of use with 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.649
 it is 7 with everything activated the truth is 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.049
 that was lasting for 5 hours 5 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.700
 hours and a half in use to fix that now 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.920
 same I go for an hour and a half almost and 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.750
 I have 85 percent and notice that 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.299
 yesterday after the tests that I was 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.849
 doing ended up with almost 8 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.310
 about a half hours and I was 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.079
 by 1% I almost arrived at 9 o'clock 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.940
 practically and that I gave it a use 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.129
 quite intensive during the day of 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.989
 yesterday not good what interests you how 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.579
 improve the autonomy of the battery let's 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.769
 to get to the point I will not tell stories 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.400
 you can deactivate everything after taking the 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.970
 location 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.220
 disable mobile data you can 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.780
 disable the wifi the bluetooth could 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.120
 disable updates 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.860
 automatic multitasking you can 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.470
 deactivate everything but yes your 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.180
 iphone would become a brick and 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.920
 what not what we want is 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.049
 that the device works the best 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.370
 possible at least ours not by 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.530
 So I think there's no need to 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.500
 exaggerating so much and closing so many things myself 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.849
 only closed one thing that is the one that 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.459
 I'm going to show you now you have to go 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.129
 In general, you have to go to 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.230
 updates in the background and how 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.150
 I tell you I have not discovered America because 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.590
 if you read this paragraph that we have here 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.690
 it ends if you turn off applications you will save 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.790
 battery this is what I've done this from 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.829
 here by default it is activated I 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.040
 what I have done has been as you see 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.409
 turn it off 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.709
 what does this do is this is very simple 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:19.349
 multitasking in ios 7 is real is like andy 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.140
 as in android all applications 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.920
 they work in the background always 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.719
 constantly but without if 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.000
 applications are adapted to ios 7 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:30.159
 dropbox it takes a while me when 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.349
 I had the golden master of ios 7 dropbox 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.579
 it did not work for you with a real fine 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.620
 but because the application was not 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.530
 adapted now yes okay then 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.750
 nothing is simply how it works 7 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.010
 but to me as ivÃ¡n years and I am already cool 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.269
 I'm doing well, I do not want the 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.900
 applications work in the background 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.400
 except when you need them there 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.230
 situations a little bit different or by 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.780
 dropbox example I use dropbox for 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.459
 upload my pictures to the cloud dropbox 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.439
 and from there I download the computer 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.849
 not automatically 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.250
 then I want and when 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.689
 purpose on the photos so that it is 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.669
 working constantly that does not 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.889
 it closes not for that then very simple 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.680
 simply selectively yourselves 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:10.930
 deactivated everything and leave dropbox that 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.519
 you want to download an audio file 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.769
 video file or any kind of 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.479
 Internet file with the crowd of 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.159
 applications of file managers that 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.700
 we have in the appstore hear then nothing 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.830
 simple 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.080
 what you have to do is the same what 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.120
 you deactivate everything from here and leave that 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.940
 application that downloads files then 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.920
 that works with fine and real me in my 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.200
 case the truth is that I do not need it 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.080
 I have everything turned off and as well as 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.200
 says this paragraph we save battery and 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.650
 this form ios 7 practically yields 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.600
 how I yielded to 6 or better or worse 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.160
 maybe a little bit worse because 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.710
 There are other things that I will explain to you now 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.870
 no but but the truth is that render 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.760
 pretty good and I 'm very happy 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.950
 with the performance of the battery or go 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.990
 disabling this option because you already 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.880
 I say I do not consider it necessary that 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.040
 applications run in the background 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.450
 do the test yourselves to see if 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.880
 you do not have any difference at the end 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.160
 removing this check-in from here I activate it 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.630
 now he deactivated it by removing this what 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.120
 we do is have the same multitasking that 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.980
 we had in years 6 I did not have any 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.600
 complaint of agreement so it's already going 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.630
 well I prefer to have more autonomy of 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.030
 battery then have a multitasking 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.740
 real that really does not work for 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.690
 for a lot not maybe for some 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.040
 certain applications there is no more 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.449
 little things that I want to explain to you 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.279
 only disabled this 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:28.779
 I advise you to deactivate nothing else because 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:31.029
 The truth is that if you do not you will not have a 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:33.279
 iphone would have and is a brick that does not 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:35.529
 would be worth nothing not then I think 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:37.449
 that it's interesting to have everything 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:38.620
 you can activate it 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.210
 it has always been said that to save 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.240
 battery is best to play with the data 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.919
 mobile and with the wifi from the control 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.139
 center from here we can deactivate the 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.909
 wifi we can disable the bluetooth and 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.740
 We can not turn off mobile data 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.059
 me when they had to do with them 6 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.219
 to last me the battery to 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:55.659
 this when I was at home I left the 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.219
 wifi activated mobile data 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:00.370
 deactivated when I went to the street 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:02.020
 disabled the wifi and left the data 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.839
 activated cell phones and sometimes even 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.360
 deactivate the 3g and went by gprs to 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:09.909
 save more battery not good this is 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.889
 well it works but it's a little rollete me 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:13.539
 I think that with an iPhone 5 it is not necessary 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.879
 because the battery lasts a lot but 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.439
 This is because depending on you not 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:19.419
 you can disable mobile data 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:21.129
 from here because they are not in control 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.449
 center today explain only one thing 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:24.370
 more than I think it is one of the novelties 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.169
 of ios 7 well in fact it is one of the 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.669
 news of the 7 but I think it's another 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.289
 which also consumes a lot 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.789
 battery in this case I have it 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.620
 activated because I do not need me 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.570
 render more 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.669
 an option that I like a lot but it's 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.860
 be here 3 kilos a itunes store and 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:41.130
 appstore and from here we have the option 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.630
 Updates simply what 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.860
 is that when we receive a 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.449
 update when there is a 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.770
 update available in the appstore 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:48.300
 of some application that we have 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.610
 installed as it is updated 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.470
 automatically without asking anything of 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.270
 this way in the appstore we do not know 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.940
 they would accumulate applications to download 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.190
 as it always happened to us, not the 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.449
 truth is that these applications that 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.800
 I have yet to update 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:03.720
 activating what would be updated 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.850
 automatically not the truth is that it is 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.070
 an option that I already love to have 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.330
 activated I have not noticed that it consumes me more 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.460
 battery the only thing I've done has been 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.710
 disable real multitasking and so 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.330
 I already work great not to notice 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.770
 that are already being updated and I do not 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.050
 given to nothing are not being updated 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.820
 automatically good guys, I know 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.350
 I advise closing only these two 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.479
 little things automatic updates 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.919
 You consider it necessary that I tell you that 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:28.440
 I do not consider it necessary, I leave it 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:31.139
 active and especially the multitasking this 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:34.650
 which is in general and update in 

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:35.810
 second plane then other little things that 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.240
 they bring 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.250
 new in ios 7 are really minimal 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.660
 those things obviously already connect you 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.060
 will last longer the battery but I think that 

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.650
 it's not justifiable because it really does not 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.110
 it will last you much longer you will not notice 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.780
 that battery increase deactivating 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.970
 other functions but these two yes that what 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.530
 will notice a lot and above all 

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.210
 play with wifi and mobile data 

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.040
 as we have always done and how we have 

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.020
 counted many times both in the 

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.190
 podcast as well as there are also who 

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.750
 youtube in some video that we have done 

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.070
 to save battery no good guys and 

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.840
 girls, this has been all new 

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.700
 Mario, I would not complicate the 

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.200
 life try this these two little things 

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.030
 because these two things are what 

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.410
 they really consume more battery 

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.360
 thank you very much for having arrived 

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.220
 up here and see you if you want in a 

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.490
 next video and in the senate dot net 

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.490
 bye
