know Spanish Spanish version but I

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.820 
know Spanish Spanish version but I
enjoyed<00:02:51.480> desperado<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.140> mean<00:02:52.319> obviously<00:02:52.470> had

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
enjoyed desperado I mean obviously had

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.410 
enjoyed desperado I mean obviously had
some<00:02:53.040> high<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.640> like<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.790> said<00:02:53.849> it's<00:02:54.090> not<00:02:54.180> a

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
some high and like I said it's not a

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.690 
some high and like I said it's not a
true<00:02:54.900> Western<00:02:55.349> but<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:55.890> does<00:02:56.040> have<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.430> feel

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
true Western but it does have that feel

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.940 
true Western but it does have that feel
and<00:02:56.970> again<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.599> movie<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.050> I<00:02:58.080> think<00:02:58.140> would<00:02:58.560> be

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
and again a movie that I think would be

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.210 
and again a movie that I think would be
the<00:02:59.190> similar<00:02:59.790> target<00:03:00.239> audience<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.260> Red

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
the similar target audience that a Red

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.009 
the similar target audience that a Red
