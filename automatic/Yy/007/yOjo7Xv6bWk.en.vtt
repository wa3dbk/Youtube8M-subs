extensive vocabulary here but multiple

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.330 
extensive vocabulary here but multiple
definitions<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.480> word<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.530> high<00:00:37.890> blood

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
definitions for a word so high blood

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.770 
definitions for a word so high blood
could<00:00:39.120> mean<00:00:39.739> stagnated<00:00:40.739> blood<00:00:41.010> anywhere<00:00:41.780> in

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
could mean stagnated blood anywhere in

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.959 
could mean stagnated blood anywhere in
the<00:00:43.320> upper<00:00:43.500> body

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
the upper body

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.750 
the upper body
basically<00:00:45.469> so<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.649> was<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:47.070> blood<00:00:47.460> that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
basically so it was just blood that

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.209 
basically so it was just blood that
wasn't<00:00:48.120> moving<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.140> congesting<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.070> was

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
wasn't moving it was congesting it was

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.740 
wasn't moving it was congesting it was
stagnating<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.770> because<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:53.940> stagnating

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
stagnating and because it was stagnating

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.360 
stagnating and because it was stagnating
it<00:00:54.960> could<00:00:55.079> turn<00:00:55.199> into<00:00:55.469> bad<00:00:55.620> blood<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.280> could

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it could turn into bad blood it could

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.790 
it could turn into bad blood it could
turn<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:56.910> thick<00:00:57.300> or<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.079> or<00:00:58.620> there

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
turn it was thick or you know or there

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.439 
turn it was thick or you know or there
was<00:00:58.920> something<00:00:59.280> blocking<00:00:59.699> it<00:01:00.059> from<00:01:00.090> moving

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
was something blocking it from moving

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.740 
was something blocking it from moving
around<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:01.770> you've<00:01:01.920> got<00:01:02.210> people<00:01:03.210> would<00:01:03.480> say<00:01:03.690> I

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
around so you've got people would say I

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.640 
around so you've got people would say I
feel<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.260> my<00:01:05.189> neck<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.610> getting<00:01:05.790> time<00:01:06.180> and

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
feel like my neck is getting time and

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.160 
feel like my neck is getting time and
all<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> blood<00:01:08.070> stuck<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.520> my<00:01:08.640> head<00:01:09.140> you<00:01:10.140> know

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
all the blood stuck in my head you know

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.230 
all the blood stuck in my head you know
there<00:01:10.799> would<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:10.950> an<00:01:11.130> example<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.729> high<00:01:11.970> blood

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
there would be an example of high blood

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.929 
there would be an example of high blood
but<00:01:12.990> basically<00:01:13.530> would<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.770> anywhere<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
but basically would be anywhere in the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.270 
but basically would be anywhere in the
above<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.509> heart<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:16.320> would<00:01:16.409> get<00:01:16.619> high<00:01:16.920> blood

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
above the heart you would get high blood

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.990 
above the heart you would get high blood
and<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:18.330> would<00:01:18.479> also<00:01:18.659> include<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:20.610> concept

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
and that would also include the concept

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.120 
and that would also include the concept
of<00:01:21.150> high<00:01:21.360> blood<00:01:21.750> pressure<00:01:22.170> or<00:01:22.530> later<00:01:22.740> that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
of high blood pressure or later that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.800 
of high blood pressure or later that
made<00:01:23.369> its<00:01:23.520> way<00:01:23.700> into<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.000> vocabulary<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
made its way into the vocabulary of the
