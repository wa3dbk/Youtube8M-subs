00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.150

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.610
 another thank you video 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.000
 I got this envelope here 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.400
 and he is mine and I am 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.400
 curious what nils has asked me 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:41.610
 here is a letter and view burgers 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:45.000
 made of fabric or so but terry hall 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.320
 okazaki too we want you a little 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.079
 Surprise make the reasons for it 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.829
 First, let's just divide the ones 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.020
 same hobbies 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.940
 second, we like and appreciate yours 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.710
 commitment and especially your videos 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.239
 and third, it's just great 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.800
 always free is a gift work 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.840
 for some time even in 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.299
 The idea came to me 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.280
 Reminder of my grandfather always 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.860
 had two things in his trouser pocket 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.760
 a small pocket knife and a 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.159
 small bag 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.520
 we who grew up in the ddr 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.189
 called the affectionately critically as booty 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.530
 if there was something that is never otherwise 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.840
 gave and then annoyed very well 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.590
 only a little of it could take one 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.000
 if happy if there is something I 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.579
 would have been mine again a short while ago 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.380
 sewing machine use and thought that way 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.479
 a useful utensil too to you 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.310
 could fit if on the way something 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.720
 would like to take stone first serious 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.700
 to have to put on a backpack 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.460
 because today you can be right on the belt 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.600
 Therefore, carrying and stowing also fold 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.000
 as a prey 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.759
 if you have not used i have 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.750
 me for the sake of sustainability 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.159
 Natural materials decided straight 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.840
 mushrooms and berries live in the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.149
 Leave a cotton longer their 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.189
 Gently cover them with soap 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.719
 wash out or later on the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:07.829
 read the history of his vehicle 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:10.069
 have fun with kurt and nada code and 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.069
 giada 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.799
 but here it is also nils on it 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.099
 Nils could then be the right name 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:28.569
 and kot or dart is then probably the 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:31.450
 Nickname or something like that I feel safe 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.690
 Maybe you can you can me 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.579
 maybe write again then there 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.379
 there is still a small map dry with 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:45.760
 hat www trotten with hat dot- blog 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:50.379
 sport.de the author blogger hormon obama 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:55.269
 this advertising for you here are the 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:57.239
 boys kurt and jada and nils or nils 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:02.620
 or whatever 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.310
 okay a falf always booty in the belt 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.170
 can carry 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.290
 I can already imagine what that 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.290
 but we'll see in 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.629
 ok in any case made one myself 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.519
 from both her has described that he 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.560
 Something on the sewing machine helps a lot 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.440
 I'm too stupid for that with 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.669
 sewing machine to work out here like that 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.680
 leather behind a nice wide 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:35.560
 Belt loop also fits a wider one 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:40.000
 Belt sewn here by one 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.079
 push button and then you can do this 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.419
 unfold bag 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:47.560
 he knew what I'll do now 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.970
 I will not put it on myself like that 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.129
 have now put on quickly 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.400
 then he could second this case 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.949
 court and yes slash also applies 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.799
 let's see in action 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:00.430
 here is the one made with a belt 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.090
 and I have something else 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.859
 was one made 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.970
 military file bag and I think 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:12.430
 the idea of the coupe slash nils is 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.269
 the same as i said i can do that though 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.280
 animal area these things with 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.750
 Velcro then you can do that 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.720
 make whole on 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.600
 in a short time a big bag where 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.610
 you can let something fall 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.160
 equipment parts and so on the whole 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.510
 yes still to do with it 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.710
 you lose and you always say yes 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.930
 possibility bigger things too 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.550
 this would have transport 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.380
 needed would be exactly the same 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:48.750
 and we'll open it for you, too 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:52.900
 here same principle and then up here 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:56.230
 from the guys so wanted a tree 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.970
 that's really cool and what's mine 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.730
 I like the whole thing so much 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.250
 must be together again 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:06.460
 that is really a cool idea you 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:11.980
 so easy without it disturbs 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:15.160
 because he can wear the belt in nature 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.350
 really nice and can be small 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.060
 a tour books often to something 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.530
 so I collect collect collect 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.630
 green stuff that I prepare later 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.640
 with mushrooms or whatever you know 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:32.080
 you never where you have a crack in the pack there 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:35.410
 such an idea really cool really nice 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.220
 big and also here with the 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.590
 possibility of pulling the whole thing with it 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.010
 nothing comes 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:49.680
 cool idea in if today is here 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:53.560
 Now I can not even ludicrous 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.400
 strong and a nice handwork 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.750

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:02.919
