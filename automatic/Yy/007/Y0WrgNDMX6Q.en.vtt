 who were they 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:31.910
 for some people 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.100
 one week 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.100
 especially to address a particular case 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.140
 it's a very special case because it's only 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.089
 father arthur 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:44.560
 to these programs 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.380
 in wounded animals patrick edlinger africa clergy the offensive of the 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.380
 cUNEO 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.270
 we immediately talked about his son and we arrive then he is a 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.270
 real risk if she went on location Saturday 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.580
 driving 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.580
 it all started here it all started 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 as for any purpose 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.870
 he managed to be invited to his home 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.190
 nothing more 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.190
 patrick edlinger who does not suspect anything 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.720
 I do not say everything 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.900
 a life rather than the practice of the craft his paintings 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.070
 we are at home 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.070
 he sells the stock market 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.890
 sit down to help their herculean work we watched the daily 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.350
 text that will soon be joking 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.350
 and at the same time he went to the bathroom apologetically 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.870
 alas the investigative journalism they have invested the avenue de toulouse 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.559
 relieved 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:11.789
 a little yes except in the meantime ouimet specified m 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:14.789
 it's the sacem 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.399
 mix special instead of crying 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.079
 and only but after 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.269
 he discovered that the eu on the one hand patrick werner 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.779
 and then that's all 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:27.929
 later to the group 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:29.439
 so dare art 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.949
 he half-opened the door 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.949
 and he had escaped by patrick 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.989
 I believe in the text the place she was it turn down not held where they thought 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.069
 that it opens the door to the same penalty more than lowering it 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.769
 already had afp 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.769
 we can not take out the balls 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.079
 totti the current boss benoÃ®t gap 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.349
 and then for me 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.860
 patricia sirois at super summer 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.860
 above the bus and here we go 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.629
 he looks up and you're filmed 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.579
 a wall of three meters a climbing wall but in the toilet that 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.649
 is not that which is a pity above all 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:12.919
 and to achieve the roles of women's rolls of pq m 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.109
 investigative reporter was waiting 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.759
 he will succeed in recovering 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.529
 it overlooks level 9 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:23.109
 with afp 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.319
 and several failures garry spanking and patrick thereafter tell them about them 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.399
 of this technique 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:32.909
 Inaudible medoc training because he respected the game a lot 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.679
 which was good that space is human 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:37.399
 part of legs in the air 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:39.669
 See what I mean 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:40.719
 saddening 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:44.179
 what adhere to what it implies melchior chamber 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.179
 it's true that on the word 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.829
 for patrick it was a bit like one of his ultimate training sessions 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:54.749
 parts of legs in the air 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:57.749
 than trying to qualify the facts c 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.789
 at the level of the thighs and glutes 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:04.759
 we will achieve victory 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.759
 yes but people will watch 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:10.049
 and to quote 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.979
 but the port is the great absent of this can dance has indeed entered 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:14.619
 his ranks health 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.669
 in the countries where she came to the ol 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:17.769
 it's more than 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.919
 dakar pad in hand 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.219
 reconcile the two 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.259
 the technique 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.969
 of the leg in the air 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:27.770
 class 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.770
 but that's patrick huh 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.270
 so here you all know it's a scoop 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.680
 we loose like that 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.680
 while from the room 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.439
 philippe garrel 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.759
 he simply has never had 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.139
 reach 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.699
 now it took who ask for their great swimming ability 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.010
 they are more roped who were friends 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.759
 the roped 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.599
 katherine heigl and ashton kutcher 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.550
 put the mouse apparently after patrick edlinger tunisia 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.059
 could contact 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:06.469
 before the broadcast of this report 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:07.740
 it was painstaking 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.900
 besides patrick following his music 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.780
 culture even if it's called text asking him to never again feet 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.449
 here why 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.930
 so you're still here but we're never really successful 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.860
 ultimate point franck ribery that's exactly what there are texts at 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.159
 basketball 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:25.499
 texting 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:28.499
 the day you're referring 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.900
 the hourglass and his child 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.900
 but they think they keep a bitter memory of this investigation 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.809
 and it's on this plane 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:47.650
 anna meares 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.800
 of this survey 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.910
 it was the thrifty thrifty thrifty thrift who wants
