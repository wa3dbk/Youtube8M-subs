I

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.060 

here<00:00:07.540> we<00:00:07.690> are<00:00:07.780> in<00:00:07.930> the<00:00:08.050> open<00:00:08.469> and<00:00:08.710> connected

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.070 
here we are in the open and connected

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.880 
here we are in the open and connected
car<00:00:09.520> so<00:00:09.820> this<00:00:10.000> is<00:00:10.180> a<00:00:10.380> platform<00:00:11.380> demonstrator

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:11.890 
car so this is a platform demonstrator

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.549 
car so this is a platform demonstrator
made<00:00:12.580> by<00:00:12.820> intelligent<00:00:13.570> systems<00:00:13.900> option<00:00:14.260> so

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
made by intelligent systems option so

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.190 
made by intelligent systems option so
the<00:00:14.860> the<00:00:15.220> whole<00:00:15.370> idea<00:00:15.610> is<00:00:16.000> to<00:00:16.450> explore<00:00:16.840> some

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
the the whole idea is to explore some

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.250 
the the whole idea is to explore some
new<00:00:17.230> technologies<00:00:18.099> and<00:00:18.369> new<00:00:18.880> usage<00:00:19.570> in<00:00:19.930> the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260 
new technologies and new usage in the

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.630 
new technologies and new usage in the
car<00:00:20.740> context<00:00:22.560> connectivity<00:00:23.560> in<00:00:23.859> terms<00:00:24.130> of<00:00:24.340> of

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
car context connectivity in terms of of

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.220 
car context connectivity in terms of of
the<00:00:24.880> card<00:00:25.119> self<00:00:25.390> connected<00:00:25.840> to<00:00:25.960> the<00:00:26.050> network

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
the card self connected to the network

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.890 
the card self connected to the network
so<00:00:26.650> we<00:00:26.800> are<00:00:26.859> connected<00:00:27.279> by<00:00:27.670> a<00:00:27.699> 3g<00:00:28.330> we're

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
so we are connected by a 3g we're

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.830 
so we are connected by a 3g we're
listening<00:00:29.260> to<00:00:29.289> web<00:00:29.560> radio<00:00:29.970> currently<00:00:30.970> will

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.690 

we<00:02:29.330> wanted<00:02:29.569> to<00:02:29.630> test<00:02:29.959> some<00:02:30.490> tablet<00:02:31.490> usage

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
we wanted to test some tablet usage

we wanted to test some tablet usage
within<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.390> car<00:02:32.690> just<00:02:33.250> doing<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.340> totally

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
within the car just doing a totally

within the car just doing a totally
different<00:02:35.090> hm<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.600> so<00:02:35.870> here<00:02:36.260> we're<00:02:36.440> using<00:02:36.560> 3d

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
different hm I so here we're using 3d

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.730 
different hm I so here we're using 3d
which<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:37.430> real<00:02:37.730> pretty<00:02:38.209> I'm<00:02:38.540> able<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.530> go

which is real pretty I'm able to go

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.449 
which is real pretty I'm able to go
through<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.940> interface<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.870> I'm<00:02:42.500> able<00:02:42.860> to

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
through the interface and I'm able to

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.600 
through the interface and I'm able to
really<00:02:44.360> control<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.500> car<00:02:45.830> so<00:02:46.130> let's<00:02:46.340> let's

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
really control the car so let's let's

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.370 
really control the car so let's let's
have<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.880> look<00:02:47.060> at<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.270> mp3<00:02:47.780> I'm<00:02:47.930> currently

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
have a look at the mp3 I'm currently

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.240 
have a look at the mp3 I'm currently
playing<00:02:48.730> catch<00:02:49.730> him<00:02:49.940> earlier<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.950> can

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
playing catch him earlier so I can

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.390 
playing catch him earlier so I can
access<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:53.410> content<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.650> car<00:02:54.890> from<00:02:55.190> my

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
access the content of the car from my

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.920 
access the content of the car from my
tablet<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.600> can<00:02:56.810> play<00:02:57.080> some<00:02:57.890> different<00:02:58.930> and

tablet and I can play some different and

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.280 
tablet and I can play some different and
I<00:03:00.020> change<00:03:00.350> here<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:01.760> another<00:03:02.000> song<00:03:02.330> the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
I change here to to another song the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.380 
I change here to to another song the
real<00:03:03.680> point<00:03:03.980> is<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.640> can<00:03:04.850> leave<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.180> driver

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
real point is you can leave the driver

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.199 
real point is you can leave the driver
drive<00:03:05.780> safely<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.470> then<00:03:06.860> passenger<00:03:07.580> or<00:03:07.880> the

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
drive safely and then passenger or the

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.940 
drive safely and then passenger or the
person<00:03:08.600> behind<00:03:08.750> can<00:03:09.080> just<00:03:09.260> take<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.470> tablets

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
person behind can just take the tablets

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.460 
person behind can just take the tablets
and<00:03:10.130> change<00:03:10.400> what<00:03:10.850> they<00:03:10.970> want<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.209> change<00:03:11.480> so

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
and change what they want to change so

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.990 
and change what they want to change so
green<00:03:12.680> driving<00:03:13.100> is<00:03:13.280> an<00:03:13.400> application<00:03:13.519> we

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
green driving is an application we

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.670 
green driving is an application we
developed<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.540> demonstrate<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.290> full

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
developed to demonstrate the full

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.640 
developed to demonstrate the full
integration<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.580> this<00:03:17.330> platform<00:03:17.930> within<00:03:18.380> the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
integration of this platform within the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.190 
integration of this platform within the
car<00:03:18.890> so<00:03:19.130> we're<00:03:19.310> taking<00:03:20.000> all<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.989> can

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
car so we're taking all the the can

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.759 
car so we're taking all the the can
messages<00:03:21.709> around<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:23.660> speed<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.410> run<00:03:24.500> /

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
messages around the the speed the run /

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.949 
messages around the the speed the run /
minutes<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.250> juice<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:25.730> we<00:03:26.390> compute<00:03:26.840> the

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
minutes the juice and we compute the

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.729 
minutes the juice and we compute the
optimal<00:03:27.350> way<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:28.330> driving<00:03:29.330> so<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:29.989> basically

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
optimal way of driving so you basically

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.590 
optimal way of driving so you basically
the<00:03:31.190> idea<00:03:31.220> is<00:03:31.550> to<00:03:31.670> have<00:03:31.850> an<00:03:32.180> eco-friendly

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
the idea is to have an eco-friendly

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.229 
the idea is to have an eco-friendly
driving<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.860> green<00:03:34.070> driving<00:03:34.489> we<00:03:34.640> implemented

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
driving the green driving we implemented

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.699 
driving the green driving we implemented
on<00:03:35.329> the<00:03:35.450> head<00:03:35.630> unit<00:03:35.810> here<00:03:36.200> but<00:03:36.410> we<00:03:36.560> also

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
on the head unit here but we also

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.819 
on the head unit here but we also
implemented<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.579> on<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:37.970> tablet<00:03:38.420> which<00:03:39.350> which

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
implemented it on the tablet which which

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.819 
implemented it on the tablet which which
you've<00:03:39.980> seen<00:03:40.220> before<00:03:41.019> so<00:03:42.019> this<00:03:42.320> tablet<00:03:42.799> is

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
you've seen before so this tablet is

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:49.530 
you've seen before so this tablet is
proposing<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.670> different<00:03:44.090> experience<00:03:44.540> of

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.259 

what<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.409> want<00:03:50.650> in<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.860> car<00:03:51.159> should<00:03:51.370> be<00:03:51.430> safe

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
what you want in the car should be safe

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.679 
what you want in the car should be safe
and<00:03:52.629> secure<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:54.519> certainly<00:03:54.939> don't<00:03:55.150> want<00:03:55.390> some

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
and secure you certainly don't want some

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.869 
and secure you certainly don't want some
applications<00:03:56.260> that<00:03:56.500> can<00:03:56.680> hijack<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.370> car<00:03:57.640> so

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
applications that can hijack the car so

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.630 
applications that can hijack the car so
the<00:03:58.150> whole<00:03:58.299> point<00:03:58.480> is<00:03:58.629> here<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.890> be<00:04:00.219> able<00:04:00.519> to

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
the whole point is here to be able to

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.179 
the whole point is here to be able to
certify<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.299> applications<00:04:02.049> and<00:04:02.319> then<00:04:02.500> make

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:03.189 
certify the applications and then make

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.780 
certify the applications and then make
them<00:04:03.340> available<00:04:03.549> to<00:04:04.349> all<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.500> drivers<00:04:05.790> what's

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
them available to all the drivers what's

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.059 
them available to all the drivers what's
next<00:04:07.209> well<00:04:07.930> this<00:04:08.170> is<00:04:08.319> obviously<00:04:08.650> a

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
next well this is obviously a

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.550 
next well this is obviously a
demonstrator<00:04:09.970> or<00:04:10.060> an<00:04:10.209> accelerator<00:04:10.840> which<00:04:11.319> we

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
demonstrator or an accelerator which we

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.229 
demonstrator or an accelerator which we
provide<00:04:11.890> to<00:04:12.010> our<00:04:12.040> customers<00:04:12.340> so<00:04:12.670> now<00:04:12.970> we're
