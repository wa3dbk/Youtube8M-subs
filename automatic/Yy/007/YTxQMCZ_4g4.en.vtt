Hello Everyone

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.120
I am going to make Cantonese sponge cake today

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.100
Let's have a look at the ingredients

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.440
We have 4 eggs

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.020
160 grams of sugar

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.860
In the powder mix, we have strong flour 50 grams

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.293
Plain flour 150 grams

00:00:16.293 --> 00:00:18.293
Corn flour 25 grams

00:00:18.293 --> 00:00:19.518
Custard powder 20 grams

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.242
Baking soda 1 teaspoon

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.060
We need to mix the powder and sieve it twice

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.480
We also have 2.5 teaspoon of baking powder for later use

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.400
We have 2 tablespoon of liquid butter

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.300
1 teaspoon of vanilla essence

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.880
1 cup of evaporated milk, that's 250 ml

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.100
First of all, we beat the eggs with the sugar together

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.320
We need to whisk it for 10-12 minutes

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:51.317
Look at the consistency of the egg mix

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.280
light yellow colour

00:00:54.308 --> 00:00:57.088
quite thick in consistency

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.900
We now sieve the powder mix into the egg

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.100
As we add the powder into the bowl, we slowly whisk the egg mixture

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:14.640
Don't whisk too hard, if you whisk too hard, the dough will not be set properly, and the cake will not be spongy

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.100
We also add in some evaporated milk and vanilla essence

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.600
We slowly add the powder mix into the bowl again

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.620
We try to add all the powder mix into the bowl

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.800
Now we add some liquid butter

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.260
You can melt the butter yourself if you cannot find ready prepared liquid butter

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.420
So we have added all our ingredients into the bowl

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.297
We should let it rest for an hour

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.280
After that, we add in the baking powder

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.860
Okay, after an hour, we mix the 2.5 teaspoon of baking powder in 1 tablespoon of water

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.360
Then add the mixture into the bowl

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:08.493
Mix well

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.160
Otherwise the cake will not rise properly

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.873
We now prepare a metal dish with holes

00:02:16.907 --> 00:02:19.667
then we place on top a baking sheet

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.220
or you can place a kitchen towel on top instead

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.280
We add in the cake mix into the metal dish

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.140
When the water is boiling in the wok, we place the metal dish in the wok

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.320
We steam it in high heat for 50 minutes

00:02:34.194 --> 00:02:36.194
Now Cantonese sponge cake is ready to serve

00:02:36.194 --> 00:02:37.805
Let's have it a look

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.300
We can use a bamboo stick to see if the cake is cooked thoroughly

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.520
We pierce the thickest part of the cake with the stick, and if there is no dough mix stuck on the stick, then the cake is ready

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.280
Cantonese sponge cake is ready!

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.813
It's really good, you should try making it too

00:02:52.813 --> 00:02:54.400
See you next time!
