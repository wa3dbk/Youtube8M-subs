00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.609
 thank you 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.250
 today in the Basque cast is arrived as a 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.250
 of the most successful players Carlos 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.980
 alberto sold maybe the erder has one 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.529
 curriculum similar to yours 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.720
 and you have a feature of 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.449
 group leadership 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.470
 at least that's what you hear 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.359
 about you 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.369
 what you think you can add 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.609
 in this group taking into account this 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.850
 representativeness of being a guy is 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.739
 leader and at the same time and an athlete 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.489
 victorious 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:41.960
 look at I spent athletic bridge have 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.820
 always when I was not a captain it was always 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.520
 when a captain came out whenever 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.010
 I was dependent on her, I do not think 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.739
 You need an armband for you 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.360
 and it will be a dilation, I think 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.399
 For me, I found myself with that guy. 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.379
 that can motivate the team 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.989
 regardless of the circumstances 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.110
 that guy who can lift the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.890
 team think football you have to have 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.530
 joy to perseverance and trust up 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.689
 everything in you I try to convey to you 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.119
 Everyone and where I went I got 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.500
 make it be a good guy 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.670
 I wish for all 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.740
 a guy where when I left when I left 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.100
 inter when I left athletic when I left 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.590
 of the bridge ensures that 80% of people 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.650
 left crying 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.840
 asked me to stay I do not think this 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.689
 leadership that I bring consequently 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.820
 my strength 1 with which I bring 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.040
 I think I have a lot to do. 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.020
 bring Vasco can help respecting 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.670
 to all who are here and I respect 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.460
 thus a very acute effect that is 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.320
 making excellent matches watch the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.340
 Basque matches are not doing this 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.049
 playing well 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.329
 I do not arrive here today it's the third side 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.790
 It's not like I said I 'm coming to 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.670
 not coming to fight for 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.380
 position with needle with needle with abuda 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.829
 today is ahead is playing a lot 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.780
 good 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.850
 I'll try to get my 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.300
 space regardless of whether you are playing or 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.700
 tamim not being a leader is not within 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.600
 Field I can speak of field assisting 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.670
 the companions 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.590
 talking when someone gives down 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.290
 I can raise this player showed that 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.570
 he may be disputing position 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.920
 sometimes the player when he is 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.270
 playing is happy 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.940
 from the moment it leaves the 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.100
 team he turns into someone else 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.950
 so that's what I try not to leave a 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.340
 thing that did not even tell me that when 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.840
 I was very scared not to lose the locker room 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.720
 This is something that all the team that is 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.580
 champion who the locker room very strong 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.230
 independent of what happens outside of 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.450
 is commented out of the car 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.970
 the locker room must be closed 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.460
 dressing room try to put players together 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.400
 technical committee to the board and when 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.260
 I came here I came because the first 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.790
 Professor Rene know that is a face of a 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.720
 differentiated character 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.670
 I appreciate the words about me knowing the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.980
 work of knowing the people who 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.480
 are working here that I know of 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.220
 Basque back was not here I know 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.530
 What was complicated now is different. 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.160
 will change for the people who are here 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.280
 by the situation then that was what 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.660
 motivated to come to Basque and I think 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.850
 People think I'm not sure that we 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.670
 can not find titles 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.680
 I think you just regain respect 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.560
 and confidence by bringing the title 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.260
 good matches having good performances 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.200
 the Basque began demonstrating this hand 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.820
 now has a difficult game is a classic 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.950
 have everything to win one more game 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.710
 played on both sides 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.540
 it's classic nobody knows who wins 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.530
 winning is not alright getting lost 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.480
 it's all wrong 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.900
 I think in this line that we have to 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.820
 keep trying to make good and you 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.710
 felt at some point harmed by 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.850
 This is starting this season already in the 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.130
 end of January 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.660
 I'm a guy who takes good care of me and 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.890
 Everyone saw me when I 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.630
 training in the two drills I did there 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.600
 I never showed up late in a 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.120
 team always by the other key 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.820
 two days before I had no saint 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.430
 had saints in other teams and teams 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.140
 out that I was trying to hire 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.700
 I always left it in the businessman's hand. 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.320
 the business there in the field 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.150
 the other part I always left with him 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.370
 itself said that it is difficult to 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.040
 negotiate with him I know that 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.460
 So I stayed in Tava training in 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.530
 House 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.690
 Of course it's totally different you 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.270
 to train alone and will have 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.160
 team but I had a certain basis of 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.130
 force to do academy practically 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.520
 every day for running every day 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:45.090
 so I come under the companions 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.550
 but with a certain a certain basis and 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.569
 They need a little time to play I 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.849
 I want to be playing 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.120
 on the other hand also has to play I 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.050
 I wanted to play just for the will not 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.610
 do my part when the teacher 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.710
 You think I'm fine, I had 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:06.090
 qualified to play I will not play 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:16.560
 is disputing with love and with that already 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:18.900
 Achieved Grade 10 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.750
 Look, it does not look like I've arrived in Basque. 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.150
 yesterday I arrived with everyone 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.599
 embracing playing laughing 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.430
 I felt at home you see I passed by 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.349
 other teams I've come to prefer 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.419
 that fell fell with the bridge with the second 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:35.009
 So you see when the locker room also 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.500
 It's kind of complicated here. 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:40.590
 you see despite the situation so 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.759
 organized everybody playing it there 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.610
 reflects in field 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.560
 It's three wins and it's beautiful today. 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.509
 You have to continue like that okay I 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.639
 I got toying playing with de let's go. 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.050
 to continue thus leading leads as soon as the 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.199
 people have everything to do a year too much 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.199
 good
