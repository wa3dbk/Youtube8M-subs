00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
anything that I dislike about them at

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.500 
anything that I dislike about them at
all<00:00:51.710> okay<00:00:54.220> so<00:00:55.220> the<00:00:55.370> first<00:00:55.400> one<00:00:55.820> I'm<00:00:56.120> going<00:00:56.300> to

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
all okay so the first one I'm going to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.910 
all okay so the first one I'm going to
show<00:00:56.660> you<00:00:56.720> is<00:00:57.080> called<00:00:57.550> Pro<00:00:58.550> tow<00:00:59.089> gay<00:00:59.300> and<00:00:59.920> if

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
show you is called Pro tow gay and if

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.729 
show you is called Pro tow gay and if
you're<00:01:00.980> not<00:01:01.220> familiar<00:01:01.460> with<00:01:01.820> tolgay<00:01:02.089> and

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
you're not familiar with tolgay and

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.140 
you're not familiar with tolgay and
basically<00:01:03.739> it<00:01:03.920> literally<00:01:04.400> is<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.610> japanese

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
basically it literally is the japanese

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.090 
basically it literally is the japanese
word<00:01:05.600> for<00:01:05.630> pass<00:01:06.290> and<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:09.740> literal

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
word for pass and the literal

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.590 
word for pass and the literal
translation<00:01:10.250> would<00:01:10.909> mean<00:01:11.570> that<00:01:13.479> it's<00:01:14.479> the

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
translation would mean that it's the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.060 
translation would mean that it's the
mountain<00:01:14.900> passes<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:15.530> it's<00:01:15.680> those<00:01:15.800> kind<00:01:16.010> of

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
mountain passes so it's those kind of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.310 
mountain passes so it's those kind of
twisty<00:01:16.430> turny<00:01:16.670> roads<00:01:17.030> up<00:01:17.659> on<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:17.930> mountains

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
shown here and which is the same thing

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.920 
shown here and which is the same thing
except<00:01:41.829> pitch<00:01:42.829> black<00:01:43.329> except<00:01:44.329> you<00:01:44.539> can<00:01:44.689> only

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
except pitch black except you can only

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.170 
except pitch black except you can only
see<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:46.100> light<00:01:46.280> from<00:01:46.460> your<00:01:46.579> car's<00:01:46.789> headlights

pretty<00:01:47.479> much<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:48.170> just<00:01:48.320> makes<00:01:48.439> it<00:01:48.590> that

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
pretty much and that just makes it that

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.060 
pretty much and that just makes it that
little<00:01:48.920> bit<00:01:49.100> much<00:01:49.310> more<00:01:50.210> difficult

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
little bit much more difficult

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.440 
little bit much more difficult
especially<00:01:52.070> in<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.549> skyline<00:01:52.939> I've<00:01:53.090> got<00:01:53.240> here

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
especially in the skyline I've got here

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.670 
especially in the skyline I've got here
as<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:55.130> weight<00:01:55.460> of<00:01:55.700> this<00:01:56.270> car<00:01:56.539> is<00:01:56.810> ridiculous

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
as the weight of this car is ridiculous

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.429 
as the weight of this car is ridiculous
making<00:01:58.310> very<00:01:58.909> very<00:01:59.509> hard<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.899> judge<00:02:00.109> and

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
making very very hard to judge and

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.730 
making very very hard to judge and
making<00:02:00.680> this<00:02:00.740> rather<00:02:00.979> interesting<00:02:02.560> this<00:02:03.560> is<00:02:03.710> a
