00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
in the grand Buchla in 2014 look at the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.070 
in the grand Buchla in 2014 look at the
results<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.970> see<00:02:40.180> he<00:02:40.270> was<00:02:40.390> really<00:02:40.630> close<00:02:40.870> to

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
results and I see he was really close to

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.180 
results and I see he was really close to
me<00:02:41.730> by<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.790> his<00:02:43.030> second<00:02:43.420> place<00:02:44.110> in<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.950> flat

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
me by the his second place in the flat

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.789 
me by the his second place in the flat
TT<00:02:46.090> so<00:02:46.510> he's<00:02:46.780> really<00:02:47.110> strong<00:02:47.410> one<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:48.519> think

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
TT so he's really strong one I think

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.650 
TT so he's really strong one I think
when<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:50.980> tantras<00:02:51.549> are<00:02:51.700> harder<00:02:52.120> more<00:02:52.330> really

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
when the tantras are harder more really

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.400 
when the tantras are harder more really
really<00:02:53.500> one<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.920> best<00:02:54.810> TT<00:02:55.810> riders<00:02:56.200> in<00:02:56.320> the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
really one of the best TT riders in the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.280 
really one of the best TT riders in the
world<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:56.890> no<00:02:57.549> question<00:02:57.940> about<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.290> he's

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
world so no question about it he's

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.820 
world so no question about it he's
always<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.920> dangerous<00:03:00.610> contender<00:03:01.709> but<00:03:02.709> his

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
always a dangerous contender but his

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.400 
always a dangerous contender but his
rivals<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:03.489> mind<00:03:03.790> Tony<00:03:04.239> Martin<00:03:04.720> continues<00:03:05.260> to

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
rivals in mind Tony Martin continues to

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.960

I<00:03:17.620> really<00:03:18.620> like<00:03:18.769> to<00:03:18.980> button<00:03:19.609> between

give<00:03:27.019> me<00:03:27.170> known<00:03:27.409> you<00:03:27.769> input<00:03:28.189> in<00:03:28.340> your<00:03:28.370> ideas

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
give me known you input in your ideas

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.780 
give me known you input in your ideas
and<00:03:29.209> you<00:03:29.359> try<00:03:29.659> maybe<00:03:29.900> 10<00:03:30.260> new<00:03:30.530> things<00:03:30.859> and<00:03:31.219> 9

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
and you try maybe 10 new things and 9

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.750 
and you try maybe 10 new things and 9
won't<00:03:32.389> work<00:03:32.629> out<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.260> one<00:03:33.709> maybe<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.519> see

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
won't work out and one maybe you see

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.020 
won't work out and one maybe you see
little<00:03:34.969> bit<00:03:35.150> advantage<00:03:35.719> so<00:03:36.849> just<00:03:37.849> really

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
little bit advantage so just really

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.039 
little bit advantage so just really
really<00:03:38.750> just<00:03:38.930> can<00:03:39.139> change<00:03:39.769> small<00:03:40.579> details

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
really just can change small details

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.869 
really just can change small details
their<00:03:42.049> answer<00:03:42.590> Fagin<00:03:42.950> will<00:03:43.159> look<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.459> dominate

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
their answer Fagin will look to dominate

somewhat different discipline the end a

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.500 
somewhat different discipline the end a
big<00:03:51.200> goal<00:03:51.379> is<00:03:51.590> like<00:03:52.430> always<00:03:52.669> to<00:03:53.389> go

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
big goal is like always to go

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.179 
big goal is like always to go
championships<00:03:54.109> at<00:03:54.439> the<00:03:54.530> end<00:03:54.739> of<00:03:54.829> this<00:03:54.949> season

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
championships at the end of this season

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.800 
championships at the end of this season
I<00:03:55.459> mean<00:03:55.689> the<00:03:56.689> biggest<00:03:56.989> one<00:03:57.310> then<00:03:58.310> as<00:03:58.489> well<00:03:58.810> the

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
I mean the biggest one then as well the

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.839 
I mean the biggest one then as well the
true<00:04:00.019> difference<00:04:00.169> with<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.859> control<00:04:01.579> at<00:04:01.699> the

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
true difference with the control at the

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.140 
true difference with the control at the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
end of the octa Torah also will see how

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.289 
end of the octa Torah also will see how
I<00:04:05.180> will<00:04:05.650> go<00:04:06.650> with<00:04:06.889> the<00:04:06.980> couples<00:04:07.370> in<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:07.760> to<00:04:08.180> the

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
I will go with the couples in the to the

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.319 
I will go with the couples in the to the
front<00:04:08.540> so<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:09.049> also<00:04:09.319> can<00:04:09.879> give<00:04:10.879> you<00:04:11.000> a<00:04:11.060> little

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
front so it also can give you a little

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.599 
front so it also can give you a little
bit<00:04:11.419> of<00:04:11.540> direction<00:04:12.109> for<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.349> future<00:04:12.769> so<00:04:13.219> I'm

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
bit of direction for the future so I'm

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.479 
bit of direction for the future so I'm
open<00:04:14.000> for<00:04:14.030> everything<00:04:14.569> and<00:04:15.160> yeah<00:04:16.160> maybe<00:04:16.340> I

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
will do in the future some more or

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.019 
will do in the future some more or
one-day<00:04:20.810> races
