00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
start out with a script and you break it

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.720 
start out with a script and you break it
down<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.740> figure<00:00:22.980> out<00:00:23.039> how<00:00:23.279> many<00:00:23.340> changes

down and you figure out how many changes
each<00:00:24.060> character<00:00:24.539> has<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.350> what<00:00:25.920> kind<00:00:26.220> of

together I know we do fittings of course

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.590 
together I know we do fittings of course
with<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> characters<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.370> that's<00:00:36.300> how<00:00:36.480> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
with the characters and that's how it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.979 
with the characters and that's how it
works

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
works

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.639 
works
now<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.350> let's<00:00:37.680> say<00:00:37.890> shake<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.579> up<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> very

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
now I let's say shake it up is a very

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.760 
now I let's say shake it up is a very
colorful<00:00:40.649> show<00:00:40.860> that's<00:00:41.340> for<00:00:41.610> sure<00:00:42.710> why<00:00:43.710> it

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
colorful show that's for sure why it

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.709 
colorful show that's for sure why it
goes<00:00:44.070> into<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> process<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.360> picking

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
goes into the process of just picking

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.810 
goes into the process of just picking
out<00:00:45.809> all<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.110> clothes<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.770> terms<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
color each character almost has their

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.360 
color each character almost has their

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.280 
out at me at the store and that's
probably<00:01:13.830> how<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.040> started<00:01:14.670> hmm<00:01:15.390> but<00:01:15.810> most<00:01:16.080> of

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
probably how I started hmm but most of

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.410 
probably how I started hmm but most of
the<00:01:16.409> clothes<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:16.979> get<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.520> alter<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.119> some

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the clothes that we get we alter in some

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.410 
the clothes that we get we alter in some
way<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:19.590> heighten<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.670> shake<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> up

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
way to just heighten it for shake it up

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.170 
way to just heighten it for shake it up
because<00:01:21.920> all<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.979> these<00:01:23.189> characters<00:01:23.700> are<00:01:23.909> very

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
because all of these characters are very

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.600 
because all of these characters are very
involved<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:25.080> their<00:01:25.470> clothes<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> show

off the rack
we<00:01:30.150> try<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.509> imagine<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.170> everything<00:01:31.770> that
