guess really what I wanted to say just a

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.469 
guess really what I wanted to say just a
quick<00:07:45.710> little<00:07:45.740> video<00:07:46.130> you<00:07:46.849> know<00:07:46.940> voicing<00:07:47.450> that

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:53.270

how even think they want to see the MMA
fights<00:07:57.050> on<00:07:57.260> that<00:07:57.380> I<00:07:57.410> don't<00:07:57.620> think<00:07:57.800> the<00:07:57.919> boxing

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:58.370
