00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.420
 in this section we will see 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.520
 how to write the opening and closing of the setback 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.690
 the ghost notes the accents 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.569
 and the three children 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:16.749
 the opening of the mishap is indicated by a small letter ok 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.150
 about the note in question 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.960
 and the closing of the mishap is indicated by a small letter 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.859
 for the case that we see on the screen 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.449
 the opening of the setback we will do in time 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.769
 two and a half 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.300
 and the closing what we are going to do in time number 3 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.319
 this compass like this in bits per minute 

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:42.319
 it would be more or less like that 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.159
 in a luque three repetitions 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.159
 it would be more or less like that 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.450
 on the other hand the ghost notes esquivel enclosing the note in question 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.770
 in a small parenthesis 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.270
 remember that a ghost note 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.500
 few note 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.930
 is one that is played with a lesser force 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.980
 that the main note 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.000
 at a rate of 80 pitt per minute the compass that we see on the screen would serve 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 more or less so 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.380
 now let's listen to the same beat in a luxury 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.380
 three repetitions 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.689
 Accented notes are indicated by placing a symbol of greater than 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.700
 an accented note is the opposite of a ghost note ie 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.100
 must touch 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.190
 stronger 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.449
 that the rest of the notes 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:12.529
 and they do not serve to mark dynamism in our executions 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.959
 so in bits per minute the score we see on the screen 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.540
 it would serve more or less like this 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.540
 the lute three repetitions 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.540
 it would be more or less like that 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.939
 now let's see how the three of them are drawn to other dishes 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:49.849
 if we had to catalog them we would say that there are two types of three 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.649
 them the three garage seals 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:55.079
 hockey the udc sectors 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.649
 and the three seals of my garage 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:00.689
 or six red nokia thorax 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.959
 on screen we have at 3 'and I am a car 

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:06.370
 that are drawn 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.779
 placing equidistant 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.829
 three garages throughout all the time 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:17.009
 and also adding a small number 3 on the notes 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:22.969
 contrary to traditional courtesies that during half vip each 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:27.309
 the garages of three and I last only one third undefeated 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.269
 this kind of three centuries can be counted in two different ways 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.769
 the first one would be 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.569
 how many whipple schÃ¼tz flee 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.849
 in fact and former employees luckily I had 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.059
 and the second 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:44.759
 which is simpler 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:45.979
 would be 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:49.819
 guancha tutas tuta that's why tacha a forks acta 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:53.269
 at 80 feet per minute 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.750
 the compass that we have on the screen would do something like this 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:06.359
 for its part 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.849
 the three sixteenth-century sites are drawn by placing 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.660
 3m eighth notes 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.540
 in an equidistant way but this time covering only half time 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:23.050
 in the same way on of this sixteenths a small 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.069
 number 3 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.069
 this type of triples can be counted 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.949
 guanche jobs the led fipp 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.090
 its triplet the simple fact that psoe and pp the psoe and pp by sectors the psoe 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.009
 can 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.240
 more simply 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.800
 how much does the cha cha tuta act the tata sui tata the tata fortabat chad el 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.389
 tata 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.520
 the compass that we see on the screen 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.879
 at a rate of 50 vips per minute 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.879
 it would serve more or less like this 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.129
 of course, as you can imagine, we can make combinations with 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:13.979
 previous 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.999
 let's suppose this case where I wish to touch tresillos de cort be 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:23.049
 but apart I want to emphasize the first note of each 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.339
 What I would do is draw the three stamps 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:33.189
 and aside to place the symbol of greater than envelope of the first cut be of 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:35.050
 each 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.000
 the above at 80 vips per minute 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.520
 it would look more or less like this
