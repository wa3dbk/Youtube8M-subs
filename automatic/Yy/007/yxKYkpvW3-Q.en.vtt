 1080 real pixels or 720 commissioners 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.350
 stereoscopic the results are not so 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.600
 striking as those of pc although in

 specials from the USA as part of a 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.130
 elite body we had to 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.040
 move to the sea of ​​philippines where 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.840
 the military forces of North Korea 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.730
 they pretended to take over the stranger 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.890
 discovery made by the team 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.220
 of scientists from the United Nations- 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.990
 sent to the place in our mission 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.210
 besides seeing us with the military 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.940
 heavily armed we discover that the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.820
 worst threat had come from space 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.950
 with the peculiarities and successes of 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.929
 this game were many but among all 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.709
 they highlighted the one that we carry a 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.450
 special suit the nanosuit this one 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.520
 allowed to camouflage those with the environment 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.050
 making them invisible enhanced 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.810
 our armor and resistance to 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.600
 shots we could run faster 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.120
 jump long distances throw objects 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.800

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.870
 high places 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.120
 each of these actions spent 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.550
 our energy more or less quickly 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.900
 having to recharge for about 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.209
 few seconds 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.920
 the great scenarios allowed us 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.680
 address the situation of different 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.079
 ways according to the type of player out 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.030
 empowering stealth action by using 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.870
 stage elements or combinations 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.060
 of all of them 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.670
 each weapon had a series of accessories 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.379
 that we could activate or not were the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.290
 predetermined weapons or those that we 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:00.540
 We were finding the enemies 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.489
 they presented good intelligence they 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.799
 watching call reinforcements and positioning 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.650
 in strategic places to give us hunt 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.480
 the campaign mode was close to 10 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.909
 hours with the possibility of 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.980
 fulfill secondary missions we had 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.160
 wide freedom of exploration of 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.320
 environment 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.330
 in their sonorous setting the 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.940
 pretty realistic shots and the 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.100
 explosions and the game was totally 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.110
 located 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.050

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.730
 for up to 32 simultaneous players something 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.310
 that disappeared in the bots 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.530

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.960
 story in the year 2008 crisis was launched 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.510

 the island during the events of crisis 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.090
 in this way we take advantage of the 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.520
 launch of crysis 3 to remember 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:56.070
