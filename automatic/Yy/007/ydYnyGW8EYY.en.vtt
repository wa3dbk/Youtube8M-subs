00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
three sections because we are going to

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.180 
three sections because we are going to
loosely<00:02:34.270> braid<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.870> um<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.710> you<00:02:35.890> couldn't<00:02:36.130> do

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
the middle strand and I'm just going to

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.560 
the middle strand and I'm just going to
repeat<00:03:05.830> that<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.150> doesn't<00:03:07.360> need<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.540> be

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
repeat that and it doesn't need to be

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.570 
repeat that and it doesn't need to be
you<00:03:07.900> know<00:03:08.280> nice<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.610> can<00:03:09.670> be<00:03:09.790> very<00:03:09.970> loose<00:03:10.269> and

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
you know nice it can be very loose and

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.800 
you know nice it can be very loose and
because<00:03:12.580> we're<00:03:12.670> going<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.880> be<00:03:13.090> pulling<00:03:13.660> it

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
because we're going to be pulling it

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.490 
because we're going to be pulling it
apart<00:03:13.900> anyways<00:03:15.959> okay<00:03:16.959> so<00:03:17.019> when<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.350> get<00:03:17.440> to

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
apart anyways okay so when you get to

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.110 
apart anyways okay so when you get to
the<00:03:17.739> end<00:03:17.860> you<00:03:18.160> don't<00:03:18.250> need<00:03:18.430> an<00:03:18.519> elastic<00:03:18.970> hair

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
pulling it apart and the point of this

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.350 
pulling it apart and the point of this
this<00:03:23.950> bun<00:03:24.130> is<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:24.489> not<00:03:24.610> necessarily<00:03:24.640> look<00:03:25.180> like

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
this bun is to not necessarily look like
