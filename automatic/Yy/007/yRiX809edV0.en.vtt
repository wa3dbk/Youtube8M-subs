00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.759
 we look at the recently released game 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.709
 which is called toy history and this 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.269
 mind blowing puzzle in which 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:16.470
 we will have to play 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.180
 way vader can you see well everything 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.730

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.090
 and who did not look sure to look 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.230

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.010
 various levels here let's 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.350
 run 1 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.539
 this game is something like angry birds but 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.539
 on the other hand it is a completely different game 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:08.040
 something it takes a long time to load and here it is 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.590
 we've got a tutor here 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.619
 cool the fact that this game is completely on 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.369

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.970

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.619

 but in general, the toy is very 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.410
