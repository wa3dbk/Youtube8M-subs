may know from the story mode it's pretty
cool<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.420> think<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.379> cool

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
cool and I think it's just really cool

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.110 
cool and I think it's just really cool
to<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.770> able<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.070> reskin<00:00:47.489> your<00:00:47.700> character

multiplayer

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.650 
multiplayer
I<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.550> Rockstar<00:00:50.940> should<00:00:51.090> allow<00:00:51.300> us<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
I think Rockstar should allow us the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.360 
I think Rockstar should allow us the
players<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.559> able<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.770> play<00:00:52.920> different

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
players to be able to play different

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.470 
players to be able to play different
characters<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.239> might<00:00:54.420> be

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
characters like this and it might be

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.990 
characters like this and it might be
happening<00:00:55.110> very<00:00:55.140> soon<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.860> an<00:00:55.980> upcoming<00:00:56.160> DLC
