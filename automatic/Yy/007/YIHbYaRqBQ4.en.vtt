00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.320
 totally nice to watch you 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.630
 new video of mine often an ow and in 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.369
 this video I like the avermedia 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.669
 to review live kemer portable 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.279
 because I'm from gamegear point b 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.759
 I catch this port medial to this one 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.920
 reviewing 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.680
 and then I also do in this video 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.440
 if you open the box first is here 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.320
 is a beautiful beauty lying right in it 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.219
 box when you open it when you then 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.589
 from box 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.239
 of course we immediately see the HDMI slots 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.260
 and the connections you need to 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.480
 use 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.940
 but I will come back to that later 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.159
 opening the second phase of the box 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.100
 namely every stitching off and then see 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.289
 namely you split an I card 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.879
 this a the media gaming bla bla some 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.350
 hdr you get xp-30 for free for three months 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.150
 gift or you can go with that 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.010
 livestreamen further when you get the box 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.110
 open a little bit in la there 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.360
 difficult about namely you need some kind 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.520
 from box to box and now 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.600
 was awkward but eventually it is 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.610
 I succeeded 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.130
 and if you make that box sit too 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.830
 here all cables in say the cables 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.530
 those at port media that are 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.180
 like the HDMI cables and so on 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.930
 let's pass all cables one by one 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.510
 to go 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.130
 you get a component cable white 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.210
 but a cable that I connect to you 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.680
 old xbox 360 that did not stand 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.090
 supports HDMI port like I do here 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.530
 home stand 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.010
 you get one 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:51.500
 3.5 mm audio cable 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.970
 you get this a usb cable you say 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.960
 of course your images right on you 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.650
 computer 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.630
 you get a playstation 3 cable 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.780
 I was just looking for what is there then 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.340
 for fuzzy cable but this cable that plugs 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.240
 you namely directly in playstation 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.649
 3 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.810
 hero a lot of people suffer is that 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.459
 a playstation 3 of wires hdmi 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.200
 signal outputs so you can not 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.400
 capture and with these cables of course 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.050
 solved 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.000
 furthermore actually a nice hdmi 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.640
 cable so you can start right away and 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.170
 do not purchase additional HDMI cables 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.790
 only very short 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.860
 furthermore you also get a very cool case 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.150
 because it is an avermedia 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.430
 portable 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.650
 either the game and yes a whole 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.230
 beautiful protective cover is of course ideal 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.459
 unfortunately the not your HDMI cables in so 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.380
 they should just be your pocket 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.810
 stop or something similar and sd card 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.519
 is also out before it breaks 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.470
 if you look at the avermedia here you look 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.660
 have the switch and the side here you can 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.549
 choose whether you go through the PC or through a 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.440
 record SD card and that makes it 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:52.280
 device is a super special 6 here 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.950
 This is the SD card input does good 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.410
 SD card in one can immediately 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.120
 you can see the AV here in its closure there 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.880
 You can clear your components on Calis 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.970
 connecting hd mies speak for themselves 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.560
 and you also have an audio in audio out and 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.690
 that is really nice if your pc we record 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.329
 but philip is certainly natural too 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.340
 just depriving sound over HDMI signal 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.989
 this is the front of avermedia press 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.680
 that button and it immediately starts to go up 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.570
 take 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.310
 if you say you bought then you must 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.290
 to the website to have media to the 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.910
 download software that just goes 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.350
 a link that a box is zegmaar 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.400
 gamer such a point 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.359
 avermedia a bit and press download 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.340
 download it is not that much 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.470
 this is who out of 80 90 and b 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.750
 so you downloaded it this Wednesday 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.390
 installs you own these supers 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.549
 need intro and jingles and that shizzle 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.260
 just say if you have your avermedia software on 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.910
 start here you can set what you want 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.870
 all you want you can choose from all 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.459
 tower from buro and from newbie so say it 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.890
 know nothing about it then click 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.480
 that I start effe with louis and me 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.040
 click on everything one by one 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.860
 now who is pretty simple you click 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.170
 blow on 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.230
 picture that push that tact and if it's right 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.180
 it works the same but as youtuber 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.810
 being that would not want a two three 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.490
 to do 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.440
 why in the best of course 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.930
 quality swipe and that is handy 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.790
 to tweak myself a little bit 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.650
 amateur in itself is reasonable 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.150
 professional because you can do everything 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.040
 change and it goes very well here 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.200
 easy step by step so you can choose 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.350
 what videos as you want audio type 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.180
 videos settings and then you even see it 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.190
 but if you have bitrate it changes 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.380
 quality difference in the picture is it 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.690
 also shows how much nicer it is 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.010
 if you use higher bitrate and we pro 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.120
 can just be one by one all 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.340
 institutions along 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.350
 what I find very useful is the duo 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.600
 those components connections it is 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.760
 so i can use my xbox one and my xbox 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.700
 360 at the same time as connecting 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.350
 xbox one with the hdmi and exposure with the 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.180
 component and then I just have to be here 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.400
 effe switch between videos sjors 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.169
 otherwise I naturally traffic on TV 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.730
 well you can choose video format you can 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.500
 adjust the resolution here 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.750
 you can with the avermedia and very high 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.820
 record the bitrate this means you 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.790
 image and will look much nicer 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.640
 you can already record up to 60 mbps two 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.470
 can record up to 14 with the hd pvr 2 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.060
 furthermore i also stream with it 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.020
 program and just choose whole 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.470
 easy with at 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.720
 amateur pro or nobi and you can do that before 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.250
 naturally we hung in depends on how 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.900
 strong computer then you have to log in 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.700
 and okay we follow to twitch stream or 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.470
 something like that but yes why would you 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.660
 use it as of course the first 3 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.850
 months free on I split 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.070
 here cm port media and operation cam 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.320
 connected with my pc you press it 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.390
 bud and agate red bottle at the moment 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.350
 that it is recording and still press it 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.120
 once again 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.460
 then it stops recording and there is 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.960
 blue here 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.910
 I also have some recordings of course 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.460
 made to look at how well the 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.770
 Quality is really well and it looks 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.510
 really very nice looking like it is in 60 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.300
 mbps 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.460
 only yes you know you have to weigh it 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.380
 costs a lot of disk space 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.760
 or your youtube videos will be natural 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.100
 super big this only longer with 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.440
 the kids so I'm going to wish some 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.169
 a maximum of 20 mbps to go on youtube 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.120
 and further it looks super nice to you 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.340
 can therefore also use this captcha kart 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.449
 for example to capture your pc if you 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.430
 also a natural for that 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:13.800
 speed turns a will not fps loose 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.990
 then you can just have this avermedia 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.849
 hanging on with a hdmi i got you too 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.749
 what call or fill 4 gameplay on the xbox 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.889
 one 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:21.930
 it also just looks great 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.370
 is beautiful from the greatest benefit to 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.960
 I still think that you have a capture card 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.270
 say portable can use 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.309
 you put a sd card in it can 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.469
 the next games will come or location 

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:34.289
 for the e3 you ask the publisher or 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:36.059
 you record some gameplay and you have one 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:38.460
 HDMI cable to plug and it works 

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:40.319
 so of course super and affixes really 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.539
 super good about this captcha tight fit 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:43.770
 of course it is super good quality 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:46.349
 here you can also see some gameplay 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.960
 my from gta 5 it is recorded on the 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:51.870
 xbox 360 is the fourth component connection 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.759
 You also want 720 p of this capture card 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.860
 purchase if I have a new youtuber
