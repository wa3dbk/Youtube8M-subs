00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
in under three minutes and Mira this

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.709 
in under three minutes and Mira this
bastard<00:01:19.009> man<00:01:19.159> he<00:01:19.369> has<00:01:19.549> auto<00:01:19.880> guard<00:01:20.119> on<00:01:20.329> fleek

here are the rewards for this battle you

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.679 
here are the rewards for this battle you
get<00:01:49.130> mirror<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:49.490> tools<00:01:49.700> clothing<00:01:49.909> you<00:01:50.509> get<00:01:50.659> a

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
get mirror and tools clothing you get a

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.450 
get mirror and tools clothing you get a
random<00:01:51.020> Z<00:01:51.289> so<00:01:51.469> I<00:01:51.500> don't<00:01:51.740> really<00:01:51.799> care<00:01:51.950> about

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
random Z so I don't really care about

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.160 
random Z so I don't really care about
uh-hum<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.090> then<00:01:53.210> you<00:01:53.329> get<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.719> gallic<00:01:54.020> beam

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
uh-hum and then you get the gallic beam

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.450 
uh-hum and then you get the gallic beam
cannon<00:01:54.530> which<00:01:54.649> is<00:01:54.770> essentially<00:01:55.070> just<00:01:55.130> a

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
cannon which is essentially just a

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.700 
cannon which is essentially just a
Gallic<00:01:55.820> gun<00:01:56.060> just<00:01:56.450> different<00:01:56.840> color<00:01:56.990> and

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
Gallic gun just different color and

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.620 
Gallic gun just different color and
fitting<00:01:57.979> explosion<00:01:58.460> which<00:01:58.579> is<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.759> chi<00:01:59.060> barrier

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
fitting explosion which is a chi barrier

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.359 
fitting explosion which is a chi barrier
blast<00:01:59.930> which<00:02:00.469> really<00:02:00.710> sucks<00:02:00.979> because<00:02:01.189> it

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
blast which really sucks because it

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.550 
blast which really sucks because it
takes<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.579> long<00:02:01.729> time<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:02.299> boot<00:02:02.780> up<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.079> this

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
takes a long time to boot up and this

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.160 
takes a long time to boot up and this
serious<00:02:04.009> bomb<00:02:04.219> I<00:02:04.520> really<00:02:05.329> don't<00:02:05.570> know<00:02:05.719> I<00:02:05.960> heard

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
serious bomb I really don't know I heard

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.749 
serious bomb I really don't know I heard
it<00:02:06.229> was<00:02:06.320> an<00:02:06.409> ultimate<00:02:06.679> I<00:02:06.950> heard<00:02:07.159> it<00:02:07.280> was<00:02:07.369> really

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
it was an ultimate I heard it was really

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.340 
it was an ultimate I heard it was really
really<00:02:07.939> nice<00:02:08.119> because<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.570> was<00:02:08.660> all<00:02:08.840> serious

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
really nice because it was all serious

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.560 
really nice because it was all serious
hence<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:10.009> name<00:02:10.160> serious<00:02:10.610> bomb<00:02:10.820> I<00:02:11.090> don't<00:02:11.510> know

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
hence the name serious bomb I don't know

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.330 
hence the name serious bomb I don't know
if<00:02:11.630> I<00:02:11.660> was<00:02:11.750> in<00:02:11.840> control<00:02:12.080> but<00:02:12.680> people<00:02:12.920> said<00:02:13.130> that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
it was a nice ultimate if it is even or

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.770 
it was a nice ultimate if it is even or

because<00:02:51.709> literally<00:02:52.430> I'll<00:02:52.610> have<00:02:52.760> two<00:02:52.970> bars<00:02:53.209> it

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
because literally I'll have two bars it

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.630 
because literally I'll have two bars it
two<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.930> half<00:02:54.080> bars<00:02:54.320> of<00:02:54.500> key<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:54.950> I'll<00:02:55.430> have

two and a half bars of key and I'll have

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.130 
two and a half bars of key and I'll have
a<00:02:55.670> little<00:02:56.030> bit<00:02:56.269> of<00:02:56.360> house<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:56.750> it's<00:02:56.930> really

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
a little bit of house so it's really

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.949 
a little bit of house so it's really
detrimental<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.920> your<00:02:58.910> build<00:02:59.239> if<00:02:59.510> you're<00:02:59.750> not

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
detrimental to your build if you're not

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.720 
detrimental to your build if you're not
you<00:03:00.620> know<00:03:00.769> a<00:03:00.800> build<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.250> revolves<00:03:01.640> around

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
you know a build that revolves around

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.670 
you know a build that revolves around
health<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.239> key<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:02.569> if<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:02.959> don't<00:03:03.500> have<00:03:03.620> a

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
is the only way this is the only

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.340 
is the only way this is the only
annoying<00:05:07.300> thing<00:05:07.570> about<00:05:07.630> Korra

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
annoying thing about Korra

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
annoying thing about Korra
that<00:05:08.560> makes<00:05:08.800> it<00:05:08.890> a<00:05:08.980> little<00:05:09.040> bit<00:05:09.190> difficult

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
that makes it a little bit difficult

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.280 
that makes it a little bit difficult
when<00:05:09.670> she<00:05:09.790> comes<00:05:10.030> in<00:05:10.210> it's<00:05:10.660> the<00:05:10.780> fact<00:05:11.020> that<00:05:11.080> her

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
when she comes in it's the fact that her

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.660 
when she comes in it's the fact that her
mutation<00:05:11.770> skill<00:05:11.950> actually<00:05:12.160> allows<00:05:12.520> her<00:05:12.640> to

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
mutation skill actually allows her to

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.130 
mutation skill actually allows her to
disappear<00:05:12.880> for<00:05:13.330> a<00:05:13.360> couple<00:05:13.420> of<00:05:13.660> seconds<00:05:14.080> so

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
disappear for a couple of seconds so

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.350 
disappear for a couple of seconds so
she'll<00:05:14.950> be<00:05:14.980> off<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.430> radar<00:05:15.700> for<00:05:15.850> a<00:05:16.060> couple<00:05:16.300> of

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
she'll be off the radar for a couple of

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.750 
she'll be off the radar for a couple of
seconds<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:17.310> unfortunately<00:05:18.310> that<00:05:18.400> means<00:05:18.520> for

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
seconds and unfortunately that means for

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.340 
seconds and unfortunately that means for
you<00:05:18.910> that<00:05:19.270> you<00:05:19.540> won't<00:05:19.630> be<00:05:19.780> able<00:05:19.840> to<00:05:19.930> attack<00:05:20.170> her

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
you that you won't be able to attack her

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.680 
you that you won't be able to attack her
and<00:05:20.530> that<00:05:20.740> degrades<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:21.790> overall<00:05:22.120> time<00:05:22.360> limit

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
and that degrades the overall time limit

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.390 
and that degrades the overall time limit
and<00:05:22.810> that's<00:05:23.260> not<00:05:23.440> good<00:05:23.650> because<00:05:23.680> remember<00:05:24.220> we

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
and that's not good because remember we

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.680 
and that's not good because remember we
gotta<00:05:24.550> defeat<00:05:24.730> these<00:05:24.850> guys<00:05:25.060> in<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.360> three

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
gotta defeat these guys in the three

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.990 
gotta defeat these guys in the three
minutes<00:05:26.020> so<00:05:26.710> so<00:05:27.040> far<00:05:27.220> so<00:05:27.280> good<00:05:27.430> I'm<00:05:27.820> actually
