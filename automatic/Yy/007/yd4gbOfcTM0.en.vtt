00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
between this object it appears to be a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.850 
between this object it appears to be a
fairly<00:01:32.340> large<00:01:32.579> craft<00:01:33.409> at<00:01:34.409> fairly<00:01:34.829> low

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860

altitude<00:01:35.659> big<00:01:36.659> surprise<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.439> doesn't<00:01:37.710> make

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
altitude big surprise it doesn't make

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.109 
altitude big surprise it doesn't make
one<00:01:38.070> goddamn<00:01:38.549> sound<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:41.460> real<00:01:41.670> special

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
one goddamn sound and the real special

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.090 
one goddamn sound and the real special
thing<00:01:42.299> about<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.649> has<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
thing about this is that it has the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.600 
thing about this is that it has the
ability<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:45.750> change<00:01:45.780> its<00:01:46.439> configuration<00:01:46.610> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
ability to change its configuration and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.410 
ability to change its configuration and
this<00:01:48.509> leads<00:01:48.720> me<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.680> topic<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.820> fake

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
this leads me to the topic of fake

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.700 
this leads me to the topic of fake
planes<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.380> mimicry<00:01:53.810> watch<00:01:54.810> carefully<00:01:55.170> here

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
planes and mimicry watch carefully here

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.249 
planes and mimicry watch carefully here
and<00:01:55.890> you're<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:57.149> vehicle<00:01:58.049> if

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
and you're going to see this vehicle if

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.219 
and you're going to see this vehicle if

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
it is in fact the vehicle changes

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.469 
it is in fact the vehicle changes
configuration<00:02:02.040> dramatically<00:02:02.820> over<00:02:03.420> the

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
impressive in my opinion these are still

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.880

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
of my channel is planet under attack I

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.350 
of my channel is planet under attack I
don't<00:05:06.800> currently<00:05:07.070> think<00:05:07.550> that<00:05:07.729> we<00:05:07.880> are<00:05:08.060> under

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
don't currently think that we are under

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.560 
don't currently think that we are under
any<00:05:08.479> kind<00:05:08.690> of<00:05:08.840> attack<00:05:09.970> I'm<00:05:10.970> approached<00:05:11.389> about

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
any kind of attack I'm approached about

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.469 
any kind of attack I'm approached about
this<00:05:11.810> quite<00:05:12.229> often<00:05:12.850> it<00:05:13.850> was<00:05:13.970> a<00:05:14.030> name<00:05:14.300> I<00:05:14.449> chose

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
this quite often it was a name I chose

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.050 
this quite often it was a name I chose
because<00:05:15.169> I<00:05:15.350> thought<00:05:15.590> it<00:05:15.650> sounded<00:05:15.949> cool<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.759> I

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
because I thought it sounded cool and I

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.249 
because I thought it sounded cool and I
thought<00:05:17.270> people<00:05:17.570> would<00:05:18.169> remember<00:05:18.350> it<00:05:20.259> I'm

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
thought people would remember it I'm

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:22.570 
thought people would remember it I'm
here<00:05:21.470> towards<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.800> end<00:05:21.949> of<00:05:22.009> his<00:05:22.160> original

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
here towards the end of his original

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.270 
here towards the end of his original
video<00:05:23.090> I<00:05:23.389> believe<00:05:24.229> this<00:05:24.410> is<00:05:24.560> just<00:05:24.800> raw<00:05:25.009> footage

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
video I believe this is just raw footage

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.480 
video I believe this is just raw footage
here<00:05:25.550> i<00:05:25.610> have<00:05:25.759> added<00:05:26.090> a<00:05:26.270> filter<00:05:26.570> to<00:05:26.600> it<00:05:27.460> we<00:05:28.460> can

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
here i have added a filter to it we can

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.090 
here i have added a filter to it we can
see<00:05:28.820> that<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.539> craft<00:05:29.960> is<00:05:30.260> dramatically

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
see that the craft is dramatically

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:37.150 
see that the craft is dramatically
different<00:05:31.220> than<00:05:31.820> when<00:05:32.780> it<00:05:32.870> first<00:05:33.080> appeared<00:05:36.160> is

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
different than when it first appeared is

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.529 
different than when it first appeared is
this<00:05:37.520> a<00:05:37.580> drone<00:05:38.000> that<00:05:38.570> we<00:05:38.660> don't<00:05:38.780> know<00:05:38.990> about<00:05:39.020> I

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
this a drone that we don't know about I
