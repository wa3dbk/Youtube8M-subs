00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:43.699 
can't see the bonds so there are find
one<00:03:36.150> they're<00:03:37.150> really<00:03:39.329> thin<00:03:40.859> little<00:03:42.000> keratin

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
one they're really thin little keratin

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.599 
one they're really thin little keratin
bits<00:03:44.709> which<00:03:45.599> is<00:03:46.599> keratin<00:03:47.109> bonds<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:47.859> they<00:03:48.400> use

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
bits which is keratin bonds so they use

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.159 
bits which is keratin bonds so they use
a<00:03:48.639> tool<00:03:49.060> which<00:03:49.090> heats<00:03:49.419> up<00:03:49.569> to<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:49.989> they

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
a tool which heats up to it and they

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:55.890 
a tool which heats up to it and they
like<00:03:50.319> 26<00:03:50.739> degrees<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:53.620> know<00:03:54.479> it<00:03:55.479> seals<00:03:55.750> on

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
like 26 degrees and you know it seals on
