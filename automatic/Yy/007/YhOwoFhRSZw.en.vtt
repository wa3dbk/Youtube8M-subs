now<00:00:53.250> that's<00:00:53.430> not<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> important<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.390> here

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
now that's not the important one here

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.939 
now that's not the important one here

take<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.479> look<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.110> application<00:01:43.320> it's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
take a look at the application it's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.719 
take a look at the application it's
really<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> take<00:01:44.220> advantage<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.640> this

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
really going to take advantage of this

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.990 
really going to take advantage of this
that<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.659> pro<00:01:46.049> cam<00:01:46.409> app

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
that is the pro cam app

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.730 
that is the pro cam app
and<00:01:47.330> really<00:01:47.540> is<00:01:47.750> how<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:48.050> sounds<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.350> pro<00:01:48.530> cam

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
and really is how it sounds a pro cam

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.150 
and really is how it sounds a pro cam
application<00:01:49.370> we<00:01:49.790> pan<00:01:50.000> out<00:01:50.150> to<00:01:50.330> here<00:01:51.010> you<00:01:52.010> can

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
application we pan out to here you can

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.070 
application we pan out to here you can
see<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:53.000> has<00:01:53.150> your<00:01:53.390> settings<00:01:53.690> right<00:01:53.780> here<00:01:53.840> now

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
it's still simplified so you can just

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.190 
it's still simplified so you can just
place<00:01:55.550> your<00:01:55.670> hit<00:01:55.820> picture<00:01:56.810> button<00:01:56.990> right

there<00:01:59.650> let<00:02:00.650> me<00:02:00.830> take<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.010> shot<00:02:01.220> just<00:02:01.280> like<00:02:01.520> that

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
there let me take a shot just like that

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.030 
there let me take a shot just like that
and<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.750> does<00:02:03.050> take<00:02:03.229> a<00:02:03.260> couple<00:02:03.470> extra<00:02:03.560> seconds

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
and it does take a couple extra seconds

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.100 
and it does take a couple extra seconds
to<00:02:04.100> save<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.550> it<00:02:04.700> but<00:02:04.940> as<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.119> good<00:02:05.810> reason

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
to save to it but as a good reason

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
to save to it but as a good reason
because<00:02:06.170> it's<00:02:06.350> going<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.530> really<00:02:06.710> give<00:02:07.010> you<00:02:07.040> a

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
because it's going to really give you a

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.639 
because it's going to really give you a
really<00:02:07.490> high-quality<00:02:07.670> photo<00:02:08.300> but<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.110> put

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
really high-quality photo but you put

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.870 
really high-quality photo but you put
the<00:02:09.679> one<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.039> things<00:02:10.459> that<00:02:10.520> makes<00:02:10.670> this<00:02:10.789> a

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
the one of the things that makes this a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.610 
the one of the things that makes this a
pro<00:02:11.120> camera<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.660> slides<00:02:12.050> on<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.320> camera

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
pro camera that slides on the camera

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.010 
pro camera that slides on the camera
icon<00:02:12.650> there<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:13.459> get<00:02:13.610> all<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.480> settings<00:02:14.810> here

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
icon there you get all the settings here

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.660 
icon there you get all the settings here
so<00:02:15.500> let's<00:02:15.709> say<00:02:15.800> say<00:02:15.950> something<00:02:16.310> for<00:02:16.459> your

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
so let's say say something for your

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
and in real time see the adjustment that

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.870 
and in real time see the adjustment that
they<00:02:21.350> kind<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.620> come<00:02:21.770> out<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:22.580> gives<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.850> a
