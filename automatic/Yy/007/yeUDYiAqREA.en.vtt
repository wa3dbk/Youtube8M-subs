00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:05.680
 the success of lists lives in the Lausanne region married to corinne he has three 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.570
 athletic toddlers he particularly loves the mountain and the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.429
 Honduras 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.259
 passionate about the Bible he studied theology for six years and then after 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.000
 an experience in pastoral ministry he joined the league for the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.720
 reading of the Bible an association of denominational character so he is the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.499
 director 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.239
 merck is exceptional with the city 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.499
 it's no stroll with a feeling of being a municipal library 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.860
 since we celebrate in the Bible to 66 liters 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.220
 66 'writings by about forty authors over 1500 years of history 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.310
 between colleagues of books 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.270
 the 501 wins very well but then can this not be a book 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.550
 a little outdated 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.570
 so why this feeling that actually exceed them a little 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.570
 dusty 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.460
 nick that's like that 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.220
 the message 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.980
 and a news 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.170
 exceptional site is it even more so today 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.130
 the Bible 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.489
 gold these best-selling plots 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.530
 this a bestseller there is a price to pay anyway after a million 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.500
 of copies per year in the world 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.800
 in Switzerland, 60 million are sold per year 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.310
 and then the Bible or portions of the Bible but still 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.690
 translated about 2300 languages 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.630
 it's the best-selling book in the whole world 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.630
 but how famous is she so extraordinary 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.780
 I believe that what is recommended that his ordinary is his message 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.369
 I would compare to a little 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:34.900
 the Bible 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.260
 as a letter 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.610
 which was written to us by God 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.690
 God 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.670
 a scene 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.180
 and you tell us 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.460
 to Lorient wrote us this letter 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.620
 and elected 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.520
 only the udc 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.700
 most beautiful part of this love letter is still to see godly 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.830
 who sees his son 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.670
 for love for us 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.499
 to get us out of this side of rebellions% this side or 

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:02.340
 we must do capello head 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.970
 he goes to bolivia his son 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.970
 why read the Bible 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:11.149
 I have three main reasons 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:12.699
 the first 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.599
 it is a bestseller r 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.489
 so I say to myself 'if anyone who fought to translate for 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.079
 oppress and to write on the ground 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.119
 it's a good reason to read it 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.269
 the second reason is because I believe that 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.379
 we are all looking for all 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.069
 of our identity who we really are 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.060
 what are we doing on this earth 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.540
 ok the same real problems 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.159
 we are looking for values 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.559
 well I think the beeb answers these questions 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:41.759
 she tells me 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:45.929
 who we are what is the problem how the rossini network 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:50.089
 so it's clear that this not a psychological treatise it's not 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:54.219
 answers all those like that we have to look for them and we have to dig 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:58.129
 but despite all that answering these questions in this quest for identity 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.029
 that we all 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:03.619
 and then the third reason is that I am convinced that every human being 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.339
 to somewhere a picture of god on this picture there 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:12.369
 it can have all possible forms but we all have a picture of 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:13.780
 hard we search all 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.209
 my God 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.579
 and in the Bible says who is really seduced she we decide 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.859
 what is the true image of god 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.859
 while reading this post I'll find out who's playing 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.309
 how the war 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.039
 so to many methods for kids we can go from the beginning to the end 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.819
 beginning first book of youth to last apocalypse 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:38.199
 but it's true that by following this all for the whole year but we 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:41.969
 crosses books that are harder to Iraq because it takes 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:43.319
 confess in the big apple read 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.740
 like more difficult 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.540
 so I just advise you to start with the gospel 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.820
 of luc since seven the revenge on which was passed the film that 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.229
 you want to see 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.719
 so how to very concretely take info take a little while in his 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:59.119
 quiet day if possible in a place where we are well 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.719
 if you like coffee - little coffee with 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:04.189
 we do not adhere to life 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:05.819
 and there you need to the museum 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.819
 ask yourself all the questions kiki that goes through our heads 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.579
 2 that the text poses for example when one is high the goals of the history of 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.059
 jesus equipment 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:19.259
 how come as paris can get pregnant like that what 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.150
 ashamed to ask the question in the notes on a small piece of paper 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.189
 then maybe we take a little moment for thoughtless 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:27.709
 not on everything to think about when we read the Bible does we never have 

00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:29.039
 alone 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.319
 if we do not believe it, we can pray to God to ask him to help us 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.499
 and then we can go ask others 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:39.669
 we can ask them the questions we ask ourselves and think together we can 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.809
 go see someone who is in a church and tell him 

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:46.080
 how do you understand this question how could he answer 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.419
 firstly I read secondly I try to understand thirdly 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.689
 that's what bob says is said 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:54.690
 that is to say, one seeks to understand 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.889
 what the text really tells me 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.940
 how can i live 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.400
 what text for example Thursday when I read a sentence that 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.720
 say you will love 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.029
 the next tone as yourself begins that I will live concretely 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:09.780
 did it have a real impact 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.110
 so what very concretely about an impact in life 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.210
 every day 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.960
 if we really let ourselves 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.800
 challenged by these texts and we want to follow what do not say 'we 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.150
 will change 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.639
 and then it'll be it will not make me in my life and then it's an impact on the 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.659
 society 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.860
 at the age of just a little example I did my studies 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.719
 alex en provence 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:34.059
 and then I was next to the faculty of law where the professors 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:35.719
 So come 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:38.690
 ask those who study theology so the Bible 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.960
 but come to explain to our students what is the Bible because they 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.200
 understand more the right the right in our society haha ​​been strongly 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.390
 influenced by the values ​​that are in the bible 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:54.789
 when we buy a new computer we stop working there are books that 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.069
 come out for example windows that for dummies and its guardians in that we have 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:05:59.200
 also this kind of advice 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.419
 to read the Bible 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.560
 we have reading wings that give us texts he gives himself 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.570
 little comments and that help us to read the Bible pass as I was 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.289
 there are texts that are sometimes hard we can not understand everything 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:10.669
 it 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:12.490
 which is great with the Bible 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.699
 this access not reserved born to an elite 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:17.449
 there are old 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.650
 there is already but it is really for all uses 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.120
 we have reading aids for children from 10 to 13 years old 

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:28.819
 for young people 14 18% of children from 6 to 4 years old 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.810
 and then if we really are not an excellent reader what can happen or 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.539
 we do not like to read the Bible as a comic that can give us this 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.539
 want to discover the central message in this book 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.590
 in the other two helps like to read the Bible 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.439
 the beam 

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:46.950
 small specimen that leave 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.980
 of the gospel of luc infant club the reds on which happened 

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:52.249
 the film 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:55.409
 then place for two days give you theses of the gospel of 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:59.229
 luc with small comments and then it's a good approach why 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:00.680
 cut 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.150
 free access
