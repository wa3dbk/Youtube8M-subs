00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:53.019
 Cheap seller classified as

 spinning for ultra light and ultralight 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.050
 rod and I will not take it because 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.609
 I'll show you why hereâ€™s a test of his 27 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.410
 gram but two gram bait 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.270
 let's try to throw specially went on 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.110
 trout pond trout fishing it took 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:13.160
 left uncomfortable to throw them 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.060
 light bait i.e. bait 5 7 to 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.090
 10 grams 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.210
 he throws well that 's bait 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.070
 who weigh there from 05 there will give from 3 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.850
 gram 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.520
 pretty bad he throws but now 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.790
 get it out of the case see what yes 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.270
 as 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:36.320
 and then probably hung some 8 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.330
 gram loads ban here but for video 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:44.080
 a couple of casts will do so that you 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:46.490
 see how he behaves in work 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.440
 Now we take out of the box with the sea 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:55.190
 how does he look like guys here we are 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:03.040
 Equipped this spinning 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:08.000
 so you can see the kosadaka reel in size 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.910
 one and a half thousand well and on the back 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.790
 subtitle tied 8 thunder with 3 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.870
 he has a line 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.560
 this spinning has an average closer to 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.510
 Slowly now literally do a couple 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:29.060
 casts see how he throws 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.890
 and your cargo as it flies I hope the sound 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.950
 normal will be the wind now 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.350
 strong but if something I think here and without 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.350
 sound especially everything will be clear 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.209
 throws up well again 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.239
 8 grams 200 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.969
 lures that are lighter and certainly not 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.969
 throw 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.769

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.910
 8 grams very well form 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.290
 just at the top of the upper test 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.050
 for the final cast 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:04.610
 try maximum far 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:04.610
 implement because meters on 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:11.360
 fifty he flies without any problems 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:26.270
