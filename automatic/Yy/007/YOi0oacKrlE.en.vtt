00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.070 

we<00:01:01.980> were<00:01:02.460> definitely<00:01:03.090> inspired<00:01:03.600> by<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
we were definitely inspired by that

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.680 
we were definitely inspired by that
story<00:01:04.440> but<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.119> way<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.299> did

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
story but in this or the the way we did

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.780 
story but in this or the the way we did
with<00:01:06.869> Rapunzel<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.650> other<00:01:07.860> stories<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
with Rapunzel and other stories the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.330 
with Rapunzel and other stories the
story<00:01:09.479> evolved<00:01:10.020> into<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.259> very<00:01:10.500> original<00:01:11.040> story

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
story evolved into a very original story

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.570 
story evolved into a very original story
so<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.570> ice<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> queen<00:01:14.280> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
so we do have ice we do have a queen and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.760 
so we do have ice we do have a queen and
that's<00:01:14.820> that's<00:01:15.300> really<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.960> resemblance<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
that's that's really the resemblance to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.920 
that's that's really the resemblance to
the<00:01:16.890> original<00:01:17.220> story<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.090> definitely<00:01:18.270> we

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the original story but it definitely we

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.740 
the original story but it definitely we
were<00:01:19.080> inspired<00:01:19.409> by<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.040> from<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> beginning

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.859 

it<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.170> early<00:01:28.380> development<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.130> he<00:01:29.190> had

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
it was in early development and he had

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.710 
it was in early development and he had
various<00:01:31.280> ideas<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.729> terms<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.210> medium<00:01:33.570> and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
various ideas in terms of the medium and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.300 
various ideas in terms of the medium and
how<00:01:33.810> he<00:01:33.869> wanted<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.229> tell<00:01:34.440> it<00:01:34.560> was<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
how he wanted to tell it was it going to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.710 
how he wanted to tell it was it going to
be<00:01:35.369> animation<00:01:35.910> was<00:01:36.060> gonna<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> combination

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
be animation was gonna be a combination

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.680 
be animation was gonna be a combination
of<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.289> with<00:01:37.350> live-action<00:01:37.850> but<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> think<00:01:39.210> he

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
of that with live-action but I think he

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.590 
of that with live-action but I think he
was<00:01:40.009> like<00:01:41.009> many<00:01:41.280> stories<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.880> struggled<00:01:42.570> with

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
was like many stories you struggled with

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.779 
was like many stories you struggled with
what<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> Snow<00:01:43.740> Queen<00:01:43.950> thinking<00:01:44.520> why<00:01:44.729> is

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
what is the Snow Queen thinking why is

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.700 
what is the Snow Queen thinking why is
she<00:01:44.909> doing<00:01:45.360> what<00:01:45.479> she's<00:01:45.780> doing<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:46.679> a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
she doing what she's doing and it was a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.700 
she doing what she's doing and it was a
hard<00:01:47.070> element<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> original<00:01:48.659> story<00:01:49.020> to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
hard element of the original story to

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.389 
hard element of the original story to
crack<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:51.240> think<00:01:51.810> by<00:01:52.020> making<00:01:52.259> our<00:01:52.619> protagonist

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
crack I think by making our protagonist

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.279 
crack I think by making our protagonist
Hana<00:01:53.640> who<00:01:54.240> related<00:01:54.569> to<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.990> Snow<00:01:55.229> Queen

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
Hana who related to the Snow Queen

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.889 
Hana who related to the Snow Queen
opened<00:01:56.130> up<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.580> different<00:01:57.149> part<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:57.630> story

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
opened up a different part of the story

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.440 
opened up a different part of the story
that<00:01:58.170> now<00:01:58.800> made<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.460> Snow<00:01:59.670> Queen<00:01:59.819> relatable

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that now made the Snow Queen relatable

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.510 
that now made the Snow Queen relatable
you<00:02:00.539> could<00:02:00.659> understand<00:02:01.259> why<00:02:01.860> she<00:02:02.130> was<00:02:02.250> doing

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
you could understand why she was doing

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.580

what<00:02:02.700> she<00:02:02.729> was<00:02:03.000> doing

a major obstacle for the movie so right
away<00:02:40.260> we<00:02:40.410> wanted<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.040> feeling<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.730> that

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
away we wanted that feeling of that

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.960 
away we wanted that feeling of that
nature<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.600> much<00:02:42.780> larger<00:02:43.290> than<00:02:43.500> man<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.070> that

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
nature is much larger than man and that

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.490 
nature is much larger than man and that
there<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.270> an<00:02:45.390> adventure<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.989> is<00:02:46.020> going<00:02:46.380> to

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
there is an adventure that is going to

00:02:46.500 --> 00:03:00.050 
there is an adventure that is going to
unfold<00:02:46.920> well<00:02:47.280> beyond<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.390> kingdom<00:02:48.750> walls

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.190 

it<00:03:00.300> was<00:03:00.450> our<00:03:00.630> art<00:03:01.560> director<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:02.370> our<00:03:03.200> lighting

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
it was our art director and our lighting

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.720 
it was our art director and our lighting
people<00:03:04.800> who<00:03:04.860> went<00:03:05.010> there<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.459> know<00:03:05.550> the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
people who went there you know the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.300 
people who went there you know the
lighting<00:03:05.970> itself<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.690> very<00:03:06.870> different<00:03:07.440> we

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
lighting itself is very different we

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.920 
lighting itself is very different we
learned<00:03:08.580> on<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.910> dramatic<00:03:09.330> settings<00:03:09.720> the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
learned on the dramatic settings the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.990 
learned on the dramatic settings the
scope<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.440> scale<00:03:10.590> which<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.070> what<00:03:11.430> influenced

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
scope and scale which is what influenced

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.880 
scope and scale which is what influenced
us<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.600> do<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.049> movie<00:03:13.350> in<00:03:13.440> CinemaScope

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
us to do this movie in CinemaScope

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.160 
us to do this movie in CinemaScope
similar<00:03:14.489> to<00:03:14.640> like<00:03:14.760> Lawrence<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.239> Arabia<00:03:15.720> we

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
similar to like Lawrence of Arabia we

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.630 
similar to like Lawrence of Arabia we
wanted<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.530> widescreen<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.310> be<00:03:17.400> able<00:03:17.489> to

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
wanted that widescreen to be able to

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.550 
wanted that widescreen to be able to
capture<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.269> environment<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.320> we<00:03:19.440> also

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
capture the environment but we also

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.710 
capture the environment but we also
learned<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.100> small<00:03:20.400> details<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.269> the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
learned the small details of the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.360 
learned the small details of the
clothing<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.410> rose<00:03:22.650> modeling<00:03:23.160> that

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
clothing and the rose modeling that

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.020 
clothing and the rose modeling that
takes<00:03:23.640> place<00:03:23.850> so<00:03:24.360> we<00:03:24.480> have<00:03:24.720> both<00:03:24.989> vast

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
takes place so we have both vast

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.820 
takes place so we have both vast
influence<00:03:27.030> in<00:03:27.840> terms<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:28.230> scope<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.620> scale

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
influence in terms of scope and scale

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.920 
influence in terms of scope and scale
but<00:03:29.459> also<00:03:29.489> right<00:03:29.970> down<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.450> detailing

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
but also right down to the detailing

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.229 
but also right down to the detailing
that<00:03:31.410> we<00:03:31.709> have<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.580> other<00:03:32.700> thing<00:03:32.910> we<00:03:33.060> learned

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
that we have the other thing we learned

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.170 
that we have the other thing we learned
was<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:33.660> snow<00:03:34.500> isn't<00:03:34.860> always<00:03:35.040> white<00:03:35.430> that

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
was that snow isn't always white that

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.600 
was that snow isn't always white that
you<00:03:36.450> know<00:03:36.600> contours<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.470> shadow<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.220> shadows

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
you know contours and shadow and shadows

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.789 
you know contours and shadow and shadows
from<00:03:38.790> trees<00:03:39.209> help<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.049> define<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.470> world

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
from trees help you define the world

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.690 
from trees help you define the world
also<00:03:41.760> snow<00:03:42.720> is<00:03:42.930> like<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.200> blank<00:03:43.560> canvas<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.400> you

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
also snow is like a blank canvas and you

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.000 
also snow is like a blank canvas and you
can<00:03:44.940> reflect<00:03:45.480> all<00:03:45.989> sorts<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.590> colors

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
can reflect all sorts of colors

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.180 
can reflect all sorts of colors
depending<00:03:47.970> upon<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.269> mood<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.660> film

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190

depending upon whether it's day or night
sunset<00:03:51.930> or<00:03:52.079> sunrise<00:03:52.459> can<00:03:53.459> vastly<00:03:53.970> change<00:03:54.390> the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
sunset or sunrise can vastly change the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:02.339 
sunset or sunrise can vastly change the
look<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.019> film<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.500> make<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.799> very<00:03:55.980> rich

would even could write a song they
needed<00:04:30.229> to<00:04:30.320> understand<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:31.160> world<00:04:31.340> that<00:04:31.580> we

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
needed to understand the world that we

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.490 
needed to understand the world that we
are<00:04:31.789> creating<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.389> characters<00:04:32.780> very<00:04:33.260> very

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
are creating the characters very very

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.879 
are creating the characters very very
collaborative<00:04:34.160> process<00:04:34.960> it<00:04:35.960> is<00:04:36.139> what<00:04:36.410> helps

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
collaborative process it is what helps

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.640

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
storytelling and the reason we like

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.680 
storytelling and the reason we like
music<00:04:42.949> is<00:04:43.190> because<00:04:43.550> music<00:04:43.820> can<00:04:44.000> evoke<00:04:44.479> an

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
music is because music can evoke an

music is because music can evoke an
emotion<00:04:45.169> and<00:04:46.070> really<00:04:46.699> get<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.180> an<00:04:47.270> emotion

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
emotion and really get to an emotion

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.379 
emotion and really get to an emotion
whether<00:04:48.710> it's<00:04:48.919> comedy<00:04:49.460> or<00:04:49.850> whether<00:04:50.180> it's

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
whether it's comedy or whether it's
