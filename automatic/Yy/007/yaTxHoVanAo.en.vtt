hi my name's Tom welcome to quickly
quickly<00:00:05.920> and<00:00:06.220> in<00:00:06.309> this<00:00:06.430> lesson<00:00:06.669> we're<00:00:07.029> going

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:07.149 
quickly and in this lesson we're going

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:08.640 
quickly and in this lesson we're going
to<00:00:07.209> be<00:00:07.270> talking<00:00:07.629> about<00:00:07.750> something<00:00:08.109> I<00:00:08.290> like<00:00:08.500> to

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.650 
to be talking about something I like to

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.680 
to be talking about something I like to
call<00:00:08.830> rush<00:00:09.250> cords<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:11.500> isn't<00:00:11.830> the<00:00:12.690> the

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
call rush cords this isn't the the

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.869 
call rush cords this isn't the the
correct<00:00:14.110> theoretical<00:00:14.889> term<00:00:15.129> for<00:00:15.429> them<00:00:15.549> but

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:15.879 
correct theoretical term for them but

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.139 
correct theoretical term for them but
what<00:00:16.509> I<00:00:16.540> basically<00:00:16.750> mean<00:00:17.169> is<00:00:17.380> cords<00:00:17.800> the<00:00:18.310> sound

00:00:19.139 --> 00:00:19.149 
what I basically mean is cords the sound

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:22.020 
what I basically mean is cords the sound
like<00:00:19.360> this

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.030 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.440 

and<00:00:22.210> that<00:00:22.840> cord<00:00:23.140> in<00:00:23.260> particular<00:00:24.180> when<00:00:25.180> I<00:00:25.210> say

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
and that cord in particular when I say

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.920 
and that cord in particular when I say
rush<00:00:25.780> I'm<00:00:26.080> talking<00:00:26.350> about<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.619> band<00:00:26.830> rush

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
rush I'm talking about the band rush

rush I'm talking about the band rush
which<00:00:28.930> is<00:00:29.140> one<00:00:29.410> of<00:00:29.440> my<00:00:29.650> favorite<00:00:30.040> bands<00:00:30.220> the

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
which is one of my favorite bands the

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.660 
which is one of my favorite bands the
guitarist<00:00:31.570> of<00:00:31.630> which<00:00:31.840> his<00:00:32.080> his<00:00:32.500> name<00:00:32.710> is<00:00:32.890> Alex

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
guitarist of which his his name is Alex

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.670 
guitarist of which his his name is Alex
Lifeson<00:00:33.910> and<00:00:34.600> he's<00:00:34.720> got<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:34.900> very<00:00:35.020> distinct

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
Lifeson and he's got a very distinct

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.689 
Lifeson and he's got a very distinct
style<00:00:36.070> and<00:00:36.970> a<00:00:37.510> very<00:00:37.720> distinct<00:00:38.410> sound<00:00:39.160> to<00:00:39.610> his

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
style and a very distinct sound to his

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.479 
style and a very distinct sound to his
playing<00:00:39.970> now<00:00:40.720> I've<00:00:40.900> been<00:00:41.110> a<00:00:41.140> fan<00:00:41.350> of<00:00:41.379> rush<00:00:41.650> well

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
playing now I've been a fan of rush well

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.549 
playing now I've been a fan of rush well
since<00:00:43.059> I<00:00:43.150> was<00:00:43.180> very<00:00:43.300> little<00:00:43.480> I<00:00:44.050> grew<00:00:44.500> up

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
since I was very little I grew up

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.950 
since I was very little I grew up
listening<00:00:44.800> to<00:00:45.070> them<00:00:45.309> and<00:00:46.150> the<00:00:46.239> certain<00:00:46.600> things

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
listening to them and the certain things

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.240 
listening to them and the certain things
about<00:00:47.140> his<00:00:47.410> playing<00:00:47.650> and<00:00:47.830> certain<00:00:48.100> things

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
about his playing and certain things

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.280 
about his playing and certain things
about<00:00:48.489> their<00:00:48.699> sound<00:00:49.059> that<00:00:49.360> just<00:00:49.540> sort<00:00:49.780> of<00:00:49.900> sunk

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
about their sound that just sort of sunk

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.830 
about their sound that just sort of sunk
in<00:00:50.650> to<00:00:51.280> my<00:00:51.820> brain<00:00:52.030> and<00:00:52.210> one<00:00:52.300> of<00:00:52.420> which<00:00:52.510> was<00:00:52.690> this

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
in to my brain and one of which was this

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.530 
in to my brain and one of which was this
chord<00:00:53.550> which<00:00:54.550> I<00:00:54.670> always<00:00:54.940> called<00:00:55.180> the<00:00:55.300> rush

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
chord which I always called the rush

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.200 
chord which I always called the rush
chord<00:00:55.930> because<00:00:56.410> it<00:00:56.590> appears<00:00:57.250> famously<00:00:57.820> in

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
chord because it appears famously in

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.000 
chord because it appears famously in
their<00:00:58.899> track<00:00:59.200> hemispheres<00:00:59.890> rather<00:01:00.250> stop<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:02.680> I

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
their track hemispheres rather stop it I

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.650 
their track hemispheres rather stop it I
think<00:01:03.250> it<00:01:03.309> sounds<00:01:03.550> fantastic<00:01:03.730> and<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:04.390> like<00:01:04.540> to

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
think it sounds fantastic and I like to

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.630 
think it sounds fantastic and I like to
use<00:01:04.720> it<00:01:04.899> wherever<00:01:05.050> possible<00:01:05.350> but<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.399> same

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
use it wherever possible but the same

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.510 
use it wherever possible but the same
technique<00:01:07.180> to<00:01:07.509> create<00:01:08.380> this<00:01:08.500> chord<00:01:08.830> can<00:01:09.369> be

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
technique to create this chord can be

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.529 
technique to create this chord can be
used<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.789> create<00:01:10.030> a<00:01:10.060> bunch<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.479> different

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
used to create a bunch of different

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.090 
used to create a bunch of different
chords<00:01:11.080> as<00:01:11.170> well<00:01:11.289> and<00:01:11.590> I'll<00:01:11.680> just<00:01:11.830> talk<00:01:11.979> about

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
chords as well and I'll just talk about

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.460 
chords as well and I'll just talk about
what<00:01:12.369> that<00:01:12.399> is<00:01:12.550> I'm<00:01:13.479> in<00:01:13.630> standard<00:01:14.050> tuning

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
what that is I'm in standard tuning

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.749 
what that is I'm in standard tuning
so<00:01:15.460> EAD<00:01:15.940> GBE<00:01:16.920> even<00:01:17.920> though<00:01:18.039> I<00:01:18.070> don't<00:01:18.220> use<00:01:18.610> this

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
so EAD GBE even though I don't use this

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.639 
so EAD GBE even though I don't use this
tuning<00:01:19.090> anymore<00:01:19.420> for<00:01:19.660> my<00:01:20.050> regular<00:01:20.229> playing

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
tuning anymore for my regular playing

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.650 
tuning anymore for my regular playing
see<00:01:20.979> my<00:01:21.130> other<00:01:21.250> videos<00:01:21.610> for<00:01:21.850> explanation<00:01:22.570> on

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
see my other videos for explanation on

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.469 
see my other videos for explanation on
that<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.080> so<00:01:23.649> I'll<00:01:23.770> talk<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:23.979> through<00:01:24.160> it<00:01:24.280> now

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that and so I'll talk you through it now

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.210 
that and so I'll talk you through it now
basically<00:01:25.479> it's<00:01:25.690> sort<00:01:25.869> of<00:01:26.189> follows<00:01:27.189> along

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
basically it's sort of follows along

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.570 
basically it's sort of follows along
from<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.670> bar<00:01:27.909> chord<00:01:28.240> concept<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.280> if<00:01:30.340> we<00:01:30.430> take

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
from the bar chord concept so if we take

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.320 
from the bar chord concept so if we take
our<00:01:30.760> open<00:01:31.030> e<00:01:31.180> chord<00:01:32.580> what<00:01:33.580> we're<00:01:33.729> gonna<00:01:33.820> do<00:01:34.119> is

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
our open e chord what we're gonna do is

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.630 
our open e chord what we're gonna do is
we're<00:01:34.510> gonna<00:01:34.600> be<00:01:34.810> moving<00:01:35.260> up<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.860> low<00:01:36.220> four

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
we're gonna be moving up the low four

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.660 
we're gonna be moving up the low four
strings<00:01:37.119> in<00:01:37.630> pitch<00:01:38.439> but<00:01:38.770> keep<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.159> top<00:01:39.400> two

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
strings in pitch but keep the top two

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.490 
strings in pitch but keep the top two
ringing<00:01:40.630> out<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.930> B<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:41.409> E<00:01:41.770> so<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.720> do<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:43.900> rush

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
ringing out the B and E so to do a rush

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.249 
ringing out the B and E so to do a rush
chord<00:01:44.950> for<00:01:45.640> this<00:01:46.479> is<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.689> way<00:01:46.810> I<00:01:46.840> described

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
chord for this is the way I described

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.609 
chord for this is the way I described
again<00:01:47.590> is<00:01:47.860> completely<00:01:48.159> non<00:01:49.119> correct<00:01:50.020> in<00:01:50.380> terms

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
again is completely non correct in terms

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.069 
again is completely non correct in terms
of<00:01:50.770> theory<00:01:51.159> but<00:01:51.369> it's<00:01:52.119> just<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.420> way<00:01:52.540> I<00:01:52.570> use<00:01:52.930> it

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
of theory but it's just the way I use it

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.590 
of theory but it's just the way I use it
to<00:01:53.229> shorthand<00:01:53.650> so<00:01:54.130> starting<00:01:54.850> on<00:01:54.970> F<00:01:55.180> what<00:01:55.479> we

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
to shorthand so starting on F what we

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.719 
to shorthand so starting on F what we
can<00:01:55.750> do<00:01:55.900> is<00:01:56.049> we<00:01:56.200> can<00:01:56.320> play<00:01:56.560> first<00:01:57.460> fret<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.700> the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
can do is we can play first fret of the

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.200 
can do is we can play first fret of the
low<00:01:57.790> E<00:01:58.110> third<00:01:59.110> fret<00:01:59.380> on<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.950> third<00:02:00.820> fret<00:02:01.180> of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
low E third fret on the a third fret of

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.999 
low E third fret on the a third fret of
the<00:02:01.270> D<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:01.780> that's<00:02:02.020> second<00:02:02.409> fret<00:02:02.619> on<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:02.740> G

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
the D and that's second fret on the G

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.420 
the D and that's second fret on the G
and<00:02:03.520> then<00:02:03.610> have<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:03.970> be

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
and then have to be

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.800 
and then have to be
wring<00:02:04.640> out

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.109 

which<00:02:08.800> basically<00:02:09.009> means<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.610> we've<00:02:09.849> got<00:02:09.880> an

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
which basically means that we've got an

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.170 
which basically means that we've got an
F<00:02:10.360> in<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.830> base<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.400> whenever<00:02:12.580> we<00:02:12.819> move<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.090> up

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
F in the base and whenever we move it up

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.850 
F in the base and whenever we move it up
we're<00:02:13.330> gonna<00:02:13.420> sharpen<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.020> base<00:02:14.140> up<00:02:14.590> Jean

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
we're gonna sharpen the base up Jean

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.850 
we're gonna sharpen the base up Jean
things<00:02:15.190> can<00:02:15.520> be<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:15.940> banks<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:16.569> on<00:02:16.860> and

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
things can be in the banks and so on and

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.540 
things can be in the banks and so on and
then<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.340> B<00:02:18.910> open<00:02:19.390> e<00:02:19.810> open<00:02:20.709> E<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.010> B<00:02:21.160> string

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
then the B open e open E and B string

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.460 
then the B open e open E and B string
ringing<00:02:21.910> out<00:02:22.060> give<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.390> some<00:02:22.660> extra<00:02:22.840> texture

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
ringing out give it some extra texture

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.620 
ringing out give it some extra texture
so<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.190> thought<00:02:24.519> I'll<00:02:24.670> just<00:02:24.700> run<00:02:25.209> through<00:02:25.239> all

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
so I thought I'll just run through all

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.070 
so I thought I'll just run through all
the<00:02:25.870> chords<00:02:26.830> from<00:02:27.340> boy<00:02:28.030> in<00:02:28.510> all<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:28.959> know

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
the chords from boy in all you know

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.229 
the chords from boy in all you know
twelve<00:02:29.410> keys<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.069> which<00:02:30.459> chords<00:02:30.790> do<00:02:31.030> and

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
twelve keys and which chords do and

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.059 
twelve keys and which chords do and
don't<00:02:31.450> work<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:33.190> we've<00:02:33.340> got<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.610> F<00:02:33.760> chord

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
don't work so we've got the F chord

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.229 
don't work so we've got the F chord
which<00:02:36.069> does<00:02:36.310> work<00:02:36.519> it<00:02:36.730> gives<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.000> really

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
which does work it gives you a really

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.470 
which does work it gives you a really
interesting<00:02:37.480> sound<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:39.700> F<00:02:39.880> sharp<00:02:40.239> which

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
interesting sound the F sharp which

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.270 
interesting sound the F sharp which
gives<00:02:40.720> us<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:40.989> rush<00:02:41.200> sound<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.950> this

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
gives us that rush sound the this

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.430 
gives us that rush sound the this
particular<00:02:42.640> chord<00:02:43.060> would<00:02:43.239> be<00:02:43.360> an<00:02:43.569> F<00:02:43.810> sharp<00:02:43.840> 7

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
particular chord would be an F sharp 7

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.110 
particular chord would be an F sharp 7
sus<00:02:44.980> 4<00:02:46.319> by<00:02:47.319> again<00:02:47.830> it's<00:02:48.160> just<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.430> rush<00:02:48.819> chord

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
sus 4 by again it's just the rush chord

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.360 
sus 4 by again it's just the rush chord
for<00:02:49.330> me<00:02:49.420> it<00:02:49.989> works<00:02:50.200> really<00:02:50.380> well<00:02:50.560> in<00:02:50.709> G

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
for me it works really well in G

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.570 
for me it works really well in G
doesn't<00:02:52.970> really<00:02:53.030> work<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:53.510> well<00:02:53.629> in<00:02:53.780> g-sharp

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
doesn't really work so well in g-sharp

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.830 
doesn't really work so well in g-sharp
yeah<00:02:55.580> really<00:02:55.790> weird<00:02:56.030> sounds

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.110 

but<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.590> might<00:03:00.769> find<00:03:00.800> some<00:03:01.160> use<00:03:01.340> for<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:02.000> in

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
but you might find some use for it in

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.470

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.050 

it<00:03:14.060> works<00:03:14.240> at<00:03:14.450> sea<00:03:15.550> doesn't<00:03:16.550> really<00:03:16.700> work<00:03:16.880> in

doesn't work at all in E flat and again

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.620 
doesn't work at all in E flat and again
we<00:03:25.100> can<00:03:25.250> use<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.490> on<00:03:25.550> the<00:03:25.670> e<00:03:25.700> all<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.390> way<00:03:26.510> up
