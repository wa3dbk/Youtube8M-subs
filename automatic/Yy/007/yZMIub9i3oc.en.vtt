00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.320
 look for something extreme stress we think 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.960
 that we were going to look for something 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.940
 of speed not so extreme but of 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.210

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.229

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.700
 that I can not be fast and furious 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.340

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.810
 Alejandro, how did that go to you? 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.010
 dangerous curve in the first round 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.330
 I said good with a little more than 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.160
 quiet and then you grab a 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.630
 little bit of confidence what it is that 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.480
