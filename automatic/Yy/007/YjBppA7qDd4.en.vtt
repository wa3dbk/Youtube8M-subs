00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
iPhone 5 as you see it's also Fido and

iPhone 5 as you see it's also Fido and
to<00:01:49.440> also<00:01:49.560> 3G<00:01:50.070> now<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.940> iPhone<00:01:51.179> 5<00:01:51.509> might<00:01:51.840> be

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
to also 3G now the iPhone 5 might be

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.199 
to also 3G now the iPhone 5 might be
faster<00:01:52.440> just<00:01:52.470> because<00:01:52.830> it's<00:01:53.459> running<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.910> sim

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
faster just because it's running a sim

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.089 
faster just because it's running a sim
has<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.720> sim<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.289> and<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:55.500> other<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.709> mobile

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:56.099 
has a sim on it and the other is mobile

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:05.170 
has a sim on it and the other is mobile
hotspot<00:01:56.459> but<00:01:56.580> we'll<00:01:56.729> see<00:01:56.910> so<00:01:57.229> three<00:01:58.229> two<00:01:58.770> one

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.950 

so<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> bb10<00:02:06.720> ran<00:02:07.050> it<00:02:07.310> faster<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.750> it's<00:02:09.750> fully

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
so the bb10 ran it faster and it's fully

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.230 
so the bb10 ran it faster and it's fully
loaded<00:02:10.140> now<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.530> iPhone<00:02:11.009> 5<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:11.760> finished

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
loaded now the iPhone 5 just finished

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.600 
loaded now the iPhone 5 just finished
loading<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.720> browser<00:02:12.930> page<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:16.610> there's

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
loading the browser page and there's

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.610 
loading the browser page and there's
another<00:02:17.910> well<00:02:18.750> another<00:02:19.080> thing<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.470> shows

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
another well another thing that shows

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.690 
another well another thing that shows
which<00:02:19.830> one<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.100> faster<00:02:20.220> as<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.180> bb10<00:02:21.630> changed

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
which one is faster as the bb10 changed

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.010 
which one is faster as the bb10 changed
the<00:02:23.700> picture<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.210> slider<00:02:24.480> first<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:26.130> yeah

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020
