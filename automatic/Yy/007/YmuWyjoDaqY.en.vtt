00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.150 

you<00:00:06.080> mentioned<00:00:07.990> er-<00:00:08.990> so<00:00:09.440> let<00:00:09.590> me<00:00:09.740> ask<00:00:09.889> you

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
you mentioned er- so let me ask you

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.900 
you mentioned er- so let me ask you
what's<00:00:10.820> new<00:00:11.240> in<00:00:11.629> the<00:00:11.980> triple<00:00:12.980> negative<00:00:13.400> French

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
what's new in the triple negative French

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.230 
what's new in the triple negative French
so<00:00:14.900> I<00:00:15.289> think<00:00:15.830> triple<00:00:16.250> negative<00:00:16.580> breast<00:00:16.609> cancer

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
so I think triple negative breast cancer

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.400 
so I think triple negative breast cancer
is<00:00:17.510> perhaps<00:00:18.350> more<00:00:19.359> misunderstood<00:00:20.359> by<00:00:20.750> the

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
is perhaps more misunderstood by the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.890 
is perhaps more misunderstood by the
general<00:00:22.100> public<00:00:22.640> than<00:00:22.880> any<00:00:23.120> other<00:00:23.360> subtype<00:00:23.870> of

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
general public than any other subtype of

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.890 
general public than any other subtype of
breast<00:00:24.140> cancer<00:00:24.680> and<00:00:24.980> I<00:00:25.340> can't<00:00:25.670> tell<00:00:25.940> you<00:00:26.150> how

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
breast cancer and I can't tell you how

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.010 
breast cancer and I can't tell you how
many<00:00:27.110> women<00:00:28.119> seem<00:00:29.119> to<00:00:29.150> think<00:00:29.480> that<00:00:29.630> having

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
many women seem to think that having

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.990 
many women seem to think that having
triple<00:00:30.500> negative<00:00:30.830> breast<00:00:30.860> cancer<00:00:31.520> is<00:00:34.000> the

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
triple negative breast cancer is the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.630 
triple negative breast cancer is the
equivalent<00:00:35.660> of<00:00:35.870> a<00:00:36.379> term<00:00:36.829> I<00:00:37.039> don't<00:00:37.250> like<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:37.610> use

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
equivalent of a term I don't like to use

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.180 
equivalent of a term I don't like to use
but<00:00:38.090> women<00:00:38.420> sometimes<00:00:38.630> use<00:00:39.050> a<00:00:39.290> death<00:00:39.530> sentence

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
but women sometimes use a death sentence

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.680 
but women sometimes use a death sentence
it<00:00:40.670> absolutely<00:00:41.090> is<00:00:41.630> not<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.680> having

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
it absolutely is not and and having

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.540 
it absolutely is not and and having
early-stage<00:00:44.690> breast<00:00:45.170> cancer<00:00:45.649> so<00:00:45.920> stage<00:00:46.250> 1<00:00:46.520> or

triple negative breast cancer tends to

triple negative breast cancer tends to
be<00:00:58.610> quite<00:00:59.149> sensitive<00:00:59.510> to<00:00:59.930> chemotherapy<00:01:00.110> and

be quite sensitive to chemotherapy and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.500 
be quite sensitive to chemotherapy and
many<00:01:01.040> of<00:01:01.160> these<00:01:01.280> women<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:01.760> can<00:01:01.850> go<00:01:02.059> on<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:02.420> do

many of these women it can go on and do

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.830 
many of these women it can go on and do

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
at Baskin the Harpe inhibitors are very

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.030 
at Baskin the Harpe inhibitors are very
interesting<00:01:34.630> drugs<00:01:34.960> in<00:01:35.200> this<00:01:35.350> setting<00:01:35.770> and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
interesting drugs in this setting and

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.920 
interesting drugs in this setting and
they're<00:01:37.030> thought<00:01:38.640> perhaps<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:40.299> particularly

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
they're thought perhaps and particularly

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.260 
they're thought perhaps and particularly
one<00:01:41.320> of<00:01:41.350> them<00:01:41.680> is<00:01:42.040> thought<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.670> add<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:43.149> the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
one of them is thought to add to the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.980 
one of them is thought to add to the
effectiveness<00:01:43.720> of<00:01:43.899> chemotherapy<00:01:44.830> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
effectiveness of chemotherapy and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.450 
effectiveness of chemotherapy and
hopefully<00:01:46.990> that<00:01:47.200> will<00:01:47.470> turn<00:01:47.799> out<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:47.979> be<00:01:48.100> true

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
hopefully that will turn out to be true

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.889 
hopefully that will turn out to be true
in<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.789> large<00:01:49.030> study<00:01:49.360> that<00:01:49.570> was<00:01:49.750> recently

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
in the large study that was recently

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.230 
in the large study that was recently
completed<00:01:50.320> that<00:01:50.799> we're<00:01:50.979> waiting<00:01:51.310> for<00:01:51.549> results

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
completed that we're waiting for results

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.060 
completed that we're waiting for results
from<00:01:53.789> so<00:01:54.789> I<00:01:54.820> think<00:01:55.149> that<00:01:55.479> we<00:01:56.080> we<00:01:56.470> clearly<00:01:56.830> need

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
from so I think that we we clearly need

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.649 
from so I think that we we clearly need
to<00:01:57.100> make<00:01:57.310> progress<00:01:57.610> in<00:01:57.909> this<00:01:58.030> area<00:01:58.090> this<00:01:58.600> is

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
to make progress in this area this is

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.649 
to make progress in this area this is
now<00:01:59.020> one<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.380> our<00:01:59.590> most<00:01:59.860> difficult<00:02:00.360> areas<00:02:01.360> and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
now one of our most difficult areas and

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.330 
now one of our most difficult areas and
to<00:02:02.110> treat<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.060> think<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:05.590> this<00:02:05.920> is<00:02:06.190> an

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
to treat but I think that this is an

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.059 
to treat but I think that this is an
area<00:02:06.550> where<00:02:06.970> we<00:02:07.179> will<00:02:07.420> learn<00:02:07.630> more<00:02:07.990> about<00:02:08.200> the

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
area where we will learn more about the

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.190 
area where we will learn more about the
biology<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.850> triple<00:02:10.239> negative<00:02:10.269> breast<00:02:10.600> cancer

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
biology of triple negative breast cancer

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.740 
biology of triple negative breast cancer
we'll<00:02:11.890> learn<00:02:12.069> more<00:02:12.130> about<00:02:12.430> how<00:02:12.970> one<00:02:13.300> woman's

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
we'll learn more about how one woman's

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.330 
we'll learn more about how one woman's
tumor<00:02:13.989> is<00:02:14.200> different<00:02:14.560> from<00:02:14.620> another<00:02:14.769> because

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
tumor is different from another because

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.100 
tumor is different from another because
there's<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.610> lot<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.910> heterogeneity<00:02:16.300> here<00:02:16.930> and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
there's a lot of heterogeneity here and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.540 
there's a lot of heterogeneity here and
we're<00:02:17.650> going<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.800> develop<00:02:18.040> better<00:02:18.310> treatments

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
we're going to develop better treatments

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.059 
we're going to develop better treatments
over<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.150> next<00:02:19.330> several<00:02:19.510> years<00:02:19.830> talking<00:02:20.830> to

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
over the next several years talking to

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.820 
over the next several years talking to
you<00:02:21.160> I'm<00:02:21.310> feeling<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:22.480> hopeful<00:02:22.870> well<00:02:23.440> I<00:02:23.470> mean

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
you I'm feeling so hopeful well I mean

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.400 
you I'm feeling so hopeful well I mean
you<00:02:24.160> know<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:25.209> reality<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.959> there<00:02:26.260> are

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
you know it the reality is there are

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.199 
you know it the reality is there are
still<00:02:26.709> 40,000<00:02:27.370> women<00:02:27.489> who<00:02:27.730> die<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:27.940> breast

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
still 40,000 women who die of breast

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.729 
still 40,000 women who die of breast
cancer<00:02:28.569> in<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.750> United<00:02:28.870> States<00:02:29.290> each<00:02:29.470> year

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
cancer in the United States each year

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.440 
cancer in the United States each year
and<00:02:29.950> about<00:02:30.160> 400,000<00:02:30.940> women<00:02:31.030> who<00:02:31.239> died<00:02:31.390> of

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
and about 400,000 women who died of

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.479 
and about 400,000 women who died of
breast<00:02:31.630> cancer<00:02:31.780> worldwide<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:32.920> there's

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
breast cancer worldwide so there's

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.810 
breast cancer worldwide so there's
there's<00:02:34.170> reason<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.200> be<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:36.190> take<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.489> problem

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
there's reason to be to take the problem

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.940 
there's reason to be to take the problem
very<00:02:37.000> seriously<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.930> we<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.380> lot<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.650> work

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
very seriously and we have a lot of work

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.949 
very seriously and we have a lot of work
to<00:02:39.130> do<00:02:39.280> on<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.880> other<00:02:39.940> hand<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.450> reason<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.840> be

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
to do on the other hand the reason to be

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.020 
to do on the other hand the reason to be
hopeful<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:41.650> there<00:02:42.310> has<00:02:42.459> just<00:02:42.489> been<00:02:42.730> this

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
hopeful is there has just been this

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.690 
hopeful is there has just been this
explosion<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:44.200> knowledge<00:02:44.620> related<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.459> the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
explosion of knowledge related to the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.620 
explosion of knowledge related to the
underlying<00:02:46.269> biology<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:47.079> cancer<00:02:47.109> and<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:48.790> far

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
underlying biology of cancer and a far

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.560 
underlying biology of cancer and a far
greater<00:02:50.290> ability<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.459> begin<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.940> translate

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
greater ability to begin to translate

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.080 
greater ability to begin to translate
that<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.959> clinic<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.609> know<00:02:54.760> these

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
that to the clinic and so you know these

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.080

answer the question that said through

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.480 
answer the question that said through
five<00:03:56.570> years<00:03:56.840> of<00:03:56.990> follow-up<00:03:57.410> there<00:03:58.070> appeared

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
five years of follow-up there appeared

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.430 
five years of follow-up there appeared
to<00:03:58.550> be<00:03:58.610> no<00:03:58.970> difference<00:03:59.420> whether<00:03:59.600> a<00:03:59.720> woman<00:04:00.080> had

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
to be no difference whether a woman had

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.460 
to be no difference whether a woman had
a<00:04:00.820> lymph<00:04:01.820> node<00:04:01.880> dissection<00:04:02.120> or<00:04:02.840> whether<00:04:03.200> she

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
a lymph node dissection or whether she

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.979 
a lymph node dissection or whether she
didn't<00:04:03.860> I<00:04:04.160> don't<00:04:04.850> think<00:04:05.150> this<00:04:05.239> defines<00:04:05.660> a<00:04:05.810> new

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
didn't I don't think this defines a new

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.870 
didn't I don't think this defines a new
standard<00:04:06.440> of<00:04:06.530> care<00:04:06.830> but<00:04:07.220> I<00:04:07.250> think<00:04:07.519> it<00:04:07.640> does

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
standard of care but I think it does

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.300 
standard of care but I think it does
mean<00:04:08.209> that<00:04:08.480> we<00:04:09.140> can<00:04:09.320> be<00:04:09.440> a<00:04:09.470> little<00:04:09.769> bit<00:04:10.010> more

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
mean that we can be a little bit more

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.780 
mean that we can be a little bit more
flexible<00:04:10.940> in<00:04:11.150> our<00:04:11.390> approach<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:11.870> patients<00:04:12.790> who

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
flexible in our approach to patients who

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.690 
flexible in our approach to patients who
have<00:04:14.000> a<00:04:14.030> positive<00:04:14.300> sentinel<00:04:14.959> biopsy

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
have a positive sentinel biopsy

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.370 
have a positive sentinel biopsy
particularly<00:04:16.700> if<00:04:17.000> we<00:04:17.510> think<00:04:17.720> that<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:18.080> chance

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
particularly if we think that the chance

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.630 
particularly if we think that the chance
that<00:04:18.530> we're<00:04:18.709> going<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:18.859> find<00:04:19.130> other<00:04:19.370> lymph

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
that we're going to find other lymph

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.969 
that we're going to find other lymph
nodes<00:04:19.910> is<00:04:20.120> quite<00:04:20.359> small<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.049> particularly<00:04:21.769> if

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
nodes is quite small and particularly if

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.700 
nodes is quite small and particularly if
a<00:04:22.100> woman<00:04:22.490> is<00:04:22.850> is<00:04:23.120> quite<00:04:23.750> fearful<00:04:24.140> of<00:04:24.590> the

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
a woman is is quite fearful of the

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.650 
a woman is is quite fearful of the
consequences<00:04:25.460> of<00:04:25.520> a<00:04:25.669> nervous

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
consequences of a nervous

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.330 
consequences of a nervous
and<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:27.680> think<00:04:28.070> this<00:04:28.490> is<00:04:28.670> something<00:04:29.060> that<00:04:29.270> will

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
and I think this is something that will

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.700 
and I think this is something that will
not<00:04:31.340> entirely<00:04:32.240> change<00:04:32.810> clinical<00:04:33.260> practice

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
not entirely change clinical practice

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.200 
not entirely change clinical practice
but<00:04:33.920> will<00:04:34.100> certainly<00:04:34.250> affect<00:04:34.550> clinical

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
but will certainly affect clinical

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.690 
but will certainly affect clinical
practice<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:36.200> finally<00:04:36.740> I<00:04:37.010> just<00:04:37.280> want<00:04:37.640> to

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
practice and finally I just want to

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.370 
practice and finally I just want to
mention<00:04:37.850> that<00:04:38.060> there<00:04:38.660> is<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:38.810> new<00:04:39.020> chemotherapy

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
mention that there is a new chemotherapy

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.710 
mention that there is a new chemotherapy
drug<00:04:40.010> that<00:04:40.250> has<00:04:40.400> been<00:04:40.610> reported<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.480> that's<00:04:41.600> a

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
drug that has been reported and that's a

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.260 
drug that has been reported and that's a
drug<00:04:41.960> called<00:04:42.200> a<00:04:42.470> rib<00:04:42.680> Yulin<00:04:42.980> it's<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.670> dragon

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
drug called a rib Yulin it's a dragon

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.270 
drug called a rib Yulin it's a dragon
from<00:04:44.660> a<00:04:45.110> sea<00:04:45.770> sponge<00:04:46.540> and<00:04:47.590> it<00:04:48.590> has<00:04:48.830> been<00:04:49.040> looked

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
from a sea sponge and it has been looked

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.560 
from a sea sponge and it has been looked
at<00:04:49.490> in<00:04:49.520> women<00:04:50.030> who<00:04:50.270> have<00:04:51.760> relatively<00:04:52.760> advanced

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
at in women who have relatively advanced

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.840 
at in women who have relatively advanced
metastatic<00:04:53.900> breast<00:04:54.260> cancer<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:55.220> in<00:04:55.670> that

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
metastatic breast cancer and in that

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.230 
metastatic breast cancer and in that
setting<00:04:56.180> it<00:04:56.870> led<00:04:57.290> to<00:04:57.560> a<00:04:57.590> small<00:04:58.220> improvement<00:04:58.820> in

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
setting it led to a small improvement in

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.510 
setting it led to a small improvement in
progression-free<00:04:59.450> survival<00:04:59.950> or<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.070> amount

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
progression-free survival or the amount

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.860 
progression-free survival or the amount
of<00:05:01.610> time<00:05:01.820> that<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.120> cancer<00:05:02.480> was<00:05:02.570> under

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
of time that the cancer was under

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.940 
of time that the cancer was under
control<00:05:03.050> and<00:05:03.650> a<00:05:04.630> an<00:05:05.630> improvement<00:05:06.230> in<00:05:06.590> an

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
control and a an improvement in an

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.980 
control and a an improvement in an
overall<00:05:07.430> survival<00:05:07.880> and<00:05:08.300> I<00:05:08.390> think<00:05:08.600> it's<00:05:08.690> a<00:05:08.780> drug

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
overall survival and I think it's a drug

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.480 
overall survival and I think it's a drug
we're<00:05:09.170> going<00:05:09.290> to<00:05:09.350> be<00:05:09.440> hearing<00:05:09.680> more<00:05:09.920> from<00:05:09.980> I

we're going to be hearing more from I

we're going to be hearing more from I
suspect<00:05:11.390> it's<00:05:11.600> one<00:05:11.780> of<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:12.020> last

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
suspect it's one of the last

that it's a boat botannical and you know

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.760 
that it's a boat botannical and you know
how<00:05:23.240> patients<00:05:23.720> are<00:05:23.810> saying<00:05:24.140> I<00:05:24.230> want<00:05:24.470> something

how patients are saying I want something
natural<00:05:25.400> so<00:05:26.090> this<00:05:26.330> is<00:05:26.570> it's<00:05:27.140> you<00:05:27.410> know<00:05:27.530> what

natural so this is it's you know what

natural so this is it's you know what
more<00:05:28.790> could<00:05:29.480> someone<00:05:29.810> want<00:05:30.020> than<00:05:30.230> a<00:05:30.320> drug<00:05:30.590> from

more could someone want than a drug from
