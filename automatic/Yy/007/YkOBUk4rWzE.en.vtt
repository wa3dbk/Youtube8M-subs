things like silicones because they're

cone<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.619> silicone<00:02:09.619> so<00:02:09.950> it's<00:02:10.250> very<00:02:10.430> easy<00:02:10.700> to

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
cone is a silicone so it's very easy to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.420 
cone is a silicone so it's very easy to
spot<00:02:11.330> them<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.990> some<00:02:12.800> of<00:02:12.830> them<00:02:12.950> are<00:02:13.040> easier<00:02:13.370> to

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
spot them and some of them are easier to

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
part they're good at blocking moisture

out<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:18.320> your<00:02:18.500> hair<00:02:18.920> when<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:20.090> know<00:02:20.210> you

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
straighten it it's very good but product

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.810 
straighten it it's very good but product
buildup<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.300> very<00:02:23.690> easy<00:02:23.900> with<00:02:24.200> silicone<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:25.520> if

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
buildup is very easy with silicone so if

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.570 
buildup is very easy with silicone so if

you don't like product build-up and he

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.310 
you don't like product build-up and he
might<00:02:29.000> take<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.390> while<00:02:29.570> before<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.960> wash<00:02:30.140> your

might take a while before you wash your
hair<00:02:30.470> again<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.190> when<00:02:31.490> it's<00:02:31.640> just<00:02:31.820> using

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240

them too much and if you do have a lot

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.910 
them too much and if you do have a lot
of<00:02:34.910> product<00:02:35.270> build-up<00:02:35.660> then<00:02:35.960> you<00:02:36.320> have<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.800> get

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
of product build-up then you have to get

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.790 
of product build-up then you have to get
rid<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:37.280> how<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:38.420> should<00:02:38.870> exfoliate<00:02:39.170> since

we don't use for bristle brushes like

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.990 
we don't use for bristle brushes like
our<00:02:42.230> straight<00:02:42.620> hair<00:02:42.830> counterparts<00:02:43.640> who

our straight hair counterparts who

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.420 
our straight hair counterparts who

pretty<00:02:46.730> well<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.270> actually<00:02:47.570> started<00:02:47.990> using<00:02:48.320> a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
pretty well I actually started using a

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.010 
pretty well I actually started using a
scout<00:02:48.980> scrub<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:50.000> found<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.270> recipe<00:02:50.420> for

scout scrub and I found a recipe for
that<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.590> tweaked<00:02:52.190> it<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.430> little<00:02:52.459> bit<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.880> my

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
that and tweaked it a little bit to my

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.290 
that and tweaked it a little bit to my
liking<00:02:53.270> and<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:54.620> really<00:02:55.190> like<00:02:55.580> using<00:02:55.880> it

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
liking and I really like using it

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.760

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.990 
to eat a lot of protein and you can get
protein<00:03:39.800> from<00:03:39.860> so<00:03:40.190> many<00:03:40.280> sources<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:40.910> if

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
protein from so many sources so if

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.670 
protein from so many sources so if
you're<00:03:41.090> vegetarian<00:03:41.269> don't<00:03:42.050> give<00:03:42.230> me<00:03:42.260> that<00:03:42.410> as

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
you're vegetarian don't give me that as

harder<00:03:46.280> but<00:03:46.310> there<00:03:46.880> are<00:03:47.209> things<00:03:47.239> like<00:03:47.870> soy

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
harder but there are things like soy

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.980 
harder but there are things like soy
beans<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.739> other

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
beans and other

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.130 
beans and other
nasty<00:03:49.590> looks<00:03:50.100> he<00:03:50.850> had<00:03:50.940> good<00:03:51.060> stuff<00:03:51.210> I<00:03:51.480> really<00:03:51.930> I

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
nasty looks he had good stuff I really I

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.110 
nasty looks he had good stuff I really I
don't<00:03:52.530> know<00:03:52.650> how<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:52.890> do<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.130> for<00:03:53.370> me<00:03:53.520> if<00:03:53.730> in

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
don't know how you do it for me if in

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.160 
don't know how you do it for me if in
fact<00:03:54.470> I'm<00:03:55.470> always<00:03:55.740> eating<00:03:56.190> quesadillas<00:03:57.170> but

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
fact I'm always eating quesadillas but

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.800 
fact I'm always eating quesadillas but
you<00:03:58.410> have<00:03:58.590> cheese<00:03:59.190> beans<00:03:59.760> turkey<00:04:00.390> that's<00:04:00.600> all

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
you have cheese beans turkey that's all

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.660 
you have cheese beans turkey that's all
protein<00:04:01.380> right<00:04:01.560> there<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:02.070> then<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.250> have<00:04:02.460> some

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
protein right there and then I have some

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.280 
protein right there and then I have some
vegetables<00:04:03.210> in<00:04:03.360> there<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.780> have<00:04:03.960> to<00:04:04.050> think<00:04:04.200> of

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
vegetables in there I have to think of

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.840 
vegetables in there I have to think of
it<00:04:04.380> like<00:04:04.530> this<00:04:04.740> what<00:04:05.310> if<00:04:05.400> your<00:04:05.550> hair

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
it like this what if your hair

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.540 
it like this what if your hair
essentially<00:04:06.420> made<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:06.870> protein<00:04:07.620> so<00:04:08.280> if<00:04:08.400> you

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
essentially made of protein so if you

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.930 
essentially made of protein so if you
don't<00:04:08.730> eat<00:04:08.910> protein<00:04:09.420> how<00:04:10.200> can<00:04:10.410> your<00:04:10.500> body<00:04:10.940> you

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
don't eat protein how can your body you

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.390 
don't eat protein how can your body you
know<00:04:12.060> just<00:04:12.330> all<00:04:12.690> of<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.320> sudden<00:04:13.620> make<00:04:13.830> protein

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
know just all of a sudden make protein

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.910 
know just all of a sudden make protein
out<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:15.180> nowhere<00:04:15.360> if<00:04:15.690> you're<00:04:15.900> not<00:04:16.140> eating<00:04:16.440> and

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
out of nowhere if you're not eating and

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.400 
out of nowhere if you're not eating and
getting<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:18.030> nutrients<00:04:18.540> that<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.900> need<00:04:18.930> then

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
getting the nutrients that you need then

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.740 
getting the nutrients that you need then
you<00:04:19.739> need<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.340> take<00:04:20.550> supplement<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.360> haven't

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
you need to take supplement I haven't

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
been eating as much as I should be

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.220

to<00:05:17.550> follow<00:05:17.940> them<00:05:18.180> so<00:05:18.390> if<00:05:18.450> you<00:05:18.540> don't<00:05:18.660> like<00:05:18.840> the

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
to follow them so if you don't like the

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.660 
to follow them so if you don't like the
taste<00:05:19.140> of<00:05:19.380> it<00:05:19.440> because<00:05:19.710> it<00:05:19.830> is<00:05:19.950> rather<00:05:20.130> strong

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
taste of it because it is rather strong

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.840 
taste of it because it is rather strong
um<00:05:21.230> you<00:05:22.230> can<00:05:22.470> take<00:05:22.650> that<00:05:22.680> or<00:05:23.220> you<00:05:23.340> can<00:05:23.490> take<00:05:23.640> it

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
um you can take that or you can take it

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.690 
um you can take that or you can take it
in<00:05:24.060> liquid<00:05:24.330> as<00:05:24.750> well<00:05:25.050> but<00:05:25.830> you<00:05:26.310> need<00:05:26.490> to<00:05:26.550> take

in liquid as well but you need to take

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.180 
in liquid as well but you need to take
your<00:05:26.850> supplements<00:05:27.390> because<00:05:27.720> if<00:05:28.500> you<00:05:28.980> don't

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190
