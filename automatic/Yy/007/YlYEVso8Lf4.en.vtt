00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
played very well the first 20 minutes

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.390 
played very well the first 20 minutes
the<00:01:04.350> last<00:01:04.379> 10<00:01:04.799> minutes<00:01:04.830> they<00:01:05.159> played<00:01:05.369> very

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the last 10 minutes they played very

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.330 
the last 10 minutes they played very
well<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.510> time<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.900> between<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.950> great<00:01:08.159> at

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
well that time in between not great at

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.490 
well that time in between not great at
all<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.700> didn't<00:01:09.090> think<00:01:09.150> man<00:01:09.330> united<00:01:09.780> was<00:01:09.960> shown

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
all I didn't think man united was shown

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.109 
all I didn't think man united was shown
either<00:01:10.650> thought<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.520> were<00:01:11.580> pretty<00:01:11.729> shocking

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
either thought they were pretty shocking

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.660 
either thought they were pretty shocking
but<00:01:12.510> at<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.170> end<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> day<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:14.189> wasn't<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
but at the end of the day it wasn't a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.280 
but at the end of the day it wasn't a
massive<00:01:15.060> defeat<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.630> would<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.020> liked<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.170> I

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
massive defeat I would have liked to I

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.359 
massive defeat I would have liked to I
thought<00:01:16.530> I've<00:01:16.650> drawn<00:01:17.040> would<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.250> been<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
thought I've drawn would have been a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.010 
thought I've drawn would have been a
fair<00:01:17.610> result<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.119> didn't<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:18.509> Spurs<00:01:18.780> took

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
fair result I didn't think Spurs took

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.630 
fair result I didn't think Spurs took
their<00:01:19.170> chances<00:01:19.200> all<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> time<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.189> think

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
their chances all the time I think

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.770 
their chances all the time I think
Chadli<00:01:20.970> could<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.210> done<00:01:21.330> better<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
Chadli could have done better on the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.810 
Chadli could have done better on the
ball<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.200> thought<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> lot<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> passing

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
ball I thought that a lot of the passing

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.490 
ball I thought that a lot of the passing
was<00:01:23.909> overweighted<00:01:24.659> they're<00:01:24.840> losing<00:01:25.080> balls

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
was overweighted they're losing balls

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.830 
was overweighted they're losing balls
making<00:01:25.770> City<00:01:26.070> sloppy<00:01:26.790> mistakes<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.360> passing

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
making City sloppy mistakes on passing

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.140 
making City sloppy mistakes on passing
and<00:01:28.280> that's<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> reason<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.759> think<00:01:29.820> at<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> end

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
and that's the reason I think at the end

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.940 
and that's the reason I think at the end
of<00:01:30.299> day<00:01:30.450> they<00:01:30.570> lost<00:01:30.750> that's<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> game<00:01:31.439> okay

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
of day they lost that's the game okay

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.810 
of day they lost that's the game okay
but<00:01:32.130> we're<00:01:32.220> going<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> aim<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.520> some

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
but we're going to aim for some

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.850 
but we're going to aim for some
positives<00:01:33.299> your<00:01:34.079> names<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.290> positives<00:01:34.770> I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.330 
you've been on top for 25 minutes it's
hardest<00:01:40.350> about<00:01:40.530> your<00:01:40.680> sponsor<00:01:40.950> yourself<00:01:41.189> back

give<00:01:48.570> me<00:01:48.630> top<00:01:48.810> scorer<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> league<00:01:49.340> well<00:01:50.340> I

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
give me top scorer in the league well I

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.730 
give me top scorer in the league well I
think<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.060> harry<00:01:51.990> kane<00:01:52.229> has<00:01:52.409> got<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
think that harry kane has got a

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.749 
think that harry kane has got a
possibility<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.149> top<00:01:54.390> scorer<00:01:55.170> but

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
possibility to be the top scorer but

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.240 
possibility to be the top scorer but
Spurs<00:01:56.759> will<00:01:57.240> probably<00:01:57.659> finish<00:01:57.869> about<00:01:58.320> seven

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
Spurs will probably finish about seven

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.660 
Spurs will probably finish about seven
or<00:01:59.369> six<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.969> last<00:02:00.240> season<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.049> yeah<00:02:01.710> okay<00:02:02.610> so

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
or six like last season and yeah okay so

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.810 
or six like last season and yeah okay so
sixth<00:02:03.210> or<00:02:03.329> seventh<00:02:03.600> out<00:02:03.719> last<00:02:03.899> season<00:02:04.110> Louie<00:02:04.469> I

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
sixth or seventh out last season Louie I

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.859 
sixth or seventh out last season Louie I

wrong I'm gonna go for a top-four
position<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.060> think<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.780> Harry<00:02:10.110> Kane<00:02:10.410> will<00:02:10.830> do

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
service I think without service he's

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.559 
service I think without service he's
like<00:02:16.409> any<00:02:16.680> other<00:02:17.099> striker<00:02:17.430> useless<00:02:17.939> he<00:02:18.329> needs

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
like any other striker useless he needs

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.360 
like any other striker useless he needs
the<00:02:18.780> service<00:02:19.170> once<00:02:19.379> he<00:02:19.469> gets<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.799> he'll<00:02:20.219> put

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
the service once he gets that he'll put

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.860 
the service once he gets that he'll put
