00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.930
 my 93 year old father read mine 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.419
 book and had fun but he told me 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.939
 that my book is often negative 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:27.480
 don't do this don't do that high 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.820
 be careful that this thing is not going to 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.410
 good end and this one not even mine 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.360
 it is not a negative book as the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.000
 titolo is a book you want to avoid 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.760
 disappointments and also wants to avoid some 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.690
 whining of the artists who decides to 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.929
 do this job 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.820
 tonight here at the pac of milan where it is 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.339
 you can also see the last days 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.899
 of the beautiful exhibition of an artist 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.530
 who made it 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.640
 jeff wall i'll be there but more than anything else 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.899
 it will be an idol of youth crowds 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.949
 it's more like a skepticism 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.789
 character of art respects 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.010
 Contemporary 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.480
 I met him and I did the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.399
 bet for fear just like 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.220
 I felt about contemporary art and 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:13.049
 everyone defended the art 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.240
 contemporary because I went there a 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.610
 attitude I really have to do that 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.640
 not even a little and this is the thing he does 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.219
 pissed off everyone defends her or 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.630
 then he arrives bonami that I knew 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:30.030
 only by name the critic curator he 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.640
 defended but below conquers us 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.560
 in the end, in short, there is an aftertaste of 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.329
 dozens revive if we are scoundrels 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.270
 this this there is maybe it doesn't come to 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.700
 to say this, however, already granted me the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.039
 fact that you write a book this does not 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.710
 I did also admit that there is a 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.070
 problem actually is not so what 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.520
 I want to tell the artists 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.960
 failure is a very strong part 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.810
 of the artist's trade 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.510
 art is a sport is a sport that one 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.400
 can do to have fun putting it all 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.369
 with passion but with a conscience that 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.619
 things almost certainly go wrong not 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.070
 it is not pessimism but it is simply 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:17.570
 realism if the curator is the curator 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:21.470
 he is not an artist in my opinion 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.540
 thinking so much and he discovered in 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.630
 this book that he and was an artist 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.750
 so in reality he tried private 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.270
 you can't get 15 slow poisoned 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.870
 It is difficult to determine whether the artist is a 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.030
 job vocation is definitely 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.640
 at the beginning a vocation for the majority 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.290
 lucky turns into a job though 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.950
 in reality it is not true because in any case the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.840
 cen affection is seen when he wrote 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.730
 he had also approved of affection 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.180
 a bit of piety I mean profession 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.150
 that gives itself to its vocation 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.459
 any professional structure 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.400
 they have precise goals and yes 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.489
 they pursue keeping under control also 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.170
 the wildest impulses that wait 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.750
 could have I walked around one 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.920
 film and somehow I saw myself again 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.860
 as a director but I don't know if the director one 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:20.799
 love hate relationship with the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.930
 actors that if it could affect but e 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:26.780
 in fact they are not servants but it is 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.090
 also grateful because I represent there 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.650
 they stage what you wrote 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.079
 and I suspect that even the 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.900
 be it so now I don't know 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.260
 in reality he hates them but he lives with them 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.690
 artists the good thing that the director can 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.049
 use can make a cartoon and then 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.299
 the snow actor eliminated the art is a 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.260
 language must be understood by those 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.329
 that are around us 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.280
 there are those who understand it is that the 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.320
 they also want to have and buy it 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.460
 so maybe the combination of these 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.510
 what's this 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.150
 is the most suitable answer for the speaker 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.310
 only to satisfy the market and then 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.590
 the curator must promise to have 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.510
 this double soul must be struck 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.410
 but from the sensitivity of an artist 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.050
 the curator at the end of the first numbers 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.730
 must therefore bring home this double 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.670
 soul allows him to be even a little 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.720
 pigeons that a mistake that maybe not 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.880
 I know if I wrote in the book but not 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.250
 we must try to impress the 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.670
 critical the weight must be impressed to 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.050
 regardless of ours we must not do 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.940
 stunts because that's the thing 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.270
 worst is the artist will have some 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.890
 character but always applauded 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.530
 the applause always because yes 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.840
 accept the fact must be paid 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.060
 that one shows a side of itself 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.250
 because actually when you see something 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.320
 that senseless and there is what you that 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.990
 competent destroy you unless 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.890
 you are not the one the subject in 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.230
 question 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.720
 also enjoy here why this is the 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.880
 corrida corrado bullfight because 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.020
 liked because there was the housewife 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.070
 repressed and deserved to be punished 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.990
 in quotes 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:10.700
 there is a kind of pleasure and evolution 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.260
 it was masterchef for example a little of 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.740
 here especially when the dish does 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.130
 sucks in the book used a term 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.600
 invented a term is subscribed mm 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.600
 superstitious romantic in the sense yes 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.450
 have the passion to have the 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.850
 the illusion having dream that art 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.250
 can change the world with a bit of 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.800
 bad luck in the sense of knowing things 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.450
 they can go wrong and so maybe 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.760
 the world we will not be able to change it with 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.700
 our works of art but to try 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.540
 I believe it is a legitimate feeling is 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.310
 a romantic feeling that precisely of 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.740
 you the superstition becomes subscription is 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.490
 that I am very superstitious and the 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.770
 book is ever 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.100
 good is there when you release us art 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.200
 contemporary you make your own corner 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.800
 contemporary art fi and wi fi as of 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:04.570
 good with friends that will approach you 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.220
 and tempt you to read even if not otherwise 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.650
 inter you mean even if it usually does 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.890
 lap of the wide lap so it's a bit for 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.480
 all in the limited world of art one 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.330
 must aspire to be a greater artist 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.610
 living remembering that ever 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.420
 1 universe always a little in any 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.420
 firenze a bischero 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:38.360
 I recommend to my televisionet friends 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:41.030
 punctual with the remote control no because su 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.270
 internet not changed 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:46.190
 that is, throwing the mouse is an evolution 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:50.380
 of the town of Gerry's remote control 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.380
 scotti is that the khimki goodies
