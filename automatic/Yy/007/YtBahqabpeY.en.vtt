00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
list this one is a size I guess six

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.620 
list this one is a size I guess six
months<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.809> year<00:00:13.130> so<00:00:14.130> it's<00:00:14.639> not<00:00:14.759> really<00:00:15.389> big

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
months to a year so it's not really big

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.200 
months to a year so it's not really big
though<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.320> might<00:00:16.500> look<00:00:16.740> like<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:17.970> not

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
though it might look like it it's not

I've<00:00:19.199> made<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.770> out<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.510> small<00:00:21.510> granny

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
I've made this out of small granny

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:30.380 
I've made this out of small granny
squares<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:25.039> with<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> thin<00:00:27.029> cotton<00:00:27.920> yarn<00:00:29.390> as

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
squares of with a thin cotton yarn as

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.180 
squares of with a thin cotton yarn as
you<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.779> see<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.340> worked<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.520> square<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:34.190> into

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
you can see I worked a square in into

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.240 
you can see I worked a square in into
the<00:00:35.520> granny<00:00:36.079> granny<00:00:37.079> square<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.649> think<00:00:38.190> you

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the granny granny square but I think you

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.660 
the granny granny square but I think you
can<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.700> with<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> with<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> normal<00:00:40.579> what<00:00:41.579> you

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
can do it with a with a normal what you

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.900 
can do it with a with a normal what you
call<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.180> square<00:00:43.020> inside<00:00:43.800> also<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.789> it

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
call it a square inside also so it

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.369 
call it a square inside also so it
doesn't<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.329> necessarily<00:00:45.690> necessarily

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
doesn't have necessarily necessarily

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.790 
doesn't have necessarily necessarily
have<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:48.289> be<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.710> square<00:00:50.340> inside<00:00:51.800> it's

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
have to be be a square inside it's

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.189 
have to be be a square inside it's
actually<00:00:53.399> very<00:00:53.789> very<00:00:54.270> very<00:00:54.600> easy<00:00:54.750> I've

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
supposed to be I've done one at each

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.010 
supposed to be I've done one at each
side<00:01:49.049> as<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.220> see<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.210> done<00:01:51.479> one

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.770 
half of the square and it's only to
create<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.670> line<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:07.039> nice<00:02:08.039> V<00:02:08.429> line<00:02:08.640> where<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
create a line a nice V line where the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.069 
create a line a nice V line where the
the<00:02:10.200> chest<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:11.039> supposed<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.580> be

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
the chest is is supposed to be

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.199 
the chest is is supposed to be
at<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.890> color<00:02:14.159> I've<00:02:14.519> used<00:02:14.909> half<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.900> square

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
at the color I've used half a square

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.860 
at the color I've used half a square
it's<00:02:18.209> not<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> diagonal<00:02:18.989> one<00:02:19.439> it's<00:02:19.620> an<00:02:19.950> half

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
it's not a diagonal one it's an half

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.250 
it's not a diagonal one it's an half
square<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:24.060> make<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.870> color<00:02:26.810> all<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.959> scrap

I'm sorry a bit thinner but you can also
use<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.329> whole<00:02:33.329> one<00:02:33.950> depending<00:02:34.950> on<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.219> size

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
use a whole one depending on the size

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.250 
use a whole one depending on the size
see<00:02:36.959> I'm<00:02:37.079> gonna<00:02:37.290> turn<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.769> around<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:39.260> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
see I'm gonna turn this around and the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.099 
see I'm gonna turn this around and the
back<00:02:40.469> is<00:02:40.680> actually<00:02:40.969> also<00:02:41.969> easy<00:02:42.209> it's<00:02:42.569> mainly

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
back is actually also easy it's mainly

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.209 
back is actually also easy it's mainly
consists<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.919> squares<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.560> arms

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:47.219 
consists of squares and that the arms

can you can get the pattern out of it

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.110 
can you can get the pattern out of it
like<00:03:03.959> this<00:03:04.199> see<00:03:05.099> it's<00:03:05.310> it's<00:03:05.609> actually<00:03:05.790> not

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
like this see it's it's actually not

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.649 
like this see it's it's actually not
that<00:03:06.419> easy<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:07.849> don't<00:03:08.849> even<00:03:08.969> know<00:03:09.180> why<00:03:09.329> I<00:03:09.359> kept

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
that easy I don't even know why I kept

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.459 
that easy I don't even know why I kept
got<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.989> pattern<00:03:10.199> from<00:03:10.409> it's<00:03:10.650> very<00:03:10.889> easy<00:03:11.069> so

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:12.469 
got the pattern from it's very easy so

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:17.059 
got the pattern from it's very easy so
yeah<00:03:13.469> and<00:03:14.459> at<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.209> border<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:16.500> give<00:03:16.889> it<00:03:16.979> a

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.490 
ironed at both sides and I've done these
two<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:35.159> make<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.370> little<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:36.780> know<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.169> hold<00:03:37.290> it
