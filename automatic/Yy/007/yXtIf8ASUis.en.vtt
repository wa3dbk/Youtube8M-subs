00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
kind of ready with a TPU plastic so I

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.270 
kind of ready with a TPU plastic so I
would've<00:01:38.509> expected<00:01:38.659> to<00:01:39.200> last<00:01:39.380> for<00:01:40.009> quite<00:01:40.220> a

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
would've expected to last for quite a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.580 
would've expected to last for quite a
while<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.149> does<00:01:41.479> feel<00:01:41.810> really<00:01:42.049> high

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
while and it does feel really high

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.310 
while and it does feel really high
quality<00:01:42.619> in<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.640> hand<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.119> also<00:01:44.990> like<00:01:45.170> the

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
quality in the hand and also like the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.649 
quality in the hand and also like the
color<00:01:45.619> scheme<00:01:45.829> on<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.520> cable<00:01:46.759> it<00:01:47.360> also

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
color scheme on the cable it also

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.959 
color scheme on the cable it also
matches<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.350> color<00:01:48.770> scheme<00:01:49.009> with<00:01:49.790> the

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
matches the color scheme with the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.399 
matches the color scheme with the
headset<00:01:50.329> so<00:01:50.509> it's<00:01:50.990> a<00:01:51.020> really<00:01:51.229> high<00:01:51.380> quality

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
headset so it's a really high quality

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.590 
headset so it's a really high quality
cable<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:52.549> wouldn't<00:01:52.909> expect<00:01:52.969> it<00:01:53.329> to<00:01:53.509> be

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
cable and I wouldn't expect it to be

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.959 
cable and I wouldn't expect it to be
breaking<00:01:53.960> any<00:01:54.140> time<00:01:54.409> soon<00:01:54.680> moving<00:01:55.579> up<00:01:55.670> along

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
breaking any time soon moving up along

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.840 
breaking any time soon moving up along
the<00:01:56.119> cable<00:01:56.299> you<00:01:56.540> do<00:01:56.659> find<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:57.049> control<00:01:57.759> sort<00:01:58.759> of

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
the cable you do find a control sort of

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.840 
the cable you do find a control sort of
panel<00:01:59.299> that's<00:01:59.780> where<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.350> able<00:02:00.829> to<00:02:01.100> change

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
panel that's where you able to change

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.179 
panel that's where you able to change
the<00:02:02.149> volume<00:02:02.329> and<00:02:02.780> either<00:02:03.229> turn<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.799> headset

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
the volume and either turn the headset

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.700 
the volume and either turn the headset
on<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:04.430> off<00:02:04.700> but<00:02:05.329> but<00:02:05.689> what<00:02:05.869> I<00:02:05.899> did<00:02:06.140> find<00:02:06.170> was

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
on and off but but what I did find was

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.600 
on and off but but what I did find was
that<00:02:06.909> even<00:02:07.909> if<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.619> switches<00:02:09.619> off<00:02:09.800> the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
that even if the switches off the

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.730 
that even if the switches off the
headset<00:02:10.880> would<00:02:11.240> still<00:02:11.480> work<00:02:11.630> so<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:12.230> honestly

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
headset would still work so I honestly

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.710 
headset would still work so I honestly
don't<00:02:12.980> know

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
don't know

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.870 
don't know
why<00:02:13.900> they<00:02:14.080> included<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.740> there<00:02:15.010> but<00:02:15.670> it's

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
why they included that there but it's

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.090 
why they included that there but it's
just<00:02:16.120> there<00:02:16.420> but<00:02:16.960> it<00:02:17.140> doesn't<00:02:17.500> actually<00:02:17.650> serve

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
just there but it doesn't actually serve

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.880 
just there but it doesn't actually serve
any<00:02:18.310> purpose<00:02:18.690> now<00:02:19.690> these<00:02:19.960> headsets<00:02:20.380> have<00:02:20.650> an

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
any purpose now these headsets have an

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.240 
any purpose now these headsets have an
all<00:02:21.190> plastic<00:02:21.400> design<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.440> they<00:02:23.440> do<00:02:23.500> kind<00:02:24.100> of

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
all plastic design and they do kind of

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.830 
all plastic design and they do kind of
feel<00:02:24.310> cheap<00:02:24.820> because<00:02:25.000> they're<00:02:25.210> pretty<00:02:25.480> light

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
feel cheap because they're pretty light

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.810 
feel cheap because they're pretty light
and<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.500> would<00:02:26.680> be<00:02:26.800> careful<00:02:27.010> when<00:02:27.310> I'm<00:02:27.430> handling

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
and I would be careful when I'm handling

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.570 
and I would be careful when I'm handling
these<00:02:28.030> but<00:02:28.900> overall<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.800> quality<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.550> decent

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
these but overall the quality is decent

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.900 
these but overall the quality is decent
for<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.420> price<00:02:31.510> they<00:02:32.500> does<00:02:32.830> have<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.700> headset

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
for the price they does have the headset

for the price they does have the headset
itself<00:02:34.210> is<00:02:34.600> quite<00:02:34.750> flexible<00:02:35.050> so<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.160> should<00:02:36.340> be

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
itself is quite flexible so it should be

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.120 
itself is quite flexible so it should be
able<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.760> fit<00:02:36.970> all<00:02:37.120> sizes<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:38.170> heads<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.620> it

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
to be retracted and not in use and I

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.560 
to be retracted and not in use and I
also<00:04:11.500> like<00:04:11.830> that<00:04:11.860> but<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.310> wish<00:04:12.760> that<00:04:13.090> when<00:04:13.360> you

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
also like that but I wish that when you

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.509 
also like that but I wish that when you
attack<00:04:14.080> it<00:04:14.110> it<00:04:14.380> would<00:04:14.530> automatically<00:04:15.190> turn

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
attack it it would automatically turn

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.460 
attack it it would automatically turn
the<00:04:15.670> microphone<00:04:15.850> off<00:04:16.330> but<00:04:16.900> this<00:04:17.019> is<00:04:17.169> normally

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
the microphone off but this is normally

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.719 
the microphone off but this is normally
a<00:04:17.530> feature<00:04:17.709> that<00:04:17.830> I<00:04:17.950> would<00:04:18.130> find<00:04:18.310> on<00:04:18.519> high-end

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
a feature that I would find on high-end
