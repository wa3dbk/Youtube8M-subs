cool abilities and I think she may have

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.940 
cool abilities and I think she may have
a<00:01:29.759> healing<00:01:30.299> ability<00:01:30.960> or<00:01:31.140> they<00:01:31.350> also<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
a healing ability or they also to have a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.640 
a healing ability or they also to have a
little<00:01:32.130> bit<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.549> healing<00:01:32.880> upgrade<00:01:33.619> but<00:01:34.619> I

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
little bit of a healing upgrade but I

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.319 
little bit of a healing upgrade but I
seem<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.100> remember<00:01:35.250> reading<00:01:35.640> about<00:01:35.820> Tinker

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
seem to remember reading about Tinker

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.359 
seem to remember reading about Tinker
Bell<00:01:36.509> being<00:01:37.320> out<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.470> Hilo<00:01:37.799> or<00:01:37.890> something<00:01:38.280> like

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
Bell being out of Hilo or something like

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.390 
Bell being out of Hilo or something like
that<00:01:39.110> but<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.710> my<00:01:40.829> characters<00:01:41.100> kind

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
that but I think all my characters kind

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.830 
that but I think all my characters kind
of<00:01:41.490> do<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.759> maybe<00:01:41.970> she<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.240> hasn't<00:01:42.420> upgrade

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
of do that maybe she just hasn't upgrade

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.200 
of do that maybe she just hasn't upgrade
for<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.229> their<00:01:44.100> hair<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.369> really<00:01:44.790> nice
