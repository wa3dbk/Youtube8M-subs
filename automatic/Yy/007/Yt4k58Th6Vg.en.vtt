country is not in favor of the Citizens
United<00:01:08.520> ruling<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.570> there's<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.900> lot<00:01:10.170> of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
United ruling so there's a lot of

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.370 
United ruling so there's a lot of
populist<00:01:10.920> feeling<00:01:11.610> about<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.200> is

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
populist feeling about that and this is

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.350 
populist feeling about that and this is
not<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.650> first<00:01:13.770> time<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> court<00:01:14.280> has<00:01:14.580> gone

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
not the first time the court has gone

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.109 
not the first time the court has gone
against<00:01:15.810> populist<00:01:16.340> Sensibility<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.970> back

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
against populist Sensibility going back

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.670 
against populist Sensibility going back

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
see this call attention to it

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.890 
see this call attention to it
clip<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:33.620> put<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.280> up<00:03:34.370> on<00:03:34.579> YouTube<00:03:35.000> make<00:03:35.720> it

clip it put it up on YouTube make it

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.140 
clip it put it up on YouTube make it
something<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.980> public<00:03:37.459> pays<00:03:37.670> attention<00:03:37.850> to

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
something that public pays attention to

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.910 
something that public pays attention to
absolutely<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.200> think<00:03:39.230> that's<00:03:39.500> important

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
absolutely and I think that's important

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.229 
absolutely and I think that's important
now<00:03:40.160> one<00:03:40.370> of<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.519> things<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:40.850> I<00:03:40.910> also<00:03:41.030> want

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
now one of the things that I also want

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.390 
now one of the things that I also want
to<00:03:41.299> bring<00:03:41.450> up<00:03:41.630> is<00:03:41.810> like<00:03:42.049> we<00:03:42.170> said<00:03:42.320> I<00:03:42.350> think<00:03:42.859> the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
to bring up is like we said I think the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.190 
to bring up is like we said I think the
conversation<00:03:44.000> first<00:03:44.239> started<00:03:44.750> because<00:03:44.959> of

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
conversation first started because of

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.050 
conversation first started because of
this<00:03:45.290> whole<00:03:45.500> spat<00:03:45.859> between<00:03:46.070> between<00:03:46.940> the

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
this whole spat between between the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.460 
this whole spat between between the
Supreme<00:03:47.510> Court<00:03:47.750> essentially<00:03:48.140> and<00:03:48.410> the

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
Supreme Court essentially and the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.229 
Supreme Court essentially and the
President<00:03:48.799> of<00:03:48.859> the<00:03:48.890> United<00:03:49.070> States<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.790> it's

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
President of the United States and it's

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.330 
President of the United States and it's
always<00:03:50.510> risky<00:03:51.290> business<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:51.829> take<00:03:52.040> on<00:03:52.220> the

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
always risky business to take on the

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.729 
always risky business to take on the
Supreme<00:03:52.670> Court<00:03:52.700> justices<00:03:53.390> because<00:03:53.720> they<00:03:53.959> tend

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
Supreme Court justices because they tend

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.559 
Supreme Court justices because they tend
to<00:03:54.859> always<00:03:55.160> bounce<00:03:55.489> back<00:03:55.670> these<00:03:56.150> people<00:03:56.450> are

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
to always bounce back these people are

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.720 
to always bounce back these people are
appointed<00:03:56.810> for<00:03:57.200> life<00:03:57.230> I<00:03:57.650> mean<00:03:57.799> this<00:03:57.980> it's<00:03:58.519> not

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
appointed for life I mean this it's not

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.610 
appointed for life I mean this it's not
an<00:03:58.910> easy<00:03:59.060> battle<00:03:59.390> to<00:03:59.660> fight<00:03:59.900> but<00:04:00.380> do<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.590> think

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
an easy battle to fight but do you think

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.960 
an easy battle to fight but do you think
the<00:04:00.980> Obama<00:04:01.069> administration<00:04:01.819> would<00:04:01.910> support

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
the Obama administration would support

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.970 
the Obama administration would support
something<00:04:02.780> like<00:04:02.930> this<00:04:03.109> because<00:04:03.350> then<00:04:03.680> it<00:04:03.799> does

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
something like this because then it does

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.580 
something like this because then it does
put<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.310> justices<00:04:05.000> on<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.299> spot<00:04:05.900> for<00:04:06.319> people

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
put the justices on the spot for people

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.370 
put the justices on the spot for people
to<00:04:06.739> see<00:04:06.890> if<00:04:07.010> they<00:04:07.130> wanted<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.750> their<00:04:08.750> reactions

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
to see if they wanted to their reactions

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.900 
to see if they wanted to their reactions
even<00:04:09.650> in<00:04:09.739> their<00:04:09.829> faces<00:04:10.250> you<00:04:10.430> can<00:04:10.549> instantly

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
even in their faces you can instantly

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.699 
even in their faces you can instantly
see<00:04:11.269> what<00:04:11.540> their<00:04:11.690> opinion<00:04:12.079> is<00:04:12.170> going<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.530> be

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
see what their opinion is going to be

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.970 
see what their opinion is going to be
and<00:04:13.010> like<00:04:13.700> we<00:04:13.850> said<00:04:14.030> if<00:04:14.150> 80%<00:04:14.959> of<00:04:15.079> Americans<00:04:15.620> are

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
and like we said if 80% of Americans are

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.680 
and like we said if 80% of Americans are
not<00:04:16.549> in<00:04:16.609> favor<00:04:16.970> of<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.209> Citizens<00:04:17.630> United

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
not in favor of the Citizens United

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.680 
not in favor of the Citizens United
ruling<00:04:18.049> then<00:04:18.739> if<00:04:19.250> they<00:04:19.609> know<00:04:19.880> who<00:04:20.359> they<00:04:20.539> want

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
ruling then if they know who they want

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.150 
ruling then if they know who they want
to<00:04:20.780> attack<00:04:21.109> if<00:04:21.380> they<00:04:21.470> see<00:04:21.530> these

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
to attack if they see these

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.680

gonna make the entire judicial system
more<00:04:59.090> political

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
more political

more political
without<00:05:00.260> that<00:05:00.470> I<00:05:00.500> don't<00:05:00.770> I<00:05:00.920> don't<00:05:00.980> think<00:05:01.130> it's

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340

it's going to make it more transparent
now<00:05:04.670> what's<00:05:05.240> going<00:05:05.630> to<00:05:05.660> be<00:05:05.900> political<00:05:06.380> is

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
now what's going to be political is

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.170 
now what's going to be political is
whether<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:06.800> Obama<00:05:06.970> administration<00:05:07.970> is

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
whether the Obama administration is

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.170 
whether the Obama administration is

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
taking on the Supreme Court you have to

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.880 
taking on the Supreme Court you have to
be<00:05:11.270> awfully<00:05:11.570> popular<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:12.110> take<00:05:12.290> on<00:05:12.470> something

as<00:05:13.040> powerful<00:05:13.670> as<00:05:13.850> that<00:05:14.240> what<00:05:14.630> you<00:05:14.780> talked

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
as powerful as that what you talked

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.500 
as powerful as that what you talked
about<00:05:15.100> appointed<00:05:16.100> for<00:05:16.250> life<00:05:16.280> the<00:05:16.970> resilience

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
of the court and that whole idea of

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.790 
of the court and that whole idea of
judicial<00:05:20.510> independence<00:05:20.660> if<00:05:21.320> the<00:05:21.500> Obama

judicial independence if the Obama

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.920 
judicial independence if the Obama
administration<00:05:22.610> is<00:05:22.760> seen<00:05:23.000> as<00:05:23.510> trying<00:05:23.780> to

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
administration is seen as trying to

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.590 
administration is seen as trying to
undermine<00:05:24.320> judicial<00:05:25.070> independence<00:05:25.420> that<00:05:26.420> is

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
undermine judicial independence that is

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.330 
undermine judicial independence that is
not<00:05:26.780> good<00:05:27.110> for<00:05:27.140> this<00:05:27.350> administration<00:05:28.040> and<00:05:28.190> I

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
not good for this administration and I

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.560 
not good for this administration and I
don't<00:05:28.610> think<00:05:28.880> at<00:05:29.000> this<00:05:29.120> point<00:05:29.330> in<00:05:29.510> the

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
don't think at this point in the

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.990 
don't think at this point in the
leadership<00:05:29.960> my<00:05:30.170> personal<00:05:30.650> opinion<00:05:31.010> that

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
leadership my personal opinion that

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.790 
leadership my personal opinion that
they're<00:05:32.210> strong<00:05:32.570> enough<00:05:32.810> to<00:05:33.410> take<00:05:33.590> on<00:05:33.740> the

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
they're strong enough to take on the

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.890 
they're strong enough to take on the
court<00:05:34.190> that<00:05:34.520> that's<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:34.940> way<00:05:35.150> to<00:05:35.180> fight<00:05:35.660> for

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
court that that's the way to fight for

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.810 
court that that's the way to fight for
change<00:05:36.070> because<00:05:37.070> then<00:05:37.310> he's<00:05:37.430> going<00:05:37.640> to<00:05:37.730> be

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
change because then he's going to be

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.050 
change because then he's going to be
essentially<00:05:38.600> litigating<00:05:39.440> his<00:05:39.890> first<00:05:40.280> nominee

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
essentially litigating his first nominee

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.300 
essentially litigating his first nominee
and<00:05:41.330> I<00:05:41.990> think<00:05:42.230> you<00:05:42.320> know<00:05:42.440> our<00:05:42.470> second<00:05:43.040> nominee

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
and I think you know our second nominee

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.420 
and I think you know our second nominee
excuse<00:05:43.640> me<00:05:43.990> why<00:05:44.990> why<00:05:45.320> litigate<00:05:45.710> that<00:05:45.860> now<00:05:46.010> one

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
excuse me why why litigate that now one

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.040 
excuse me why why litigate that now one
thing<00:05:46.640> I<00:05:46.760> think<00:05:46.820> that<00:05:47.090> could<00:05:47.419> be<00:05:47.450> a<00:05:47.600> good<00:05:47.750> idea

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
thing I think that could be a good idea

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.240 
thing I think that could be a good idea
is<00:05:48.260> that<00:05:48.290> now<00:05:48.560> people<00:05:48.919> won't<00:05:49.040> necessarily

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
is that now people won't necessarily

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.750 
is that now people won't necessarily
refer<00:05:49.940> to<00:05:50.120> a<00:05:50.150> Judge<00:05:50.540> Judy<00:05:51.080> as<00:05:51.430> the<00:05:52.430> people<00:05:52.730> they

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
refer to a Judge Judy as the people they

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.860 
refer to a Judge Judy as the people they
should<00:05:53.000> look<00:05:53.180> up<00:05:53.360> to<00:05:53.600> if<00:05:55.419> Joe<00:05:56.419> I<00:05:56.450> want<00:05:56.660> to<00:05:56.720> thank

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
should look up to if Joe I want to thank

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.659 
should look up to if Joe I want to thank
you<00:05:56.990> for<00:05:57.140> looking<00:05:57.260> here<00:05:57.710> should<00:05:58.310> the<00:05:58.520> Supreme

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
you for looking here should the Supreme

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.120 
you for looking here should the Supreme
Court<00:05:58.940> be<00:05:59.450> televised<00:06:00.050> that's<00:06:00.680> a<00:06:00.800> new<00:06:00.919> bait

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
Court be televised that's a new bait

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.560 
Court be televised that's a new bait
debate<00:06:01.430> that's<00:06:01.610> being<00:06:01.760> discussed<00:06:02.150> and<00:06:02.450> I

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
debate that's being discussed and I

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.020 
debate that's being discussed and I
personally<00:06:03.290> think<00:06:03.620> it's<00:06:04.010> a<00:06:04.070> very<00:06:04.220> bad<00:06:04.430> idea<00:06:04.490> I

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
personally think it's a very bad idea I

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.710 
personally think it's a very bad idea I
think<00:06:05.180> it<00:06:05.270> could<00:06:05.419> be<00:06:05.600> good<00:06:06.080> for<00:06:06.470> the<00:06:06.620> people
