 Please, welcome people, welcome. 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.510
 It's another video and today our video 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.240
 guys will be on making portion and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.730
 I'm going to teach how to do five types. 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.970
 portions is to teach to opposition 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.400
 regeneration speed weakness 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.960
 resistance to fire and force 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.420
 So get the notebooks and we'll write it down. 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.450
 I went back to igat and now I'm going to show 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.629
 the items needed to do it right are 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.770
 these positions 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:52.020
 so come on and we will need all 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.750
 these items that are are the Redstone Gunpowder 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.550
 can luminous stone eye of water is 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:05.750
 fermented sugar can increase blaze 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:09.180
 of magma tear of guest and neder background 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.460
 these bottles will also be needed. 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:19.020
 with normal water 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:21.210
 Let's get everyone here and support it. 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.000
 potions of course 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.150
 now to do the support portion galley 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.150
 very easy you get a wave of blaze and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.150
 three stones groups in boulder 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.479
 that's it, you can stop, you can stop 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.680
 Geez, thank you so much for the applause. 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:53.400
 so let's go and put the 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.250
 portions and prepare this position leaves 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.850
 she thus prepared to make 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.979
 proposition let's put a fund neder 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.009
 Let's do this in everyone put the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.350
 three of a fund to prepare the 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:13.650
 positions are being prepared with this 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:16.200
 we expect a little bit here already 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.030
 ready and this here is the strange position 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.850
 no effect position 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.330
 Now we'll do it and put a 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.250
 tear of guest here and we will do 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.720
 with the guest money the position of 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.590
 regeneration is the same strange thing without 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.170
 It is made 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.160
 Let's put the magma cream leave the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.190
 position 1 fire resistance 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.739
 here it was the same and we're going 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.370
 put the blaze pod let's put the pod 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.980
 blaze to make the position of force 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.900
 now the position of weakness we go 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:58.170
 put a fermented spider eye and the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.450
 position of speed opposition to 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.110
 People are going to put a sugar 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:09.090
 there am ready here all day 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.940
 here our position of regeneration was 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.890
 You're ready for 45 seconds for us. 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.959
 to increase her time, we can 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.450
 put a net stone 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.280
 the idea of ​​increasing our time 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.890
 position is 3 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.459
 Let's put a redstone to 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.440
 increase the time position of force has 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.640
 three minutes we will also increase the 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:36.450
 time of weakness one minute and thirty 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.060
 let's increase the time and our position 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.650
 agility or speed with three 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.829
 Let's increase her time. 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.829
 also 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.980
 now just wait a little bit 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:54.349
 here our position of regeneration of 45 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:01.160
 seconds went to two minutes 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:03.670
 if it is enough it is now our kaka 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.280
 our position of resistance to fire of 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.980
 two minutes I think or 33 minutes was 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.230
 for 8 minutes 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.989
 Also our position 3 min 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.639
 strength went to 8 minutes 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.479
 our position of speed and agility 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.130
 from three months went to 8 minutes 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.020
 it is a situation of weakness of one minute 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.110
 and half went for 4 minutes 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.410
 now we leave this portion 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.580
 would throw the gunpowder at her 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.380
 she will be responsible 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.130
 Let's put a gunpowder at home here. 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.300
 can only play the portion right 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.300
 Let's put it here too. 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.410
 in a little while you'll notice the guys 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.160
 What are you going to do with eight minutes? 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:53.050
 Note that as I put it to 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:57.470
 stay responsible I'll show you here 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.960
 with eight minutes is yours transformed into 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.450
 I would see you lower it. 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.000
 time of 8 - went to 6 minutes 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.400
 decreased two minutes but continued 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.460
 getting good the same way here is the 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 swine I guess was for three minutes 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.370
 It's still a lot of time for you. 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.919
 make a higher portion of the 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.680
 example the level 2 of a portion if 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:26.060
 puts luminous stone powder 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:29.120
 but this also decreases is the time goes 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.889
 decrease the time then understood that the 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.990
 times is not so good 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:38.300
 You have to do several several like this. 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:40.539
 You are taking understood and put here 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.539
 also 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.700
 now it 's just getting ready and waiting 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.770
 soon né that almost ready to and diminished 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.440
 for 16 seconds but is on the 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.260
 regeneration number level 2 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.590
 here was our throwing position 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.020
 lived with fire resistance by 2015 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.090
 you can not leave level 2 but 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.670
 decreases the time if you put the powder 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:08.090
 luminous stone the force stayed one minute and 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.310
 7 level 2 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.600
 the agility potion and the speed with 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.760
 one minute and 7 also level 2 and the position 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.669
 of weakness did not evolve but with 1 minute 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:27.770
 and 17 seconds too so let's get the 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:30.590
 modified here is people this is it 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:35.090
 It's really cool to leave the position 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:38.360
 if you are going to play in seila play in wool 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:42.190
 so this is good elton weakness 40 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.190
 seconds here 45 seconds
