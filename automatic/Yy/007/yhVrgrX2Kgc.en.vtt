hi<00:00:06.190> Lisa<00:00:06.460> I<00:00:06.940> learned<00:00:07.600> that<00:00:07.900> you<00:00:08.049> won<00:00:08.259> over

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 
hi Lisa I learned that you won over

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.279 
hi Lisa I learned that you won over
cancer<00:00:08.829> with<00:00:09.219> the<00:00:09.339> help<00:00:09.549> of<00:00:09.669> stem<00:00:09.969> cells<00:00:10.329> you

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:11.289 
cancer with the help of stem cells you

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:13.409 
cancer with the help of stem cells you
inspire<00:00:11.740> so<00:00:12.190> many<00:00:12.249> people<00:00:12.789> out<00:00:12.940> there

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:13.419 
inspire so many people out there

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.170 
inspire so many people out there
I<00:00:13.499> keep<00:00:14.499> hearing<00:00:14.919> about<00:00:15.009> stem<00:00:15.549> cells<00:00:15.879> these

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
I keep hearing about stem cells these

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.890 
I keep hearing about stem cells these
days<00:00:16.480> and<00:00:16.780> I<00:00:17.200> don't<00:00:17.260> have<00:00:17.710> an<00:00:17.830> idea<00:00:18.250> about<00:00:18.340> them

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
days and I don't have an idea about them

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.690 
days and I don't have an idea about them
can<00:00:19.900> you<00:00:20.020> please<00:00:20.230> explain<00:00:20.410> to<00:00:20.860> me<00:00:21.040> about<00:00:21.160> stem

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
can you please explain to me about stem

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.480 
can you please explain to me about stem
cells<00:00:22.030> to<00:00:22.450> understand<00:00:23.140> stem<00:00:23.590> cells<00:00:23.950> all<00:00:24.310> you

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
cells to understand stem cells all you

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.279 
cells to understand stem cells all you
have<00:00:24.700> to<00:00:24.820> do<00:00:24.970> is<00:00:25.180> imagine<00:00:25.300> the<00:00:25.690> stem<00:00:26.020> of<00:00:26.200> a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
have to do is imagine the stem of a

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.070 
have to do is imagine the stem of a
plant<00:00:26.320> it<00:00:27.039> grows<00:00:27.730> and<00:00:28.000> grows<00:00:28.060> and<00:00:28.270> branches

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
plant it grows and grows and branches

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.040 
plant it grows and grows and branches
out<00:00:29.260> into<00:00:29.500> leaves<00:00:29.950> flowers<00:00:30.670> and<00:00:30.880> fruits<00:00:31.180> there

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
out into leaves flowers and fruits there

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.169 
out into leaves flowers and fruits there
are<00:00:32.199> days<00:00:32.439> when<00:00:32.829> a<00:00:32.859> storm<00:00:33.280> blows<00:00:33.609> and<00:00:34.030> the

the world last year the Nobel Prize for
medicine<00:02:06.509> was<00:02:06.959> given<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.470> two<00:02:07.619> scientists

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
medicine was given to the two scientists

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.589 
medicine was given to the two scientists
who<00:02:08.340> are<00:02:08.610> working<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> stem<00:02:09.390> cell

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
who are working for the stem cell

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.410 
who are working for the stem cell
treatment<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.760> this<00:02:11.760> actually<00:02:12.090> makes<00:02:12.299> me

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
treatment and this actually makes me

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.960 
treatment and this actually makes me
believe<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.230> stem<00:02:13.470> cell<00:02:13.650> treatment<00:02:14.130> to

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
believe that the stem cell treatment to

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.759 
believe that the stem cell treatment to
transplants<00:02:15.660> have<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.870> promising<00:02:16.410> future<00:02:16.440> in

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
transplants have a promising future in

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.520 
transplants have a promising future in
medicine

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
medicine

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.550 
medicine
I<00:02:18.560> get<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.340> doctor<00:02:19.970> stem<00:02:20.570> cells<00:02:20.900> are<00:02:21.140> truly

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
I get it doctor stem cells are truly

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.400 
I get it doctor stem cells are truly
lifesavers<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.580> wish<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.480> could<00:02:23.660> want<00:02:23.840> my<00:02:23.990> hands

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
lifesavers I wish I could want my hands

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.740 
lifesavers I wish I could want my hands
on<00:02:24.530> them
