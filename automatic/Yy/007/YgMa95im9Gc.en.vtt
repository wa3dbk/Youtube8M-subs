00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.280
 Oh 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.320
 This is a snare system 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.679
 Follow 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.679
 Putsu 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:21.660
 Case It is one of the snare drums as the name already says 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:26.849
 The snare drum is one of the most important sounds among people 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:30.270
 The color of the entire beat also changes depending on the attack and tone of the snare drum 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.550
 Also it has changed sense of groove this snare 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.800
 p 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:42.610
 Unlike the smear of ef, it comes out from the throat using the mouth 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:49.659
 As a friend, please be aware of house pronunciation and the shape of the mouth of the house 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:50.570
 Please try to breathe So rather than put out the breath is to pronounce the house 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.050
 It is like this 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.050
 Ha 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.350
 2 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.350
 It almost feels like taking a breath 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.500
 I feel like I breathe to my stomach 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:13.460
 And such as it is a small air pocket at the end of the portion of the rear jaw back teeth in the mouth 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.390
 In the image 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:23.710
 Rubbing there makes the sound like muddy by rubbing the air 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.710
 Will the it mean a little while ago grinded of 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.979
 It would have been the friction that would rub here 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.550
 Yeah 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.810
 Do you know the difference of the next will sound 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.810
 Not'm'll more cost 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:47.060
 a 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:52.430
 So, as a point of caution in this practice, I swallowed saliva and entered a period and I am sorry 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:56.420
 Please be careful when you practice, as it may change . 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:00.000
 It's about the air than the period e 2 army and so 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:05.450
 It's about a few images to put it 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.450
 It will be cut short the sound 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:18.150
 So the total snare will be finished with this This sound is certainly not easy though 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:24.030
 It's a very important sound so practice and master it 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:27.950
