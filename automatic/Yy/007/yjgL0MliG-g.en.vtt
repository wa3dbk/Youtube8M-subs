00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.309 
similar to that little pixelated icon
that<00:04:00.849> we<00:04:01.030> are<00:04:01.180> seeing<00:04:01.419> on<00:04:01.599> the<00:04:01.720> photostream

that we are seeing on the photostream
application<00:04:02.979> at<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.459> time<00:04:03.699> nobody<00:04:03.970> thought

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
application at the time nobody thought

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.740 
application at the time nobody thought
much<00:04:04.569> of<00:04:04.599> it<00:04:04.959> but<00:04:05.260> combining<00:04:05.859> these<00:04:06.250> two

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
much of it but combining these two

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.420 
much of it but combining these two
fairly<00:04:07.750> small<00:04:08.169> leaks<00:04:08.500> makes<00:04:08.889> one<00:04:09.159> pretty

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
fairly small leaks makes one pretty

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.030 
fairly small leaks makes one pretty
significant<00:04:10.239> idea<00:04:10.959> of<00:04:11.109> what<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.470> iphone<00:04:11.829> 5

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
significant idea of what the iphone 5

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.619 
significant idea of what the iphone 5
could<00:04:12.370> look<00:04:12.549> like<00:04:12.579> all<00:04:13.090> right<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.419> this<00:04:13.569> next

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
could look like all right so this next

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.719 
could look like all right so this next
story<00:04:14.049> is<00:04:14.199> kind<00:04:14.409> of<00:04:14.530> crazy<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:15.099> kind<00:04:15.519> of

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:15.729 
story is kind of crazy and kind of

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.599 
story is kind of crazy and kind of
unbelievable<00:04:16.030> but<00:04:16.769> apparently<00:04:17.769> there<00:04:18.070> is<00:04:18.310> a

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
unbelievable but apparently there is a

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.479 
unbelievable but apparently there is a
iphone<00:04:19.539> 5<00:04:19.720> floating<00:04:20.169> around<00:04:20.260> out<00:04:20.560> in<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:21.130> wild

iphone 5 floating around out in the wild

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.850 
iphone 5 floating around out in the wild
because<00:04:21.849> an<00:04:22.090> apple<00:04:22.539> employee<00:04:22.630> left<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.529> in<00:04:23.680> a

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
because an apple employee left it in a

because an apple employee left it in a
mexican<00:04:24.340> bar<00:04:24.610> okay<00:04:25.330> so<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.599> story<00:04:25.840> goes<00:04:25.930> that

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110
