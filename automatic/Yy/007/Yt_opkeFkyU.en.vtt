00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.570
 hello to all subscribers and viewers of my 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.930
 channel today I open a new 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.539
 rubric but I donâ€™t know what yet 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.940
 Want to suggest how I call write 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.220
 below in the comments and in this section I 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.470
 I will review different liquids 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.630
 fertilizer tablets equipment 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:37.110
 Today my choice fell on tetra plant 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.329
 min fertilizer is good enough but 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.309
 he has one thing but the instructions say 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.760
 wrong dosage it contains 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.829
 iron chelate it is absorbed 70 percent 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.050
 and we know that peak soaking up all 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.969
 plant matter goes first 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.819
 half an hour to forty minutes when you turn on the light 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.339
 the peak of activity is already on 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:58.319
 the plant already absorbs all substances 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.979
 much worse because he already 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.530
 calmed down 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.589
 and when we turn on the light she start 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.790
 to look for food 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.890
 them and add this plan to mine I would 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.590
 advised as he used to pour out 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.600
 aquarium this for half an hour 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.289
 Well, that is, we have included and we can already immediately 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.750
 add it to the aquarium who writes doses 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.000
 different, I chose one two millimeters 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.280
 punish that liter if you have big 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.520
 the number of plants we take 5 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.140
 milliliters for every gray liters 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.590
 be sure to shake it and pour it 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.420
 his boyfriend says 5 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.890
 milliliters per 10 liters once a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.740
 week or once a month 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.049
 this is nonsense we feed you only ours 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.560
 algae if you do this when changing 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.439
 then remove the water but fill and add 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.600
 this center boards have nothing more to say 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.490
 because up fertilizer enough 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.549
 good it contains a lot of iron o 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.719
 iron we need for succulent green 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.060
 beautiful leaves 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.429
 as iron can do it myself 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.740
 I have a video down somewhere around 50 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.590
 can fatal anyone interesting to see 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.210
 do the iron yourself and add 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.200
 the concentration is less than this fertilizer 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:18.150
 on the colors on some orange brown 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.100
 on the smell of some kind of technical 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.550
 some kind of technical fluid 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.750
 I dressed fertilizer when do iron and 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.490
 bivalent then it is completely nothing 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.100
 he also smelled of potassium 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.500
 smells here have all the necessary 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.450
 trace elements macro and micro which 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.950
 needed for aquarium plants and if
