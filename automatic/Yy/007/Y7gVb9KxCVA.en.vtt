00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
definitely has sparkle in it but it's a

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.060 
definitely has sparkle in it but it's a
more<00:01:36.860> pink<00:01:37.860> brown<00:01:38.280> color<00:01:39.470> that<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.500> what<00:01:40.830> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
aspects of it it's worth the money

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.170 
aspects of it it's worth the money
especially<00:03:50.220> if<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.400> wanted<00:03:50.609> to<00:03:50.700> give<00:03:50.820> this<00:03:50.970> as

especially if you wanted to give this as
a<00:03:51.209> gift<00:03:51.299> I<00:03:51.750> think<00:03:51.959> it's<00:03:52.079> a<00:03:52.200> very<00:03:52.350> very<00:03:52.650> very

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
a gift I think it's a very very very

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.340 
a gift I think it's a very very very
good<00:03:53.190> idea<00:03:56.480> so<00:03:57.480> as<00:03:57.600> you<00:03:57.660> can<00:03:57.840> see<00:03:58.019> that<00:03:58.170> that's

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
good idea so as you can see that that's

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.190 
good idea so as you can see that that's
the<00:03:58.560> blue<00:03:58.940> this<00:03:59.940> one<00:04:00.180> I've<00:04:00.359> worn<00:04:00.570> this<00:04:00.840> this

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
the blue this one I've worn this this

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.460 
the blue this one I've worn this this
really<00:04:01.530> electric<00:04:01.920> purple<00:04:02.340> I've<00:04:02.519> worn<00:04:03.209> as<00:04:03.480> a<00:04:03.780> as

a<00:04:06.769> line<00:04:07.769> or<00:04:07.980> color<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.609> I<00:04:08.940> actually<00:04:09.120> really

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
a line or color and I actually really

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.949 
a line or color and I actually really
like<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:15.150> they're<00:04:15.329> definitely<00:04:15.510> really

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
like that so they're definitely really

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.120 
like that so they're definitely really
pigmented<00:04:16.380> see<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.220> black<00:04:17.489> hasn't<00:04:17.940> met<00:04:18.120> this

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
pigmented see the black hasn't met this

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.450 
pigmented see the black hasn't met this
light<00:04:20.130> color<00:04:20.400> is<00:04:20.579> a<00:04:20.609> matte<00:04:21.740> this<00:04:22.740> purple<00:04:23.280> is

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
light color is a matte this purple is

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.810 
light color is a matte this purple is
definite<00:04:23.970> Matt<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:25.680> then<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.430> other<00:04:26.460> ones

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
definite Matt and then the other ones

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.670 
definite Matt and then the other ones
are<00:04:26.970> either<00:04:27.210> like<00:04:27.510> a<00:04:27.539> shimmer<00:04:28.169> a<00:04:30.140> machine<00:04:31.140> not

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
are either like a shimmer a machine not

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.070 
are either like a shimmer a machine not
necessarily<00:04:32.190> like<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.669> glitter<00:04:33.419> and<00:04:33.780> there<00:04:33.930> are

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
necessarily like a glitter and there are

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.770 
necessarily like a glitter and there are
ones<00:04:34.320> that<00:04:34.410> have<00:04:35.190> obvious<00:04:35.729> chunks<00:04:36.300> of<00:04:36.450> glitter

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
ones that have obvious chunks of glitter

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:45.870 
ones that have obvious chunks of glitter
in<00:04:37.050> them<00:04:39.560> looking<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.650> bee<00:04:40.710> stings<00:04:40.740> my<00:04:41.160> fingers

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.660 

so<00:04:46.880> i<00:04:47.300> will<00:04:48.080> probably<00:04:48.410> when<00:04:48.980> i<00:04:49.010> put<00:04:49.340> this<00:04:49.460> away

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
so i will probably when i put this away

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.780 
so i will probably when i put this away
in<00:04:50.120> my<00:04:52.660> makeup<00:04:53.660> drawers<00:04:54.110> will<00:04:54.980> separate<00:04:55.610> them

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
in my makeup drawers will separate them

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.870 
in my makeup drawers will separate them
just<00:04:56.030> because<00:04:56.120> it'll<00:04:56.360> be<00:04:56.390> easier<00:04:56.810> that<00:04:57.020> way

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
just because it'll be easier that way

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.730 
just because it'll be easier that way
but<00:04:58.880> this<00:04:59.060> would<00:04:59.300> be<00:04:59.420> like<00:04:59.450> actually<00:04:59.900> if<00:05:00.620> you

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
but this would be like actually if you

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.860 
but this would be like actually if you
were<00:05:00.890> to<00:05:01.040> take<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.370> plastic<00:05:01.580> out<00:05:02.090> a<00:05:02.330> good

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
were to take the plastic out a good

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.410 
were to take the plastic out a good
travel<00:05:03.230> makeup<00:05:03.800> kit<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.520> then<00:05:04.760> I<00:05:04.790> mean<00:05:05.090> the

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
travel makeup kit and then I mean the

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.840 
travel makeup kit and then I mean the
shadows<00:05:05.840> fit<00:05:06.200> perfectly<00:05:07.100> back<00:05:07.340> here<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:07.730> will

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
shadows fit perfectly back here you will

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.250 
shadows fit perfectly back here you will
need<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.030> bring<00:05:08.180> any<00:05:08.360> other<00:05:08.600> shadows<00:05:08.960> with<00:05:09.110> you

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260
