 hi this is raddho the video of 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.860
 day for gold denominated in dollars as well 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.720
 that for the money well 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.640
 so first of all thank you for being 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.920
 as many for yesterday's webinar 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.610
 devoted to the medium-term trend 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.680
 on gold 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.090
 it went very well there was 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.129
 a lot of questions that have been 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.750
 asked a lot more than I 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.620
 Expected what I expected in 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.700
 any case thanks to all the participants 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.739
 let's go back another gold denominated in 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.230
 dollars then things are obviously 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.210
 disappointing enough for gold holders 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.800
 1 any way from the moment when we 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.219
 broke the moving average at 20 sessions 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.860
 lee was relatively predictable as 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.080
 things are accelerating and that's it 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.630
 we have attended for three sessions 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.610
 three sessions of decline that brings us 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.930
 near a new test of the area 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:20.380
 of support here between the 1355 wholesale and 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.510
 the 1300 12 years old and it is true that the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.760
 crossing m7 a bath and co does not leave 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.560
 not bode very positive things 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.600
 all know that we are in the process of 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.270
 close here below the bollinger 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.670
 lower which is also not a 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.650
 good sign what I would like 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.030
 to linger today is the 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.490
 crossing of 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.880
 I have reported here to the and is preparing a 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.520
 little webinar a little tutorial then 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.869
 the lesson a set a mathematical tool 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.470
 which makes it a kind of two products 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.850
 where we are inspired by the differences of 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.440
 mons moving averages is a little bit 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.050
 technical but good if we look 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.869
 the use especially it is used as 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.799
 so we have an evolution of the ma 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.920
 waving around the 0's and we tend 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.239
 to say that when this famous mass and 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.860
 uncrosses his signal 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.239
 There is no if you are new 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.680
 technical analysis you have to know that 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.920
 you have nothing to calculate a it's the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.000
 platform that calculates it for you if 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.360
 you work on a good plate 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.489
 shape and good when the m gave cross 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.720
 his signal well it gives a signal 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.750
 of purchase or sale in this case 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.910
 here when we cross upward the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.780
 signal it's a buy signal like here 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.760
 and like there and of course when the ma 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.440
 yielded cross is reported downward as 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.420
 this is the case here or again there is a 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.950
 drop signal so I found you 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.870
 examples on gold 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.299
 look for example when the ma 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.420
 to cross at the bottom we finally signal 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.720
 vo late April it gave downward 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.489
 pau that involves which attended 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.709
 last month is another example 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.959
 when the masses and crossed his 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.959
 upward signal was late 2012 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.720
 well we got a very high rise 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.660
 important to whom we could also 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.230
 assist for more than a little more 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.959
 half months 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.680
 if I talk about it naturally, it's because 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.329
 that on the m yielded gold well 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.989
 look at a cross 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.120
 bearer is massaged soon signal 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.299
 which shows that there are chances 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.190
 for the downward trend to 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.280
 perpetuates then it's not a 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.640
 necessity it is not an obligation to 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.120
 100% but that's usually what it's 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.609
 past 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.700
 so now if we look at the money 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.900
 now denominated in dollars this is it 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.349
 that we can say 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.390
 the rise is symbolic but it is a 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.489
 increase anyway since one gets 0.2 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.819
 percent and the reason is probably to 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.280
 look for the test support side of 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.360
 $ 22 1 remember this support had 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.480
 already slowed down the decline during the tacc du 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.790
 April 16 to 1 a month ago and well the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.420
 It is clear that the market has 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.459
 of memory 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.280
 and these same levels have allowed to 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.049
 bounce back we will also notice that on 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.269
 the money the rcd did not cross his 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.109
 signal what is a little more 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.180
 encouraging 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.310
 I wish you a good day 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.860
 good trade and see you soon for 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.860
 our technical opinion it will be tomorrow night 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.159
 cmc markets 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.140
