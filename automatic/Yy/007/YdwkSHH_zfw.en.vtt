00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
in anime studio Pro 9 there have been

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.310 
in anime studio Pro 9 there have been
some<00:00:22.460> improvements<00:00:23.119> as<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:23.660> how<00:00:23.840> we<00:00:23.900> can<00:00:24.109> edit

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
some improvements as to how we can edit

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.339 
some improvements as to how we can edit
keyframes<00:00:24.980> in<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.369> timeline<00:00:25.820> this<00:00:26.750> tutorial

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
keyframes in the timeline this tutorial

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.249 
keyframes in the timeline this tutorial
will<00:00:27.619> cover<00:00:27.650> those<00:00:28.070> new<00:00:28.250> methods<00:00:29.050> first<00:00:30.050> of

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
will cover those new methods first of

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.770 
will cover those new methods first of
all<00:00:30.439> it<00:00:30.650> is<00:00:31.189> now<00:00:31.520> much<00:00:31.849> easier<00:00:32.090> to<00:00:32.570> add<00:00:32.750> a

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
all it is now much easier to add a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.930 
all it is now much easier to add a
keyframe<00:00:33.129> wherever<00:00:34.129> you<00:00:34.340> want<00:00:34.610> on<00:00:34.820> the

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
keyframe wherever you want on the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.600 
keyframe wherever you want on the
timeline<00:00:35.360> let's<00:00:36.260> say<00:00:36.440> for<00:00:36.680> instance<00:00:36.800> I<00:00:37.280> moved

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
timeline let's say for instance I moved

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.569 
timeline let's say for instance I moved
to<00:00:37.879> frame<00:00:38.269> 72<00:00:38.900> on<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:39.170> timeline<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:39.890> I<00:00:40.339> want

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
to frame 72 on the timeline and I want

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.460 
to frame 72 on the timeline and I want
to<00:00:40.699> create<00:00:40.970> a<00:00:41.030> keyframe<00:00:41.390> for<00:00:41.960> this<00:00:42.079> channel

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
to create a keyframe for this channel

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.560 
to create a keyframe for this channel
instead<00:00:43.460> of<00:00:43.640> grabbing<00:00:43.850> let's<00:00:44.269> say<00:00:44.420> the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
instead of grabbing let's say the

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.390 
instead of grabbing let's say the
transform<00:00:45.050> layer<00:00:45.199> tool<00:00:45.470> and<00:00:45.739> clicking<00:00:46.100> on<00:00:46.250> the

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
transform layer tool and clicking on the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.729 
transform layer tool and clicking on the
canvas<00:00:46.790> to<00:00:46.820> create<00:00:47.000> a<00:00:47.239> keyframe<00:00:47.600> I<00:00:48.019> could

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
canvas to create a keyframe I could

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.849 
canvas to create a keyframe I could
simply<00:00:49.040> now<00:00:49.190> come<00:00:49.460> down<00:00:49.489> here<00:00:49.909> to<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.210> channel

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
simply now come down here to the channel

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.420 
simply now come down here to the channel
double-click<00:00:51.859> to<00:00:52.629> create<00:00:53.629> a<00:00:53.660> keyframe<00:00:53.870> so

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
double-click to create a keyframe so

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.979 
double-click to create a keyframe so
that<00:00:55.430> really<00:00:55.699> simplifies<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.390> process<00:00:56.809> now

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
that really simplifies the process now

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.009 
that really simplifies the process now
when<00:00:57.350> it<00:00:57.469> comes<00:00:57.590> to<00:00:57.769> adding<00:00:58.190> keyframes<00:00:59.019> also

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
when it comes to adding keyframes also

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.500 
when it comes to adding keyframes also
this<00:01:00.230> works<00:01:00.469> in<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.890> motion<00:01:01.219> graph<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:02.090> if<00:01:02.390> I

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
this works in the motion graph so if I

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.620 
this works in the motion graph so if I
go<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.989> motion<00:01:03.320> graph<00:01:03.469> tab<00:01:03.769> and<00:01:04.360> I<00:01:05.360> am<00:01:05.479> in

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
go to the motion graph tab and I am in

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.380 
go to the motion graph tab and I am in
this<00:01:05.780> channel<00:01:06.170> currently<00:01:06.380> I<00:01:06.970> can<00:01:07.970> simply<00:01:08.270> come

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
this channel currently I can simply come

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.830 
this channel currently I can simply come
over<00:01:08.450> here<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:09.289> frame<00:01:09.740> 84<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.660> double<00:01:11.660> click

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
over here to frame 84 and double click

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.180 
over here to frame 84 and double click
and<00:01:12.100> I've<00:01:13.100> now<00:01:13.280> added<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.880> keyframe<00:01:14.360> for<00:01:14.810> every

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
and I've now added a keyframe for every

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.700 
and I've now added a keyframe for every
property<00:01:16.190> of<00:01:16.670> this<00:01:17.030> channel<00:01:17.380> so<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.530> works

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
property of this channel so that works

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.650 
property of this channel so that works
really<00:01:18.890> well<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.399> can<00:01:19.460> help<00:01:19.729> speed<00:01:20.060> up<00:01:20.090> your

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
really well and can help speed up your

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.219 
really well and can help speed up your
workflow<00:01:20.990> when<00:01:21.590> working<00:01:21.950> in<00:01:22.160> anime<00:01:22.520> studio

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
workflow when working in anime studio

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.069 
workflow when working in anime studio
now<00:01:24.229> let<00:01:24.380> me<00:01:24.470> come<00:01:24.590> back<00:01:24.770> here<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:25.250> my<00:01:25.400> channels

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
now let me come back here to my channels

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.560 
now let me come back here to my channels
next<00:01:27.079> is<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.590> ability<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:28.070> move<00:01:28.880> keyframes

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
next is the ability to move keyframes

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.410 
next is the ability to move keyframes
past<00:01:29.990> each<00:01:30.259> other<00:01:30.470> let's<00:01:31.430> say<00:01:31.490> for<00:01:31.820> instance<00:01:31.939> I

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
past each other let's say for instance I

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.520 
past each other let's say for instance I
highlight<00:01:32.930> these<00:01:33.409> three<00:01:33.770> frames<00:01:34.210> now<00:01:35.210> in<00:01:35.960> the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
highlight these three frames now in the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.160 
highlight these three frames now in the
past<00:01:36.799> and<00:01:37.220> past<00:01:37.460> versions<00:01:37.939> if<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.659> tried<00:01:39.049> to

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
past and past versions if I tried to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.170 
past and past versions if I tried to
move<00:01:39.350> these<00:01:39.530> ahead<00:01:40.009> of<00:01:40.280> let's<00:01:40.640> say<00:01:40.759> these<00:01:40.939> two

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
move these ahead of let's say these two

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.899 
move these ahead of let's say these two
keyframes<00:01:42.070> basically<00:01:43.070> what<00:01:43.220> would<00:01:43.310> happen<00:01:43.729> is

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
keyframes basically what would happen is

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.460 
keyframes basically what would happen is
you<00:01:44.210> would<00:01:44.240> run<00:01:44.659> into<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.960> problem<00:01:45.290> where

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
you would run into the problem where

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.410 
you would run into the problem where
they<00:01:46.009> would<00:01:46.189> collide<00:01:46.549> you<00:01:46.610> would<00:01:47.030> bump<00:01:47.270> into

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
they would collide you would bump into

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.300 
they would collide you would bump into
it<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:47.930> couldn't<00:01:48.170> go<00:01:48.380> past<00:01:48.409> that<00:01:48.920> certain

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
it and you couldn't go past that certain

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.539 
it and you couldn't go past that certain
point<00:01:49.610> well<00:01:50.479> now<00:01:50.719> as<00:01:50.990> you<00:01:51.079> can<00:01:51.229> see<00:01:51.439> I<00:01:51.649> can<00:01:52.369> move

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
point well now as you can see I can move

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.050 
point well now as you can see I can move
past<00:01:52.969> any<00:01:53.630> keyframe<00:01:54.530> I<00:01:54.649> want<00:01:54.890> now<00:01:55.729> those<00:01:55.880> can

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
past any keyframe I want now those can

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.609 
past any keyframe I want now those can
create<00:01:56.180> some<00:01:56.479> interesting<00:01:56.810> movements<00:01:57.439> for

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
create some interesting movements for

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.230 
create some interesting movements for
you<00:01:57.850> however<00:01:59.140> it<00:02:00.140> works<00:02:00.350> as<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:00.860> should<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.310> I

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
you however it works as it should and I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.029 
you however it works as it should and I
think<00:02:02.659> that<00:02:02.750> as<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.899> new<00:02:03.079> feature<00:02:03.289> you<00:02:03.710> will

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
think that as a new feature you will

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.130 
think that as a new feature you will
find<00:02:04.399> beneficial<00:02:05.560> when<00:02:06.560> in<00:02:06.799> graph<00:02:07.070> mode<00:02:07.369> now

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
find beneficial when in graph mode now

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.080 
find beneficial when in graph mode now
you<00:02:09.140> have<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.560> ability<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.190> scale<00:02:10.700> keys

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
you have the ability to scale keys

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.199 
you have the ability to scale keys
vertically<00:02:11.720> so<00:02:12.470> let's<00:02:12.650> say<00:02:12.829> at<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.220> point<00:02:13.549> in

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
vertically so let's say at this point in

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.990 
vertically so let's say at this point in
my<00:02:14.269> timeline<00:02:14.930> like<00:02:15.230> right<00:02:15.620> here<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.130> want<00:02:16.850> to

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
my timeline like right here I want to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.530 
my timeline like right here I want to
adjust<00:02:17.709> this<00:02:18.709> point<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.280> graph<00:02:19.459> I<00:02:19.850> could

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
adjust this point of the graph I could

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.509 
adjust this point of the graph I could
hold<00:02:20.780> down<00:02:20.959> my<00:02:20.989> left<00:02:21.109> mouse<00:02:21.320> button<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:22.130> as

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
hold down my left mouse button and as

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.580 
hold down my left mouse button and as
you<00:02:22.640> can<00:02:22.730> see<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.970> can<00:02:23.209> go<00:02:23.299> up<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.690> down<00:02:24.049> now<00:02:24.350> as

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
you can see I can go up and down now as

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.940 
you can see I can go up and down now as
well<00:02:25.220> as<00:02:25.489> left<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.329> right<00:02:26.530> but<00:02:27.530> of<00:02:27.709> course

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
well as left and right but of course

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.220 
well as left and right but of course
this<00:02:28.190> gives<00:02:28.340> us<00:02:28.550> much<00:02:28.819> more<00:02:28.849> flexibility<00:02:29.690> when

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
this gives us much more flexibility when

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.690 
this gives us much more flexibility when
working<00:02:30.470> in<00:02:30.709> graph<00:02:30.890> mode<00:02:31.129> and<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.370> can<00:02:31.519> see<00:02:31.670> I

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
working in graph mode and you can see I

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.860 
working in graph mode and you can see I
can<00:02:31.910> alter

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
can alter

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.539 
can alter
the<00:02:32.959> X<00:02:33.110> property<00:02:33.470> here<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.069> come<00:02:34.370> down<00:02:34.519> here

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
the X property here and come down here

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.050 
the X property here and come down here
and<00:02:34.849> alter<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.330> Y<00:02:35.450> property<00:02:35.989> and<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:36.650> on<00:02:37.060> okay

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
and alter the Y property and so on okay

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.059 
and alter the Y property and so on okay
now<00:02:38.330> let<00:02:38.690> me<00:02:38.780> bounce<00:02:38.989> back<00:02:39.290> here<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.769> the

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
now let me bounce back here to the

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.860 
now let me bounce back here to the
channels<00:02:41.440> tab<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:43.120> I'm<00:02:44.120> just<00:02:44.269> gonna<00:02:44.360> add<00:02:44.629> a

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
channels tab and I'm just gonna add a

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.410 
channels tab and I'm just gonna add a
couple<00:02:45.080> more<00:02:45.200> channels<00:02:45.860> here<00:02:46.159> so<00:02:46.459> I'll<00:02:47.269> come

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
couple more channels here so I'll come

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.110 
couple more channels here so I'll come
over<00:02:47.480> here<00:02:47.629> to<00:02:47.780> frame<00:02:48.110> 12<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.790> I'll<00:02:49.790> just

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
over here to frame 12 and I'll just

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.839 
over here to frame 12 and I'll just
expand<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.220> rotate<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.310> slightly<00:02:52.430> so<00:02:52.819> I

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
expand this and rotate it slightly so I

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.110 
expand this and rotate it slightly so I
have<00:02:53.060> some<00:02:53.360> channels<00:02:54.079> pop<00:02:54.290> in<00:02:54.470> here<00:02:54.709> for<00:02:55.129> this

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
have some channels pop in here for this

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.600 
have some channels pop in here for this
example<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:56.989> I<00:02:57.019> can<00:02:57.200> do<00:02:57.379> the<00:02:57.860> camera<00:02:58.280> here<00:02:58.489> as

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
example and I can do the camera here as

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.449 
example and I can do the camera here as
well<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.360> I'll<00:02:59.840> pop<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.260> frame<00:03:00.500> one<00:03:00.709> at<00:03:01.040> a

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
well so I'll pop to frame one at a

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.449 
well so I'll pop to frame one at a
camera<00:03:01.819> keyframe<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:02.599> on<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.470> okay<00:03:04.159> now

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
camera keyframe and so on so okay now

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.809 
camera keyframe and so on so okay now
you<00:03:05.299> are<00:03:05.859> working<00:03:06.859> on<00:03:06.950> your<00:03:07.099> animation<00:03:07.579> and

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
you are working on your animation and

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.449 
you are working on your animation and
you<00:03:07.940> want<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.480> add<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:09.140> keyframe<00:03:09.470> for<00:03:09.829> all<00:03:10.220> the

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
you want to add a keyframe for all the

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.130 
you want to add a keyframe for all the
channels<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:11.510> know<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.750> double<00:03:11.989> click

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
channels you know the double click

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.319 
channels you know the double click
method<00:03:12.319> now<00:03:12.650> but<00:03:13.190> that<00:03:13.310> only<00:03:13.489> adds<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.940> keyframe

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
method now but that only adds a keyframe

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.680 
method now but that only adds a keyframe
for<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.959> certain<00:03:15.379> channel<00:03:16.060> but<00:03:17.060> now<00:03:17.209> if<00:03:17.569> you

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
for that certain channel but now if you

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.770 
for that certain channel but now if you
go<00:03:17.810> up<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:18.190> animation<00:03:19.190> add<00:03:20.650> keyframe<00:03:22.780> this

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
go up to animation add keyframe this

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.809 
go up to animation add keyframe this
will<00:03:23.930> now<00:03:24.079> add<00:03:24.319> a<00:03:24.349> keyframe<00:03:24.769> for<00:03:25.069> all<00:03:25.489> current

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
will now add a keyframe for all current

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.710 
will now add a keyframe for all current
channels<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:28.459> can<00:03:28.609> see<00:03:28.819> it<00:03:29.030> even<00:03:29.299> added<00:03:29.599> a

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
channels you can see it even added a

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.680 
channels you can see it even added a
keyframe<00:03:30.200> now<00:03:30.230> for<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:31.510> point<00:03:32.510> motion

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
keyframe now for the point motion

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.520 
keyframe now for the point motion
portion<00:03:33.440> of<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:34.250> animation<00:03:35.209> so<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:35.930> now<00:03:36.500> have

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
portion of the animation so you now have

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.280 
portion of the animation so you now have
keyframes<00:03:37.370> for<00:03:37.489> all<00:03:37.849> those<00:03:38.180> points<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:38.959> that

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
keyframes for all those points and that

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.020 
keyframes for all those points and that
allows<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.709> lock<00:03:40.069> in<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.430> animation<00:03:40.910> at

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
allows you to lock in the animation at

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.960 
allows you to lock in the animation at
that<00:03:41.150> certain<00:03:41.480> point<00:03:41.720> for<00:03:42.380> all<00:03:42.709> instances<00:03:43.459> of

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
that certain point for all instances of

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.900 
that certain point for all instances of
your<00:03:44.540> animation<00:03:45.230> channels<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.730> that's

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
your animation channels so that's

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.050 
your animation channels so that's
another<00:03:47.540> useful<00:03:47.810> feature<00:03:48.200> for<00:03:48.970> working<00:03:49.970> on

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
another useful feature for working on

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.050 
another useful feature for working on
the<00:03:50.180> timeline<00:03:50.950> another<00:03:51.950> new<00:03:52.129> feature<00:03:52.310> is<00:03:52.669> the

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
the timeline another new feature is the

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.690 
the timeline another new feature is the
ability<00:03:53.239> to<00:03:53.690> edit<00:03:54.230> multiple<00:03:54.980> keyframes<00:03:55.250> at

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
ability to edit multiple keyframes at

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.080 
ability to edit multiple keyframes at
once<00:03:56.109> so<00:03:57.109> just<00:03:57.500> as<00:03:58.220> an<00:03:58.310> example<00:03:58.400> here<00:03:58.970> I'm<00:03:59.030> just

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
once so just as an example here I'm just

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.509 
once so just as an example here I'm just
gonna<00:03:59.209> get<00:04:00.079> rid<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.319> all<00:04:00.440> this<00:04:00.680> stuff<00:04:01.160> right

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
gonna get rid of all this stuff right

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
transform layer tool you can see I have

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.180 
transform layer tool you can see I have
a<00:04:07.280> path<00:04:07.579> now<00:04:07.910> it's<00:04:08.449> just<00:04:08.840> an<00:04:09.260> example<00:04:10.069> I

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.289 
a path now it's just an example I
created<00:04:11.079> but<00:04:12.129> when<00:04:13.129> I<00:04:13.160> page<00:04:13.819> through<00:04:14.060> here<00:04:14.209> you

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
created but when I page through here you

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.970 
created but when I page through here you
can<00:04:14.359> see<00:04:14.569> I<00:04:14.599> have<00:04:14.840> some<00:04:15.049> movement<00:04:15.470> going<00:04:15.769> on

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
can see I have some movement going on

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.229 
can see I have some movement going on
now<00:04:16.699> let's<00:04:16.940> say<00:04:17.090> for<00:04:17.150> whatever<00:04:17.510> reason<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:19.239> made

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
now let's say for whatever reason I made

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.270 
now let's say for whatever reason I made
this<00:04:20.359> animation<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:21.260> I<00:04:21.410> realize<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:21.829> made<00:04:22.250> a

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
this animation and I realize I made a

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.900 
this animation and I realize I made a
mistake

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
mistake

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.689 
mistake
that<00:04:23.419> I<00:04:23.449> want<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.620> animation<00:04:24.979> to<00:04:25.190> take<00:04:25.430> place

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
that I want the animation to take place

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.719 
that I want the animation to take place
over<00:04:26.330> here<00:04:26.599> on<00:04:26.750> this<00:04:27.500> portion<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:28.010> my<00:04:28.039> screen<00:04:28.190> I

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
over here on this portion of my screen I

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.279 
over here on this portion of my screen I
want<00:04:28.970> all<00:04:29.150> this<00:04:29.449> movement<00:04:29.690> to<00:04:29.930> take<00:04:30.080> place

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
want all this movement to take place

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.770 
want all this movement to take place
over<00:04:30.530> here<00:04:30.949> well<00:04:31.789> in<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.090> past<00:04:32.300> you<00:04:32.599> know<00:04:32.720> you

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
over here well in the past you know you

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.890 
over here well in the past you know you
had<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.520> essentially<00:04:34.520> move<00:04:35.030> every<00:04:35.389> keyframe

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
had to essentially move every keyframe

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.420 
had to essentially move every keyframe
individually<00:04:36.560> you<00:04:36.800> would<00:04:36.919> have<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.099> move<00:04:37.250> this

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
individually you would have to move this

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.080 
individually you would have to move this
one<00:04:37.699> then<00:04:38.419> page<00:04:38.720> over<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.099> frame<00:04:40.099> 12<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.789> then

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
one then page over to frame 12 and then

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.899 
one then page over to frame 12 and then
move<00:04:41.539> that<00:04:41.960> one<00:04:42.229> and<00:04:42.520> just<00:04:43.520> kind<00:04:43.700> of<00:04:43.729> keep

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:43.909 
move that one and just kind of keep

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.570 
move that one and just kind of keep
piecing<00:04:44.419> the<00:04:45.080> animation<00:04:45.620> together

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
piecing the animation together

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.760 
piecing the animation together
where<00:04:46.729> you<00:04:46.970> wanted<00:04:47.449> it<00:04:47.569> to<00:04:47.599> go<00:04:47.720> and<00:04:48.409> this<00:04:48.590> could

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
where you wanted it to go and this could

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.480 
where you wanted it to go and this could
be<00:04:48.800> very<00:04:49.220> tedious<00:04:50.050> however<00:04:51.050> now<00:04:51.289> if<00:04:51.800> you<00:04:52.250> come

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
be very tedious however now if you come

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.700 
be very tedious however now if you come
down<00:04:52.639> here<00:04:52.849> to<00:04:52.909> your<00:04:53.120> timeline<00:04:53.629> and<00:04:53.810> highlight

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
down here to your timeline and highlight

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.499 
down here to your timeline and highlight
all<00:04:54.919> of<00:04:54.979> the<00:04:55.550> keyframes<00:04:56.030> and<00:04:57.490> then<00:04:58.490> move<00:04:59.360> the

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
all of the keyframes and then move the

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.779 
all of the keyframes and then move the
animation<00:05:00.080> or<00:05:00.289> that<00:05:00.710> particular<00:05:01.099> keyframe

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
animation or that particular keyframe

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.850 
animation or that particular keyframe
where<00:05:01.969> you<00:05:02.060> want<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.419> so<00:05:02.659> I<00:05:02.870> can<00:05:03.500> move<00:05:03.560> it<00:05:03.710> like

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
where you want it so I can move it like

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.240 
where you want it so I can move it like
over<00:05:04.310> here<00:05:04.639> and<00:05:04.849> release<00:05:05.389> you<00:05:06.229> can<00:05:06.379> see<00:05:06.620> now<00:05:06.800> it

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
over here and release you can see now it

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.740 
over here and release you can see now it
moves<00:05:07.639> that<00:05:07.939> entire<00:05:08.439> animation<00:05:10.599> where<00:05:11.599> you

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
moves that entire animation where you

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.809 
moves that entire animation where you
want<00:05:11.960> it<00:05:12.050> to<00:05:12.169> go<00:05:12.319> because<00:05:13.039> you<00:05:13.159> have<00:05:13.370> all<00:05:13.610> those

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:13.819 
want it to go because you have all those

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.409 
want it to go because you have all those
keyframes<00:05:14.120> selected<00:05:14.960> now<00:05:15.889> this<00:05:16.129> works<00:05:16.460> too

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
keyframes selected now this works too

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.680 
keyframes selected now this works too
for<00:05:17.840> instance<00:05:17.870> if<00:05:18.379> I<00:05:18.500> only<00:05:18.680> selected<00:05:19.690> like

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
for instance if I only selected like

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.649 
for instance if I only selected like
let's<00:05:20.900> say<00:05:21.020> for<00:05:21.259> instance<00:05:21.289> I<00:05:22.389> select<00:05:23.389> these

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
let's say for instance I select these

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.399 
let's say for instance I select these
three<00:05:24.020> keyframes<00:05:24.530> and<00:05:24.800> then<00:05:24.860> I<00:05:25.849> move<00:05:26.060> them<00:05:26.409> you

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
three keyframes and then I move them you

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.379 
three keyframes and then I move them you
can<00:05:27.560> see<00:05:27.770> now<00:05:27.949> it<00:05:28.219> alters<00:05:28.669> the<00:05:28.789> paths<00:05:29.000> but

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
can see now it alters the paths but

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.659 
can see now it alters the paths but
those<00:05:29.629> three<00:05:30.020> keyframes<00:05:30.650> have<00:05:31.190> now<00:05:31.400> been

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
those three keyframes have now been

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.089 
those three keyframes have now been
moved<00:05:31.940> according<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.780> the<00:05:33.560> animation<00:05:34.069> that

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
moved according to the animation that

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.790 
moved according to the animation that
has<00:05:34.340> taken<00:05:34.490> place<00:05:34.669> up<00:05:35.090> to<00:05:35.360> that<00:05:35.509> point<00:05:35.810> so<00:05:36.770> that

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
has taken place up to that point so that

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.570 
has taken place up to that point so that
can<00:05:37.099> be<00:05:37.219> very<00:05:37.460> useful<00:05:37.909> and<00:05:38.229> a<00:05:39.229> time-saver<00:05:39.889> when

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
can be very useful and a time-saver when

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.180 
can be very useful and a time-saver when
working<00:05:40.789> on<00:05:41.000> your<00:05:41.240> animations<00:05:41.870> and<00:05:42.229> this

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
working on your animations and this

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.269 
working on your animations and this
works<00:05:43.460> for<00:05:43.729> point<00:05:44.419> movement<00:05:44.900> as<00:05:45.050> well<00:05:45.439> to

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:46.279 
works for point movement as well to

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.249 
works for point movement as well to
demonstrate<00:05:46.729> this<00:05:46.879> further<00:05:47.150> I<00:05:47.300> have<00:05:47.719> created

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
demonstrate this further I have created

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.040 
demonstrate this further I have created
another<00:05:48.800> example<00:05:49.460> here<00:05:50.210> I<00:05:50.240> have<00:05:50.419> an<00:05:50.870> object

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
another example here I have an object

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.939 
another example here I have an object
that<00:05:51.469> is<00:05:52.479> edited<00:05:53.479> only<00:05:53.659> by<00:05:53.930> points<00:05:54.529> and<00:05:54.770> you

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
that is edited only by points and you

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:56.860 
that is edited only by points and you
can<00:05:55.099> see<00:05:55.279> that<00:05:55.460> on<00:05:55.610> my<00:05:55.879> timeline<00:05:56.419> through<00:05:56.779> the

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
can see that on my timeline through the

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.869 
can see that on my timeline through the
channels<00:05:57.259> and<00:05:57.529> what<00:05:58.159> I<00:05:58.190> did<00:05:58.400> here<00:05:58.669> with<00:05:58.849> the

00:05:58.869 --> 00:05:58.879 
channels and what I did here with the

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.749 
channels and what I did here with the
points<00:05:59.479> is<00:05:59.659> as<00:06:00.229> I<00:06:00.319> came<00:06:00.379> in<00:06:00.770> and<00:06:01.310> I<00:06:01.430> just<00:06:01.460> did

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 
points is as I came in and I just did

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.730 
points is as I came in and I just did
this<00:06:01.909> quick<00:06:02.300> animation<00:06:02.569> word<00:06:03.050> stretches<00:06:03.589> back

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
this quick animation word stretches back

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.550 
this quick animation word stretches back
and<00:06:03.979> forth<00:06:04.190> so<00:06:05.060> let's<00:06:05.449> say<00:06:05.659> for<00:06:06.409> whatever

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
and forth so let's say for whatever

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.219 
and forth so let's say for whatever
reason<00:06:07.039> I<00:06:07.240> finished<00:06:08.240> this<00:06:08.449> and<00:06:08.750> I'm<00:06:08.900> like<00:06:09.080> oh

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 
reason I finished this and I'm like oh

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.189 
reason I finished this and I'm like oh
well<00:06:09.589> I<00:06:09.620> want<00:06:10.069> to<00:06:10.479> alter<00:06:11.479> my<00:06:11.599> points<00:06:12.050> I

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 
well I want to alter my points I

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.559 
well I want to alter my points I
actually<00:06:12.560> don't<00:06:12.860> want<00:06:12.979> this<00:06:13.219> shape<00:06:13.490> so<00:06:13.789> I'm<00:06:14.419> on

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:14.569 
actually don't want this shape so I'm on

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:17.170 
actually don't want this shape so I'm on
frame<00:06:14.839> 1<00:06:15.080> and<00:06:15.319> I<00:06:15.770> can<00:06:15.800> come<00:06:16.069> in<00:06:16.190> here<00:06:16.490> and<00:06:16.639> I<00:06:16.909> can

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
frame 1 and I can come in here and I can

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.260 
frame 1 and I can come in here and I can
adjust<00:06:17.389> the<00:06:17.779> shape<00:06:18.020> however<00:06:18.379> I<00:06:19.240> see<00:06:20.240> fit

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
adjust the shape however I see fit

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.140 
adjust the shape however I see fit
however<00:06:20.779> I<00:06:20.990> want<00:06:21.319> it<00:06:21.500> I<00:06:21.680> come<00:06:22.669> in<00:06:22.789> here<00:06:22.969> and<00:06:23.060> I

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
however I want it I come in here and I

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.990 
however I want it I come in here and I
can<00:06:23.330> just<00:06:23.620> create<00:06:24.620> a<00:06:24.919> different<00:06:25.819> looking

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
can just create a different looking

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.860 
can just create a different looking
shape<00:06:27.099> like<00:06:28.099> so<00:06:28.370> so<00:06:29.180> I<00:06:29.210> this<00:06:29.300> is<00:06:29.479> the<00:06:29.569> shape<00:06:29.750> I

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
shape like so so I this is the shape I

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.839 
shape like so so I this is the shape I
wanted<00:06:30.460> but<00:06:31.460> of<00:06:31.759> course<00:06:32.029> as<00:06:32.360> it<00:06:33.050> pages<00:06:33.379> through

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
wanted but of course as it pages through

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:36.939 
wanted but of course as it pages through
since<00:06:34.849> we<00:06:35.029> already<00:06:35.240> created<00:06:35.569> keyframes<00:06:36.440> for

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:36.949 
since we already created keyframes for

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:40.839 
since we already created keyframes for
this<00:06:37.310> particular<00:06:39.190> animation<00:06:40.190> with<00:06:40.819> the

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849 
this particular animation with the

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:42.790 
this particular animation with the
points<00:06:41.330> you<00:06:41.659> can<00:06:41.839> see<00:06:42.020> now<00:06:42.169> that<00:06:42.199> it<00:06:42.469> morphs

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
points you can see now that it morphs

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.450 
points you can see now that it morphs
back<00:06:43.270> when<00:06:44.270> we<00:06:44.389> hit<00:06:44.539> the<00:06:44.690> second<00:06:45.020> keyframe<00:06:45.460> so

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
back when we hit the second keyframe so

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.909 
back when we hit the second keyframe so
by<00:06:47.060> page<00:06:47.300> back<00:06:47.539> here<00:06:47.870> and<00:06:47.960> just<00:06:48.620> get<00:06:48.740> rid<00:06:48.830> of

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 
by page back here and just get rid of

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:52.180 
by page back here and just get rid of
this<00:06:49.069> what<00:06:50.029> I<00:06:50.089> can<00:06:50.270> do<00:06:50.479> now<00:06:50.949> using<00:06:51.949> the<00:06:52.039> same

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
this what I can do now using the same

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.129 
this what I can do now using the same
method<00:06:52.520> I<00:06:52.580> showed<00:06:52.819> you<00:06:53.000> with<00:06:53.180> moving<00:06:53.719> a<00:06:53.870> bunch

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139 
method I showed you with moving a bunch

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.409 
method I showed you with moving a bunch
of<00:06:54.229> keyframes<00:06:54.649> I<00:06:54.889> can<00:06:55.669> highlight<00:06:56.029> all<00:06:56.300> these

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:56.419 
of keyframes I can highlight all these

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:00.650 
of keyframes I can highlight all these
keyframes<00:06:57.339> and<00:06:58.339> now<00:06:58.819> come<00:06:59.569> in<00:06:59.690> here

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
keyframes and now come in here

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.130 
keyframes and now come in here
with<00:07:01.080> my<00:07:01.550> translate<00:07:02.550> point<00:07:02.820> tool<00:07:03.030> and<00:07:03.330> create

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.140 
with my translate point tool and create

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:13.910 
with my translate point tool and create
the<00:07:05.100> shape<00:07:05.340> I<00:07:05.460> want<00:07:11.660> and<00:07:12.660> so<00:07:13.080> now<00:07:13.260> when<00:07:13.560> I<00:07:13.590> page

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:13.920 
the shape I want and so now when I page

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.570 
the shape I want and so now when I page
through<00:07:14.720> you<00:07:15.720> can<00:07:15.870> see<00:07:16.140> that<00:07:16.830> those<00:07:17.040> points

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
through you can see that those points

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.350 
through you can see that those points
retained<00:07:18.390> their<00:07:19.140> shape<00:07:20.120> while<00:07:21.120> at<00:07:21.210> the<00:07:21.330> same

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 
retained their shape while at the same

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.180 
retained their shape while at the same
time<00:07:21.780> they're<00:07:22.260> going<00:07:22.290> through<00:07:22.800> and<00:07:23.040> being

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.190 
time they're going through and being

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.900 
time they're going through and being
resized<00:07:23.640> and<00:07:24.060> so<00:07:24.510> on<00:07:24.720> so<00:07:25.560> again<00:07:25.860> this<00:07:26.550> can

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:26.910 
resized and so on so again this can

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.580 
resized and so on so again this can
really<00:07:27.210> help<00:07:27.450> you<00:07:27.690> speed<00:07:28.170> up<00:07:28.200> your<00:07:28.380> workflow
