00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
plant I have him in here for here the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.519 
plant I have him in here for here the
point<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.330> here<00:00:27.599> takes<00:00:27.930> up<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.320> whole

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.320 
point I have in here takes up the whole
enclosure<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.279> he's<00:00:29.400> got<00:00:29.519> plenty<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.880> hiding

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
enclosure so he's got plenty of hiding

the<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.529> plant<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.070> kind<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.550> rough<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.270> if

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the the plant is kind of rough so if

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.240 
the the plant is kind of rough so if
he's<00:00:33.780> shedding<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.469> come<00:00:34.649> right<00:00:34.829> off<00:00:34.860> I

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
he's shedding it can come right off I

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.520 
he's shedding it can come right off I

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.280 
tell you that the one thing I personally
recommend<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.720> little<00:01:33.960> better

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
recommend that you do a little better

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.810 
recommend that you do a little better
than<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.650> did<00:01:34.890> which<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.340> am<00:01:35.400> starting<00:01:35.700> to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
than I did which I am starting to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.420 
than I did which I am starting to
realize<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.270> now<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:37.170> my<00:01:37.470> rooms<00:01:37.829> humidity<00:01:38.400> I

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
realize this now as my rooms humidity I

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.760 
realize this now as my rooms humidity I
believe<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.090> must<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.630> pretty<00:01:39.840> high<00:01:40.020> there

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
believe is must be pretty high there

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.130 
believe is must be pretty high there
it's<00:01:41.009> very<00:01:41.130> hard<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.759> me<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.140> regulate

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
it's very hard for me to regulate

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.020 
it's very hard for me to regulate
humidity<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.250> enclosure<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:44.790> well<00:01:44.939> as

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
humidity in this enclosure as well as

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.340 
humidity in this enclosure as well as
you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.210> see<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> good<00:01:45.899> amount<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.229> air

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
you can see I have a good amount of air

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.870 
you can see I have a good amount of air
holes<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.920> actually<00:01:47.100> nearly<00:01:47.520> isn't

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
holes but this actually nearly isn't

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.550 
holes but this actually nearly isn't
enough<00:01:48.149> I'm<00:01:48.540> actually<00:01:48.840> looking<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.290> purchase

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
enough I'm actually looking to purchase

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.080 
enough I'm actually looking to purchase
these<00:01:49.950> things<00:01:50.009> where<00:01:50.520> they're<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.880> cut<00:01:51.060> a

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
these things where they're you cut a

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.690 
these things where they're you cut a
hole<00:01:51.180> right<00:01:51.509> there<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.740> put<00:01:53.009> screen<00:01:53.399> it's

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
hole right there and you put screen it's

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.300 
hole right there and you put screen it's
like<00:01:53.850> little<00:01:54.060> screen<00:01:54.450> circles<00:01:54.990> mesh<00:01:55.710> things

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
like little screen circles mesh things

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.190 
like little screen circles mesh things
and<00:01:56.640> basically<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:57.899> help

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and basically it's going to really help

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.190 
and basically it's going to really help
let<00:01:59.070> air<00:01:59.310> flow<00:01:59.759> because<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.630> having<00:02:00.659> enough

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
let air flow because not having enough

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.289 
let air flow because not having enough
humidity<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.189> as<00:02:02.310> bad<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.790> having<00:02:03.119> too

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
humidity is just as bad as having too

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.690 
humidity is just as bad as having too
much<00:02:03.450> humidity<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.619> again<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> really

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
much humidity so again this is a really

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.069 
much humidity so again this is a really
good<00:02:05.939> way<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.119> set<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.540> like<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.840> said<00:02:07.049> a

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
good way to set it up like I said a

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.869 
good way to set it up like I said a
plant<00:02:07.409> taking<00:02:07.680> up<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.129> good<00:02:08.399> amount<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
plant taking up a good amount of the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.320 
plant taking up a good amount of the
enclosure<00:02:09.179> from<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.479> hide<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.869> food<00:02:10.110> dishes
