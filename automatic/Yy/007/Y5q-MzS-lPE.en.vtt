00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.620
 Hello again, everyone! 

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.400
 Last time, I gave you a challenge-- 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.640
 a challenge to write a series of numbers 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.420
 with numbers from 0 to 1, 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.000
 so that the first two numbers 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.560
 stand in different halves, 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.200
 and the first three numbers 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.900
 are then in different third parties, 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.600
 and the first four numbers 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.800
 stand in different quarters, and so on. 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.440
 I brought it as a puzzle, 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.340
 in which you build houses on a strip of land, 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.580
 so that every time a new person is added, 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.680
 you have to divide the land again, 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.220
 so that everyone gets a piece 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.000
 that is the same length. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.640
 And I asked you how many houses 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.940
 can you build? 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.480
 Can you do this indefinitely, 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.740
 or is there some sort of limit? 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.580
 If you haven't tried this yet, 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.600
 please do that! 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.600
 You can do it with pen and paper, 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.240
 or if you have not seen this yet, 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.700
 we made it into a computer game. 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.500
 There is a link to this in the description. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 It's just a sort of point and click 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.760
 and you build your houses gradually. 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.540
 Try it now, 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.600
 if you haven't done that yet, 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.060
 because I'm going to give you the solution. 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.280
 You see, 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.240
 you cannot do this infinitely. 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.200
 There is a limit to how many houses you can build. 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.900
 And that limit 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.500
 is 17. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700
 That is very strange! 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.280
 17 houses! 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.300
 So to begin with, it is strange that you cannot do this infinitely. 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.300
 That is not obvious. 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.680
 There is a limit. 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.140
 But the limit is 17. 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.380
 Why 17? Why not 18 or something else? 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.660
 Well, I'm going to show you a solution, 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.400
 with 17 houses on it, 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.580
 I will do that later, 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.780
 But first, 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.160
 I want to show you a proof-- 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.440
 proof that it is not 18 houses. 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.080
 To do that, 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.800
 must we 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.320
 consider a number of steps 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.740
 in which the land is divided into pieces of different sizes. 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.940
 I'm going to start dividing the land 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.520
 in 9 equally large pieces, 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.200
 and then I take 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.160
 the tenth and the eleventh and the twelfth, and so on in consideration. 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.280
 And first I consider 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.580
 the point that occupies the fifth piece 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.260
 after dividing by 9. 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.880
 We call that 'x'. 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.840
 So x is somewhere between 4/9 and 5/9. 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.760
 But let's say x equals 0.46. 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.100
 But if x is 0.46, 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.320
 then I know that 0.46 is in the fifth piece 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.240
 after dividing by 10. 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.720
 And it is also in the sixth piece 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.200
 after dividing by 11. 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.740
 And in the sixth piece after dividing by 12. 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.040
 That is all automatic. 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.720
 Let us now consider the point 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.780
 that is in the fourth piece 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.360
 after dividing by 9. 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.300
 Let's call that "y," and we'll try to determine 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.500
 what is the value of y. 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.460
 Well, y may be in the fourth or fifth piece 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.940
 after dividing by 10. 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.620
 But it cannot be in the fifth piece 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.120
 because that belongs to x, 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.060
 So y must be in the fourth piece. 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.280
 That means that y must be less than 4/10, or 0.4. 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.700
 Looking at division by 11, 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.960
 y cross a border again, 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.400
 so it can be in the fourth piece, 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.980
 or in the fifth piece. 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.100
 If y is in the fourth piece, 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.440
 means that the fifth piece is empty. 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.660
 That's OK. That just means the blank piece 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.020
 must be occupied by the eleventh point. 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.360
 But that is a problem if you look at division by 12, 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.160
 for the eleventh point 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.040
 must then share a piece with either x or y, 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.720
 and that is not allowed. 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.860
 So y cannot be in the fourth piece after dividing by 11. 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.000
 it must be in the fifth piece after dividing by 11. 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.080
 and that means we have determined 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
 that y must be between 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.580
 4/11 and 4/10. 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.740
 In other words, y is between 0.364 and 0.4. 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.880
 Now let's add a new point. 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.580
 We call that z, and it is in the fourth piece 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.160
 after dividing by 12. 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.240
 And we now go through the same process 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.460
 taking into account what happens after dividing by 13, 14 and 15. 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.880
 and we will discover that y is in the sixth piece 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.940
 after dividing by 15, and z is in the fifth piece 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.580
 after dividing by 15. 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.100
 Going further again we now see that y 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.580
 in the seventh piece, after dividing by 16, 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.240
 and z will be in the fifth piece. But that means that the sixth piece will be empty. 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.500
 So that must be filled by the 16th point. 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.400
 Now consider the following division. 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.220
 So y would be in the seventh piece, 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.220
 after dividing by 17, 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.360
 and z will occupy the fifth piece, 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.060
 and the new point is in the sixth piece. 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.760
 But as before, this is a problem, 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.360
 This means the 16th point 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.560
 share a piece 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.180
 with either z or y, 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.420
 if we divide by 18, 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.420
 and that should not happen. 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.600
 So we have discovered that we have failed 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.020
 when dividing by 18. 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.300
 But this all worked great 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.300
 to divide by 17. 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.620
 This is what happens if I choose to set x to 0.46. 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.980
 But what if I had chosen a different location? 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.820
 Well, the full proof shows 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.180
 that you always get stuck 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.700
 for any value of x. 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.420
 And remember that x was defined as the point 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.660
 in the fifth piece 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.180
 after dividing by 9. 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.560
 In fact, I chose this value for x because 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.240
 we then could go as far as dividing by 17. 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.020
 Other values ​​for x 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.140
 in fact, fail much sooner. 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.200
 So the evidence shows that it fails to divide by 18. 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.100
 So a series of 18 points does not exist. 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.080
 That is impossible. 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.820
 But the same method can also be applied to 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.520
 constructing solutions, including solving 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.320
 up to and including 17 points. 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.720
 For example, here is one solution that includes the sixth point 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.120
 0.46 is-- 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.860
 that was x in my proof. 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.900
 And z and y are exactly where I predicted they would be. 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.680
 The thing to remember is 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.200
 it is not just the values ​​of the solution that are important, 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.880
 but also the order. 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.980
 For example, we cannot simply divide the line into, say, 100 equal pieces, 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.980
 and then put a point in each piece. 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.500
 No-- the first two points must be in two different halves. 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.300
 The first three points must be in different thirds, and so on. 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.840
 And it is this limitation that gives us this limit. 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.080
 The problem is related to the Farey series of order 18. 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.820
 That is the ordered series of all fractions 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.180
 with denominators smaller than or equal to 18 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.800
 And the problem actually becomes 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.160
 "The Irregularity of Distributions," or "The 18 Point Problem." called. 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.020
 This proof actually dates back to the 1960s. 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.740
 However, it is very functional. 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.680
 It indeed shows that you have none 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.060
 Can construct 18th point, 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.420
 and that you can construct a 17th point. 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.700
 So there are solutions with 17. 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.260
 But at a deeper level, 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.480
 it doesn't really tell you why 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.720
 it is that number. 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.120
 And if you think so, 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.000
 I agree with you. 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.260
 It is very strange; 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.540
 it's very strange. 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.600
 I think this is not a well-known fact, 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.740
 that's why I wanted to share it with you. 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.640
 Finally, I would like to thank Christian Perfect 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.840
 for making the game for our use. 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.280
 And, well - if you did that 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.500
 thanks for looking!
