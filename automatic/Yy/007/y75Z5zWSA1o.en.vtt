I'm going to show you how quickly it is

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.330 
I'm going to show you how quickly it is
to<00:00:14.389> fold<00:00:14.660> down<00:00:14.960> the<00:00:14.990> second<00:00:15.679> row<00:00:15.769> seat<00:00:16.099> and

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
to fold down the second row seat and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:33.980 
to fold down the second row seat and
store<00:00:16.670> it<00:00:16.759> underneath<00:00:17.000> the<00:00:17.119> baseboard

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.950 

three<00:00:34.680> parts<00:00:35.310> of<00:00:35.460> snow<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.850> go<00:00:35.910> feature<00:00:36.450> is

the<00:00:37.200> third<00:00:37.440> row<00:00:37.680> we<00:00:39.500> lowered<00:00:40.500> which<00:00:40.860> i<00:00:40.980> think

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the third row we lowered which i think

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:52.040 
the third row we lowered which i think
is<00:00:41.310> extremely<00:00:41.790> cool<00:00:42.270> about<00:00:42.510> this

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.150 

actually<00:00:53.050> it's<00:00:53.170> two<00:00:53.320> features<00:00:53.680> you<00:00:53.800> can<00:00:53.890> stew

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
actually it's two features you can stew

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.040 
actually it's two features you can stew
it<00:00:54.340> and<00:00:54.550> then<00:00:54.640> you<00:00:54.760> can<00:00:54.910> do<00:00:55.450> one<00:00:55.660> other<00:00:55.810> thing

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
it and then you can do one other thing

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.280 
it and then you can do one other thing
that<00:00:56.080> is<00:00:56.260> pretty<00:00:57.070> amazing<00:00:57.250> so<00:00:57.930> bottom<00:00:58.930> X<00:00:59.080> was

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
that is pretty amazing so bottom X was

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.020 
that is pretty amazing so bottom X was
down<00:00:59.500> you<00:00:59.650> can<00:00:59.770> also<00:00:59.890> just<00:01:00.130> do<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.430> left<00:01:00.670> or

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
down you can also just do the left or

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.700 
down you can also just do the left or
the<00:01:01.240> right<00:01:01.270> side<00:01:02.040> separately<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:04.480> then<00:01:04.809> you

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
the right side separately and then you

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.930 
the right side separately and then you
have<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:05.920> second<00:01:06.250> row<00:01:06.340> and<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.670> third<00:01:06.700> row

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
have the second row and the third row

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.810 
have the second row and the third row
completely<00:01:07.860> stored<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.160> it<00:01:09.490> gives<00:01:09.640> you

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
completely stored and it gives you

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.860 
completely stored and it gives you
access<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.360> this<00:01:11.700> large<00:01:12.700> amount<00:01:12.910> of<00:01:13.150> space<00:01:13.270> to

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
access to this large amount of space to

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.850 
access to this large amount of space to
carry<00:01:14.530> things<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:16.180> move<00:01:16.360> or<00:01:16.840> whatever<00:01:17.590> you

carry things to move or whatever you
needed<00:01:18.040> to<00:01:18.190> do<00:01:18.369> I<00:01:18.790> think<00:01:19.660> you<00:01:19.720> could<00:01:19.840> actually

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
needed to do I think you could actually

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.890 
needed to do I think you could actually
sleep<00:01:20.500> in<00:01:20.650> this<00:01:20.740> thing<00:01:20.800> so<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:22.030> other<00:01:22.210> second

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
sleep in this thing so the other second

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.170 
sleep in this thing so the other second
feature<00:01:23.050> to<00:01:23.320> this<00:01:23.440> is

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.020
