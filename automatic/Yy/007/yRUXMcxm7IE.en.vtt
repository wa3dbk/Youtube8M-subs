00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.920
 d 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.720
 hi how about this weather report 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.820
 from the national meteorological service 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.070
 and the weather functions for this 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.529
 day are the following 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.939
 we have an extreme front number 47 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.349
 which extends along the north and 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.550
 northeast of national return in the 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.320
 Interaction with moisture entry 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.520
 from the Pacific Ocean keeps 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.349
 a potential for snow fall 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.450
 mainly in states as it is 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.700
 chihuahua coahuila and areas 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.529
 mountainous state of Durango also 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.629
 in moving the system in 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.190
 interaction with a low pressure channel 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.720
 because it maintains the potential for 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.339
 presence of tornadoes tornados that 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.290
 they were accompanied by activity 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:43.260
 electrical and the potential for hail 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.089
 in entities from both the northeast and east and 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.219
 center of the national territory towards the 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.180
 south part the effect of surada on 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.219
 entities of the southeast 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.079
 this does not have warm temperatures in the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.870
 Yucatan Peninsula The southern part of 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.699
 country and some entities of the center of 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.750
 Mexican territory let's go with the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.650
 temperatures where we expect the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.570
 following conditions 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.730
 for the northwest part the minimum is 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.440
 rationing from 8 to 10 degrees 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.910
 celsius in mountainous portions by 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.920
 below 0 degrees celsius this 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.110
 due to the closeness of the frontal theme 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.490
 number 47 also the increase of 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.470
 cloudiness and the presence of rains 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.300
 important associated with this system 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.850
 frontal the maximum temperature will be 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.100
 reaching from 27 to 30 degrees 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.540
 celsius varying the region for this 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.240
 zone for the northeast part detector 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.580
 national we hope the following the 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.110
 minimum temperature from 12 to 19 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.600
 degrees this is the maximum could reach 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.670
 the 27 up to 30 degrees separating the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.530
 region there is increased cloudiness and 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.479
 as I mentioned the potential for 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.550
 some tornado accompanied by activities 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.550
 electric and hail for that region 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.510
 for the western central part the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.729
 conditions are thus kept the minimum 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.640
 13 to 19 degrees celsius maximum 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.260
 can reach 29 to 31 degrees is 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.090
 varying the region some very rain 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.750
 isolated for what is this region 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.300
 due to moisture entry 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.070
 from the Pacific Ocean 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.110
 to the southern part of the national territory 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.810
 the conditions are the following the 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.850
 minimum between 7 and 19 degrees Celsius in 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.860
 portion of the coast could reach 21 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.080
 up to 23 degrees is the maximum will be 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.660
 reaching in coast 35 degrees celsius and 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.400
 in a general way clear sky there is no 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.900
 potential for rainfall except for 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.820
 the zones from 0 to where a rain waits 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.940
 isolated accompanied by activity 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.940
 electric 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.540
 for the southeastern part of the entire area of 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.550
 the conditions are the following the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.980
 Minimum of 22 to 22 maximum centers 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.230
 can reach 30 to 34 degrees 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.390
 celsius on coast sky conditions 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.340
 cleared with cloudiness increase 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.590
 late-night and the presence some 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.150
 rain isolated mainly in the 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.190
 state of Chiapas the company of 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.200
 electrical activity for the peninsula of 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.570
 yucatán something very similar temperature 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.330
 maximum will reach 39 degrees celsius 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.520
 the minimum between 22 to 25 degrees 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.890
 celsius varying the region 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.150
 for the federal district the conditions 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.280
 are the following and this morning a 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.960
 minimum temperature reported of 14 the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.460
 maximum are reaching 26 degrees

 celsius sky conditions 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.910
 Partly cloudy with an increase of 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.560
 business towards evening-night some 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.080
 very isolated rain south of the 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.000
 federal district in the period of 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.010
 prognosis the minimum between 12 and 13 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.230
 degrees celsius the maximum could reach 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.030
 the 25 to 26 degrees celsius conditions 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.710
 of partly cloudy sky and also 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.750
 cloudiness increase if the 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.120
 late-night with low potential 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.010
 rains more thrown to what is the south 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.300
