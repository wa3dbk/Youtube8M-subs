close to the 3 seconds per lap next
season<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.920> really<00:01:02.250> 10<00:01:02.579> times<00:01:02.850> more

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.140 
season so it's really 10 times more
powerful<00:01:04.129> there<00:01:05.129> will<00:01:05.220> be<00:01:05.250> two<00:01:05.640> electrical

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
powerful there will be two electrical

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.960

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
mechanical meaning to the kid by not the

mechanical meaning to the kid by not the
engine<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.970> turbine<00:01:12.360> which<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.720> moved<00:01:12.990> by<00:01:13.290> the

engine the turbine which is moved by the
exhausts<00:01:14.550> of<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.060> engine<00:01:15.330> itself<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.960> what

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
exhausts of the engine itself so what

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.500 
exhausts of the engine itself so what
will<00:01:17.070> happen<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:17.880> use<00:01:18.120> all<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
will happen is that we use all the

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.110 
will happen is that we use all the
energy<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.260> the<00:01:19.440> exhausts<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> turbine

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
energy of the exhausts for the turbine

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.820

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.080 
well try to generate electrical powers

to a very firm motor which will charge
the<00:01:27.330> batteries<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.010> completely

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the batteries this is a completely

the batteries this is a completely
different<00:01:29.880> way<00:01:30.299> were<00:01:30.540> handling<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.350> engine

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
different way were handling the engine

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.460 
different way were handling the engine
because<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.150> recover<00:01:33.420> energy<00:01:33.900> if

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
because you have to recover energy if

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.800 
because you have to recover energy if
you<00:01:34.650> want<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.150> faster<00:01:36.150> there's<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.570> couple
