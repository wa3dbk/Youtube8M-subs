00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.200
 My friends on YouTube 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.160
 You know what I like most 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.200
 to laugh 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.980
 But it's not just laughter I like 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.720
 Also to be happy, to joke 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.580
 In short, to fret 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.900
 The song of laughter - for your judgment 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.780
 Remember? You have to choose the best song 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900
 Then vote and influence 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.680
 What fun to laugh 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.920
 Ready? 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.940
 You will not believe who's here 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.700
 Yes, that's me, Kofiko 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.460
 Now everyone is screaming with me 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.340
 Because for me to laugh is a law 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.080
 All day I jump 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.840
 So much like joking 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.500
 Every child standing in front of me 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.700
 want to be my friend 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.360
 Ha ha ha ha ha 

00:01:29.853 --> 00:01:36.953
 Ha ha ha ha ha 

00:01:48.853 --> 00:01:52.233
 Enjoying doing err 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.420
 And make all the kids laugh 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.000
 To friends I love to help 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.520
 And no one will stop me 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.940
 There is nothing that laughter does not cure 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.280
 I put Tamar some salt in the coffee 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.160
 She was salty but burst out laughing 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.680
 And as always she forgave me for everything 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.980
 Ha ha ha ha ha 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.500
 Ha ha ha ha ha 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.660
 Ha ha ha ha ha 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.240
 Ha ha ha ha ha
