00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.310 
what you might find on one of the yolks

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.070 
what you might find on one of the yolks
is<00:00:12.550> that<00:00:12.970> it's<00:00:13.120> angled<00:00:13.600> and<00:00:13.750> it's<00:00:13.900> not

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
is that it's angled and it's not

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.170 
is that it's angled and it's not
straight<00:00:14.500> so<00:00:14.770> the<00:00:14.890> socket<00:00:15.250> will<00:00:15.400> sit<00:00:15.790> on<00:00:15.820> a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
straight so the socket will sit on a

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.890 
straight so the socket will sit on a
salon<00:00:17.020> you<00:00:17.500> can<00:00:17.770> see<00:00:17.980> this<00:00:18.130> line<00:00:18.369> on<00:00:18.580> that<00:00:18.900> you

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
salon you can see this line on that you

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.660 
salon you can see this line on that you
could<00:00:20.080> grind<00:00:20.290> the<00:00:20.500> socket<00:00:20.830> out<00:00:20.980> or<00:00:21.250> just<00:00:21.279> be

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
could grind the socket out or just be

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.609 
could grind the socket out or just be
careful<00:00:22.210> when<00:00:22.450> you<00:00:22.570> fit<00:00:22.840> it<00:00:22.990> into<00:00:23.170> your<00:00:23.410> G

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619

cramp<00:00:24.010> that<00:00:24.250> it<00:00:24.790> doesn't<00:00:25.240> slip<00:00:26.039> positioning

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
cramp that it doesn't slip positioning

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.640 
cramp that it doesn't slip positioning
it<00:00:27.160> just<00:00:27.700> right<00:00:28.000> and<00:00:28.150> having<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.570> socket<00:00:29.050> sit

so<00:00:30.070> it's<00:00:30.250> not<00:00:30.520> going<00:00:30.670> to<00:00:30.760> slip<00:00:30.970> when<00:00:31.180> you<00:00:31.270> apply

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
so it's not going to slip when you apply

dirty and then put the end of the spider
in<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.750> then<00:01:54.590> we're<00:01:54.770> going<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:54.920> push<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.310> cap

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
in and then we're going to push the cap

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.789 
in and then we're going to push the cap
in<00:01:55.789> first<00:01:56.060> of<00:01:56.240> all<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.810> spiders<00:01:57.289> holding

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
in first of all so the spiders holding

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.780 
in first of all so the spiders holding
the<00:01:58.159> needle<00:01:58.310> roll<00:01:58.700> is<00:01:58.880> in<00:01:59.060> place

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.000 

all<00:02:03.480> right<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.780> initially<00:02:04.080> first<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.740> want<00:02:04.920> to

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
all right so initially first you want to

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.710 
all right so initially first you want to
be<00:02:05.100> setting<00:02:05.490> up<00:02:05.610> your<00:02:05.760> cap<00:02:05.970> so<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.300> can<00:02:06.510> push

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
be setting up your cap so you can push

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.639 
be setting up your cap so you can push
it<00:02:06.900> in<00:02:07.050> all<00:02:07.460> right<00:02:08.460> now<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.790> socket<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.600> is<00:02:09.649> not

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
it in all right now a socket that is not

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.890 
it in all right now a socket that is not
squarely<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.730> cap<00:02:11.970> might<00:02:12.420> well<00:02:12.630> cause

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
squarely on the cap might well cause

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.770 
squarely on the cap might well cause
damage<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.740> yoke<00:02:14.010> as<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.310> push<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:14.880> so

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
damage to the yoke as you push it in so

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.980 
damage to the yoke as you push it in so
take<00:02:16.290> your<00:02:16.470> tongue<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:17.270> get<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.390> just<00:02:18.780> right

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
take your tongue and get it just right

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.800 
take your tongue and get it just right
you<00:02:19.500> need<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.160> socket<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.730> go<00:02:21.030> inside<00:02:21.570> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
you need the socket to go inside the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.340 
you need the socket to go inside the
yoke<00:02:22.110> itself<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.150> not<00:02:24.150> cause<00:02:24.450> damage<00:02:24.990> anyway

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
yoke itself and not cause damage anyway

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.630 
yoke itself and not cause damage anyway
you<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:25.710> see<00:02:25.830> I'm<00:02:25.950> having<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.220> little<00:02:26.340> bit<00:02:26.550> of

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
you can see I'm having a little bit of

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.910 
you can see I'm having a little bit of
trouble<00:02:26.820> here<00:02:27.120> starting<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:28.440> once<00:02:28.680> it's

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
trouble here starting it but once it's

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.520 
trouble here starting it but once it's
off<00:02:29.100> I'm<00:02:29.400> pushing<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.270> in<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:31.080> will<00:02:31.230> push

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
off I'm pushing it in and it will push

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.420 
off I'm pushing it in and it will push
this<00:02:32.100> cap<00:02:32.640> into<00:02:33.060> place<00:02:33.380> now<00:02:34.380> there<00:02:34.710> is<00:02:34.860> an<00:02:35.220> area

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
this cap into place now there is an area

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.960 
this cap into place now there is an area
that<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.850> want<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.570> rest<00:02:36.870> at<00:02:37.310> now<00:02:38.310> stopping

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
that you want it to rest at now stopping

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.570 
that you want it to rest at now stopping
just<00:02:39.450> before<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.080> get<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.680> what<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.250> need<00:02:41.459> to

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
just before I get to it what I need to

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.270 
just before I get to it what I need to
do<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.880> take<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.510> past<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.020> groove<00:02:43.320> where

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
do is take it just past the groove where

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.460 
do is take it just past the groove where
the<00:02:44.459> circlip<00:02:45.000> would<00:02:45.420> sit<00:02:45.810> now<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.320> isn't

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
the circlip would sit now that isn't

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.310 
the circlip would sit now that isn't
quite<00:02:46.890> there<00:02:47.840> when<00:02:48.840> I've<00:02:48.959> got<00:02:49.170> this

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
quite there when I've got this

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.820 
quite there when I've got this
positioned<00:02:50.690> then<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:52.080> will<00:02:52.260> be<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> lot

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
positioned then that will be a lot

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.040 
positioned then that will be a lot
easier<00:02:53.010> we<00:02:53.790> put<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> clip<00:02:54.330> on<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.720> then<00:02:54.840> put

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
easier we put the clip on and then put

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.680 
easier we put the clip on and then put
the<00:02:55.110> cap<00:02:55.410> on<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.950> other<00:02:56.130> side<00:02:56.459> as<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.450> can<00:02:57.570> see

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
the cap on the other side as you can see

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.540 
the cap on the other side as you can see
this<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.020> bit<00:02:58.290> fiddly<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.739> I<00:02:58.890> need<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.370> get

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
this is a bit fiddly and I need to get

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.500 
this is a bit fiddly and I need to get
it<00:02:59.700> just<00:03:00.090> right

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
it just right

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.410 
it just right
right<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.050> can<00:03:01.230> see<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.560> cap<00:03:01.800> going<00:03:02.100> in

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
right you can see the cap going in

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.870 
right you can see the cap going in
little<00:03:03.420> by<00:03:03.600> little<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.080> check<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.800> again<00:03:05.070> okay

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
little by little and check it again okay

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.970 
little by little and check it again okay
so<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.360> does<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.870> look<00:03:07.080> like<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.560> could<00:03:07.769> fit

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
so that does that look like I could fit

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.860 
so that does that look like I could fit
a<00:03:08.010> clip<00:03:08.340> in<00:03:08.519> there<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.850> does<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.420> groove<00:03:09.690> is

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
a clip in there that does the groove is

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.900 
a clip in there that does the groove is
showing<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:11.040> doesn't<00:03:11.370> matter<00:03:11.550> if<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.760> go<00:03:11.880> a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
showing it doesn't matter if you go a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.570 
showing it doesn't matter if you go a
little<00:03:12.269> bit<00:03:12.630> over<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.800> can<00:03:13.980> always<00:03:14.190> push<00:03:14.400> it

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
little bit over you can always push it

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.640 
little bit over you can always push it
back<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.790> little<00:03:15.090> bit<00:03:15.360> there<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.110> go<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.470> can

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
back a little bit there you go you can

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
back a little bit there you go you can
see<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.980> slot<00:03:18.080> next<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.350> second<00:03:19.890> cap<00:03:20.130> goes<00:03:20.430> on

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
see the slot next the second cap goes on

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.030 
see the slot next the second cap goes on
and<00:03:20.880> if<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.090> just<00:03:21.269> put<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.600> into<00:03:21.810> place<00:03:22.049> and

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
and if you just put it into place and

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.640 
and if you just put it into place and
then<00:03:23.220> slide<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:24.090> spyder<00:03:24.420> across<00:03:24.930> making<00:03:25.500> sure

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
then slide the spyder across making sure

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.640 
then slide the spyder across making sure
you<00:03:25.890> don't<00:03:26.250> knock<00:03:26.580> any<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.239> needles<00:03:27.750> it

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
you don't knock any of the needles it

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.830 
you don't knock any of the needles it
will<00:03:28.890> sit<00:03:29.130> there<00:03:29.160> just<00:03:29.310> nicely<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:30.810> can

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
will sit there just nicely and you can

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.310 
will sit there just nicely and you can
push<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.620> other<00:03:31.769> side<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:32.989> okay<00:03:33.989> well<00:03:34.290> a

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
push the other side in okay well a

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.860 
push the other side in okay well a
little<00:03:34.620> bit<00:03:34.830> of<00:03:34.890> care<00:03:35.250> is<00:03:35.459> needed<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:36.510> push

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
little bit of care is needed to push

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.259 
little bit of care is needed to push
this<00:03:37.200> in<00:03:37.640> take<00:03:38.640> it<00:03:38.670> easy

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
this in take it easy

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.960 
this in take it easy
and<00:03:39.450> check<00:03:40.110> it<00:03:40.459> what<00:03:41.459> you'll<00:03:41.580> find<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:41.940> a

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
and check it what you'll find is a

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.670 
and check it what you'll find is a
little<00:03:42.420> bit<00:03:42.570> stiff<00:03:42.900> at<00:03:43.049> first<00:03:43.290> but<00:03:43.470> don't

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
little bit stiff at first but don't

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.410 
little bit stiff at first but don't
worry<00:03:43.830> about<00:03:44.130> that<00:03:44.370> I've<00:03:44.549> got<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.910> slot<00:03:45.239> on

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
worry about that I've got the slot on

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.650 
worry about that I've got the slot on
this<00:03:45.660> side<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.549> can<00:03:47.730> put<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.910> clip<00:03:48.269> in<00:03:48.450> there

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
this side and I can put a clip in there

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.789 
this side and I can put a clip in there
for<00:03:48.930> 1/2<00:03:49.410> which<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.860> think<00:03:50.040> I'll<00:03:50.220> do<00:03:50.459> right<00:03:50.489> now

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
for 1/2 which I think I'll do right now

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.070 
for 1/2 which I think I'll do right now
with<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.950> circuit<00:03:53.400> pliers<00:03:53.700> this<00:03:54.150> side<00:03:54.720> will

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
with the circuit pliers this side will

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.830 
with the circuit pliers this side will
drop<00:03:55.500> in<00:03:55.709> very<00:03:56.070> easily<00:03:56.340> because<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.420> just

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
drop in very easily because it is just

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.750 
drop in very easily because it is just
slightly<00:03:58.049> past<00:03:58.500> where<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:58.950> clip<00:03:59.190> groove<00:03:59.489> is

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
slightly past where the clip groove is

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.479 
slightly past where the clip groove is
if<00:04:00.360> you<00:04:00.870> haven't<00:04:01.200> damaged<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.830> then<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.370> the

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
if you haven't damaged it then it the

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.910 
if you haven't damaged it then it the
clip<00:04:02.670> will<00:04:02.820> go<00:04:02.940> in<00:04:03.090> easily<00:04:03.440> now<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.500> other

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
clip will go in easily now the other

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.910 
clip will go in easily now the other
side<00:04:05.010> obviously<00:04:06.170> it<00:04:07.170> hasn't<00:04:07.380> quite<00:04:07.680> reached

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
side obviously it hasn't quite reached

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.460 
side obviously it hasn't quite reached
it<00:04:08.220> so<00:04:08.820> what<00:04:09.239> I<00:04:09.269> want<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.600> do<00:04:09.780> is<00:04:10.110> make<00:04:10.440> sure

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
it so what I want to do is make sure

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.250 
it so what I want to do is make sure
that<00:04:10.769> it's<00:04:11.160> pushed<00:04:11.489> in<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.720> will<00:04:12.840> go<00:04:13.049> in

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
that it's pushed in and it will go in

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.650 
that it's pushed in and it will go in
the<00:04:14.010> joint<00:04:14.280> will<00:04:14.430> be<00:04:14.549> stiff<00:04:14.850> at<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.209> point<00:04:15.480> it

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
the joint will be stiff at this point it

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.310 
the joint will be stiff at this point it
don't<00:04:15.900> worry

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
don't worry

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.970 
don't worry
that<00:04:16.760> now<00:04:17.760> this<00:04:18.120> might<00:04:18.360> there<00:04:18.660> we<00:04:18.780> go<00:04:18.990> that's

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
that now this might there we go that's

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.820 
that now this might there we go that's
pushed<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.550> to<00:04:20.730> where<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.030> should<00:04:21.060> do<00:04:21.570> at<00:04:22.530> some

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
pushed it to where it should do at some

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.410 
pushed it to where it should do at some
point<00:04:22.860> you'll<00:04:23.220> be<00:04:23.250> happy<00:04:23.730> that<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:24.030> can<00:04:24.180> fit

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
point you'll be happy that you can fit

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.800 
point you'll be happy that you can fit
the<00:04:24.600> other<00:04:24.750> clip<00:04:25.080> in<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.850> as<00:04:26.850> a<00:04:26.910> bit<00:04:27.660> of<00:04:27.750> a

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
the other clip in and as a bit of a

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.750 
the other clip in and as a bit of a
heads<00:04:28.020> up<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.380> still<00:04:28.740> will<00:04:28.920> be<00:04:28.950> stiff<00:04:29.430> at<00:04:29.610> this

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
heads up it still will be stiff at this

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.220 
heads up it still will be stiff at this
point<00:04:30.030> don't<00:04:30.330> worry<00:04:30.600> about<00:04:30.720> it

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
point don't worry about it

a little tip here is if you can't quite

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.540 
a little tip here is if you can't quite
get<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.540> clip<00:04:36.780> in<00:04:36.990> just<00:04:37.230> tap<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.710> in<00:04:37.860> with<00:04:38.280> a

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
get the clip in just tap it in with a

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.090 
get the clip in just tap it in with a
chisel<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.390> make<00:04:39.570> sure<00:04:39.810> that<00:04:40.020> it<00:04:40.140> is<00:04:40.290> perfectly

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
chisel to make sure that it is perfectly

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.000 
chisel to make sure that it is perfectly
home<00:04:41.490> in<00:04:41.700> the<00:04:41.850> slot<00:04:42.380> you<00:04:43.380> should<00:04:43.560> already<00:04:43.860> be

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
home in the slot you should already be

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.860 
home in the slot you should already be
aware<00:04:44.280> that<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:44.730> can<00:04:44.910> do<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.150> same<00:04:45.390> thing<00:04:45.690> for

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
aware that you can do the same thing for

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.760 
aware that you can do the same thing for
the<00:04:45.990> other<00:04:46.020> half<00:04:46.770> with<00:04:47.760> the<00:04:47.850> other<00:04:47.970> two<00:04:48.210> caps

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
the other half with the other two caps

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.890 
the other half with the other two caps
this<00:04:49.770> one<00:04:50.070> I'm<00:04:50.310> cutting<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.760> clip<00:04:51.150> in<00:04:51.390> before

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
this one I'm cutting the clip in before

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.560 
this one I'm cutting the clip in before
I<00:04:51.930> put<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.380> other<00:04:52.530> cap<00:04:52.890> on<00:04:53.160> is<00:04:53.370> not<00:04:54.180> really

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
I put the other cap on is not really

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.720 
I put the other cap on is not really
that<00:04:54.780> important<00:04:55.350> which<00:04:55.770> way<00:04:55.950> round<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:56.370> do<00:04:56.550> it

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
that important which way round you do it

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.970 
that important which way round you do it
but<00:04:56.910> I'm<00:04:57.000> dropping<00:04:57.600> this<00:04:57.750> in<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.260> actually

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
but I'm dropping this in and actually

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.680 
but I'm dropping this in and actually
this<00:04:59.070> is<00:04:59.220> quite<00:04:59.520> loose<00:04:59.760> so<00:05:00.090> I<00:05:00.120> pushed<00:05:00.480> it<00:05:00.630> a

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
this is quite loose so I pushed it a

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.960 
this is quite loose so I pushed it a
little<00:05:01.020> bit<00:05:01.200> too<00:05:01.440> far<00:05:01.770> that<00:05:02.580> will<00:05:02.700> be<00:05:02.850> adjusted

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
little bit too far that will be adjusted

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.040 
little bit too far that will be adjusted
later<00:05:03.660> on<00:05:07.940> okay<00:05:08.940> anyway<00:05:09.390> we'll<00:05:09.600> turn<00:05:09.780> it<00:05:09.960> in

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
later on okay anyway we'll turn it in

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.020 
later on okay anyway we'll turn it in
the<00:05:10.170> vise<00:05:10.380> get<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.830> next<00:05:11.130> cap<00:05:11.340> on<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.850> the

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
the vise get the next cap on and the

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.510 
the vise get the next cap on and the
clip<00:05:12.270> on<00:05:15.200> so<00:05:16.200> the<00:05:16.320> caps<00:05:16.530> finally<00:05:17.010> there<00:05:17.310> and

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
clip on so the caps finally there and

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.480 
clip on so the caps finally there and
there<00:05:18.390> is<00:05:18.570> a<00:05:18.600> groove<00:05:19.080> enough<00:05:19.770> to<00:05:19.950> fit<00:05:20.130> the<00:05:20.250> clip

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
there is a groove enough to fit the clip

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.510 
there is a groove enough to fit the clip
into<00:05:20.850> place<00:05:21.290> this<00:05:22.290> is<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.560> last<00:05:22.770> component<00:05:23.130> to

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
into place this is the last component to

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.310 
into place this is the last component to
be<00:05:23.640> fitted<00:05:24.030> into<00:05:24.150> place<00:05:24.510> before<00:05:24.900> everything

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
be fitted into place before everything

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.580 
be fitted into place before everything
gets<00:05:25.470> squared<00:05:25.950> up<00:05:26.280> and<00:05:26.490> then<00:05:26.580> greased

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
gets squared up and then greased

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.110 
gets squared up and then greased
alright<00:05:28.590> so<00:05:28.860> drop<00:05:29.160> in<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.340> clip<00:05:29.550> in<00:05:29.760> easy

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
alright so drop in the clip in easy

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.290 
alright so drop in the clip in easy
enough<00:05:30.540> alright<00:05:31.350> it's<00:05:31.530> gone<00:05:31.710> in<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:31.980> place

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
enough alright it's gone in the place

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.700 
enough alright it's gone in the place
you<00:05:33.300> can<00:05:33.480> see<00:05:33.630> there's<00:05:33.810> a<00:05:33.870> gap<00:05:34.140> between<00:05:34.380> the

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
you can see there's a gap between the

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.260 
you can see there's a gap between the
two<00:05:34.740> eyes<00:05:35.130> but<00:05:35.520> I'm<00:05:35.610> just<00:05:35.790> going<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.060> make<00:05:36.240> sure

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
and with each of the clips I'm going to

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.850 
and with each of the clips I'm going to
knock<00:05:39.180> them<00:05:39.450> further<00:05:39.750> into<00:05:40.050> the<00:05:40.260> grooves<00:05:40.560> to

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
knock them further into the grooves to

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.680 
knock them further into the grooves to
make<00:05:41.130> sure<00:05:41.340> that<00:05:41.520> they<00:05:41.670> are<00:05:41.850> fitted<00:05:42.480> properly

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
make sure that they are fitted properly

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.440 
make sure that they are fitted properly
I<00:05:43.140> don't<00:05:43.350> want<00:05:43.500> these<00:05:43.620> coming<00:05:44.040> out<00:05:44.390> okay<00:05:45.390> so

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
I don't want these coming out okay so

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.630 
I don't want these coming out okay so
knocking<00:05:46.020> it<00:05:46.140> round<00:05:46.410> that<00:05:46.770> moves<00:05:47.070> around<00:05:47.250> and

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
knocking it round that moves around and

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.210 
knocking it round that moves around and
that<00:05:47.820> squarely<00:05:48.390> in<00:05:48.750> this<00:05:49.560> is<00:05:49.710> vitally

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
that squarely in this is vitally

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.740 
that squarely in this is vitally
important<00:05:50.640> you<00:05:50.700> don't<00:05:50.820> want<00:05:50.940> it<00:05:51.120> spinning<00:05:51.510> out

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
important you don't want it spinning out

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.350 
important you don't want it spinning out
on<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:52.020> road<00:05:52.280> these<00:05:53.280> go<00:05:53.520> out<00:05:53.550> quite<00:05:54.120> a<00:05:54.150> high

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
on the road these go out quite a high

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.680 
on the road these go out quite a high
speed<00:05:55.250> right<00:05:56.250> then<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.610> next<00:05:56.910> thing<00:05:57.060> to<00:05:57.240> do<00:05:57.450> is

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
speed right then the next thing to do is

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.430 
speed right then the next thing to do is
the<00:05:58.410> fun<00:05:58.770> part<00:05:59.040> because<00:05:59.450> the<00:06:00.450> u-j<00:06:01.020> will<00:06:01.290> be

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
the fun part because the u-j will be

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.500 
the fun part because the u-j will be
quite<00:06:01.680> stiff<00:06:02.130> at<00:06:02.340> the<00:06:02.460> moment<00:06:02.880> you<00:06:03.270> can<00:06:03.480> see

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
quite stiff at the moment you can see

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.680 
quite stiff at the moment you can see
that<00:06:03.830> it's<00:06:04.830> the<00:06:05.370> way<00:06:05.520> it's<00:06:05.700> moving<00:06:05.880> is<00:06:06.270> stiff

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
that it's the way it's moving is stiff

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.290 
that it's the way it's moving is stiff
what<00:06:07.380> we<00:06:07.500> want<00:06:07.680> to<00:06:07.770> do<00:06:07.920> is<00:06:08.070> square<00:06:08.430> it<00:06:08.550> up<00:06:08.670> with

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
what we want to do is square it up with

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.930 
what we want to do is square it up with
a<00:06:09.330> hammer<00:06:09.690> or<00:06:09.960> you'll<00:06:10.380> Landrover<00:06:11.220> adjusting

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
a hammer or you'll Landrover adjusting

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.990 
a hammer or you'll Landrover adjusting
tool<00:06:12.180> which<00:06:12.390> is<00:06:12.570> very<00:06:12.990> much<00:06:13.080> approved<00:06:13.590> and

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
tool which is very much approved and

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.850 
tool which is very much approved and
just<00:06:15.000> tap<00:06:15.360> it

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.619 

you<00:06:20.860> don't<00:06:21.069> need<00:06:21.250> to<00:06:21.400> hit<00:06:21.520> it<00:06:21.580> so<00:06:22.030> hard<00:06:22.060> that<00:06:22.479> it

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:22.629 
you don't need to hit it so hard that it

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:24.420 
you don't need to hit it so hard that it
will<00:06:22.900> crimp<00:06:23.259> it<00:06:23.439> together<00:06:23.830> but<00:06:24.159> what<00:06:24.310> you're

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
will crimp it together but what you're

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.749 
will crimp it together but what you're
looking<00:06:24.729> for<00:06:24.969> is<00:06:25.180> smoothness<00:06:26.080> of<00:06:26.490> each<00:06:27.490> of<00:06:27.669> the

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 
looking for is smoothness of each of the

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.850 
looking for is smoothness of each of the
joints<00:06:28.270> so<00:06:29.050> when<00:06:29.259> you<00:06:29.379> fit<00:06:29.590> it<00:06:29.680> to<00:06:29.800> your

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
joints so when you fit it to your

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.040 
joints so when you fit it to your
vehicle<00:06:30.340> it<00:06:30.550> won't<00:06:30.789> be<00:06:31.090> stiff<00:06:31.509> and<00:06:31.840> cause

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
vehicle it won't be stiff and cause

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.709 
vehicle it won't be stiff and cause
vibrations<00:06:32.919> now<00:06:33.159> this<00:06:33.370> is<00:06:33.490> perfect<00:06:34.090> last<00:06:34.419> job

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:34.719 
vibrations now this is perfect last job

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:36.689 
vibrations now this is perfect last job
is<00:06:34.930> just<00:06:35.199> to<00:06:35.319> grease<00:06:35.650> the<00:06:35.860> joints<00:06:36.250> up<00:06:36.430> so

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:36.699 
is just to grease the joints up so

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:39.119 
is just to grease the joints up so
they're<00:06:36.939> serviceable<00:06:37.599> and<00:06:37.830> painter<00:06:38.830> if<00:06:38.979> you

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:39.129 
they're serviceable and painter if you

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:42.059 
they're serviceable and painter if you
so<00:06:39.400> require<00:06:39.849> them<00:06:40.060> fit<00:06:40.330> it<00:06:40.479> to<00:06:40.659> the<00:06:40.689> vehicle<00:06:41.319> so

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069 
so require them fit it to the vehicle so

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:46.439 
so require them fit it to the vehicle so
there<00:06:42.250> you<00:06:42.280> go<00:06:42.400> it's<00:06:42.729> all<00:06:42.849> done<00:06:43.120> easy<00:06:44.080> huh
