00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.589
 yes, here is your burkhard I am again 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.610
 on the menu mines 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:14.250
 I was the Soviet heavy tank 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:19.439
 s8 and yes he is relatively fast and 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.750
 Agile has it with a thin tub 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.080
 panzer unpaid of the tower well 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.320
 armored as far as I know is the tower 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.080
 as usual at the time 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.239
 poured in nature also very round 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.950
 held 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.960
 For one thing , cast towers were relative 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.940
 hard and on the other by the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.719
 rounded mold or design is 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:51.170
 bounced or slipped on him 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.170
 blown off as it may call 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:00.750
 low points sink lower tub driver 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.140
 hatch in the tower also all hatches and if 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.630
 her a reasonably good caliber and 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.369
 halfway the sloping at 90 degrees angle 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.510
 hits shoots there as well 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:16.140
 he is barely armored by him, but he 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.520
 is fast you see it yes I race 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.520
 handy for the heavy there 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.670
 What is historical about this 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.070
 to say vehicle 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:33.390
 in the development of ten prototypes 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:38.210
 built or pre-production vehicles it was called 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.210
 still object 730 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.100
 before delivery to the troop or 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.960
 introduction in the troupe he then left 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.960
 until 8 and when he was in the troop 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:13.459
 In 1953 this suddenly 14 not you 10cc 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:14.950
 sorry yes how many vehicles drove 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.840
 built of it 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:26.140
 some sources say two and a half thousand 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:31.100
 others claim 8000 are the ones 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.690
 people who need to know the waves 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:47.170
 they did not write that down 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:51.590
 I have a very good cannon 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:56.590
 but passage is unfortunately makes you pro 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:59.870
 Do not hit so much with it but for that 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:06.960
 through it puts very thick armor 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:12.690
 for your class yes 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.490
 that 's it so directly about the wannsee what 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.770
 are quick to say about videos 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.930
 because I read from time to time 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.790
 what about the graphic what about the 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:30.630
 Sound I give my pc soon 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:33.560
 Dealer and read upgrade with them 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:40.340
 new hardware and software 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.340
 and until that is not completed 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:50.550
 I leave almost everything as it is 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:52.200
 in the videos because I also stop new 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.560
 software means I have to 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.560
 Clear again 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.920
 and as long as I'm still with the old ones 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:07.380
 I can not work on components either 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:10.920
 big on the graphics and on the picture 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.100
 sound I let everything like everything now 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.100
 it is 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.960
 and if he can see this video 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.580
 probably my computer still at 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.600
 dealer 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.900
 because i like this i should say this 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.900
 produce four 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.320
 So please understand that I am myself 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.340
 now that not few hours Rhine knee to 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.500
 something to change on the video if I have 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.810
 my calculator war again i have to 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.810
 anyway make everything different again and 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:07.240
 the time I save now around the 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:10.669
 Try everything to put 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.919
 I just use it for fun 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.919
 have and couple and drive 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:35.000
 and frankly I do not know 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.040
 if I'm going to last that high grade 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.090
 videos can hold that I have so many 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:44.180
 but as long as I still can 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.410
 I want to create you as possible 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.410
 many tanks show 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:57.140
 until each of my vehicles you 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:06:04.730
 once I have unfortunately presented 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:08.930
 Therefore also say the high quality will 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:10.940
 then time costs that means me 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.800
 will do much less why 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.570
 can 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.290
 and if I place much high now 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:22.120
 so that had every vehicle fast 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.120
 she herself is funny 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.800
 yes now to the evaluation of this battle 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.800
 as a class 2 had been worth 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.889
 the better represented the team surprised 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:45.139
 not ok well I had 12 now 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:49.159
 Of these, eleven were direct 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:50.500
 Only six hits hit me 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:54.970
 have done better but 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:58.580
 nevertheless 2065 damage received 5 hits 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:02.449
 three were effective then 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:04.580
 potential harms 2430 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:07.900
 opponents discovered her opponent damaged 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.900
 killed three opponents 

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:14.539
 the whole thing was still thanks to premium 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:17.569
 financial gain of over 15,000 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:18.229
 Credit without premium will be just under 4,000 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:21.379
 been 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:24.199
 that was a simple fight with 

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:27.650
 Reward for order completion goods 

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:31.610
 the end of 1696 points of experience thanks 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:33.710
 premium and yes I have you this 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.449
 vehicle now presented it will 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:39.279
 take a moment to come again 

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:39.279
 wish you much fun with it your board
