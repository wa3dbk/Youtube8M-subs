the<00:02:01.259> panel<00:02:01.590> set<00:02:01.800> to<00:02:01.920> work<00:02:02.069> finding<00:02:02.670> bugs<00:02:03.090> in

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the panel set to work finding bugs in

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.419 
the panel set to work finding bugs in
the<00:02:03.450> prototype<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.679> were<00:02:04.800> playing<00:02:05.039> with<00:02:05.220> them

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
the prototype we were playing with them

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.639 
the prototype we were playing with them
with<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.050> motors<00:02:07.050> hooked<00:02:07.259> up<00:02:07.410> to<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
with the motors hooked up to the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.100 
with the motors hooked up to the
controllers<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.220> everything<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:09.990> all

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
controllers and everything and we all

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.690 
controllers and everything and we all
came<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> conclusion<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.400> motors

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
came to the conclusion that the motors

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.760 
came to the conclusion that the motors
just<00:02:12.360> weren't<00:02:12.540> all<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.780> great<00:02:12.959> they<00:02:13.590> weren't

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
just weren't all that great they weren't

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.480 
just weren't all that great they weren't
very<00:02:13.950> powerful<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:15.480> we<00:02:15.660> actually<00:02:16.170> also<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.220> a

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
very powerful so we actually also in a

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.800 
very powerful so we actually also in a
closed<00:02:17.670> dialogue<00:02:18.000> with<00:02:18.120> our<00:02:18.150> community<00:02:18.630> we

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
closed dialogue with our community we

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.390 
closed dialogue with our community we
re-engineer<00:02:19.410> our<00:02:19.470> motors<00:02:19.860> three<00:02:20.130> times

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
re-engineer our motors three times

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.760 
re-engineer our motors three times
before<00:02:20.580> we<00:02:20.910> satisfy<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.290> very<00:02:22.470> short<00:02:22.530> time

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
before we satisfy in a very short time

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.650 
before we satisfy in a very short time
they<00:02:23.040> came<00:02:23.190> back<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.459> us<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.610> said<00:02:23.819> okay<00:02:24.090> well

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
they came back to us and said okay well

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.420 
they came back to us and said okay well
we<00:02:25.230> have<00:02:25.410> some<00:02:25.590> new<00:02:25.620> motors<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.310> new

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
we have some new motors and new

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.100 
we have some new motors and new
electronics<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.480> we're<00:02:27.569> going<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.720> send<00:02:27.959> to

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
electronics that we're going to send to

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.949 
electronics that we're going to send to
you<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.880> we<00:02:29.880> want<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.209> try<00:02:30.330> these<00:02:30.390> out<00:02:30.690> see

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
you and we want you to try these out see

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.020 
you and we want you to try these out see
if<00:02:30.990> they<00:02:31.290> work<00:02:31.470> any<00:02:31.680> better<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:32.520> new<00:02:32.670> motors

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
if they work any better the new motors

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.540 
if they work any better the new motors
then<00:02:33.450> were<00:02:34.310> really<00:02:35.310> good<00:02:35.490> but<00:02:37.459> Steven<00:02:38.459> his

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
then were really good but Steven his

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.690 
then were really good but Steven his
friend<00:02:38.790> Dave<00:02:39.090> had<00:02:39.360> another<00:02:39.810> concern<00:02:40.349> with<00:02:41.190> the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
friend Dave had another concern with the

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.830 
friend Dave had another concern with the
new<00:02:41.849> kit<00:02:42.090> one<00:02:42.240> of<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.390> first<00:02:42.569> things<00:02:42.630> they

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
new kit one of the first things they

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.150 
new kit one of the first things they
said<00:02:43.050> was<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.470> all<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.740> pieces<00:02:43.920> are<00:02:44.010> going

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
said was that all the pieces are going

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.800 
said was that all the pieces are going
to<00:02:44.220> be<00:02:44.280> studless<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:44.940> one<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.630> first

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
to be studless and one of the first

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.809 
to be studless and one of the first
things<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.080> Dave<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.349> I<00:02:46.530> both<00:02:46.680> said<00:02:46.920> was<00:02:47.190> the

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
things that Dave and I both said was the

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.820 
things that Dave and I both said was the
problem<00:02:48.090> with<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.450> studless<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.080> there's<00:02:49.709> no

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
problem with the studless is there's no

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.800 
problem with the studless is there's no
way<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.040> connect<00:02:50.400> two<00:02:50.550> beams<00:02:50.760> together<00:02:51.000> with

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
way to connect two beams together with

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.380 
way to connect two beams together with
the<00:02:51.930> old<00:02:52.080> studded<00:02:52.860> pieces<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:54.060> was<00:02:54.210> pretty

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
the old studded pieces it was pretty

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.490 
the old studded pieces it was pretty
easy<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.750> make<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.350> beat<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.800> pieces<00:02:55.980> can

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
easy to make to beat to pieces can

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.860 
easy to make to beat to pieces can
did<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.770> 90<00:02:57.040> degrees<00:02:57.180> yours<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.390> principle

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
did it 90 degrees yours this principle

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.430 
did it 90 degrees yours this principle
to<00:02:59.080> create<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.530> 90<00:03:00.040> degree<00:03:00.130> angle<00:03:01.020> Soren<00:03:02.020> luntik

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
to create a 90 degree angle Soren luntik

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.050 
to create a 90 degree angle Soren luntik
the<00:03:02.620> 90<00:03:02.920> degree<00:03:03.010> angle<00:03:03.460> problem<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:03.970> his

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
the 90 degree angle problem to his

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.360 
the 90 degree angle problem to his
colleagues<00:03:04.300> they<00:03:05.050> tried<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.380> make<00:03:05.560> 90-degree

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
colleagues they tried to make 90-degree

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.490 
colleagues they tried to make 90-degree
angles<00:03:06.670> with<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:06.910> existing<00:03:07.210> pieces<00:03:07.720> Michigan

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
angles with the existing pieces Michigan

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.740 
angles with the existing pieces Michigan
but<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.710> didn't<00:03:08.950> work<00:03:08.980> very<00:03:09.130> well<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:10.330> it

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
but that didn't work very well and it

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.750 
but that didn't work very well and it
take<00:03:10.960> what<00:03:11.200> two<00:03:11.680> four<00:03:12.190> six<00:03:12.220> eight<00:03:13.000> ten<00:03:13.990> pieces

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
take what two four six eight ten pieces

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
take what two four six eight ten pieces
and<00:03:15.760> when<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:15.940> saw<00:03:16.150> all<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.420> different

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
and when I saw all the different

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.720 
and when I saw all the different
examples<00:03:17.620> they<00:03:17.709> came<00:03:17.890> up<00:03:17.920> with<00:03:18.070> it<00:03:18.400> says<00:03:18.520> it

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
examples they came up with it says it

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.150 
examples they came up with it says it
just<00:03:19.000> cannot<00:03:19.240> be<00:03:19.420> true<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:20.170> takes<00:03:20.500> 10<00:03:20.860> pieces

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
just cannot be true it takes 10 pieces

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.150 
just cannot be true it takes 10 pieces
fast<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:21.940> combine<00:03:22.360> two<00:03:22.660> beams<00:03:22.959> so<00:03:23.860> we<00:03:24.010> look

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
fast to combine two beams so we look

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.920 
fast to combine two beams so we look
back<00:03:24.340> then<00:03:24.550> maybe<00:03:24.730> there's<00:03:25.000> something<00:03:25.510> into

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
back then maybe there's something into

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.270 
back then maybe there's something into
this<00:03:26.020> maybe<00:03:26.290> we<00:03:26.530> need<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.709> do<00:03:26.920> something<00:03:27.130> about

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
this maybe we need to do something about

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.610 
this maybe we need to do something about
it<00:03:27.490> we<00:03:28.209> always<00:03:28.510> need<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.840> be<00:03:28.989> on<00:03:29.140> back<00:03:29.380> to<00:03:29.590> the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
it we always need to be on back to the

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.740 
it we always need to be on back to the
drawing<00:03:29.950> board<00:03:30.130> so<00:03:31.060> they<00:03:31.090> came<00:03:31.330> up<00:03:31.390> with<00:03:31.510> this

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
drawing board so they came up with this

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.680 
drawing board so they came up with this
piece<00:03:32.130> which<00:03:33.130> will<00:03:33.310> allow<00:03:33.430> them<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.330> connect

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
piece which will allow them to connect

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.030 
piece which will allow them to connect
to<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:36.220> Biebs<00:03:36.430> together<00:03:36.820> at<00:03:37.090> 90<00:03:37.540> degrees<00:03:38.040> this

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
to to Biebs together at 90 degrees this

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.229 
to to Biebs together at 90 degrees this
