00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the settings everything seems to run

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.260

more<00:00:40.260> faster<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.890> more<00:00:41.040> fluid<00:00:41.520> than<00:00:41.550> beta<00:00:41.969> 2

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
more faster and more fluid than beta 2

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.860 
more faster and more fluid than beta 2
beta<00:00:42.450> 2<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.200> would<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.829> much<00:00:43.980> more<00:00:44.040> slower<00:00:44.870> it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
beta 2 it would be much more slower it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.020 
beta 2 it would be much more slower it
wouldn't<00:00:46.289> fade<00:00:46.559> away<00:00:46.829> when<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.100> turn<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.700> or

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
wouldn't fade away when I turn it on or

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.420 
wouldn't fade away when I turn it on or
would<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> fade<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.510> when<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.079> turned<00:00:49.399> when<00:00:50.399> I

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
would a fade on when it turned when I

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.229 
would a fade on when it turned when I
turned<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:50.969> off<00:00:52.430> it<00:00:53.430> would<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.910> would<00:00:54.090> be

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
turned it on off it would this would be

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.990 
turned it on off it would this would be
a<00:00:54.270> little<00:00:54.539> laggy<00:00:54.920> this<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.070> crisp<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.640> more

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
a little laggy this is crisp and more

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.740 
a little laggy this is crisp and more
fluid<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:58.199> works<00:00:58.620> better<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.609> turned<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.510> off

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
fluid it works better I turned it off

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.340 
fluid it works better I turned it off
earlier<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.770> didn't<00:01:02.100> crash<00:01:02.629> so<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:04.080> would

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
earlier and it didn't crash so I would

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.620 
earlier and it didn't crash so I would
just<00:01:04.559> say<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.890> everything<00:01:05.189> seems<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.270> be

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
just say that everything seems to be

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.969 
just say that everything seems to be
working<00:01:06.960> better<00:01:08.000> but<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.750> doesn't<00:01:10.380> mean<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
working better but it doesn't mean it

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.710 
working better but it doesn't mean it
doesn't<00:01:11.520> actually<00:01:11.760> mean<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:14.090> it's<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
doesn't actually mean that it's going to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.350 
doesn't actually mean that it's going to
be<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.200> hundred<00:01:16.320> percent<00:01:16.820> better<00:01:17.820> because

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
be one hundred percent better because

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.100 
be one hundred percent better because
it's<00:01:18.540> still<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.170> beta<00:01:19.650> as<00:01:20.150> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.360> see<00:01:21.600> here

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
it is the beta but everything seems to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.160 
it is the beta but everything seems to
work<00:01:31.460> good<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:33.290> ant<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.829> camera<00:01:35.729> bug<00:01:36.600> has<00:01:36.930> been

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
work good on ant the camera bug has been

work good on ant the camera bug has been
completely<00:01:37.680> removed<00:01:38.159> um<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:42.590> everything<00:01:43.590> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
completely removed um and everything is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.280 
completely removed um and everything is
more<00:01:44.040> fluent<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.610> better<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.210> has<00:01:45.240> less<00:01:45.960> bugs

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
more fluent and better it has less bugs

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.340 
more fluent and better it has less bugs
but<00:01:47.220> once<00:01:47.670> again<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.270> say<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.930> still<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
but once again I say this is still the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.270 
but once again I say this is still the
beta<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:50.220> can<00:01:50.399> download<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:51.600> use<00:01:51.869> it

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
beta you can download it you can use it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.480 
beta you can download it you can use it
whatever<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.810> sure<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.490> just

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
whatever you like just be sure that just

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.840 
whatever you like just be sure that just
be<00:01:56.610> clear<00:01:57.229> that<00:01:58.229> not<00:01:58.710> all<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> features<00:01:59.340> are

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
be clear that not all the features are

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.200 
be clear that not all the features are
going<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.750> run<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.369> saluted<00:02:02.369> because<00:02:03.030> it's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
going to run a saluted because it's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.859 
going to run a saluted because it's
still<00:02:03.750> not<00:02:03.990> as<00:02:04.259> complete<00:02:04.799> stable<00:02:05.549> one<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.659> is

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
still not as complete stable one it is

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.070 
still not as complete stable one it is
more<00:02:07.110> stable<00:02:07.350> than<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> beta<00:02:08.009> 2<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.780> it's<00:02:09.780> not

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
more stable than the beta 2 but it's not

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.200 
more stable than the beta 2 but it's not
fully<00:02:11.069> stable

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
fully stable

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.810 
fully stable
because<00:02:12.510> for<00:02:13.110> example<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.860> be<00:02:14.220> using<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
because for example I be using the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.160 
because for example I be using the
iphone<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.950> back<00:02:17.370> part<00:02:17.850> would<00:02:18.630> become

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
iphone and the back part would become

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.200 
iphone and the back part would become
black<00:02:19.470> for<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.830> second<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.340> then<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.730> would<00:02:20.940> i

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
black for a second and then it would i

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.010 
black for a second and then it would i
would<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.580> lock<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.910> unlock<00:02:24.210> my<00:02:24.720> phone

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
would have to lock and unlock my phone

little slow so i would say that this
beta<00:03:04.410> version<00:03:05.450> really<00:03:06.450> impressed<00:03:07.080> me<00:03:07.820> it<00:03:08.820> lags

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
it but still it's not completely stable
