00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.100
 this unit with registration of 54 is lousy 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.419
 it tied is to say that it is a machine 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.999
 that brake 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.970
 and can not move 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.359
 Edge abstract is made randomly 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.359
 from this side to the third lane 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.079
 10 hectares 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:32.830
 to overtake 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.330
 the truck 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.260
 however, 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.510
 could not 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.770
 and he was also embarrassed 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.770
 in this afternoon 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.530
 practically all the traffic disorder 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.530
 It covers from the zone of it is to enter of supplies of ecatepec 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.590
 and advance 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.590
 that the accesses of the sections of different 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.550
 in fact this warning to the community of madrid 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.650
 and the reason for this road chaos 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.980
 this truck 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.980
 with registration 9 54 f5 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.000
 the conveyor 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.910
 and that truck 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.910
 call it is to say the machine broke down 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.140
 and he stayed 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.250
 paralyzed in being are more in the lane 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.530
 medium 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.930
 and that look we see aside 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.550
 did go over 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.080
 this zone 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.230
 to get past that confrontation that however did not succeed and got stuck with that channel 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.830
 it seems that others 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.159
 another trailer 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.200
 wants to spend 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.890
 by the only lane that is functional 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.070
 it's complicated 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.200
 martínez in all this stretch 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.520

 not for nothing is that at this time there 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.429
 the rumors begin to advance 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.229
 however, they are occupying 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:15.229
 two of the three lanes that occupy this road 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.739
 because this truck 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.579
