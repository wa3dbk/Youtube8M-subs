 Channel knows I like things 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.130
 A lot of people are going to attack every 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.570
 ingredients only remembering that the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 ingredients attack in the description of 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.110
 video if you do not think it happens 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.720
 the gourmet network may be 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.990

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.990
 all 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.140
 a pinch of salt but it's sweet it goes 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.910
 put salt because salt is not and 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.770
 taste of the new so whenever you do 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.380
 a goal is put a little bit what is 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.870
 I know it's a guy out of here. 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.600
 your channel and the gastronomic part 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.880
 You think a lot about life if philosophy 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.890
 read many books runs eighth and 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.250
 I mentally wanted to hear from you. 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.340
 next you have a one concept 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.320
 a theory about any mission to the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.160
 what are we going to do in our lives? 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.160
 Are you fine? 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.239
 this is basically so if you knew the 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.650
 details and manages to do anything 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.580
 interesting I think the cool is 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.620
 That's really what we're doing. 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.569
 is to share this kind of information 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.480
 It's not cool, she can record with me. 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.950
 nothing is going to happen and we will pass 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.510
 for a container we will go through 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.590
 a goal or something was just the 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.420
 enough to put on the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.099
 refrigerator for about a 20 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.450
 minutes because we try to do now 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.000
 she is full of water 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.349
 We are going to be in the air a person to 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.120
 to sit down to do these 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.590
 bubbles is still gone 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.239

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.970
 You think everything always works out for this. 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.329

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.760
