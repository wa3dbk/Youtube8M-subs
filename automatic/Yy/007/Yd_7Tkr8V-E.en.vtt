actually for a very long time and and we
these<00:01:00.370> days<00:01:00.700> we<00:01:00.970> were<00:01:01.270> considered<00:01:01.809> almost

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
these days we were considered almost

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.619 
these days we were considered almost
like<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:03.460> authority<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.210> world<00:01:04.420> authority

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
like the authority the world authority

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.550

we<00:01:08.710> are<00:01:08.920> fit<00:01:09.280> suppose<00:01:09.729> yeah<00:01:10.180> I<00:01:10.479> think<00:01:10.690> what

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
we are fit suppose yeah I think what

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.380 
we are fit suppose yeah I think what
makes<00:01:11.050> us<00:01:11.200> unique<00:01:11.619> is<00:01:11.890> that<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:13.000> would<00:01:13.300> have

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
makes us unique is that it would have

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.750 
makes us unique is that it would have
been<00:01:13.420> very<00:01:13.690> easy<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:14.200> just<00:01:14.530> stay<00:01:14.830> singing<00:01:15.460> and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
been very easy to just stay singing and

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.580 
been very easy to just stay singing and
your<00:01:16.119> sister<00:01:16.450> songs<00:01:16.720> or<00:01:17.020> Boswell<00:01:17.440> Sisters

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
your sister songs or Boswell Sisters

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.440 
your sister songs or Boswell Sisters
songs<00:01:17.979> which<00:01:18.160> we<00:01:18.310> loved<00:01:18.550> and<00:01:18.790> we<00:01:18.850> did<00:01:19.180> do<00:01:19.420> that

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
songs which we loved and we did do that

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.920 
songs which we loved and we did do that
but<00:01:20.350> because<00:01:20.740> we're<00:01:21.070> of<00:01:21.310> our<00:01:21.790> time<00:01:22.150> and<00:01:22.450> people

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
but because we're of our time and people

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.900 
but because we're of our time and people
that<00:01:23.170> we<00:01:23.350> are<00:01:23.380> we<00:01:23.770> wanted<00:01:24.160> to<00:01:24.280> do<00:01:24.399> something

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
that we are we wanted to do something

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:37.540 
that we are we wanted to do something
new<00:01:25.899> and<00:01:26.229> that's<00:01:26.649> what<00:01:26.979> makes<00:01:27.190> us<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.720> make

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:45.859 

Oh

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.840 

each<00:01:46.869> song<00:01:47.170> has<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.470> different<00:01:47.890> very<00:01:48.400> different

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
each song has a different very different

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.880 
each song has a different very different
personality<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.690> arrangements<00:01:50.650> are<00:01:50.740> all

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
personality the arrangements are all

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.380 
personality the arrangements are all
completely<00:01:51.369> different<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.119> think<00:01:52.300> that

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
completely different and I think that

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.090 
completely different and I think that
gives<00:01:52.600> it<00:01:52.750> such<00:01:52.900> an<00:01:53.080> edge<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.530> essentially

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
gives it such an edge and essentially

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.550 
gives it such an edge and essentially
the<00:01:54.759> concept<00:01:55.030> is<00:01:55.420> Hollywood<00:01:55.840> which<00:01:56.110> is<00:01:56.140> so

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
the concept is Hollywood which is so

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.219 
the concept is Hollywood which is so
great<00:01:56.890> its<00:01:57.070> cinematic<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.630> can<00:01:58.810> do<00:01:58.960> so

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
great its cinematic and you can do so

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.260 
great its cinematic and you can do so
much<00:01:59.470> with<00:01:59.740> that<00:01:59.800> you<00:02:00.340> could<00:02:00.550> make<00:02:00.759> a<00:02:00.790> movie

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
much with that you could make a movie

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.790 
much with that you could make a movie
you<00:02:01.360> could<00:02:01.540> make<00:02:01.750> album<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.350> know<00:02:02.470> one<00:02:02.619> of<00:02:02.649> the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
you could make album you know one of the

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.399 
you could make album you know one of the
tracks<00:02:03.070> maybe<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.490> bit<00:02:03.640> more<00:02:03.670> fellini-esque

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
tracks maybe a bit more fellini-esque

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.100 
tracks maybe a bit more fellini-esque

when we were looking back at the 40s

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.360 
when we were looking back at the 40s
there's<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:33.689> much<00:02:33.840> beautiful<00:02:34.590> fashion<00:02:35.040> and

there's so much beautiful fashion and

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.699 
there's so much beautiful fashion and
the<00:02:36.090> clothes<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.659> the<00:02:36.719> style<00:02:37.019> was<00:02:37.319> something

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
the clothes and the style was something

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.319 
the clothes and the style was something
that<00:02:37.890> really<00:02:38.069> appealed<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.549> all<00:02:38.700> three<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.239> us

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
that really appealed to all three of us

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.160 
that really appealed to all three of us
and<00:02:39.930> each<00:02:40.379> of<00:02:40.590> us<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.920> very<00:02:41.219> individual<00:02:41.849> and

indifferent<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.290> our<00:02:43.409> tastes<00:02:43.950> but<00:02:44.609> I<00:02:44.790> think<00:02:45.239> we

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
indifferent in our tastes but I think we

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.309 
indifferent in our tastes but I think we
