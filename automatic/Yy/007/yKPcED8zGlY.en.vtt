00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
amazing back to what we were just

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.170 
amazing back to what we were just
talking<00:01:58.619> earlier<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.369> protein<00:01:59.759> you<00:02:00.000> do

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
talking earlier is the protein you do

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.030 
talking earlier is the protein you do
not<00:02:00.299> just<00:02:00.420> want<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> just<00:02:00.869> chug<00:02:01.290> protein<00:02:01.770> Chuck

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
not just want to just chug protein Chuck

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.770 
not just want to just chug protein Chuck
protein<00:02:02.369> chugboats<00:02:02.729> into<00:02:02.969> protein<00:02:03.360> why

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
protein chugboats into protein why

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.080 
protein chugboats into protein why
because<00:02:04.140> if<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.560> over<00:02:05.159> max<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.610> protein

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
because if you just over max on protein

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.570 
because if you just over max on protein
in<00:02:07.079> your<00:02:07.320> percentages<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> day<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.310> want

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
in your percentages in the day you want

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.010 
in your percentages in the day you want
to<00:02:08.640> have<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.090> right<00:02:09.239> amount<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.599> carbs<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
to have the right amount of carbs the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.960 
to have the right amount of carbs the
right<00:02:10.140> amount<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.440> protein<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.009> fat<00:02:11.340> how<00:02:11.879> are

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
right amount of protein and fat how are

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.370 
right amount of protein and fat how are
you<00:02:12.060> gonna<00:02:12.150> know<00:02:12.239> if<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.569> have<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> perfect

how much you are putting into your body
break<00:02:48.420> them<00:02:48.570> down<00:02:48.600> carbs<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.500> protein<00:02:49.530> fat<00:02:50.190> you

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
break them down carbs to protein fat you

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.670 
break them down carbs to protein fat you
can<00:02:50.880> finally<00:02:51.150> figure<00:02:51.330> out<00:02:51.450> alright<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.500> is

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
can finally figure out alright this is

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.010 
can finally figure out alright this is
my<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.640> know<00:02:53.730> percentage<00:02:54.210> is<00:02:54.390> how<00:02:54.750> can<00:02:54.930> it

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
my you know percentage is how can it

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.260 
my you know percentage is how can it
make<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.290> better<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.740> adjust<00:02:56.190> for<00:02:56.400> weight<00:02:56.970> loss

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
make it better to adjust for weight loss
