00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.840
 Spaniards, Messi ... he's dead 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.440
 What do you do?!?! This is a prank! 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 No jokes! Portuguese don't have a sense of humor 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.200
 All you have to do is shoot a video with apologies to Messi and it must look real 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:26.000
 because if not, there are people who will not trust you, but also those who believe the justifications of some team players 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 huh? well, so try what you feel? 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.680
 Stomach pain 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.280
 pity? 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.480
 No, no, I think it's hungry 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.200
 Pepe, try it again as you look at stepping on Messi's hand 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 I never intended to step on Messi's hand because I wanted to step on his head like Juanito (Juanito, a former Real Madrid player who was involved in many skirmishes and in 1988 got a 5 year ban on deliberately stepping on Matthäus's face) 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.720
 it will be a long day 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 Pizza? They added extra tubers to it. 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:13.240
 All I want to do is defend my team and the idea of ​​hurting my opponent didn't come at all to me 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.360
 Here's the pizza, sorry, we didn't have any tubers 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.280
 Not! Once again! 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:32.800
 I apologize for the unintentional stepping on the hand of Messi, I did not want it as Captain Costa Concordia (a ship that crashed on the Italian coast on January 13, 2012) 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.800
 nieeeeeeee! cut! 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 Take this, this is what you have to say, quite simply, you just have to read it 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.120
 Pooookiiiikud iiiideee ooooooo 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 Mister, what's the capital letter? 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.340
 Incredible, we've been trying it for three hours and we have nothing 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.360
 Look, there's a red light on the camera, maybe we're gonna shoot something ... 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.080
 La mano arriba cintura sola da media vuelta danza kuduro (Danza kuduro song) 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.080
 no, turn it off now! 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:25.440
 We have nothing, nor .... ... I'm so stressed out, I need some fun! You understand? 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.840
 ooo, you're sad about what Ramos said in the locker room, hmm? 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.280
 Calm down, not everyone in the world hates you 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.480
 Not all players hate me? 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.440
 Well, all the players, but I was talking about Karank 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
