00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:09.350
 this is a feeder 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:10.879
 semi-continuous made of pvc tube 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.580
 approximately one meter long in 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:14.980
 where the channel that is the open to what 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.360
 long 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.480
 is used as a roof 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.880
 the support to have the same level and 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.820
 do not curve 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.390
 the channel is made 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.390
 is 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.990
 we arrived adapted with 2 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.360
 and hard plastic clothes hangers 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.040
 and these in turn 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.600
 they are tied to a tube 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.600
 that supports the little bit 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.480
 s 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.480
 with 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.440
 the whale is beginning to others 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.440
 pretty 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.580
 came to regret that the hen bounces her 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.540
 chicks hitting them as if 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.540
 I did not know 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.480
 and that's why the bird conduit is 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.480
 that things happen 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.470
 one 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.210
 in some mines extra conduct 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.540
 it took to appear this behavior took 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.540
 more time 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.380
 good 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.270
 in this dining room or feeding well to 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.270
 through two pvc tubes 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.740
 Then pvc tube to elbow and a 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.400
 connector 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.400
 no way 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.780
 Well the pvc storage tube 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.369
 in addition to also a meter long all 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.990
 this was about a quarter of an inch 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.990
 four inch forgiveness 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.300
 the width of the channel cut at 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.370
 long it has to be smaller than the diameter a 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.940
 the length of the diameter because the idea 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.940
 of this suitcase 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.410
 since the food 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.490
 to be let's say downloaded with the peak 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.490
 for the birds back 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.970
 returned to the same channel by the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.420
 curvature made to it in half 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.280
 Of the same 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.290
 if it does not just cut the level of 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.450
 diameter as the food would not return 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.420
 I would be more likely to eat 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.040
 in this dining room, less waste is wasted 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.180
 amount that if they were 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.650
 or almost 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.650
 since if it were a conejero 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.020
 let's say it is at level without this 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.480
 curvature 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.480
 here the food was uncovered 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:14.560
 at the level of union among all 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:18.959
 between this elbow between this elbow and the 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.959
 gutter has to be placed 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.730
 a kind of cap 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.110
 where it is open to less yet 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.480
 at half the radius 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.370
 from that circle of food input 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.459
 so that food does not go through the roof 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.650
 everything and in the channel is of little a 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.190
 little bit 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.320
 how is it happening now 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.910
 had the animals were finishing 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.010
 the food that is very close to the elbow 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.090
 that the food of the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.780
 tube 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.780
 vertical 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.099
 and these are all you know that I keep
