00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.639
 we will do together a cream 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.280
 confectioner and there you go to see it 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.509
 something very very simple the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.220
 more complicated it is almost bare but 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:20.820
 the plate we will heat the milk 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.640
 with the vanilla pod that we will have 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.119
 scratch beforehand and we will put the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.619
 half of the sugar 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.929
 because I want the sugar that is 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.940
 heavier than milk water go down 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.370
 basically and warming fashion when 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.860
 even ten heroes and that avoids me at the end 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.780
 to have a saucepan or the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.510
 hang in our turn I do not roll 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.059
 during that time you bleached it's 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.920
 egg yolk then whitewash its judges 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.390
 mix and egg yolks do not like 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.960
 too much contact with the sugar so we 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.030
 stir us to melt the sugar the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.710
 game add cornstarch have he 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.140
 there are people too because jafari me I 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.980
 prefers to add starch because 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.840
 I think it makes pastry creams 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.489
 they are better 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.470
 my milk was ambitious and we are going to 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.680
 gradually pour while whisking 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.500
 this is me slowly you see that basically 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.100
 from the union in the early sugar on there 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.170
 is going slowly after month the totality 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.430
 here I am very very noisy we have 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.100
 practically with a marker that ends 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.630
 the land of fire and there you leave the NATO 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.770
 in life in absorbing milk in 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.119
 does if you want the starch grains it 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.340
 will crack at some 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.640
 temperature he absorbed six times his 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.860
 weight 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.600
 and if you leave him no time to 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.350
 grow six times you will have 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.909
 lumps 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.040
 we will make her heart cream 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.490
 pastry cook that's cooked we're going to wear it 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.500
 to boiling 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.960
 we're going to have the cup one to two minutes in 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.119
 stirring constantly because that's it 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.010
 really it cooks starch not really 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.600
 this taste 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.130
 really different from like a sauce 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.380
 bechamel bechamel sauce is going to boil 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.590
 media dying to remove this Buddha 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.960
 video is very important that my cream 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.730
 pastry chef and is finished a little secret a 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.770
 every little bit of salt is a 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.760
 flavor enhancer and if you're after 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.440
 really very greedy you can put 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.720
 also a little bit of raw butter 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.150
 who will melt and who will look at this pretty 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.220
 shot of raw butter we see here put it 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.990
 in a movie dish is assassin problems 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.250
 of hygiene who also appreciates hyper 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.260
 practice is here we put the film back 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.810
 here is called finished at the touch it got me 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.660
 avoided some roads and leave it from there 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.090
 we will put in the refrigerator 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.420
 and then we let cool you're going to do 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:37.770
 the plunge and then you 'll say what 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:37.770
