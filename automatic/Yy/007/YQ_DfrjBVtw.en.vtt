00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.170
 mostly people we are here on the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.210
 channel and not in any game and 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.340
 Although it is here so starting point for 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.500
 every video something with that 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.260
 desktop has to do or so and this time 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.130
 it's about the nice shooting program 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.859
 openbroadcast here you see it 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.990
 small windows where in the channel on me me 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.679
 shut up or I'm the one 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.770
 Website 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.750
 and this is about me here 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.430
 What I 'm looking for is not mine 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.390
 game 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.450
 So sometimes it actually brings only 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.920
 minecraft to jerk the extorre and 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.750
 if I'm not good now and then 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.610
 I thought okay look what the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.260
 other youtubers have and so on 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.750
 get out openbroadcast is far 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.670
 spreads and goes in this 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.100
 actually, streaming program 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.579
 because you can stream if you can 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.890
 want 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.199
 I can not stop the austria now 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.789
 Click but otherwise I could you 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.019
 show how to do that when I am now 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.990
 somehow still different the screen 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.670
 I can not record that though 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.619
 launches her gave you the program here 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.080
 there is nothing in there is scene and 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.350
 everything else is out so i start i 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.500
 then it's easy to record 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.840
 stay up here settings 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.759
 there you go and make you 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.590
 any profile i ever do 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.759
 So here's some attitude 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.530
 profile goes by the name and clicks okay 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.299
 then you have the coding here so 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.280
 from the video first time since I have 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.380
 I use him constant bitrate 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.869
 let quality eight that's okay that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.570
 yes remains the kopal expanded and 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.350
 a bitrate I got it on 10,000 times 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.200
 that was okay the 14,000 you too 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.850
 good that other standard have been with me 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.110
 So that's what I have left otherwise 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.630
 It could also be the appropriate 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.979
 change if you like it then 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.840
 I made the broadcaster setting 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.610
 and it's important to her here in the mode 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.729
 So not live stream but only file 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.469
 output then as a file path just where 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.820
 you wanted to save the videos and 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.479
 you can still start at the and 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.849
 to stop 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.649
 then select a particular button 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.680
 he clicks on ok again and if you 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.450
 just as the window changes 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.570
 jones yes you want the settings 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.430
 save then you do that quickly 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.610
 here again video from a video card 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.230
 if not the ghosts to minecraft enough 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.660
 and for many other games too 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.400
 who has little money so I believe 80 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.260
 euro or something like that 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.760
 audio quality get I now 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.990
 also standard because I just left 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.370
 Look down there I have as 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.710
 standard devices first here my 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.540
 Logitech microphone and of course the 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.740
 logitech speakers so there is more 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.770
 not really to say 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.630
 I let the other pomp the outside 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.640
 days display in any case shit 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:02.580
 down here and in minutes I can 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.290
 on the microphone itself then yes here 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.110
 I have not expanded yet 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.240
 wrapped up wants to leave everything so synonymous 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.880
 It is very complicated with me 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.120
 works so well the rough 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.330
 Playful with mails and it is enough 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.620
 So not so good attitude 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.690
 We made it so far but how can I get there 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.390
 now to take on because if you 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.920
 start streaming now click or 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.040
 also the bag you have set at 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.180
 me 7 on the keyboard then comes 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.100
 not easy you click here 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.560
 monitor recording so i do that 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.260
 namely always and when I go to 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.060
 for example minecraft open now 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.500
 you see times minecraft reimbursed loud 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.850
 I know I have slow internet 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.310
 therefore needs a little 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.920
 and if i maximize the game here 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.870
 then I would just have to on the 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.940
 10 press the keypad number 7 and 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.860
 I would take that up now 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.060
 do here so I like now holding the 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.040
 small windows and adjoining 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.680
 open broadcast and their domain screen 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.560
 It's easy to see what has to be done 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.990
 not necessarily so for that reason 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.620
 this is a certain attitude 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.080
 already important more is not too 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.760
 say if you find out like this 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.350
 with window recordings and closes if you 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.940
 I like to write that I am satisfied 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.830
 with the monitor recording because I completely 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.530
 Well, you can do that too 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.880
 Microphone quieter may regulate 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.720
 I've just become quiet now 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.150
 Now I'm loud again here you can 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.100
 the sound of your pc quieter and people 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.270
 I would do the rest and I would 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.260
 let the fingers of it because so 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.230
 it works fine 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.030
 you do not want to know now twitter 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.470
 Stream would have the settings and 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.840
 Maybe make a recruitment profile 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.250
 stream then goes if the broadcaster 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.730
 settings and makes up here the 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.230
 mode on live stream and on here 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.300
 show it very briefly then you can do it 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.730
 Select the streaming platforms 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.320
 must also specify the server that 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.870
 will you find out everything if you are 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.700
 you can stream you the stream 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.380
 Delay in seconds so enter 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.380
 how far the video is delayed that 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.960
 the people, for example, not in black 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.860
 ops know where he stands 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.950
 us w we stay at file issue and 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.390
 break is here and yes so far 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.130
 as good as you have now I believe 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.830
 mitgekriegt like that with openbroadcast 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.240
 works with broadcaster I have 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.710
 Here are my old extorre 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.600
 order where the videos then stop in it 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.530
 land like for example that here what 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.280
 we are just recording 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.750
 and the bigger this bitrate is with 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.570
 the bigger the one gets 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.190
 video file the raw material but who good 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.560
 of course that should go high 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.150
 Keep that fun when you guys 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.570
 Try yourself if you start yourself 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.320
 wanted to display and always nice what 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.870
 kilos remember that 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.640
 while I just told the etf how 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.490
 so you record well if you do that 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:56.030
 video is in the morning in the evening at noon 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.950
 whenever you do, you'll be fine 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.510
 I go, I hope hope you have also 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.820
 into the other videos purely and yes 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.820
 that's why joller max is then
