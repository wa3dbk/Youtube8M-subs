00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
in there so I pretty much know where to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.720 
in there so I pretty much know where to
keep<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.560> chip<00:02:15.769> at<00:02:17.769> if<00:02:18.769> not<00:02:19.099> you'll<00:02:19.400> touch

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
keep the chip at if not you'll touch

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.160 
keep the chip at if not you'll touch
something<00:02:20.090> else<00:02:20.239> on<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.510> board<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.019> can

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
something else on the board and you can

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.650 
something else on the board and you can
really<00:02:21.349> short<00:02:21.620> circuit<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.069> whole<00:02:22.220> system<00:02:22.660> so

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
really short circuit the whole system so

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.030 
really short circuit the whole system so
just<00:02:23.959> be<00:02:24.080> careful<00:02:24.290> when<00:02:24.620> you're<00:02:24.709> messing<00:02:25.010> with

just be careful when you're messing with
your<00:02:25.250> chips<00:02:25.489> make<00:02:25.790> sure<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.000> don't<00:02:26.120> have<00:02:26.269> your

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
your chips make sure you don't have your

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
power connected to it that way you don't

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.490 
power connected to it that way you don't
mess<00:02:28.040> anything<00:02:28.190> up<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:30.230> meal<00:02:32.290> make<00:02:33.290> sure<00:02:33.319> to
