Hi everyone! I hope you're good! :D

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.120
I'll show you how i made shopping bags for dolls! :D

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.040
we draw the pattern of a bag on cardboard

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.360
The two circles are the handles

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.860
The shape of the bag on the middle

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.320
we fold here

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.980
we fold the dotted lines to make the sides of the bag

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.600
We draw the shape according to the style we want to create

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.360
We can glue ribbon, lace, bracelets, chains, etc, to make the handles

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.540
we cut the pattern

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.760
i'll use a cutter to cut the handles

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.120
if you are a child please ask an aduld for help if you use a cutter

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.620
we'll fold here

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.900
we choose a paper to make our bags ^^

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.680
we can use gift wrap, origami paper, etc

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.140
we put the pattern on the back of the paper

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.120
and we draw around it to have the pattern on the paper

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.200
We don't forget to fold here to draw the side's lines

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.940
we draw the bottom of the bag

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We cut

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.140
we can cover our bag with scotch

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.340
or varnish our bag with modpodge or lacquer for paper

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.860
like this varnish for instance

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.200
to protect our bag and give it a nice glazed effect

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.580
we fold

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.920
We glue the sides

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.500
We can flatten the bag as we do with a shopping bag

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:30.360
we can make a square or recangular bag and make the handles with ribbon, chains, etc

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.680
and we can customise them with accessories (stickers, pendants, etc)

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.880
Now it's your turn to make your own shopping bags! :D

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.500
Thank you for waching :)

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.260

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.660

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.660
Have a nice day! ;)
