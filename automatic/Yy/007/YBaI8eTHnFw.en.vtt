00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
one-third of the reason having no idea

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.000 
one-third of the reason having no idea
what<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> put<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.940> another<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:22.050> know<00:02:22.110> third<00:02:22.770> or

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
what a put is another you know third or

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
what a put is another you know third or
so<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:25.370> that's<00:02:26.370> all<00:02:26.520> i<00:02:26.550> can<00:02:26.730> think<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.970> right
