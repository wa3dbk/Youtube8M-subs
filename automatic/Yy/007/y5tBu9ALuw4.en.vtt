00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.420
 Talking about youtube beauty hafeez 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.240
 here speaking and in the video of today bringing 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.670
 for you another black ops gameplay 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.160
 2 and in today's video wanted to bring a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.170
 a little different mode a 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.890
 modality including of which I am not 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.230
 accustomed to playing that is the modality 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.949
 hardcore or extreme as it is 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.540
 written in Portuguese is a modality 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.309
 me somewhat different 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.770
 As I mentioned, it is not customary for 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.440
 play I played this mode a little 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.870
 including the previous colors from the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.110
 coi season 5 but is a mode 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.180
 who helped me a lot here in the black ops 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.140
 two mainly on the issue of 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.180
 challengers 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.030
 I was supposed to do some 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.719
 charles is short of catch 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.730
 the diamond camouflage and the modality 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.530
 hardcore is the extreme mode was 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.170
 a modality that helped me a lot 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.100
 get to watch before you 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.229
 hitting the opponent is much simpler 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.890
 the amount of bullet that is expended is 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.110
 much smaller and consequently a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.520
 A little easier just that, huh? 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.009
 how are you maicon 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.400
 just as it is easier to kill is more 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.579
 easy to die then the campera gem is bigger 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.659
 the strategic game tactical game is bigger 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.689
 but you can have fun cool to give 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.240
 to play cool I recommend you there the day 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.880
 that you're in a little stressed 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.460
 to leave have not had much in order to 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.310
 get nervous and want to play something 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.159
 different young the modality is hardcore 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.530
 or extreme is very good worth a lot to 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.210
 Too bad, I was playing with a friend of mine. 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.360
 of the clan 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.200
 brs tom and we had a lot of fun 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.930
 I made a freight until reasonable in the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.329
 in my view in my point of view 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.350
 view is I thought I played until 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.619
 cool 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.840
 at least from the middle of the game 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.100
 that at first I think that I took 45 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.310
 followed 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.050
 but then it was a little chicken 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.950
 until it is cool that determines from 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.880
 29/9 and I think it was really cool I 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.040
 liked it 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.680
 That's why I decided to bring it. 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.420
 this mode brings a gameplay of 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.510
 Hardcore here for you exactly 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.690
 even to tell you guys you have 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.150
 interest in playing if you want to change 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.880
 a little game style is there 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.040
 the ideal mode for you have changed 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.280
 bit gives a stressed tip and 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.500
 spend a little less nervous and think 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.420
 which is this is what I wanted to bring 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.460
 In today's video for you, the video is already 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.470
 very short that did not give even five 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.160
 minutes gave a little four minutes 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:04.350
 this sequence went 123 was everyone 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.270
 and it was pretty cool, cool bag 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.830
 so this is it personal short video 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.520
