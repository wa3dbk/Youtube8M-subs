00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.019
 and we come out to the last video 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.730
 the jacket on week in the last five 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.500
 I have Japanese games on you 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.669
 ok it will show what is there 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.470
 better than a week in Japan 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.869
 complete as a star and over 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.099
 Japanese advertising 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.509
 what the first click is about 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.160
 not quite as easy to see through 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.869
 or subtitles, it's harder 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.529
 make sense to see it but make your own 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.529
 own opinion to it 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.010
 league 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.840
 ok come analysis has perhaps 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.160
 something to do with battery that the battery 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.260
 is empty and then the people come 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.850
 he ran for some power 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.380
 maybe continue to use in henley 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.580
 can 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.010
 I have no idea in any case 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.680
 For example, hero epic produces the seco 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.480
 flies with slow motion the guy is swinging 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.610
 About the only thing not the thing yet 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.610
 could do better have exploded 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.490
 the first clip shows something like that 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.330
 Japanese pint rest with a pretty 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.330
 cool beat music 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.620
 you've been really hot on 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.270
 a few grilled and so much 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.890
 cravings that will be done right away 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.890
 had something for you 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.939
 interesting as it is in the first quarter 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.829
 a typical friendly represents where 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.689
 two women talk about eating 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.640
 And with funny music, it accompanies 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:33.370
 the extent is has pressed button is allowed 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:33.370
 said the cancer 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.849
 connect this whole advertising long 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.430
 it was not about a lte connection 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.069
 a super instant death metal nice 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:54.049
 grill machine quasi highspeed internet 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.700
 and high speed is bad if its yours 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.500
 Advertising should be where your cup 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.970
 just have to sell like this would 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.560
 Advertising will likely look like 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.629
 where he's doing in kettle where you are 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.400
 hot water in the rhine tilt and how 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.170
 Slowly turn the noodle out of the mug 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.170
 and 70 is a clichÃ© of an application 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.109
 it is not about any wear 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.840
 or business men or any 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.670
 people are maple on the no that 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.930
 are only sold in the mistaken I 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.180
 my japan is famous for its 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.620
 pretty wacky advertising but this one 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.209
 clip has only been in the last six 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.040
 seconds made sense where it is about noodles 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.500
 Everything went before it was somehow 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.359
 nonsense there it went in the kielwasser 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.650
 bullet will be max appeal for so long in 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.239
 not that mug sumo 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.760
 I've fallen for ringer too 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.470
 So no problem the next clip 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.310
 Let's put it in the category again 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.310
 work on 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.610
 this in itself is nothing 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.320
 unspectacular in parka nothing too 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.300
 sell or promote one show 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.070
 Trucks maybe we will distribute a lot of load 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.690
 but since I show here we just go 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.470
 a mobile woman the shanti or 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.360
 should represent 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.370
 I'm the only one with this 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.390
 pulls crane off to think of something else 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.160
 and that was it with the 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.780
 third part of japanese advertising 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.130
 gamestage here you come to the clips 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.780

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.760

 Go sea floss klop if you have one 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.380
 to create advertising 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.800
 and the next clip shows 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.800
