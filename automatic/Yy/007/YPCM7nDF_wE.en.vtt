other than that I mean the one rear hub

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.690 
other than that I mean the one rear hub
is<00:03:41.940> pretty<00:03:42.180> good<00:03:42.390> oh<00:03:45.380> now<00:03:46.380> it's<00:03:47.250> hard<00:03:47.459> for<00:03:47.580> me

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
is pretty good oh now it's hard for me

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.850 
is pretty good oh now it's hard for me
to<00:03:47.790> do<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.030> while<00:03:48.209> across<00:03:48.420> sitting<00:03:48.840> down<00:03:49.049> needs

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
to do it while across sitting down needs

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.300 
to do it while across sitting down needs
work<00:03:50.819> axle<00:03:51.450> bearings<00:03:51.920> that<00:03:52.920> hub<00:03:53.099> needs

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
work axle bearings that hub needs

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.900 
work axle bearings that hub needs
tighten<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:54.709> probably<00:03:55.709> need<00:03:56.069> pads<00:03:56.340> all<00:03:56.640> around

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910

for<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.239> brakes<00:03:57.510> I've<00:03:57.810> imagined<00:03:58.519> dunno<00:03:59.519> if

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
for the brakes I've imagined dunno if

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.780 
for the brakes I've imagined dunno if
it's<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.849> necessity<00:04:00.000> right<00:04:00.510> now<00:04:00.690> but<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:00.989> might

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
it's a necessity right now but it might

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.640 
it's a necessity right now but it might
the<00:04:02.790> nerf<00:04:03.030> bars<00:04:03.299> are<00:04:03.480> loose<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:04.019> really<00:04:04.380> tight
