just go with tuck actually not even

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.490 
just go with tuck actually not even
toxic<00:01:38.759> cuz<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.090> mean<00:01:39.210> you're<00:01:39.360> using<00:01:39.479> spork<00:01:39.990> so

toxic cuz I mean you're using spork so

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.260 
toxic cuz I mean you're using spork so
the<00:01:40.619> good<00:01:40.710> thing<00:01:40.920> about<00:01:41.250> pair<00:01:41.640> sect<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.150> is

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the good thing about pair sect is it is

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.090 
the good thing about pair sect is it is
one<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> few<00:01:42.750> spore<00:01:43.140> Pokemon<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> game

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
one of a few spore Pokemon in the game

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.030 
one of a few spore Pokemon in the game
so<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.060> does<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.450> 100%<00:01:46.320> accuracy<00:01:46.710> put

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
so it does have that 100% accuracy put

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.440 
so it does have that 100% accuracy put
you<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.250> sleep<00:01:47.369> move<00:01:47.640> but<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:47.970> top<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.329> that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
you to sleep move but on top of that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.740 
you to sleep move but on top of that
it's<00:01:49.320> kind<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.590> lacking<00:01:49.770> um<00:01:50.540> so<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.600> do<00:01:51.720> have

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
it's kind of lacking um so you do have

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.810 
it's kind of lacking um so you do have
those<00:01:52.229> kind<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> options<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.189> protect

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
those kind of options you can protect

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.760 
those kind of options you can protect
here<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.210> was<00:01:54.600> looking<00:01:54.930> into<00:01:55.140> personally

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
here I was looking into personally

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.160 
here I was looking into personally
having<00:01:56.219> roto<00:01:56.579> tiller<00:01:56.990> rototiller<00:01:57.990> is

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
having roto tiller rototiller is

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.440 
having roto tiller rototiller is
interesting<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.799> me<00:01:58.920> because<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.490> raised<00:02:00.329> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
interesting to me because it raised a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.330 
interesting to me because it raised a
special<00:02:00.750> attack<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.290> attack<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.920> all<00:02:02.100> grass

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
special attack and attack of all grass

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.920 
special attack and attack of all grass
type<00:02:02.579> Pokemon<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.969> was<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:03.210> what<00:02:03.659> if<00:02:03.750> there's

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
type Pokemon I was like what if there's

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.929 
type Pokemon I was like what if there's
grassy<00:02:04.290> terrain<00:02:04.560> roto<00:02:05.040> tiller<00:02:05.280> synergy

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
grassy terrain roto tiller synergy

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:06.709 
grassy terrain roto tiller synergy
that'd<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.329> cool

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
that'd be cool

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.540 
that'd be cool
I've<00:02:07.049> been<00:02:07.170> finding<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.500> hat<00:02:07.649> I've<00:02:08.160> been<00:02:08.340> having

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
I've been finding a hat I've been having

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.680 
I've been finding a hat I've been having
a<00:02:08.580> hard<00:02:08.759> time<00:02:08.789> trying<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.270> use

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
a hard time trying to use

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.660 
a hard time trying to use
because<00:02:09.990> it's<00:02:10.110> not<00:02:10.260> a<00:02:10.290> very<00:02:10.380> fast<00:02:10.860> kind<00:02:11.580> of

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
because it's not a very fast kind of

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.700 
because it's not a very fast kind of
setup<00:02:11.850> strategy<00:02:12.360> but<00:02:12.690> was<00:02:12.960> thinking<00:02:13.380> with<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
setup strategy but was thinking with the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.070 
setup strategy but was thinking with the
dry<00:02:13.890> skin<00:02:13.950> rototiller<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.940> synergizes<00:02:15.840> very

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
dry skin rototiller it synergizes very

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.840 
dry skin rototiller it synergizes very
well<00:02:16.260> with<00:02:16.530> Ludicolo<00:02:16.950> instead<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.670> brain

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
well with Ludicolo instead of brain

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.460 
well with Ludicolo instead of brain
dance<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.210> that<00:02:18.330> first<00:02:18.570> turn<00:02:18.750> try<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.260> get<00:02:19.440> a

and just go to full health while using
roto<00:02:35.790> tiller<00:02:36.060> then<00:02:36.720> Ludo<00:02:36.960> Ludicolo<00:02:37.560> get<00:02:37.920> some

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
roto tiller then Ludo Ludicolo get some

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.920 
roto tiller then Ludo Ludicolo get some
extra<00:02:38.310> surf<00:02:38.550> damage<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.240> then<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.630> can<00:02:39.780> try

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
extra surf damage and then you can try

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.450 
extra surf damage and then you can try
to<00:02:39.960> make<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.260> work<00:02:40.380> from<00:02:40.590> there<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.950> was<00:02:41.310> think

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
to make it work from there I was think

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.850 
to make it work from there I was think
you<00:02:41.550> can<00:02:41.730> put<00:02:41.880> Swift<00:02:42.210> swim<00:02:42.390> ran<00:02:43.020> dish<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.470> a

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
you can put Swift swim ran dish is a

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.100 
you can put Swift swim ran dish is a
really<00:02:44.610> good<00:02:44.760> idea<00:02:44.850> on<00:02:45.270> Ludicolo<00:02:45.660> because<00:02:45.960> the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
really good idea on Ludicolo because the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.230 
really good idea on Ludicolo because the
sustain<00:02:46.530> but<00:02:47.190> overall<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.730> sinking<00:02:48.000> Swift

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
sustain but overall the sinking Swift

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.730 
sustain but overall the sinking Swift
swim<00:02:48.420> could<00:02:48.630> work<00:02:48.810> because<00:02:49.140> your<00:02:49.260> are<00:02:49.440> getting

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
swim could work because your are getting

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.140 
swim could work because your are getting
good<00:02:49.890> amount<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.220> those<00:02:50.370> feet<00:02:50.670> without<00:02:51.000> the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
good amount of those feet without the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.480 
good amount of those feet without the
investment<00:02:51.420> means<00:02:52.230> fast<00:02:52.530> serve<00:02:52.770> maybe<00:02:53.220> some

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
investment means fast serve maybe some

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.730 
investment means fast serve maybe some
fast<00:02:53.730> hits<00:02:53.970> that's<00:02:54.960> all<00:02:55.200> I've<00:02:55.350> got<00:02:55.380> though

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
fast hits that's all I've got though

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.440 
fast hits that's all I've got though

that's fairly tanky or you can just put
it<00:03:02.520> next<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.790> Ludicolo<00:03:03.210> try<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.630> exploit<00:03:03.960> the

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
it next to Ludicolo try to exploit the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.260 
it next to Ludicolo try to exploit the
dry<00:03:04.290> skin<00:03:04.350> substitute<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.400> then<00:03:05.970> get<00:03:06.150> it

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
dry skin substitute and then get it

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.360 
dry skin substitute and then get it
spore<00:03:06.570> going<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.050> couldn't<00:03:07.920> see<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.130> spore

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
spore going I couldn't see the spore

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.460 
spore going I couldn't see the spore
being<00:03:08.580> pretty<00:03:08.790> good<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:09.210> double-teaming<00:03:10.140> art

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
being pretty good in double-teaming art

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.260 
being pretty good in double-teaming art
that's<00:03:10.860> always<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.220> tricky<00:03:11.640> room<00:03:11.820> because<00:03:12.150> you

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
that's always a tricky room because you

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.720 
that's always a tricky room because you
do<00:03:12.390> have<00:03:12.540> like<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.900> really<00:03:13.320> fast<00:03:13.680> spore<00:03:14.459> at<00:03:14.580> that

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
do have like a really fast spore at that

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.490 
do have like a really fast spore at that
point<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.510> can<00:03:15.660> use<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.959> like<00:03:16.050> that<00:03:16.230> but

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
point so you can use it like that but

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.199 
point so you can use it like that but
overall<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.220> seems<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.610> mungus<00:03:18.000> does<00:03:18.180> a

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
overall it seems like a mungus does a

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.680 
overall it seems like a mungus does a
paris<00:03:18.630> ex<00:03:18.810> job<00:03:19.020> better<00:03:19.380> overall<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.420> if<00:03:21.420> you

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
paris ex job better overall and if you

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.750 
paris ex job better overall and if you
want<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:21.989> just<00:03:22.110> try<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.350> get<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:22.920> going<00:03:23.130> yeah
