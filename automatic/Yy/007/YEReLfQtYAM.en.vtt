00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 to roberto martÃ­nez announcing the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.259
 concert that I expected so much and that 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.000
 will perform at the national stadium 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.000
 This May 24 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.340
 Santa Rosa 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.400
 but what do we ask about that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.189
 blonde profile was photographed her 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.189
 remember if I'm working over there 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.210
 but calmly he will comment now to your 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.700
 colleagues that I venture to say 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.850
 that is to say that I am that our audio 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.230
 I prefer to keep it for myself because 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.690
 because then what happens to me happens 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.550
 it's usually not something to someone who 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.250
 there connects me relate me and then 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.559
 not a single one and I took it back today 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.000
 threatens me 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.059
 we ended up scoring and from the bottle 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.239
 10,000 cases say I 'll do the one for you 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.890
 your boss and keep it private I'll 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.890
 I can ask a couple of things 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:17.740
 for one 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.740
 exact 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.380
 changing the subject we remember together 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.539
 when roberto sat on the value of 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.880
 the truth and was named janet barboza 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.850
 that at that time I was with Jean Paul 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.930
 strauss subsequently the singer 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.350
 angered 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.770
 but his sweetheart Jean Paul Strauss pulled out 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.710
 the claws and teeth before this and this 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.380
 that you feel at the national level to say 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.570
 because I had a fierce I had a grip with 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.400
 a so-and-so is no longer a joke 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.290
 then I feel that he goes out of step and 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.060
 obviously this creates reactions and 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.909
 the reaction of jean paul so kisses then 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.310
 because it has bothered him 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.149
 now that the time has passed to think 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.250
 to Roberto because of an insult and he's 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.850
 While it is not about power and advocate 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.610
 for insulting and putting his power and back 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.390
 but 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.090
 but it's fine or he reacted as 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.090
 couple of her that felt felt 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.430
 offended no no I do not have anything that 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.650
 say as I tell you about it I'm not 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.629
 who stops to 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.099
 to comment on a topic of couples that 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.430
 is but as I say it is solved of the 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.719
 The best way is usually hard 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.730
 that is with his statements with that 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:37.120
 normally hard do not be crushed mine or 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.329
 with just reason at the time I think I 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.249
 so he thought no but I do not have 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.469
 I do not have anything, the opposite is 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:47.450
 the natural reaction of a person who 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:49.609
 feels that they offend their partner for that 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.200
 side if I do not understand why that's always 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:54.170
 has answered and that's why now 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.819
 I'm not going to lend myself to giancarlo either 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.739
 to say something bad about him because in 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.510
 truth is a delicate situation gave 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.980
 people who have to solve their 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.430
 issues and that I really hope that what 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.430
 solve
