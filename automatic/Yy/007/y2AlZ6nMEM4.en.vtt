automatically<00:03:03.570> created<00:03:04.340> watch<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.489> demo<00:03:05.820> we

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
automatically created watch this demo we

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.729 
automatically created watch this demo we
have<00:03:06.420> taken<00:03:06.690> some<00:03:06.810> screenshots<00:03:07.140> from<00:03:07.530> our

have taken some screenshots from our

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.710 
have taken some screenshots from our
software<00:03:08.989> so<00:03:09.989> this<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.070> sheet<00:03:11.760> which<00:03:12.450> you

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
software so this is the sheet which you

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.900 
software so this is the sheet which you
saw<00:03:12.959> just<00:03:13.170> now<00:03:13.230> only<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.100> difference<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.640> that

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
saw just now only the difference is that

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.810 
saw just now only the difference is that
we<00:03:15.330> have<00:03:15.450> put<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.660> date<00:03:15.959> here<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:17.400> can<00:03:17.580> see<00:03:17.790> a

dates of the tasks are ready so this is
actually<00:03:34.530> based<00:03:34.650> on<00:03:34.860> four<00:03:35.130> kind<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.430> cycles

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
actually based on four kind of cycles

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.460 
actually based on four kind of cycles
which<00:03:36.000> are<00:03:36.120> planned<00:03:36.360> here<00:03:36.600> machinery
