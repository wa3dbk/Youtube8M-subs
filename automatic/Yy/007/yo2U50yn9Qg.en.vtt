00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
because it was so early and I was flying

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.469 
because it was so early and I was flying
in<00:01:45.450> from<00:01:45.630> California<00:01:46.399> but<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.880> ended<00:01:48.149> up<00:01:48.240> being

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
in from California but it ended up being

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.330

students<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.680> was<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.129> was<00:02:23.280> every

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
students it was it was every

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.790 
students it was it was every

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
and the interview day for me just kind

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.670 
and the interview day for me just kind
of<00:02:25.950> sealed<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.970> deal<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.720> was<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.410> was<00:02:28.440> the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
of sealed the deal and it was it was the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.420 
of sealed the deal and it was it was the
best<00:02:29.150> aspects<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.300> think<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.530> application

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
best aspects I think of the application

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.740 
best aspects I think of the application
cycle<00:02:32.610> because<00:02:32.880> everything<00:02:33.239> in<00:02:33.360> during<00:02:33.690> the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
cycle because everything in during the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.440 
cycle because everything in during the
application<00:02:33.840> cycle<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.819> really<00:02:35.819> hectic<00:02:36.000> and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
application cycle is really hectic and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.290 
application cycle is really hectic and
you<00:02:36.540> can't<00:02:37.050> really<00:02:37.200> control<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.620> but<00:02:38.340> when<00:02:39.209> you

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
you can't really control it but when you

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.340 
you can't really control it but when you
actually<00:02:39.450> show<00:02:39.690> up<00:02:39.780> at<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.989> school<00:02:40.110> and

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
actually show up at the school and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.570 
actually show up at the school and
realize<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.190> where<00:02:41.430> you're<00:02:41.520> gonna

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
realize that this is where you're gonna

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.030 
realize that this is where you're gonna
be<00:02:41.700> for<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.090> next<00:02:42.209> at<00:02:42.720> least<00:02:42.780> four<00:02:43.140> years<00:02:43.170> it's

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
be for the next at least four years it's

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.520 
be for the next at least four years it's
it's<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.640> great<00:02:44.819> experience<00:02:45.260> when<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.319> came<00:02:46.380> to

started out at Oakland University and I

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.870 
started out at Oakland University and I

remember them walking us through the

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.760 
remember them walking us through the
curriculum<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:37.570> that's<00:04:37.870> honestly<00:04:38.500> where<00:04:38.740> I

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
curriculum and that's honestly where I

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.770 
curriculum and that's honestly where I
started<00:04:39.280> becoming<00:04:39.640> super<00:04:40.090> inquisitive

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
started becoming super inquisitive

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.410 
started becoming super inquisitive
because<00:04:41.260> I<00:04:41.650> realized<00:04:42.460> that<00:04:42.820> this<00:04:43.120> curriculum

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
because I realized that this curriculum

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.020 
because I realized that this curriculum
is<00:04:43.870> not<00:04:43.960> like<00:04:44.800> most<00:04:45.160> other<00:04:45.370> schools<00:04:45.790> that<00:04:45.880> I

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
is not like most other schools that I

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.200 
is not like most other schools that I
had<00:04:46.060> applied<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:47.230> first<00:04:47.470> hour<00:04:48.310> of<00:04:48.670> being
