00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.760
 and that 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.220
 good to walk with us 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.530
 and I'm about to make some delicious 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.750
 Breads milestones to accompany my eggs 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.360
 they are spectacular they are like clouds 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.040
 and you're already in the oven 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.160
 small rolls very easy bread 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.410
 make very rich and then make yourself more 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.510
 flaneras really the name are pop 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.760
 over they are called pop covers and they are very 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.650
 Americans and they are made in these molds 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.570
 that you have here at home 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.910
 lady do it 's way if you're going to 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.170
 stay the same for that we put them 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.440
 lemon rolls 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.960
 I'm taking out zest 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.940
 because I want them to have a flavor 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.550
 little acid to counteract the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.980
 flavor of the egg we are like something 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.710
 acid and I want you to really know to 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.110
 lemon and I'm doing it the best 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.290
 way is to have a grater cited as 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.940
 this and if you are one this 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.490
 grater that has cheese in new 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.670
 side parts there has to grate 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:15.640
 for citrus zest 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.159
 and I come to see this that is the stem 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.180
 and to have a much better taste than 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.180
 chop it finely 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.380
 here we are stinging and I do not want to leave it 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.440
 long I will tell you why if we leave 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.880
 long could when one bites the bread 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.980
 success could be confused with a 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.780
 horse and is very unpleasant people 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.730
 he does not know he is not eating and there is no 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.660
 nothing more unpleasant than a little horse 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.730
 in the soup is good how rich we 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.660
 We are hard-line and it is very easy to 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.100
 do I'm going to put all the 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.100
 all ingredients that are milk 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.260
 it's egg 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.880
 egg cream a spatula 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.080
 this to work backwards is very 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.810
 funny 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.780
 but my dear pepillo wants to see the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.489
 blender then here I am demonstrating 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.520
 the blender 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.750
 we need water 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.310
 we need a pinch of salt 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.239
 you look for 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.239
 Pepper 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.500
 the zest 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:38.080
 and here I have more zest 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.099
 pick up my table and we're three quarters 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.099
 flour rates 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.159
 let's mix everything and I'm going to preheat 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.810
 the oven at 350 degrees fahrenheit 180 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.250
 centigrade I have my planets already 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.250
 previously greased 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.920
 I will take advantage to clean my table in 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.210
 work surface I love doing it the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.970
 I really have here ready 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.800
 ingredients 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.350
 the knives as we always say 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.500
 they always go outside the sink 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.150
 so as not to cut us 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.150
 we are ready to see how it is 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.909
 until when will I continue to beat anything 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.400
 more until foam comes out nothing more 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.140
 I exaggerate in what he estimates to be 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.240
 ready for the gabon 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.040
 the table if it is rigid if it is very light 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.860
 much more vigilance than the consistency of 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.300
 a mix of foster's but I need 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.520
 integral is ready air that is 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.010
 important for laying for these 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.840
 gaps for these gaps then it is 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.230
 rich that the thing that we're going to take this 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.090
 delicious many people filled them with 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.640
 more worms as well as coming out of the oven 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.940
 but it 's because they go very fast in the 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.940
 oven 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.460
 to burst 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.170
 starting to have smoking 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.840
 and meters I will see the oven because in the 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.970
 oven we have our eggs 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.780
 I would like you to please take nothing 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.780
 more than delight 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.750
 Wow 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.220
 in parents well also much better 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.930
 the truth is so delicious about four 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.400
 minutes will be ready and my 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.989
 parents also call be ready now 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.300
 I have some ready for the presentation 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.310
 final 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.310
 we can see how it already has foam 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.210
 and it 's ready I'm going to remove this from here 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.210
 and good 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.180
 fill in three quarters of your 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.889
 capacity 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.889
 each of the molds 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.690
 and I am very happy with this section 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.720
 how good there are people who do not like 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.810
 a lot but no way for you to have runs 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.510
 and he will not pay you then if he has 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.460

 other than just music 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.810
 so they are not being denounced because 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.000
 it grieves me more than you wanted the 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.729
 true that nothing I sent a greeting 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.220

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.370
