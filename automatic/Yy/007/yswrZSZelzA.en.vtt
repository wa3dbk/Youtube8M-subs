sure<00:00:18.750> if<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.930> had<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> lot<00:00:19.230> more<00:00:19.289> time<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.650> would<00:00:20.100> be

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
sure if I had a lot more time I would be

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.470 
sure if I had a lot more time I would be
able<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.520> figure<00:00:20.670> out<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> song<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.359> that

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480
