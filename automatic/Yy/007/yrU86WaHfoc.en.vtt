00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.790
 hi guys and compass and welcome to 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.149
 another new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.820
 title new images from the version of 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.279
 big car computer 5 ok 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.279
 you will know that we are only 6 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:19.250
 days of the expected launch of large 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.530
 5 cars on the computer and it's already 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.660
 being able to pre download the game in 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.730
 estimated that but more than anything rock star 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.039
 has shown some pictures of what is going to 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.110
 be this release and the truth is that 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.660
 it's pretty good not since this big 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.660
 computer auto 5 will allow a 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.720
 resolution of 4k that would be like a thousand more 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.739
 of thousand 80 and you will also find yourself at 60 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:46.010
 fps is ok and obviously it will be at 1080p with 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.320
 a greater drawing distance than this 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.050
 will allow it to look much better at 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.149
 away or as close as the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.250
 consoles do not and the truth is that it's something 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.719
 good since you can remember from 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.640
 that if we go to the top of the mountain 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.800
 exile and we look down we do not know 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.379
 you will see everything good and this is what 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.389
 will allow all this obviously that if not 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.799
 you have a super powerful computer not 

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:07.280
 I think that's going to be the case but the 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.049
 true 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.729
 it's something that 's pretty good and 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.200
 apart from that the images look 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.299
 pretty good and me like they have 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.159
 no longer you may be seeing the 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.020
 It is true that the beach is one of 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.090
 those that I have loved the most and also 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.070
 something that stands out and that has improved 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.140
 very much are some details of the 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.880
 characters not like the gun can be 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.560
 or simply the hands in fact 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.020
 you can remember or those who are 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.850
 old fans of the saga that in the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.770
 first big cars or more than anything in 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.899
 those of the last generation of 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.850
 playstation 2 and xbox the characters 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.890
 they had their fingers stuck together and 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.570
 the something that looked funny not but the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.220
 it's true that this looks pretty good to me 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.720
 I loved how it looks basically 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.880
 all this about the game and the truth that 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.740
 I hope it 's pretty good, not a 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.810
 image which caught my attention 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.300
 let's see right after the one 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.710
 it comes is quite impressive since 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.080
 in that image we will be able to find 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.610
 some things and here as you see we can 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.319
 see some details of the car that the 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.869
 I really love how it works 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.729
 see and here comes the image which they 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.649
 he said not here as they see it we can be 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.720
 looking at the menu of what they are doing 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.880
 the configurations of grand theft auto 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.829
 5 I started and I think here is 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.210
 where you are going to align everything obviously the 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.940
 images must have been taken out 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.560
 with the best possible computer 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.000
 that the graphics are brutal and they 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.550
 I say that if you run with the 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.500
 low requirements with everything that goes to it 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.270
 unless you can give this game I think 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.730
 that they will see the same as the version 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.890
 of playstation 3 or xbox 360 and without 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.810
 hdmi plug for nothing for 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.400
 make a comparison then as 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.410
 they see it the truth they look extremely 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.540
 well the images I loved 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.950
 as you see more than anything the details of 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.780
 the characters I even feel that 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.790
 maikel in this video game be a little 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.070
 older and something else that calls me 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.230
 the attention that I want to come out in all 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.270
 this version are the mods not though 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.520
 basically the modifications are 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.980
 which allow us to add some things 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.320
 to the game as it could be a mode of a 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.730
 zombie apocalypse or even the one 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.130
 jetpack the truth is something that I hope 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.140
 rather this PC version of nothing 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.780
 think that there are only a few days left to 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.970
 have it and be able to play all this and 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.350
 there I do not know to me the truth that I do 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.970
 pretty good I've also read a 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.220
 little bit out there that the characters that 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.780
 you have in your current console is going to 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.610
 able to pass me but do not know what 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.870
 the most interesting to me will be the way 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.610
 story because I think obviously 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.470
 in what is being the multiplayer mode 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.060
 you can not put more and what 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.890
 that would be as forbidden not and only 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.810
 would be for the story mode but of 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.240
 the same way it would still be something brutal 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.980
 and it would be very good in the game like that 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.030
 I hope you guys liked the 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.130

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.570
