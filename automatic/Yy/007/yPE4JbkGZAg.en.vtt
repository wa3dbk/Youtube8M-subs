00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:08.970
 fish numbers and subscribers today we have 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.530
 map swamp almost 99 and very good 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.950
 changed so consider today 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.800
 positions for the upper niche base not the upper 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.810
 base with us . will be squared dd3 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.000
 . very interesting allows us 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.660
 control immediately set 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.449
 directions with girls this principle 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.440
 tagged here can be my curious 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.410
 creativity check on them is not the most difficult 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.180
 Here we call in with the analysis as usual with 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.579
 I do gasoline then I think it will be soon 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.469
 even easier jumped here with bendikam 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.809
 have to fidget in Britain 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.930
 direction and basically then there already 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.789
 here comes a little further along this 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.640
 here is the way we drive here 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.800
 we have a bunch of interesting bushes and 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.680
 folds of the area behind which we can 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.100
 hide from how we can 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.970
 shoot at us more interested here 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.850
 this slide 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:14.340
 and that's about the veto there are bushes that 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.689
 will allow us to defy directions with 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.270
 sides of the enemy on the first second 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.670
 the third line which we were excellent 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.250
 court view and highlight only 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.439
 imagine ally arte and can be ally 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.110
 tanks here have cups empty 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.049
 which captures half swamp 1 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.970
 second or third line as I said 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.310
 by the way from here you can see our very well 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.350
 base here we are and even very good 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.460
 Shine through the case accordingly 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.080
 can capture capture 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.380
 either control comrades 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:51.090
 from the opposite side they are not there 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.890
 drove around heavily happens breakthrough there 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.620
 not knowing the fireflies map or something else 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.530
 there they are, and essentially what they are 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.820
 boors who allow not only 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.580
 control half swamps all 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.960
 swamps shine through and from songs that can 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.240
 will roll roll 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:12.090
 that's what's interesting. for upper base 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.270
 on this map. 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.480
 position for the bottom base here I found another 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.550
 I will say right away that the comrade is on 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.350
 rest me remaking a goat already even in 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.480
 fight time 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.280
 Well, it does not matter, I will show you too, because 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.700
 that it is basically a mirror 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.720
 display of the position of this one 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.490
 currently viewing the same plan 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.050
 straight to the height of the same place allows 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.540
 defit same lines here is the same 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.770
 the center of the marshes both from this point also with 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.350
 they can choke 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.350
 also a great base here 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.830
 this interesting position is on 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:59.150
 bottom base location it occupies in 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.980
 eg8 squares that's the direction too 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.410
 can consider create my card 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.340
 thirst reechkami what you can do well, 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.340
 I will say verbally that Vince is the same as 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.940
 I will even repeat the same thing as with 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.870
 top base position for is here too 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.680
 just we drive in and here's a twist 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.750
 Driving here is a small overclocking 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.330
 here if you attach to so just 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.800
 write as he immediately pay attention 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.350
 here on the bushes on the right here on there right away 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.070
 lit up our test of 220 which costs 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.260
 near the base 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.320
 the only prince you can do with 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.260
 adversary who will implement 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.790
 the credo of the credo is just summer than the base here 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.410
 then you can ride down the slope 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.110
 sheets life such bushes of course skoda 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.780
 from the place here is smaller than the first 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.540
 point for eternal base hide here in 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.030
 principle not as much as possible there 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.360
 also here are bushes which allows us 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.480
 shine through the tenth ninth 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.690
 and accordingly assurance 10 zero 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.260
 will be given at 8 lines from this bush can 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.050
 shine 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.180
 here you can drive here it is more than bushes 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.959
 which is allowed even an idiot himself about 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.549
 we will take all the swamps with you 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.730
 principle we will light up the bumps with 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.790
 enemy side enemy base there 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.400
 Tanks are also very often 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:28.100
 here similar to the kitchen base here therefore 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.040
 I think that when you get to this 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.140
 map I think you will know where you are 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.419
 become and where you can stuff at home make 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.210
 many frags if you like the position 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.900
 as usual thumb up subscribe to 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.610
 My channel is all good luck until we meet again not 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.430
 forget to send your linden and with these 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.410
 positions will be very happy to see the most 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.410
 show other people everything bye
