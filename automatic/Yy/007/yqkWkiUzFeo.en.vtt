00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
some would say yes but I think of it is

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.190 
some would say yes but I think of it is
that<00:01:46.640> Virginia<00:01:46.880> has<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.299> level<00:01:47.630> of<00:01:47.780> experience

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
that Virginia has a level of experience

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.960 
that Virginia has a level of experience
that<00:01:48.560> speaks<00:01:49.190> for<00:01:49.400> itself

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
that speaks for itself

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.700 
that speaks for itself
and<00:01:50.119> so<00:01:50.330> no<00:01:50.479> matter<00:01:50.690> what<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.140> level<00:01:51.409> of<00:01:51.650> the

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710
