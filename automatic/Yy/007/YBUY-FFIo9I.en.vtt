strong ones followed them all to the

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.669 
strong ones followed them all to the
center<00:00:52.030> so<00:00:52.149> that's<00:00:52.359> twice<00:00:52.690> we<00:00:52.989> followed<00:00:53.320> it<00:00:53.379> to

this<00:00:53.769> end<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.160> they<00:00:54.219> do<00:00:54.429> once<00:00:54.670> more<00:00:54.910> on<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:55.929> side

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
this end and they do once more on a side

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.389 
this end and they do once more on a side
fold<00:00:56.710> all<00:00:57.609> four<00:00:58.030> corners<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.410> center<00:00:59.530> once

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
fold all four corners to the center once

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.869 
fold all four corners to the center once
more<00:01:00.870> being<00:01:01.870> particular<00:01:02.589> about<00:01:03.129> the<00:01:03.399> edge

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
more being particular about the edge

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.040 
more being particular about the edge
right<00:01:04.360> here<00:01:04.590> making<00:01:05.590> sure<00:01:05.620> that<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.100> edge<00:01:06.250> is

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
right here making sure that the edge is

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.030 
right here making sure that the edge is
well<00:01:08.579> there<00:01:09.579> two<00:01:09.759> down<00:01:09.970> one<00:01:10.350> now<00:01:11.350> quite<00:01:11.650> strong

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
well there two down one now quite strong

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.969 
well there two down one now quite strong
quite<00:01:12.909> sharp<00:01:13.240> that's<00:01:14.110> three<00:01:14.409> times<00:01:14.439> then<00:01:14.860> you

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
quite sharp that's three times then you

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.249 
quite sharp that's three times then you
turn<00:01:15.189> it<00:01:15.310> over<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:16.450> fold<00:01:16.750> it<00:01:16.840> once<00:01:17.049> more

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
turn it over and you fold it once more

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.830 
turn it over and you fold it once more
to<00:01:17.829> the<00:01:17.950> center<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.490> edges<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.659> center

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
to the center the edges to the center

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.360 
to the center the edges to the center
once

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.840 

so<00:01:24.910> you'll<00:01:25.060> end<00:01:25.210> up<00:01:25.360> with<00:01:25.600> something<00:01:25.810> that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
so you'll end up with something that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.240 
so you'll end up with something that
looks<00:01:27.850> just<00:01:28.180> like<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.660> folded<00:01:29.200> it<00:01:29.740> corners

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
looks just like that folded it corners

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.620 
looks just like that folded it corners
into<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.640> center<00:01:31.170> three<00:01:32.170> times<00:01:32.440> one<00:01:32.830> way<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
into the center three times one way and

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.360 
into the center three times one way and
one<00:01:34.900> time<00:01:35.850> from<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.000> opposite<00:01:37.390> side<00:01:38.370> you'll

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
one time from the opposite side you'll

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.400 
one time from the opposite side you'll
get<00:01:39.490> there<00:01:39.730> now<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.540> take<00:01:40.720> your<00:01:40.930> thumb<00:01:41.140> and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
get there now you take your thumb and

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.490 
get there now you take your thumb and
put<00:01:41.710> your<00:01:41.830> thumb<00:01:42.010> between<00:01:42.430> these<00:01:42.670> two<00:01:43.230> and<00:01:44.230> yet

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
put your thumb between these two and yet

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.360 
put your thumb between these two and yet
other<00:01:45.000> then<00:01:46.000> go<00:01:46.300> finger<00:01:46.990> goes<00:01:47.110> behind<00:01:47.560> and

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
other then go finger goes behind and

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.120 
other then go finger goes behind and
grudge<00:01:48.760> that<00:01:49.090> then<00:01:50.050> you<00:01:50.200> simply<00:01:50.410> pull<00:01:50.830> it<00:01:50.980> up

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
grudge that then you simply pull it up

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.510 
grudge that then you simply pull it up
and<00:01:51.400> away<00:01:52.380> don't<00:01:53.380> touch<00:01:53.620> the<00:01:53.890> edge<00:01:54.070> don't

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
and away don't touch the edge don't

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.480 
and away don't touch the edge don't
touch<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.210> point<00:01:55.510> just<00:01:56.500> pull<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.830> up<00:01:57.280> and

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
touch the the point just pull it up and

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.640 
touch the the point just pull it up and
a<00:01:57.670> wire<00:01:57.820> like<00:01:58.000> that<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.840> you'll<00:01:59.290> see<00:01:59.500> that

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
a wire like that and you'll see that

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.520 
a wire like that and you'll see that
that<00:01:59.860> starts<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.400> give<00:02:00.720> your<00:02:01.720> flower<00:02:02.080> some

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
that starts to give your flower some

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.610 
that starts to give your flower some
sort<00:02:02.800> of<00:02:02.860> rigidity<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:04.350> once<00:02:05.350> you've<00:02:05.500> done

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
sort of rigidity and once you've done

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.150 
sort of rigidity and once you've done
that<00:02:05.680> turn<00:02:06.160> it<00:02:06.280> over<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.850> simply<00:02:07.690> pull<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
that turn it over and simply pull the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.850 
that turn it over and simply pull the
other<00:02:09.450> leaves<00:02:10.450> out<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:11.020> make<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:12.400> make<00:02:12.550> petals
