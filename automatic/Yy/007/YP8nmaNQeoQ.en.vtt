00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.110 
spent some time with the curators going
around<00:00:57.080> the<00:00:57.230> collections<00:00:57.710> learning<00:00:58.160> about

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
around the collections learning about

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.729 
around the collections learning about
them<00:00:59.390> from<00:00:59.540> these<00:00:59.780> wonderful<00:01:00.230> specialists

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
them from these wonderful specialists

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.710 
them from these wonderful specialists
and<00:01:00.860> I<00:01:01.250> was<00:01:01.400> suddenly<00:01:01.580> struck<00:01:02.030> by<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.360> fact

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
and I was suddenly struck by the fact

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.259 
and I was suddenly struck by the fact
that<00:01:02.809> we<00:01:03.050> had<00:01:03.290> all<00:01:03.650> of<00:01:03.680> these<00:01:04.129> paintings<00:01:05.089> that

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
that we had all of these paintings that

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.270 
that we had all of these paintings that
was<00:01:05.480> most<00:01:05.840> commonly<00:01:06.140> would<00:01:06.560> be<00:01:06.710> called<00:01:06.920> a<00:01:06.980> fake

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
was most commonly would be called a fake

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.430 
was most commonly would be called a fake
I<00:01:07.580> suggested<00:01:08.300> that<00:01:08.330> we<00:01:08.480> have<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.900> makings<00:01:09.260> of

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
I suggested that we have the makings of

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.130 
I suggested that we have the makings of
an<00:01:09.860> exhibition<00:01:10.400> here<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.420> then<00:01:11.960> when

a<00:02:49.290> micro<00:02:49.830> scale<00:02:50.190> or<00:02:50.520> what<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.760> try<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.150> do<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:52.200> to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
a micro scale or what I try to do is to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.910 
a micro scale or what I try to do is to
do<00:02:52.800> as<00:02:53.070> much<00:02:53.520> as<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.850> can<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.480> learn<00:02:54.840> as<00:02:55.140> much<00:02:55.200> as

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
do as much as I can to learn as much as

I can
non-destructively<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.040> workhorse

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
non-destructively and so the workhorse

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.450 
non-destructively and so the workhorse
instrument<00:03:00.390> for<00:03:01.230> doing<00:03:01.650> non-destructive

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
instrument for doing non-destructive

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.640 
instrument for doing non-destructive
analysis<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:04.170> XRF<00:03:05.240> spectrometer<00:03:06.240> and

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
analysis is the XRF spectrometer and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.490 
analysis is the XRF spectrometer and
what<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.890> does<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.900> employs<00:03:09.900> x-rays

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
what it does is it employs x-rays

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.240 
what it does is it employs x-rays
focused<00:03:11.250> at<00:03:11.550> a<00:03:11.610> certain<00:03:12.090> spot<00:03:13.050> on<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.740> work<00:03:14.040> of

focused at a certain spot on a work of

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.540 
focused at a certain spot on a work of
art<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:14.760> then<00:03:15.240> I<00:03:15.480> get<00:03:15.780> information<00:03:16.550> regarding

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
art and then I get information regarding

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.330 
art and then I get information regarding
the<00:03:17.730> elemental<00:03:18.510> composition<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:20.040> point

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
the elemental composition of the point

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.850 
the elemental composition of the point
of<00:03:20.520> analysis<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.360> looking<00:03:22.020> at<00:03:22.140> pigments<00:03:22.650> and

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
of analysis in looking at pigments and

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.120 
of analysis in looking at pigments and
paintings<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.850> other<00:03:24.210> works<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.690> art<00:03:24.900> of

paintings and other works of art of

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.730 
paintings and other works of art of
pigments<00:03:26.130> have<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.280> history<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.760> use<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:28.530> I

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
pigments have a history of use and so I

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.250 
pigments have a history of use and so I
get<00:03:29.040> information<00:03:29.540> elemental<00:03:30.540> information

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260

was purchased in 1936 Salvador came to
me<00:03:47.070> with<00:03:47.220> questions<00:03:47.760> about<00:03:47.850> this<00:03:48.150> painting

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
me with questions about this painting

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.620 
me with questions about this painting
because<00:03:49.050> of<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.380> curious<00:03:50.420> absence<00:03:51.420> of

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
because of the curious absence of

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.470 
because of the curious absence of
provenance
