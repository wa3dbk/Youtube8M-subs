00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
really nice day there's our tree house

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.229 
really nice day there's our tree house
all<00:02:22.069> right<00:02:22.160> so<00:02:22.310> if<00:02:22.430> we<00:02:22.519> walk<00:02:22.670> around<00:02:23.000> inside

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
all right so if we walk around inside

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.000 
all right so if we walk around inside
the<00:02:23.390> house<00:02:23.510> here's<00:02:23.750> our<00:02:23.870> platform<00:02:24.349> it's

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
the house here's our platform it's

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.820 
the house here's our platform it's
really<00:02:25.310> big<00:02:25.550> as<00:02:25.819> you<00:02:26.360> can<00:02:26.390> see<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.019> you<00:02:27.800> can

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
really big as you can see and you can

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.650 
really big as you can see and you can
see<00:02:27.950> how<00:02:28.250> small<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.880> generator<00:02:29.330> is<00:02:29.540> itself

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.600 

now<00:02:35.660> it's<00:02:35.840> gonna<00:02:35.959> hop<00:02:36.230> up<00:02:36.440> here<00:02:36.620> quickly<00:02:39.610> this

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
now it's gonna hop up here quickly this

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.490 
now it's gonna hop up here quickly this
way<00:02:40.819> I<00:02:40.849> can<00:02:41.030> show<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.299> what<00:02:41.599> it<00:02:41.690> looks<00:02:41.930> like<00:02:42.200> a

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
way I can show you what it looks like a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.520 
way I can show you what it looks like a
different<00:02:43.010> angle<00:02:44.110> basically<00:02:45.110> over<00:02:45.319> here<00:02:45.560> is

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
different angle basically over here is

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.229 
different angle basically over here is
the<00:02:48.530> generator<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.280> place<00:02:49.910> where<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.120> hook

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
the generator the place where you hook

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.949 
the generator the place where you hook
up<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.450> electronics<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.519> hoses<00:02:52.569> fuel<00:02:53.569> Inlet

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
up the electronics and hoses fuel Inlet

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.600 
up the electronics and hoses fuel Inlet
pressure<00:02:54.230> this<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.709> where<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.010> gasoline<00:02:55.310> is

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
pressure this is where the gasoline is

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.970 
pressure this is where the gasoline is
and<00:02:56.890> over<00:02:57.890> here<00:02:58.250> is<00:02:58.370> our<00:02:58.579> I<00:02:59.470> have<00:03:00.470> no<00:03:00.620> idea<00:03:00.860> what

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
and over here is our I have no idea what

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.220 
and over here is our I have no idea what
that<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.519> don't<00:03:02.120> really<00:03:02.269> care<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.780> this<00:03:03.140> is

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
that is I don't really care and this is

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.860 
that is I don't really care and this is
Verizon<00:03:03.620> FiOS<00:03:03.799> box<00:03:04.269> that<00:03:05.269> goes<00:03:05.390> up<00:03:05.569> there<00:03:05.750> to

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
Verizon FiOS box that goes up there to

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.379 
Verizon FiOS box that goes up there to
the<00:03:05.989> live<00:03:06.200> wires<00:03:06.500> that<00:03:06.769> go<00:03:06.910> straight<00:03:07.910> back

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
the live wires that go straight back

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:15.400 
the live wires that go straight back
there<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:13.540> yeah<00:03:14.540> here's<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.959> window<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.230> was

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
there and yeah here's the window I was

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.840 
there and yeah here's the window I was
that<00:03:15.590> previously<00:03:16.190> so<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:16.400> could<00:03:16.519> see<00:03:16.670> outside

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
that previously so you could see outside

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.629 
that previously so you could see outside
and<00:03:17.590> yeah<00:03:18.590> this<00:03:18.829> is<00:03:18.920> basically<00:03:19.069> going<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.579> be

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
and yeah this is basically going to be

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.509 
and yeah this is basically going to be
put<00:03:19.910> into<00:03:20.030> effect<00:03:20.620> when<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.920> power<00:03:22.160> goes<00:03:22.310> out

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
put into effect when the power goes out

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.270 
put into effect when the power goes out
at<00:03:22.970> our<00:03:23.000> house<00:03:23.560> due<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.769> severe

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
maybe any natural disaster that may

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
maybe any natural disaster that may
knock<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.079> power<00:03:33.260> out<00:03:33.440> of<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.769> house

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
knock the power out of the house

knock the power out of the house
including<00:03:34.400> this<00:03:34.489> tree<00:03:34.760> for<00:03:34.970> branch<00:03:35.209> falls<00:03:35.450> and

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
including this tree for branch falls and

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.420 
including this tree for branch falls and
pulls<00:03:35.959> and<00:03:36.380> Yanks<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.799> waters<00:03:37.040> right<00:03:37.190> off<00:03:37.310> the

pulls and Yanks the waters right off the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.640 
pulls and Yanks the waters right off the
house<00:03:37.549> which<00:03:37.760> has<00:03:37.940> happened<00:03:38.180> before<00:03:38.510> but<00:03:39.500> if

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
house which has happened before but if

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.319 
house which has happened before but if
it<00:03:39.859> has<00:03:40.010> if<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.430> happens<00:03:40.760> again<00:03:40.970> this<00:03:41.150> then

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
it has if it happens again this then

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.270 
it has if it happens again this then
will<00:03:41.480> pick<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:41.840> now<00:03:42.380> this<00:03:42.560> thing<00:03:42.739> is<00:03:42.769> tested<00:03:43.250> to

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
will pick in now this thing is tested to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.490 
will pick in now this thing is tested to
every<00:03:43.639> Wednesday<00:03:44.090> around<00:03:44.239> 11<00:03:44.690> a.m.<00:03:45.019> just<00:03:45.350> like

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
every Wednesday around 11 a.m. just like

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.900 
every Wednesday around 11 a.m. just like
the<00:03:45.620> required<00:03:45.799> weekly<00:03:46.069> tests<00:03:46.430> on<00:03:46.549> the<00:03:46.670> weather

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
the required weekly tests on the weather

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.690 
the required weekly tests on the weather
radio<00:03:47.470> basically<00:03:48.470> what<00:03:48.620> happens<00:03:49.010> is<00:03:49.190> this

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
radio basically what happens is this

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.120 
radio basically what happens is this
takes<00:03:50.000> over<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.359> power<00:03:50.540> for<00:03:50.870> 30<00:03:51.049> seconds<00:03:52.840> so

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
takes over the power for 30 seconds so

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.830 
takes over the power for 30 seconds so
it's<00:03:55.130> over<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.370> power<00:03:55.549> for<00:03:55.700> 30<00:03:55.790> seconds<00:03:56.269> shuts

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
it's over the power for 30 seconds shuts

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.180 
it's over the power for 30 seconds shuts
off<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.260> normal<00:03:57.500> power<00:03:57.650> from<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.069> utility

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
off the normal power from the utility

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.610 
off the normal power from the utility
lines<00:03:58.670> outside<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.780> this<00:03:59.930> kicks<00:04:00.169> in<00:04:00.319> for<00:04:00.470> 30

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
lines outside and this kicks in for 30

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.009 
lines outside and this kicks in for 30
seconds<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.130> test<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.569> to<00:04:02.569> make<00:04:02.630> sure<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:02.930> all

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
seconds to test it to make sure it all

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.449 
seconds to test it to make sure it all
works<00:04:03.049> or<00:04:03.410> everything<00:04:03.620> else<00:04:03.829> except<00:04:04.250> for<00:04:04.370> the
