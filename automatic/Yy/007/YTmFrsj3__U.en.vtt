00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 this is a 1.4 liter turbo engine with 140 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.589
 ps and 200 newtonmeter torque 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.710
 we have a six-speed gearbox and the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.559
 all-wheel four-wheel is not reached he 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.610
 is also very clever of his function 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.359
 let me maybe 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.650
 cleverly define why because he is with 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.380
 many components here in the vehicle 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:32.369
 communicates so speaks the permanent 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.410
 with motor with steering with abs esp 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.200
 and traction control uses 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.390
 thereby the sensorik which is given there 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.820
 such example steering angle sensor of the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.700
 vehicle speed the single wheel 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.590
 speed of all four wheels 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.020
 gas pedal position we use the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.989
 piraten sensor as another feedback 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.210
 to add the four- wheel or even 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.489
 not to switch on or even wismars 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.500
 we use the slope the slope 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.730
 information about the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.620
 logi to capture the needle sensors and 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.380
 the 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.060
 Control of a dc electronic control 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.000
 unit the four-wheel calculates the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.110
 ideal parameter to what extent that 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.880
 transmitted torque to the rear wheels 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.130
 shall be 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.680
 the special thing is that we have it 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.750
 not as a pure slip controller like that 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.880
 use help traction help if 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.220
 spin the wheels but also under 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.290
 certain circumstances around the vehicle 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.440
 more driving dynamics more fun at 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.890
 to ride more joy to prepare so 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.300
 For example, we always drive at the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.700
 start even if no speech 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:49.040
 go crazy with a permanent one 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.830
 all-wheel drive we drive under 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.540
 situations such as curvy 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.720
 stretch in four-wheel mode and of course 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.910
 where it really is with faction 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.350
 problems are the torque distribution 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.270
 to the rear axle can vary from 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.950
 100 percent on the front axle to zero 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.880
 on the rear axle until a split 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.010
 for example, 50 50 that was up 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.690
 snow and ice where we really little 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.709
 have traction and there too 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.709
 need the advice
