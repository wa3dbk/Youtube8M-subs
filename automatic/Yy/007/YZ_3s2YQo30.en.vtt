problems with it it's easier to listen
not<00:03:50.090> problems<00:03:50.599> with<00:03:50.810> but<00:03:51.049> um<00:03:52.239> first<00:03:53.239> problem

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
not problems with but um first problem

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.390 
not problems with but um first problem
with<00:03:53.629> the<00:03:53.780> controller<00:03:54.230> come<00:03:54.650> by<00:03:54.980> it's<00:03:55.250> not<00:03:55.340> the

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
with the controller come by it's not the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.890 
with the controller come by it's not the
worst<00:03:55.579> control<00:03:55.970> it's<00:03:56.120> not<00:03:56.209> jagwire

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
worst control it's not jagwire

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.240 
worst control it's not jagwire
controller<00:03:57.470> so<00:03:57.620> it's<00:03:57.709> not<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:57.860> worst<00:03:57.980> control

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
controller so it's not the worst control

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.390 
controller so it's not the worst control
in<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.430> world<00:03:58.610> but<00:03:59.290> certainly<00:04:00.290> not<00:04:00.409> good<00:04:00.650> six

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
in the world but certainly not good six

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.800 
in the world but certainly not good six
batteries<00:04:01.790> is<00:04:01.970> not<00:04:02.120> enough<00:04:02.329> it's<00:04:02.480> not<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.599> good

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
batteries is not enough it's not a good

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.020 
batteries is not enough it's not a good
