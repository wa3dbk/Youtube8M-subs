 avatar and once you've written it 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.640
 this application 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.870
 so this can take a little bit so much 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.550
 she gave any given that your 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.040

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.570
 place if you have it downloaded to you 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.270
 here you can finally the end that is 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:06.230
 not very very powerful because in fact more 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.480
 the logo a format its rights and its more 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.620

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.210
 advise you to take a logo 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.860
