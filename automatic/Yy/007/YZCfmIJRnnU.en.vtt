00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello my name is svetlana 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.990
 Alexandrova and continue the conversation very 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.860
 the markets a week ago I was cutting shaft 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:15.210
 balsam and pelargonium here let's see what 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.670
 we have a week is quite vigorous and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.720
 quite a good looking cuttings 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.340
 have a good healthy look 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.340
 nice tour of cards some of course 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.520
 I have n't recovered a little bit yet 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.290
 several times a day sprayed in the morning and 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.300
 in the evening 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.379
 we still have some cuttings 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.280
 have recovered and look a little 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.809
 such advertising 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.950
 but in general, the cutting itself did not hit and 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:54.690
 trunks not shriveled but this one looks like 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.210
 no longer the tenant the whole blackened face and I 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.989
 I see no reason to leave it 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.430
 and it looks like it just needs to be rejected 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.710
 well here here probably I thrust 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.869
 several pair of cuttings and this 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:16.110
 pulled out neatly this side filed 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.509
 all but this is not quite 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.400
 recovered but quite looks 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.250
 decently 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.640
 Here we have such balsam cuttings 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.909
 the cup is free and you can 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.229
 or remove or here you and the extra pile that 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.750
 this is what we need a knife example 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.630
 chlorophytum steam fit it costs me water 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:45.060
 such beautiful white ones have already developed 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:50.310
 strong roots can take any cutting 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.820
 and root in this freeing 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.820
 a glass 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.460
 chlorophytum i just like 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.149
 balsam and camber al use 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.600
 gardening them well framed 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:10.600
 flower beds do the same hole deeper 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:19.270
 and gently insert so as not to damage 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:21.550
 roots tactical and very deep 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.410
 good to use it in shady 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.489
 places 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:31.030
 however, he lives quite well in the sun 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:34.650
 it is possible and to frame beds to make of it 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.420
 curbs and here such long elongated 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.150
 leaves look good too 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.390
 growing fast and now i have 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.840
 a sort of such a white-edged one 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.130
 it is good to make compositions with it 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.680
 balsam we figured out and now 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:03:00.190
 let's see how our cuttings look 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:02.019
 girami at first glance what is he 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.010
 we have them a little bit 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:10.000
 the edges turned yellow look untidy but it 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:18.250
 quite normal of course 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.989
 lower leaves die off and you need everything 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.130
 only 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.700
 it's all so neatly rob 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.709
 if leaves 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.519
 still holding tight and not coming off then 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.859
 not worth 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.470
 pull because you can carelessly 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:38.710
 return and pull out 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.880
 seedling from the earth and this is for us right now 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:45.160
 do not need so here neatly 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.860
 we select if you are very straight 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:52.740
 annoying presence of yellow leaves 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.120
 they can be cut with scissors cuttings and 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.830
 little greens I see none 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.020
 chernysheva it means quite 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.930
 the probability is that each of them 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.540
 take root and now a week has passed and I 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.150
 I have never watered them and can 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.220
 moisten a little because the load was 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.530
 well spilled was not in it 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.900
 necessity is also necessary not 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.730
 overdo it because it will be strong 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.990
 wet 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:27.570
 will start to begin to turn black will be dry 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:29.800
 do we develop roots and 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.100
 pelargonium and balsam 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.980
 we still leave at least a week 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.620
 now and then two in shady in bright 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.250
 the room does not need to get on them 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.100
 now 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.740
 direct sunlight especially on 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.820
 balsam he is not ready to go on 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.820
 open sun
