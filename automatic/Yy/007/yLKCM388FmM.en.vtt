00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:07.310
 I had to be born in winter 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:10.790
 but they had not put my coat on and 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.160
 I said 0 in garlic in the summer with the 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.770
 warmth and I waited for six months and in 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.500
 so surprisingly in my house I do not even 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.330
 I was waiting and my mother had gone out to ask 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.330
 parsley to a neighbor 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.590
 so I was born alone and old age and only to the 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.140
 doorkeeper said if a julie am a child said 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.180
 the good goalkeeper and I said not to have 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.790
 born is not also mother at home to see 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.160
 who gives me to suck and gave me to suck 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.800
 the concierge bit because she was poor 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.860
 since neither for a cut 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.410
 because as a young girl she had been a nurse and 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.989
 I had fed 11 children and a 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.510
 cavalry sergeant who later got married 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.370
 with her ungrateful nested 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.600
 more and more I found out and it was a dragon 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.420
 dipped ensaimadas 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.910
 well I went to my house I sat in a 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.469
 chair that we had when we did not and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.619
 when my mom came she used to open the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.290
 door said mom born and my mother said 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.390
 that is the last time he is born only 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.759
 then we wrote a letter to me 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.250
 dad who worked from drums the 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.409
 london symphony orchestra and wine 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.119
 running he was so happy that clear 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.340
 I had not come for more than two years 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.159
 home and said now yes you have to 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.520
 work because we were already many 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.520
 nine brothers my dad my mom and a 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.800
 Mr. Brown who did not know him 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.360
 he was always in the hall we sold him 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.720
 the tambo not the neighbors who were poor 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.760
 and they did not have a radio 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.440
 with what they gave us for the drum in 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.810
 instead of spending it on champagne and on 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.450
 marijuana and that we throw a raffle and 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.720
 we had a cow we were given to choose the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.180
 cow or 12 bars of soap and said my 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.040
 father the cow that was a fat said my 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.650

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.610
 Then the cow arrived on the balcony so that 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.500
 the milk was fresh and it was known 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.890
 that he had a loose horn he dropped 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.960

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.310
 very angry with the horn in his hand and 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.200
 when my father was given to open the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.600

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.460
 he escaped on a Sunday afternoon that 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.590
 It was raining and there were no taxis and he said 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.590

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.000
 beggar and in the photos he had a 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.340
 engineer with eyes 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.400

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.000
 I placed scotland yard agent yo 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.740
 I discovered the murderer that famous 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.410
 you will have heard him name the jack the 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.670
 ripper I will tell you never what 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.760
 told by the beast but I'm going to 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.810
 count it turns out that the house was like that 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.300
 a man appeared on the street as 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.230
 asleep but like more than a month ago 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.470
 that was there 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.919
 and jose but many adults fund owners 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.389
 so we called the coroner who was not 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.210
 doctor or anything had a forum 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.160
 We called the coroner and they saw current 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.949
 he approached he gave six kicks to the lying 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.500
 in the kidneys and said one of two or is 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.479
 dead or what holds the beast and 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.910
 he was dead and well or sherlock holmes and 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:40.820
 said he has already been the ripper and we said 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.820
 because the planes and those two bikes 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:48.409
 the ripper I went to the same hotel and 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.379
 as I do not like violence will 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:53.150
 I stopped with hints we crossed in 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.040
 the hall said I had someone killed 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.540
 someone 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.540
 and I do not like to point out 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.260
 after they have told me in the bathroom and 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.260
 I said someone is a murderer 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.310
 there's a lot of fog had to do the 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.050
 round palpating and delivered a few hits 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.100
 against the doors that I was going to kill myself and 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.100
