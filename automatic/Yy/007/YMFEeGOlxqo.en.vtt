00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.899
 The book is about guilt and about 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:07.259
 loss but also friendship and 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.870
 love 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.670
 15 year old miriam is experiencing something very much 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.790
 dramatic silvia friend shot 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.109
 is during a rampage and in the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.300
 book just has to learn with this 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.890
 deal with the situation and live with it 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.740
 Especially because they are the culprit 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.170
 knew what moved me when writing 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.500
 Attitude that moved me afterwards 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.210
 simply the main character because the poor 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.430
 miriam again and again after a hit 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.890
 one they war have to end 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.480
 but this does not develop further 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.610
 same person as in the beginning 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.920
 miriam has become more self-confident and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.980
 more independent and if it better now 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.510
 or worse is not so 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.280
 important it's just that too 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.540
 something bad from bad things 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.280
 can result 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.380
 I always wanted a writer 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.940
 therefore it is on the one hand for 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.310
 I always been clear that will 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.500
 and that's great, and then again 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.940
 It's just incredible because I'm so young 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.310
 am and now all these great things 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.300
 experience and it is just surreal 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.120
 although I experience now 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.340
 especially me have fantasy-novels 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.400
 impressed and inspired too 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.110
 Write something about the topic 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.870
 is surprising and then I have 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.700
 start writing just totally close 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.810
 to the actual books with 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.920
 started fanfiction and someday 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.619
 this results in my own writing style 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.720
 develops and just off the fantasy back 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.050
 to real stories 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.670
 after I finished writing 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.930
 I was thinking ok there is this 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.850
 send now so do not send it 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.040
 and has the woman dwindling me here in the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.990
 helped bookstore and got me 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.030
 addresses of different publishers 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.280
 given to the one I have sent it one 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.900
 can very many cancel and 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.060
 one and a half years later than I already did 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.970
 can not even have believed in it 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.620
 a letter from oetinger verlag and the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.760
 I wanted my whole manuscript and me 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.490
 I still have no hope 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.840
 but then they wanted everything and everything 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.470
 therefore there is my book was now 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.570
 to buy 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.130
 At the time I was quite normal to school 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.580
 gone now I go to normal 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.580
 job 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.220
 I write a lot on the weekend 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.290
 in the evening and at night sometimes are easy 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.209
 situations because I think the super 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.739
 fits perfectly always in the book and now 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.209
 then I just write it to me 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.080
 home somewhere because I have to go again 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.030
 can use 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.600
 and otherwise until my everyday life as everyone 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.600
 others too 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.370
 a beginning with my books and me 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.170
 have an end and then I play for that 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.870
 the end of a story as it comes 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.420
 the to what needs to happen for this to 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.829
 end comes out after I do not 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.689
 more in school am I can quite 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.870
 I honestly say maybe I was not 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:42.250
 always the most exemplary student 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.439
 another sat with her cell phone under the 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.700
 School desk there and I just sat with mine 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.870
 blog there and have written and 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.189
 written and written and sometimes 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.290
 is it then already next to these 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.819
 stupid block away so I am me 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.200
 me that the book is folk 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.659
 but I do not care so much 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.000
 that's why the bookstores now 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.919
 storms and everyone buy this 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.069
 then just want that the people 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:05.169
 read this book also like that you 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.450
 Like to read it and that the topic is him 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:09.930
 I could also get close to that 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.930
 to wish
