 straight in star edition james bond and 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.240
 one or the other will surely 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.950
 james bond turns 50 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.809
 year old 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.299
 and he has one here 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.460
 Digital special issue released 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.699
 we are right now on the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.830
 start screen shortly in advance yes the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.170
 content is equal to the ratings 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.029
 currently not that bad 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.699
 once it appeals to the app 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.109
 many do not start like this 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.700
 the ipad 3 is currently no 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.620
 problems maybe here has the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.250
 Stern already tried and the problems 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.520
 Fixed 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.480
 yes, as you can see, it works 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.980
 maybe if you already loaded that 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.879
 could have tried it again 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.690
 now it probably will too 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.059
 work ipad is supported 1 2 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.489
 and 3 and on ipad 3, of course 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.750
 retina support as you can see here 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.539
 we now have as normal 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.699
 Here's a little insight 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.410
 Here you can see what in the four euro 99 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.809
 expensive app everything was built 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.730
 because the description is very nice there 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.320
 is made of many interactive elements 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.630
 talked and we just want to go 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.000
 here in the look throw in quite a classic 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.430
 is scroll here right wipe left 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.200
 then you can down the text here 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.659
 read if you have any 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.100
 there are still a few interactive ones 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.720
 elements is plus if you 're on it 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.330
 clicks then you get directly to 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.000
 the story that was announced there 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.590
 Here's a little newspaper article here 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.330
 in the first area we are in the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.759
 picture gallery and have just the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.110
 possibility and to look at pictures 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.729
 in addition there is then this always so 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.220
 small rider one can take off 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.020
 then you always get the info what 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.850
 you really are seeing this right now 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.259
 so about the first 20 pages is 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.030
 really just picture gallery they are all 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.290
 so you can always build the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.329
 raise small info 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.560
 and yes that's just the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.180
 picture gallery that we want now too 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.399
 skip it there you can 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.200
 just scroll through it yourself and 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.549
 read through and as you can see if we 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.040
 a little further, we are still 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.759
 come to the gallery so slowly to the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.369
 history or history and yes we go 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.899
 Just over here to the actors 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.460
 all actors in the overview you can 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.079
 click through here and then see 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.460
 you also played everything 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.160
 Roger Moore 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.960
 pierce brosnan and daniel craig are 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.760
 probably the two the most 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.350
 here no or no 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.990
 that was the last two recent ones 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.270
 jenny craig is still up to date 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.850
 soon to see the screen again 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.090
 full of sky and here you can stop 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.490
 read through a few infos and read through 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.170
 actor himself and as you can see 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.080
 now a lucky designated illustration 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.000
 The whole thing was not done here 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.590
 for example, the filmography joke 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.940
 You can easily see yourself called 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.460
 scroll through and you just look like 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.660
 Many of the films were made the names and 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.760
 the cover and if you go to now 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.140
 For example, I would like to be here now 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.060
 no one ever dies over tomorrow 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.230
 information then we jump 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.630
 but just go there and can us 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.700
 then you will see huge flights here 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.640
 has led as the title song who was 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.910
 has played etc and here is one too 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.590
 small star rating that is from the 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.540
 been made 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.890
 if that then of course your own 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.430
 opinion corresponds to that was there times 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.260
 posed 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.030
 Also interesting here are the facts 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.320
 cemetery here you can have a look 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.790
 who earns how much money when you look at yourself 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.640
 Let's have a look at Craig for skype 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.860
 gets the 12.5 million US dollars 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.710
 that's neat sean connery 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.720
 has just for his first film 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.340
 Getting 800 1000 dollars is natural 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.920
 in contrast already a blatant 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.460
 difference but that is probably in 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.210
 an actor actor business 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.650
 Here you can have a look again 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.940
 which films, for example, in Germany 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.810
 very successful madness what her friend 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.300
 fireball 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.280
 that was probably a runner who says 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.390
 Personally, not quite as much 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.750
 I'm probably still too young 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.690
 for casino royale or golden eye is here 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.650
 already another house number 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.140
 Here you can see for example the 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.870
 Proceeds from Aston Props 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.400
 martin james bond one is just for 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.880
 four million dollars at table 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.710
 went 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.810
 Of course, that's really neat here too 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.880
 found such a nice nice graphic like 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.770
 The production was really expensive 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.270
 you can look at it for example 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.290
 Here is the first movie if you always over 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.820
 look 441 think that a pay in 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.800
 that's what it's like for millions of dollars 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:19.150
 also and if you have a look here 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.500
 quantum consolation has just 622,000 622 times 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.060
 million dollars 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.100
 Of course, a house number 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.120
 Casino Royale was still at 76 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.050
 a bit expensive 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.870
 As you can see we are here with 1001 15 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.450
 This fire because that, of course, too 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.310
 Neat my god I am very exciting 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.540
 I must say, just a look 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.740
 again a piece further 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.450
 the Navarre here there's also a 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.410
 couple of infos to the women too 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.690
 played along 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.060
 there is an essay you can write 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.440
 here also very nice for example about 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.150
 to find out about the cars here 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.400
 if you just click on it 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.800
 you can see his here 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.240
 special attacks what everything here at his 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.639
 car was installed over 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.870
 you can do the same for the lotus 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.250
 yes, just click on it as sees 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.320
 you come here in front then chain stores 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.450
 out here below you have a mini 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.610
 league is really interesting 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.790
 made and there they have the same time 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.229
 abfahren 1 become with a b 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.180
 but it is so obvious 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.430
 there is also a bit of advertising 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.320
 also deals with the physics of 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.080
 Professor is here at the University of Dortmund 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.060
 So basically busy around the corner and 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.280
 explained here also in the video 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.770
 if the city ​​is really realistic 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.870
 that were made in the movie and here 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.090
 In the video, there are three stunts a year 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.010
 examined and looked ob 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.830
 that really can be done that way 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.510
 or not and we just do it 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.650
 Here again the fast one believes something 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.950
 we have we have we, however 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.940
 everything yes there are a few info to the 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:51.490
 sets always in the midst of parodies 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.240
 okay there are a few pictures that 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.740
 james bond quasi imitate so little is 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.840
 It is also nice that you can get it 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.220
 look at what he gives as much as you do 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.600
 I already have it on here 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.979
 We clicked because of the navigation 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.600
 then you can get away for example 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.700
 watch the james bond watch here 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.820
 and you have some more information 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:12.130
 was then really gets and yes everything 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.990
 In China, the class optimizes you 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.910
 can scroll down here I have to say 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.410
 it is quite a lot of pictures 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.389
 There is also text in the back 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.030
 then a little more 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:24.430
 Ask her for something again 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.560
 interesting right here for example 50 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.090
 Things that are determined by james bond 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.950
 not yet know that you can here 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.630
 read through 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.340
 if you look for example here 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.310
 15 looks at the turning of goldfinger 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.630
 About 30 gold bars disappeared daily 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.130
 Crewmembers grabbed them 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.910
 Gold color nations the aluminum pieces 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.160
 as a souvenir 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.700
 So there were no colt banks stolen 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.880
 but just just any stones with 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:50.820
 gold color the golf were covered 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.650
 and yes the information is very nice a lot 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.770
 you did not know that you can 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:58.590
 Look well here and just one 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.700
 some literary tips also with the and 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.050
 of course have to do 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.060
 there you can now here for example 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.000
 if you lie on it opens everyone 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.110
 browser and you will also go to Amazon 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.520
 you can forward the book 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.100
 directly purchase 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:15.720
 that was such a fast run 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:17.940
 from the special edition of the star the 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.160
 can one buy for 499 lands 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.440
 not in the newsstand but as 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.270
 stand-alone app and makes on everyone 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.710
 Good impression as you can see 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.170
 the app works in contrast to the 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.460
 reviews in the app store and if you like 

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:33.860
 we wish you the app now much 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.860
 fun with the active
