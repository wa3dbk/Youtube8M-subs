00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
45-degree angle which is okay if your

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
opponent is leaning over like this but

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.600 
opponent is leaning over like this but
if<00:02:26.930> he's<00:02:27.080> standing<00:02:27.500> neutral<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.129> straight<00:02:28.400> up

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
if he's standing neutral and straight up

you standing straight up I want to hit
him<00:02:33.140> at<00:02:33.470> an<00:02:33.590> angle<00:02:33.980> how<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.000> create<00:02:35.780> two<00:02:35.989> right

him at an angle how to create two right
angles<00:02:36.379> here<00:02:36.769> that<00:02:37.220> way<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.459> force<00:02:37.670> goes<00:02:38.030> in

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
angles here that way the force goes in

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.440 
angles here that way the force goes in
instead<00:02:39.260> of<00:02:39.440> grazing<00:02:39.890> up<00:02:40.280> or<00:02:40.489> grazing<00:02:41.120> down

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.420 

now<00:03:53.570> for<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:53.960> front<00:03:54.170> leg<00:03:54.380> round<00:03:54.620> kick<00:03:54.710> it's<00:03:55.370> a

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
now for the front leg round kick it's a

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.600 
now for the front leg round kick it's a
similar<00:03:55.790> concept<00:03:56.350> we<00:03:57.350> can<00:03:57.500> do<00:03:57.620> this<00:03:57.770> quite<00:03:58.580> a

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
similar concept we can do this quite a

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.950 
similar concept we can do this quite a
few<00:03:58.850> ways<00:03:59.000> actually<00:03:59.270> there's<00:03:59.600> a<00:03:59.660> lot<00:03:59.810> of

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
few ways actually there's a lot of

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.230 
few ways actually there's a lot of
variations<00:04:00.440> around<00:04:00.560> kicks<00:04:00.980> these<00:04:01.820> aren't<00:04:02.180> the

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
variations around kicks these aren't the

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.790 
variations around kicks these aren't the
only<00:04:02.360> ones<00:04:02.660> there's<00:04:02.900> a<00:04:02.960> lot<00:04:03.290> more<00:04:03.560> there's

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
only ones there's a lot more there's

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.580 
only ones there's a lot more there's
probably<00:04:04.390> two<00:04:05.390> or<00:04:05.420> three<00:04:05.600> dozen<00:04:05.900> variations

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
probably two or three dozen variations

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.590 
probably two or three dozen variations
of<00:04:06.740> the<00:04:06.830> round<00:04:07.010> kick<00:04:07.220> alone<00:04:07.640> one<00:04:08.120> way<00:04:08.270> we<00:04:08.480> can

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
of the round kick alone one way we can

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.260 
of the round kick alone one way we can
do<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:08.930> is<00:04:09.140> from<00:04:09.920> here<00:04:10.280> we're<00:04:10.880> going<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.090> shift

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
do it is from here we're going to shift

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.000 
do it is from here we're going to shift
our<00:04:11.480> weight<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.900> back<00:04:12.050> leg<00:04:12.350> pivot<00:04:12.890> our

before<00:04:18.799> we<00:04:18.890> kick<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.609> same<00:04:19.850> way<00:04:20.090> with

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
before we kick it's the same way with

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.050 
before we kick it's the same way with
this<00:04:20.420> we<00:04:21.260> can't<00:04:21.500> kick<00:04:21.830> if<00:04:22.070> we<00:04:22.280> keep<00:04:22.460> this<00:04:22.700> foot

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
this we can't kick if we keep this foot

45 degrees

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.490 
45 degrees
okay<00:04:25.340> we<00:04:26.000> need<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.560> lift<00:04:27.560> turn<00:04:28.360> kick<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:30.290> drop

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
okay we need to lift turn kick and drop

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.470 
okay we need to lift turn kick and drop
it<00:04:30.650> down<00:04:30.680> in<00:04:30.890> front<00:04:30.919> of<00:04:31.130> us<00:04:31.280> now<00:04:31.490> this<00:04:32.270> is<00:04:32.450> a

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
it down in front of us now this is a

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.850 
it down in front of us now this is a
weaker<00:04:32.840> way<00:04:32.960> to<00:04:33.020> throw<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.380> kick<00:04:33.560> but<00:04:33.710> it's

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
weaker way to throw the kick but it's

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.560 
weaker way to throw the kick but it's
faster<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:34.460> can<00:04:34.550> still<00:04:34.790> get<00:04:34.910> a<00:04:34.940> knockout<00:04:35.330> as

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
faster you can still get a knockout as

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.080 
faster you can still get a knockout as
