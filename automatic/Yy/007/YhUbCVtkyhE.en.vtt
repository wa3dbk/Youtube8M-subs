00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello very good with the appearance of 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.610
 upper what's many developers are 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.860
 they have put the batteries and finally there are 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.080
 and a multitude of applications that have 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.780
 some functionality adapted to this 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.340
 smart watch but in the video of 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.100
 today we are going to teach you the 5 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.530
 applications better adapted to Peru and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.600
 those 5 apps that you have to try when 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.650
 you buy it, try it for the first time 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:34.720
 apple upper watch 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:36.700
 [Music] 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.100
 and the first application that you have to 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.170
 try with the upper what is called team 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.330
 apple we know that it is an application that 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.210
 it does not exist for all cities but 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.000
 every day includes one more city and its 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.650
 services are spectacular we like 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.960
 how comfortable it is to have the clock in the 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.090
 doll and with a touch to be able to know which 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.860
 it's the fastest way to go home 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.920
 or any other address we have 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.810
 saved with a step-by-step explanation 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.910
 also seventh verte gives information 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.010
 updated of all transports 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.320
 public that you have nearby schedules 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.510
 stops hours of departure at a distance 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.090
 foot even offers information about 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.770
 possible service alerts 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.810
 and also includes the function has 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.860
 transportation but only available in 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.860
 the platinum version 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.360
 I think it does not work and the second app 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.430
 you have to try the upper bots 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.890
 it's called wonder list sure that the 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.600
 you know it's about that application with 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.490
 which for example you can have a 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.320
 Shared shopping list with your partner 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.030
 and so when you go to buy you know 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.520
 exactly the ingredients that you 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.440
 are missing now with the implement what's not done 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.840
 missing or that you take out is the phone of the 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.790
 pocket in addition with wunderlist in the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.800
 upper web you can mark what you already 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.530
 you have bought the movies that have 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.390
 pending tasks that you have to finish your 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.280
 Wish list in the main menu 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.410
 you have the input tray where 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.510
 you will receive any comments in lists 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.580
 shared the calendar to see the 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.100
 tasks with dates an access to 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.230
 Favorites and other access to any item 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.210
 that you have been assigned directly to 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.160
 you and the third application that you have 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.920
 what to try in the upper world is called 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.410
 runkeeper as you already know the upper watch and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.030
 Similar watches are perfect for 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.640
 those people who like 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.710
 do some fitness apps 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.690
 as runkeeper, the app shows 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.520
 can boot the activity on the iphone 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.380
 and it will show you your time 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.300
 kilometers traveled 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.430
 in which you are running at intervals 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.080
 of time the mobile app takes care of 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.840
 save the rest of information so that 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.880
 see it later you can also pause or 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.550
 stop the activity from the clock in 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.440
 any time and the fourth application 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.660
 you have to try the whats in the app 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.850
 it's called rules and it was one of the first 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.090
 games that was already created with an adaptation 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.040
 to this apple smart watch it 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.200
 it's about a very original game with a 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.180
 mechanics that will test your brain 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.430
 with a version for Peru what's very 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.440
 well resolved but less complex the 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.170
 game brings them you have to solve 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.100
 logical puzzles that will require all of your 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.240
 concentration and memory at all times 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.310
 and the fifth application that you have to 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.160
 try on the upper watch is called day 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.740
 one and it is a similar to a 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.630
 newspaper or a place to take notes with 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.600
 an apple watch version very well 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.490
 adapted and very useful we think an idea 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.410
 great to be able to add 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.570

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.660
 staff where you can take voice notes 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.180
 using the clock the date location 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.610
 Now place and even time will 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.070
