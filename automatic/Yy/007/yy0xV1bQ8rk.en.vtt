performance tests this is Geekbench 3 a

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.119 
performance tests this is Geekbench 3 a
very<00:02:41.849> good<00:02:42.180> kind<00:02:42.689> of<00:02:42.780> overall<00:02:43.230> representation

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129

through testing pcs I believe so you can
actually<00:02:49.980> go<00:02:50.760> ahead<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.030> test<00:02:51.329> your<00:02:51.540> desktop

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
actually go ahead and test your desktop

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.539 
actually go ahead and test your desktop
computer<00:02:52.409> if<00:02:52.560> you'd<00:02:52.709> like<00:02:52.889> it's<00:02:53.340> going<00:02:53.489> to

I've<00:03:06.689> actually<00:03:06.840> skipped<00:03:07.260> ahead<00:03:07.379> a<00:03:07.620> little<00:03:07.739> bit

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
I've actually skipped ahead a little bit

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.369 
I've actually skipped ahead a little bit
just<00:03:08.340> because<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.849> Nexus<00:03:09.480> 7<00:03:09.750> 2nd<00:03:10.109> generation

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
just because the Nexus 7 2nd generation

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.379 
just because the Nexus 7 2nd generation
took<00:03:10.709> quite<00:03:10.889> a<00:03:10.950> lot<00:03:11.129> longer<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.459> complete<00:03:11.879> this

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
took quite a lot longer to complete this

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.599 
took quite a lot longer to complete this
benchmark<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.680> actually<00:03:13.709> came<00:03:14.159> in<00:03:14.340> with<00:03:14.489> a

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
benchmark and it actually came in with a

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.599 
benchmark and it actually came in with a
single<00:03:14.970> core<00:03:15.120> performance<00:03:15.269> of<00:03:16.010> 583<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.220> then

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
single core performance of 583 and then

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.110 
single core performance of 583 and then
a<00:03:17.760> multi-core<00:03:18.389> performance<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:19.849> 1866<00:03:20.849> so

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
a multi-core performance of 1866 so

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.119 
a multi-core performance of 1866 so
clearly<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.750> ipad<00:03:22.079> mini<00:03:22.260> retina<00:03:22.319> display<00:03:22.919> has

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
clearly the ipad mini retina display has

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.039 
clearly the ipad mini retina display has
benchmark<00:03:23.609> quite<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.819> bit<00:03:24.000> higher<00:03:24.269> than<00:03:24.900> the

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
benchmark quite a bit higher than the

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.170 
benchmark quite a bit higher than the
nexus<00:03:25.410> 7<00:03:25.739> second<00:03:26.129> generation<00:03:26.639> but<00:03:26.910> in<00:03:27.030> real

to benefit you all that much now let's
have<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.709> look<00:03:31.859> at<00:03:32.010> how<00:03:32.220> their<00:03:32.400> web<00:03:32.639> browsers

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
JavaScript rendering benchmark it will

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.110 
JavaScript rendering benchmark it will
kind<00:03:37.799> of<00:03:37.829> give<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.159> a<00:03:38.190> bit<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.060> a

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
kind of give you a bit of a

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.449 
kind of give you a bit of a
representation<00:03:39.930> as<00:03:40.079> to<00:03:40.109> how<00:03:40.620> well<00:03:40.949> your

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.059 
browsing and web pages it's going to go
ahead<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.959> wait<00:03:46.169> for<00:03:46.409> this<00:03:46.530> benchmark<00:03:46.979> to

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
ahead and wait for this benchmark to

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.099 
ahead and wait for this benchmark to
finish<00:03:47.370> you'll<00:03:47.549> see<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.150> ipad<00:03:49.079> mini

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
finish you'll see that the ipad mini

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.809 
finish you'll see that the ipad mini
again<00:03:49.739> pretty<00:03:50.040> much<00:03:50.129> tears<00:03:50.519> through<00:03:50.729> this

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
again pretty much tears through this

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.250 
again pretty much tears through this
benchmark<00:03:51.269> this<00:03:51.419> gives<00:03:51.599> you<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.750> time

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
benchmark this gives you a time

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.259 
benchmark this gives you a time
representation<00:03:53.220> of<00:03:53.430> how<00:03:53.549> long<00:03:53.729> the<00:03:53.849> benchmark

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
representation of how long the benchmark

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.180 
representation of how long the benchmark
took<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:55.109> course<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.500> lowest<00:03:55.829> score<00:03:56.069> is

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
took so of course the lowest score is

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.099 
took so of course the lowest score is
better<00:03:56.430> here<00:03:56.729> and<00:03:56.940> as<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.180> can<00:03:57.299> see<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.659> ipad

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
better here and as you can see the ipad

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.009 
better here and as you can see the ipad
mini<00:03:58.470> retina<00:03:58.530> displays<00:03:59.190> called<00:04:00.019> 398

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.409 
milliseconds of 300 98.7 milliseconds to
actually<00:04:04.859> fully<00:04:05.159> complete<00:04:05.729> this<00:04:05.909> benchmark

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
actually fully complete this benchmark

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:10.159 
actually fully complete this benchmark
and<00:04:06.629> then<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.840> nexus<00:04:07.169> 7<00:04:07.440> took<00:04:07.849> 1080<00:04:09.169> 1.9

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
and then the nexus 7 took 1080 1.9

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.930 
and then the nexus 7 took 1080 1.9
milliseconds<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.949> complete<00:04:11.340> this<00:04:11.459> match<00:04:11.639> mark

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
milliseconds to complete this match mark

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.149 
milliseconds to complete this match mark
so<00:04:12.090> again<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.299> clear<00:04:12.720> win<00:04:12.959> for<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.650> ipad<00:04:14.010> mini

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
so again a clear win for the ipad mini

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.770 
so again a clear win for the ipad mini
with<00:04:14.280> retina<00:04:14.340> display<00:04:14.699> of<00:04:15.269> course<00:04:15.479> that's<00:04:15.599> not

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
with retina display of course that's not

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.539 
with retina display of course that's not
