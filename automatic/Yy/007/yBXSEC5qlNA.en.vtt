00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.759 
see a full review you can check the link
below<00:00:06.690> so<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.890> i-15<00:00:08.900> is<00:00:09.900> going<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.410> be<00:00:10.530> very

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
below so the i-15 is going to be very

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.180 
below so the i-15 is going to be very
similar<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:12.530> i-10<00:00:13.530> if<00:00:13.710> you've<00:00:13.860> seen<00:00:14.040> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
similar to the i-10 if you've seen the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.550 
similar to the i-10 if you've seen the
night<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.519> 10<00:00:14.910> model<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.719> 10<00:00:15.990> ran<00:00:16.199> off<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.500> a

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
night I I 10 model that 10 ran off of a

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.599 
night I I 10 model that 10 ran off of a
single<00:00:16.890> 16<00:00:17.310> 340<00:00:17.850> size<00:00:18.060> battery<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.710> 15<00:00:19.710> runs<00:00:20.460> off

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
single 16 340 size battery I 15 runs off

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.960 
single 16 340 size battery I 15 runs off
of<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.850> single<00:00:21.210> 18<00:00:21.510> 650<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.430> bit<00:00:23.460> larger

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
of a single 18 650 so it's a bit larger

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.240 
of a single 18 650 so it's a bit larger
got<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> lot<00:00:25.080> more<00:00:25.109> capacity<00:00:25.560> there<00:00:26.420> and<00:00:28.250> yes

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
got a lot more capacity there and yes

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.529 
got a lot more capacity there and yes
you<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.609> run<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> light<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.179> high<00:00:30.330> brightness

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
you can run the light on high brightness

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.080 
you can run the light on high brightness
for<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.960> longer<00:00:31.170> amount<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.560> time<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:33.530> i-15

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
for a longer amount of time so the i-15

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.760 
for a longer amount of time so the i-15
doesn't<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.239> any<00:00:36.630> tail<00:00:36.930> switch<00:00:37.290> it's

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
doesn't have any tail switch it's

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.010 
doesn't have any tail switch it's
controlled<00:00:38.219> completely<00:00:38.610> by<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.090> magnetic

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
controlled completely by the magnetic

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.270 
controlled completely by the magnetic
dimmer<00:00:40.559> switch<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:42.200> this<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.620> an<00:00:43.860> infinitely

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
dimmer switch here this is an infinitely

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.830 
dimmer switch here this is an infinitely
variable<00:00:44.610> switch<00:00:45.030> however<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.690> you're

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
variable switch however if you're

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.360 
variable switch however if you're
familiar<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.379> night<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> site<00:00:47.010> annual

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
familiar with that night I site annual

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.389 
familiar with that night I site annual
know<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:47.670> these<00:00:48.210> switches<00:00:48.920> do<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.100> click

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
know like these switches do have click

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.540 
know like these switches do have click
stops<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.890> I'm<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.070> sure<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.489> hear

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
stops and I'm not sure if you can hear

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.430 
stops and I'm not sure if you can hear
it<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> video<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.960> these<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.410> different

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
it on the video but these have different

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.020 
it on the video but these have different
cliques<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.190> clicks<00:00:56.430> into<00:00:56.579> position

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
cliques and it clicks into position

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.619 
cliques and it clicks into position
there<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.469> each<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.680> clicks<00:00:59.210> you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.329> see

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
there and each of the clicks you can see

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.750 
there and each of the clicks you can see
I<00:01:00.899> am<00:01:01.379> not<00:01:01.649> moving<00:01:01.800> between<00:01:02.010> click<00:01:02.340> search<00:01:02.579> so

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
I am not moving between click search so

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.420 
I am not moving between click search so
it<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:02.940> infinitely<00:01:03.210> variable<00:01:03.750> two<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.710> Brian

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
it is infinitely variable two is a Brian

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.149 
it is infinitely variable two is a Brian
exchange<00:01:05.790> between<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.180> clicks<00:01:06.920> but<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.010> does

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
exchange between the clicks but it does

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.219 
exchange between the clicks but it does
have<00:01:08.369> those<00:01:08.490> clicks<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:08.970> certain<00:01:09.240> levels<00:01:09.600> so

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
have those clicks for certain levels so

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.810 
have those clicks for certain levels so
you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:11.130> an<00:01:11.250> idea<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.520> what<00:01:11.700> your

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
you can that get an idea of what your

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.060 
you can that get an idea of what your
brightness<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> i-15

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
brightness is going to be so the i-15

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.170 
brightness is going to be so the i-15
features<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> cree<00:01:15.240> xm-l<00:01:15.840> u2<00:01:16.110> bend<00:01:16.860> emitter

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
features a cree xm-l u2 bend emitter

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.820 
features a cree xm-l u2 bend emitter
that<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.360> currently<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.930> highest<00:01:19.409> bright

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that so currently be highest bright

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.620 
that so currently be highest bright
highest<00:01:20.340> efficiency<00:01:20.670> high<00:01:21.030> brightness<00:01:21.240> and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
highest efficiency high brightness and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.870 
highest efficiency high brightness and
that<00:01:21.750> are<00:01:21.840> available<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.740> got<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> orange

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
that are available it's got a orange

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.910 
that are available it's got a orange
peel<00:01:24.180> textured<00:01:24.900> reflector<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
peel textured reflector there and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.330 
peel textured reflector there and
because<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.600> small<00:01:27.869> head<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.860> small

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
because of the small head a small

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
because of the small head a small
reflector<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.880> orange<00:01:30.270> peel<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.479> XML

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
reflector the orange peel and XML

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.359 
reflector the orange peel and XML
together<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.890> going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.220> pretty

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
together this is going to be a pretty

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.710 
together this is going to be a pretty
floody<00:01:32.729> light<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> not<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> really<00:01:36.540> tight

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
floody light so not a not a really tight

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.179 
floody light so not a not a really tight
bottle<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.290> gives<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> pretty<00:01:37.710> good<00:01:37.829> flood

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
bottle it gives you a pretty good flood

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.749 
bottle it gives you a pretty good flood
of<00:01:38.400> light<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.360> pretty<00:01:39.630> smooth<00:01:39.960> beam<00:01:40.259> there

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
of light and a pretty smooth beam there

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.300 
of light and a pretty smooth beam there
so<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.360> i-15<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.649> see<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
so the i-15 you can see one of the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.190 
so the i-15 you can see one of the
changes<00:01:44.729> from<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> i-10<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.990> worth

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
changes from the i-10 that's worth

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.679 
changes from the i-10 that's worth
noting<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.829> there<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.939> texture<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
noting is a there is a texture on the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.990 
noting is a there is a texture on the
ring<00:01:48.930> all<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.259> way<00:01:49.920> around<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.670> different

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
ring all the way around it's a different

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.990 
ring all the way around it's a different
texture<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.450> half<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:51.990> ring<00:01:52.790> but<00:01:53.790> does

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
texture on half of the ring but does

texture on half of the ring but does
have<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> texture<00:01:54.600> all<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> way<00:01:54.840> around<00:01:54.930> which

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
have a texture all the way around which

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.670 
have a texture all the way around which
is<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> good<00:01:56.130> upgrade<00:01:56.280> from<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.820> i-10<00:01:57.560> you<00:01:58.560> can

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
is a good upgrade from the i-10 you can

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.499 
is a good upgrade from the i-10 you can
also<00:01:58.799> see<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.219> got<00:01:59.340> some<00:01:59.640> good<00:02:00.299> heat

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
also see it's got some good heat

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.179 
also see it's got some good heat
dissipation<00:02:00.960> fins<00:02:01.350> there<00:02:01.590> which<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.770> good<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
dissipation fins there which is good to

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.459 
dissipation fins there which is good to
this<00:02:02.340> light<00:02:02.520> density<00:02:02.909> pretty<00:02:03.119> warm<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:04.320> also

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
this light density pretty warm it also

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.550 
this light density pretty warm it also
includes<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:05.130> titanium<00:02:05.490> alloy<00:02:05.909> clip<00:02:06.560> screws

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
includes this titanium alloy clip screws

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.800 
includes this titanium alloy clip screws
on<00:02:07.740> by<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> couple<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.399> allen<00:02:09.030> screws<00:02:09.360> there<00:02:09.629> and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
on by a couple of allen screws there and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.350 
on by a couple of allen screws there and
they<00:02:10.080> do<00:02:10.200> provide<00:02:10.379> an<00:02:10.649> allen<00:02:10.950> wrench<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.370> you

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
they do provide an allen wrench for you

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.800 
they do provide an allen wrench for you
so<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.830> i-15<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.120> see<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.390> beam<00:02:15.540> here

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
so the i-15 so you can see the beam here

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.000 
so the i-15 so you can see the beam here
I'll<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.710> click<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:16.950> up<00:02:17.190> one<00:02:17.730> by<00:02:17.880> one<00:02:19.010> ch

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
I'll just click it up one by one ch

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:29.450 
I'll just click it up one by one ch
click<00:02:20.250> it's<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.520> little<00:02:20.700> bit<00:02:20.820> brighter<00:02:28.310> this<00:02:29.310> is

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
click it's a little bit brighter this is

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.740 
click it's a little bit brighter this is
the<00:02:29.550> maximum<00:02:29.970> there<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.480> can<00:02:30.600> see

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
the maximum there and so you can see

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.240 
the maximum there and so you can see
that<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.080> pretty<00:02:31.530> floody<00:02:31.860> beam<00:02:32.040> with<00:02:32.220> a

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
that is a pretty floody beam with a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.860 
that is a pretty floody beam with a
smooth<00:02:32.640> transition<00:02:33.030> out<00:02:33.300> into<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.600> spill

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
smooth transition out into the spill

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.910 
smooth transition out into the spill
area<00:02:34.460> so<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.940> i-15<00:02:36.390> also<00:02:36.780> features<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.200> hidden

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
area so the i-15 also features a hidden

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.460 
area so the i-15 also features a hidden
strobe<00:02:38.610> mode<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.030> hidden<00:02:39.209> SOS<00:02:39.690> mode<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.440> it

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
strobe mode and hidden SOS mode so it

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.590 
strobe mode and hidden SOS mode so it
access<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.010> strobe<00:02:41.310> mode<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:42.330> can<00:02:42.450> do<00:02:42.540> this

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
access the strobe mode you can do this

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.090 
access the strobe mode you can do this
from<00:02:42.750> any<00:02:42.959> position<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.500> usually<00:02:43.770> find<00:02:43.920> it

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
from any position I usually find it

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.250 
from any position I usually find it
easier<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.610> wait<00:02:45.240> for<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.450> at<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.570> max<00:02:45.810> motion

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
easier I wait for you at the max motion

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.650 
easier I wait for you at the max motion
but<00:02:46.410> from<00:02:46.590> anywhere<00:02:46.890> do<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.490> quick<00:02:47.640> turn<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.570> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
but from anywhere do a quick turn to the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.130 
but from anywhere do a quick turn to the
left<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.530> back<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.070> right<00:02:50.100> 2<00:02:50.489> times<00:02:51.140> and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
left and back to the right 2 times and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.460 
left and back to the right 2 times and
it<00:02:52.260> activates<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.800> strobe<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.420> then<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:55.320> can

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
it activates the strobe and then you can

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.979 
it activates the strobe and then you can
change<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.890> brightness<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.520> strobe<00:02:56.989> by

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
change the brightness of the strobe by

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.420 
change the brightness of the strobe by
clicking<00:02:58.350> up<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.620> down<00:02:58.770> so<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.190> can<00:02:59.280> have<00:02:59.370> a

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
clicking up and down so you can have a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.400 
clicking up and down so you can have a
pretty<00:02:59.640> bright<00:02:59.880> strobe<00:03:00.239> all<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.989> maximum

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
pretty bright strobe all the maximum

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.790 
pretty bright strobe all the maximum
there<00:03:01.610> or<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.820> can<00:03:03.230> dim<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.350> down<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> pretty

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
there or you can dim it down to a pretty

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.229 
there or you can dim it down to a pretty
dim<00:03:05.010> strobe<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.489> then<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.730> turn<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:05.970> strobe

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
dim strobe and then to turn the strobe

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.270 
dim strobe and then to turn the strobe
off<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:07.320> just<00:03:07.380> turn<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.709> light<00:03:07.860> back<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.190> the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
off you just turn the light back to the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.390 
off you just turn the light back to the
off<00:03:08.400> position<00:03:09.470> there's<00:03:10.470> also<00:03:10.620> hidden<00:03:10.920> SOS

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
off position there's also hidden SOS

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.610 
off position there's also hidden SOS
mode<00:03:11.670> it's<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.630> similar<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.110> just<00:03:13.260> turn<00:03:13.470> the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
mode it's a similar you just turn the

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.680 
mode it's a similar you just turn the
light<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.580> rink<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.150> left<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.570> then

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
light to the rink to the left and then

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.260 
light to the rink to the left and then
back<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.050> right<00:03:16.170> three<00:03:16.500> times

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.920 

here's<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:19.930> strim

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
here's a strim

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.680 
here's a strim
oh<00:03:21.989> that's<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:22.799> us

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
oh that's so us

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.420 
oh that's so us
and<00:03:25.260> again<00:03:25.500> like<00:03:25.710> with<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.980> strobe<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.340> can

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
and again like with the strobe you can

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.550 
and again like with the strobe you can
change<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.760> brightness<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.240> it<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:28.410> have<00:03:28.530> it

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
change the brightness of it and have it

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.280 
change the brightness of it and have it
on<00:03:28.710> the<00:03:28.770> maximum<00:03:29.040> brightness<00:03:29.960> or<00:03:30.960> you<00:03:31.170> can

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
on the maximum brightness or you can

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.710 
on the maximum brightness or you can
turn<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.590> down<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:31.950> lower<00:03:32.160> brightness<00:03:32.720> this

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
turn it down to a lower brightness this

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.910 
turn it down to a lower brightness this
whatever<00:03:33.990> you<00:03:34.080> need<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.350> then<00:03:34.440> again<00:03:34.680> just<00:03:34.860> to

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
whatever you need and then again just to

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.770 
whatever you need and then again just to
turn<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.280> SOS<00:03:35.970> off<00:03:36.210> you<00:03:36.420> turn<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.660> all<00:03:36.720> the

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
turn that SOS off you turn it all the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.540 
turn that SOS off you turn it all the
way<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.110> left<00:03:37.140> so<00:03:37.560> let's<00:03:38.190> throw<00:03:38.370> up<00:03:38.430> in<00:03:38.520> the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
way to the left so let's throw up in the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.000 
way to the left so let's throw up in the
SOS<00:03:38.940> mode<00:03:39.210> I<00:03:39.240> found<00:03:39.660> unless<00:03:40.500> you're<00:03:40.710> just<00:03:40.740> sort

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
SOS mode I found unless you're just sort

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.770 
SOS mode I found unless you're just sort
of<00:03:41.040> pulling<00:03:41.250> around<00:03:41.460> and<00:03:42.270> you<00:03:42.360> generally

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
of pulling around and you generally

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.290 
of pulling around and you generally
don't<00:03:42.960> activate<00:03:43.470> those<00:03:43.680> on<00:03:43.860> accident<00:03:44.430> in

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
don't activate those on accident in
