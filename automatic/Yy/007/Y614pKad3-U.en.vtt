00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.130

 hard face always existed and also 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:44.809
 had mom let's go over there for the decade 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.969
 of 50 when rock gave its first 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.100
 steps the musicians who scandalized 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.010
 everyone did it just for 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.960
 play rock and roll that music of 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.670
 devil according to the thinking people of 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.699
 that moment because to tell the truth 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.949
 seen today his pint did not impress 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.809
 too much rather those short hairs and 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.339
 Gummies gives them a profile 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.770
 gang members that at that time 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.960
 enough to shock a few 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.810
 and who would be the prototype of rock 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.450
 those years 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.210
 of course Mr. Elvis Presley 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.399
 all a rocker of law loved by the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.020
 girls loved by mothers-in-law and 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.240
 respected by the guys who 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.189
 they would copy the high coconut look and 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.960
 long sideburns yes even the very same 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.329
 john lennon when he was a purrete and 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.520
 I wanted to be like him, of course, lennon and 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.259
 then I would form the hippies would be one of 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.740
 those that would make the dirty so that the 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.869
 fashion evolves there are those who ask for those 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.170
 fringes the horror of the ladies of 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.200
 the 60s those were pelilargos leads 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.860
 even though with those suits so well 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.090
 designed the thing is given little tied 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.429

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.459

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.560
 what is this a boy of full years 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:00.289
 60 when the youth felt so 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.380
 free that even some chose not to 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.920
 to bathe in the end with so much beard and so much 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.829
 hair 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.420
 let's know who is behind everything 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:11.030
 but just as everything that goes up has to 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.640
 download everything that grows it has to 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.190
 cut and a decade later in the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.300
 70s rock again showed signs of 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.310

 and so much anger that he had seems that 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.710
 his hair was like that pointy 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.810
 so they wore their hairstyles flush those that 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.830
