00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.260 

we've<00:00:00.930> made<00:00:01.110> a<00:00:01.170> simple<00:00:01.530> PHP<00:00:01.920> interface<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:03.149> add

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
we've made a simple PHP interface to add

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.809 
we've made a simple PHP interface to add
new<00:00:03.629> data<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.290> database<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:05.100> in<00:00:05.609> this

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
new data to the database and in this

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.550 
new data to the database and in this
lesson<00:00:06.089> we'll<00:00:06.390> make<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.600> similar<00:00:06.960> one<00:00:07.319> to

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
lesson we'll make a similar one to

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.419 
lesson we'll make a similar one to
delete<00:00:08.130> data<00:00:09.200> will<00:00:10.200> do<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.559> HTML<00:00:11.130> interface

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
delete data will do the HTML interface

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.030 
delete data will do the HTML interface
together<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.389> then<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:12.929> want<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.530> adapt

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
together and then I want you to adapt

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.010 
together and then I want you to adapt
what<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.340> did<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.700> previous<00:00:14.849> lesson<00:00:15.389> to

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
what we did in the previous lesson to

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.620 
what we did in the previous lesson to
write<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.470> code<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:17.039> delete<00:00:17.550> data<00:00:17.850> instead<00:00:18.510> of

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
write the code to delete data instead of

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.970 
write the code to delete data instead of
inserting<00:00:19.020> it

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
inserting it

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.500 
inserting it
most<00:00:21.980> of<00:00:22.190> the<00:00:22.250> code<00:00:22.460> is<00:00:22.640> identical<00:00:22.790> to<00:00:23.360> that

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
most of the code is identical to that

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.210 
most of the code is identical to that
used<00:00:23.690> in<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.230> previous<00:00:24.440> lesson

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
used in the previous lesson

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.700 
used in the previous lesson
so<00:00:25.610> we'll<00:00:25.790> modify<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:26.420> two<00:00:26.780> scripts<00:00:27.170> we<00:00:27.410> just

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
so we'll modify the two scripts we just

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.890 
so we'll modify the two scripts we just
