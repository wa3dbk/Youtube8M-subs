00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960 
when pokemon was a like at first Mario
Brothers<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:11.280> add<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> green<00:01:11.729> one<00:01:11.939> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
Brothers you add the green one that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.870 
Brothers you add the green one that
represents<00:01:12.840> Luigi<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.340> red<00:01:14.520> one<00:01:14.729> that

represents Luigi and the red one that
represents<00:01:15.420> merrier<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.080> think<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.770> red<00:01:16.979> one

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
represents merrier I think the red one

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.160 
represents merrier I think the red one
it's<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.240> up<00:01:18.390> or<00:01:18.570> something<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.960> gives

it's like one up or something it gives

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.230 
it's like one up or something it gives
you<00:01:19.409> makes<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.920> bigger<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.490> then<00:01:21.000> there's<00:01:21.180> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
you makes you bigger and then there's a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.120 
you makes you bigger and then there's a
bigger<00:01:21.540> one<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.960> makes<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.320> even<00:01:22.619> bigger

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
bigger one that makes you even bigger

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.410 
bigger one that makes you even bigger
than<00:01:23.280> there's<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.580> giant<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.240> make<00:01:24.390> sure

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
than there's a giant one to make sure

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.730 
than there's a giant one to make sure
you<00:01:24.630> huge<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.610> think<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.060> green<00:01:27.840> mushroom

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
is like a life or something though if

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.469 
is like a life or something though if
you<00:01:31.110> die<00:01:31.350> an<00:01:31.770> extra<00:01:32.070> life<00:01:32.250> I'm<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:33.119> too<00:01:33.270> sure

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
you die an extra life I'm not too sure

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.969 
you die an extra life I'm not too sure
