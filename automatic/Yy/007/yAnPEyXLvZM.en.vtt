to this episode man here's the thing a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.920 
to this episode man here's the thing a
bunch<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.760> Chivas<00:02:24.030> last<00:02:24.360> week<00:02:24.630> were

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
bunch of Chivas last week were

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.410 
bunch of Chivas last week were
discussing<00:02:25.800> on<00:02:25.950> what<00:02:26.160> most<00:02:26.370> likely<00:02:26.490> cody<00:02:27.209> has

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
discussing on what most likely cody has

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.590 
discussing on what most likely cody has
and<00:02:28.520> after<00:02:29.520> reading<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.850> lot<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.120> your<00:02:30.240> guys's

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
and after reading a lot of your guys's

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.230 
and after reading a lot of your guys's
comments<00:02:31.020> last<00:02:31.320> week<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.950> think<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.880> kind<00:02:33.150> of

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
comments last week I think we kind of

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.760 
comments last week I think we kind of
finally<00:02:33.660> narrowed<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.140> down<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.530> what<00:02:34.650> it

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
finally narrowed it down for what it

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.390 
finally narrowed it down for what it
most<00:02:34.950> likely<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.870> als<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.590> know<00:02:37.680> about<00:02:37.770> ALS

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
most likely is als if you know about ALS

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.979 
most likely is als if you know about ALS
you'll<00:02:38.910> know<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.480> was<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.720> entire

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
you'll know that that was the entire

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.110 
you'll know that that was the entire
reason<00:02:40.020> for<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.680> ice<00:02:40.830> bucket<00:02:41.340> challenge<00:02:41.370> last

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
known cure of ALS and if this series

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.520 
known cure of ALS and if this series
wants<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.060> be<00:03:06.150> realistic<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.930> we've<00:03:07.140> had<00:03:07.320> no

supernatural<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:08.519> this<00:03:08.700> series<00:03:08.970> at<00:03:09.090> all<00:03:09.239> it's

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
supernatural in this series at all it's

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.479 
supernatural in this series at all it's
not<00:03:10.200> before<00:03:10.590> shadow<00:03:10.830> either

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
not before shadow either

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.110 
not before shadow either
that<00:03:12.150> means<00:03:12.420> if<00:03:13.019> she<00:03:13.560> does<00:03:13.769> have<00:03:13.799> ALS<00:03:14.370> she<00:03:14.910> is

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
that means if she does have ALS she is

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.150 
that means if she does have ALS she is
dying<00:03:15.420> she<00:03:15.840> will<00:03:16.049> die<00:03:16.290> like<00:03:16.650> there's<00:03:17.010> no

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
stopping that if she really does have

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.960 
stopping that if she really does have
that<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.160> here's<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.430> thing<00:03:20.610> I'm<00:03:20.820> getting

that and here's the thing I'm getting

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.910 
that and here's the thing I'm getting
from<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.360> if<00:03:21.600> she<00:03:21.870> really<00:03:22.260> does<00:03:22.470> have<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.890> I

from this if she really does have that I

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.970 
from this if she really does have that I
have<00:03:23.690> my<00:03:24.690> actual<00:03:25.200> thoughts<00:03:25.230> about<00:03:25.799> this

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
have my actual thoughts about this

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.180 
have my actual thoughts about this
series<00:03:26.900> this<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.079> just<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.410> fury<00:03:28.650> I'm<00:03:29.010> gonna

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.270 
series this is just a fury I'm gonna
discuss<00:03:29.579> this<00:03:29.820> if<00:03:30.750> clarity<00:03:31.350> does<00:03:31.680> really<00:03:32.070> have

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
discuss this if clarity does really have

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.610 
discuss this if clarity does really have
ALS<00:03:32.850> okay<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.540> if<00:03:33.690> we<00:03:33.870> judge<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.140> by<00:03:34.380> last

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
ALS okay and if we judge it by last

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.229 
ALS okay and if we judge it by last
year's<00:03:34.950> popularity<00:03:35.610> of<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.820> ice<00:03:35.970> bucket

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
year's popularity of the ice bucket

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.539 
year's popularity of the ice bucket
challenge<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.780> spread<00:03:37.140> awareness<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.739> ALS<00:03:38.010> I

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
challenge to spread awareness of ALS I

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.910 
challenge to spread awareness of ALS I
am<00:03:39.420> willing<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.750> bet<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.200> mom<00:03:40.440> who<00:03:40.620> come<00:03:40.799> all

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
am willing to bet the mom who come all

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.610 
am willing to bet the mom who come all
most<00:03:41.070> likely<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:42.030> doing<00:03:42.780> this<00:03:42.989> disease<00:03:43.380> on

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
most likely is doing this disease on

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.970 
most likely is doing this disease on
Cordy<00:03:44.070> because<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.720> spreads<00:03:46.320> awareness<00:03:46.590> of

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
Cordy because it spreads awareness of

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.280 
Cordy because it spreads awareness of
the<00:03:47.250> damages<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:47.880> ALS<00:03:48.540> does<00:03:49.130> that's<00:03:50.130> a<00:03:50.370> very

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
the damages that ALS does that's a very

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.720 
the damages that ALS does that's a very
smart<00:03:52.290> tactic<00:03:52.890> when<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.100> comes<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.400> writing<00:03:53.579> a

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
smart tactic when it comes to writing a

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.580 
smart tactic when it comes to writing a
series<00:03:54.120> like<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.510> know<00:03:54.660> spreading<00:03:55.410> awareness

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
series like you know spreading awareness

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.199 
series like you know spreading awareness
of<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.010> disease<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.549> why<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:56.880> needs<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.150> be

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
of a disease and why it needs to be

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.930 
of a disease and why it needs to be
fixed<00:03:57.750> if<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.769> really<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.519> route<00:03:59.700> that

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
fixed if that really is the route that

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.670 
fixed if that really is the route that
this<00:04:00.120> Monaco's<00:04:00.630> gonna<00:04:00.840> take<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:01.440> if<00:04:01.530> it

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
this Monaco's gonna take and if it

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.430 
this Monaco's gonna take and if it
