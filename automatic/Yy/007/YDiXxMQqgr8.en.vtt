00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 in the eyes and with bassi welcome to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.990
 another new video we are here in another 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.480
 gameplay more than big pautÃ³ 5 online in 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.759
 a very crazy and very extreme race like that 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.650
 that we're going to start and something that I 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.049
 I've always wondered is how can I 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.119
 put on the dust instead of the helmet or 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.580
 when I make a career always me 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.920
 puts the helmet and well it is normal that 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.050
 failures to fail at a start is fine 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.599
 it happened be the problem call do not go 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.039
 like a thousand times good is not so hard 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.359
 so there seems to be going to make them 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.489
 for here the good thing is that I put the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.260
 race without collision because if not this 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.809
 yes that trolling enough to see here we 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.320
 Let's go slowly and remember that the one 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.969
 endurance is the one that wins good no no no the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.920
 not really that does not help at all 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.230
 let's go like this to see now I have to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:52.320
 go through the cars in the junkyard 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.780
 ok let's grab we do not line up this 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.910
 time my voice is gone, it's that while 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.890
 my good saliva let's see 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.710
 now how do you intend me to go see 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.660
 it can happen like that ok ok ok ok well it's not 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.670
 so hard for what you see looks 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.870
 easy it does not look so difficult the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.800
 problem is that this thing 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.690
 troll and now to see here I brake ok 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.120
 well let's give it that way ok this pretty 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.620
 the race is cute and what is 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.810
 best of all is that it does not look so 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.550
 difficult like other races the good thing is 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.530
 that these are not the typical ones 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.900
 floating ramps because what shocks me 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.970
 these damn floating ramps is 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.730
 that drown in themselves yes they drown or 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.190
 be you the pizzas and things are overturned 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.200
 they move and total you lose the way 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.820
 well we already passed the first zone 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.250
 it seems that here I take the control point 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.200
 and with this we keep going forward to see 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.420
 let's go here look how nice 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.730
 landscape is that seriously these editors 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.040
 what good imagination they have is that they do not 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.350
 I do not understand how where does the 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.050
 imagination to the editors is that they see 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.730
 How beautiful that the landscape gives more 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.160
 the pure landscape of this race look 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.920
 what a beautiful landscape you see here 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.840
 damn middle landscape where yes yes yes is 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.830
 I'm stupid is that it's true 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.630
 that I if someone who likes 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.260
 nature then when you see it it 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.450
 It's exciting if it's something strange and good 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.970
 it's not the first time it's okay 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.319
 second one was passed for the third one depends 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.870
 Yes Yes 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.480
 If I already told myself, they automatically hang 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.280
 already already and she see that saying more let's 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.889
 go away tranquilitos I will not try to 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.260
 appreciate the beautiful landscape and better me 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.969
 I'm going to pass it more tranquilito ok me 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.859
 I fall where it is not right, it's fine 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.079
 there are mistakes in life there are 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.969
 accept it in fact many of you 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.769
 they will be saying that I am relaxed 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:37.540
 because in other races and I get well 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.549
 crazy but then you have to accept things 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.019
 as they are not in the race the truth is not 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.030
 it's hard in fact that's why we 're 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.040
 expressing in fact if I'm failing is 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.019
 By mistake, my mistake is not just 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.609
 nothing is more than anything my things and the 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.129
 career is not difficult is what fits 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:53.980
 doing here that we already closed by 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:56.019
 here is easy yes yes yes you are 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.760
 capabilities that difficult then after 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.680
 know well that when it explodes as a 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.689
 I motorcycle a car or something scares me because 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.549
 live and free control and like me 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.799
 move everything yes yes come here exploded 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.780
 something in fact you will have seen a 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.120
 movement of the screen and for little more 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.790
 I have it there I almost broke all my 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.329
 command and it fit him to see I think that 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:20.530
 uy uy uy no no because I brake because the 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:21.909
 brake will not play is this I do not know for 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.439
 what brakes that six shades that for what 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.510
 brake to see let's throw us out fast 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:29.220
 not because I'm as calm as it gets back 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.800
 to see more over here ok 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.870
 let's go, it's not that I'm telling you something 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.120
 when the pinche of this 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.190
 gasoline container everything becomes 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.930
 exaggeratedly difficult because because I already 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.610
 you can not use it from rahm pilla to see 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.020
 this was what I did not want to happen to me 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.880
 I did not want to throw myself with other people 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.560
 because when it is thorax I 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.480
 deconcentrated everything I do not know other people 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.000
 but I became increasingly deconcentrated 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.650
 we were here ok now let's go 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.760
 everything forwards or that we are going to leave 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.560
 here 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.300
 this is easy how hard comes right 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.090
 then to see here we go like this all 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.860
 normalito we pass here here and 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.070
 we're going all normal as if it did not happen 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.220
 nothing although I do not give up like that ok to see 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.510
 here I will load the impulse ok win if 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.250
 I knew I had to close it because 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.350
 I knew that if I was not going to see 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.160
 here from what I see already arrived ok we go in 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.200
 first place 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.239
 we just came back gentlemen we just 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.650
 go up so we go here although the 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.820
 career is pretty pretty indeed 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.680
 I really like this 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.450
 If someone knows who I say something to 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.120
 I do not like to use the helmet is that I 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.760
 I know that the security of everything but in the 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.230
 grand theft auto 'will communicate with or if 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.430
 someone knows how to remove the helmet for 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.320
 Careers so please tell me please 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.580
 because I hate helmets or I want to 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.830
 have my car mask 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.810
 Mr. Don Macario and I do not love the 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.770
 plan they know then let's go by 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.650
 here ok 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.060
 the race is pretty good and it's that 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.680
 I do not want to fall is that if I fall I 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.259
 I'm going to break all my tangerine into segments 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.139
 and that's something we do not want to know not 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.830
 I know where the subscribers go to see 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.629
 come on I do not know the truth 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.610

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.319

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.280
 over here and now where is the point 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.169
 control they know is that this happens to me 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.520
 always play the area I was going to see them 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.020
 I know I really do not know where they are 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.819

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.000

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.180
 of pretty pretty nature this 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.979

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.789
 good race guys like they see it 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.440
 extremely entertaining career to me 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.599
 liked it more than anything because of the beautiful landscape 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.120
 they had a very beautiful landscape this 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.830
 like everything is inside the jungle 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.139
 like you have to go between the rocks 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.259
 I do not know, it was pretty nice, really 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.489

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.139
