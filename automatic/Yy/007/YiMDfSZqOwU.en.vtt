00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.180
 we present the reference oximeter 50 hp 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.180
 of this is an oximeter with 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.860
 pediatric characteristics because we're going 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.860
 to appreciate how it comes 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.040
 in its metallic luxury case really 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:26.960
 bring your laptop case something 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:30.220
 fundamental rechargeable lithium battery 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.220
 I repeat rechargeable 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.800
 and we find ourselves with a size 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:50.610
 50 percent more than the oximeter 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.010
 normal for an adult then that 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.870
 pressure here an adverse entry mouth 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.410
 It is an entrance mouth of an oximeter of 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.750
 adult 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.960
 they may realize that the difference 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.600
 makes it that edge in a kind of 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.090
 foam that substantially reduces the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.620
 real area and in the end it ends up being the 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.350
 half 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.350
 let's put him then his battery 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.720
 and appreciate the operation 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.430
 something interesting to see in stocks and 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.920
 meter is that if you are set to weigh 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.570
 that the mouth is so small he has 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.240
 a property for example on the finger of 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.390
 one side then I put it on the squad 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.909
 and it's in the back 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.530
 that facility makes it incredibly 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.360
 functional because the fact that it 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.159
 lift allows oximetry to be taken 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.500
 also perfect in an adult and 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.289
 obviously if it is not that way 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.520
 completely in its original state then 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.520
 Perfectly accommodates a baby 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.640
 have an auditory alarm as they can 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.150
 listen in the video 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.260
 right now I'm saturating 92 and the 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.180
 pulse 75 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.260
 and if we were to use it on a baby 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.650
 I repeat when I take my finger the stop 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.379
 get up closes completely 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.060
 and because this is what allows 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.610
 again when you put your finger on 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.129
 Baby work just like in the adult 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.129
 perfect comes with its charger 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.379
 s that will allow the corresponding 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.379
 Connection 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.690
 to the normal outlet that is coming 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.910
 against this shot and this is the one that 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.890
 connects you the electric current is a 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.750
 product that we really recommend 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.210
 has been very successful in the use 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.160
 for children and good is available for 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.270
 between immediately enough that they call us 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.270
 and we will gladly send them
