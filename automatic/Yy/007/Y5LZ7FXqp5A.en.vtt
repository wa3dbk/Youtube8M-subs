angle of view which is extremely wide

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.910 
angle of view which is extremely wide
and<00:00:31.790> it's<00:00:32.790> about<00:00:32.850> oh<00:00:33.329> one<00:00:33.930> or<00:00:34.079> two<00:00:34.260> pounds<00:00:34.469> and

so you'd like for me personally I never

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.959 
so you'd like for me personally I never
noticed<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.190> camera<00:00:38.520> almost<00:00:38.670> it's

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
noticed it on the camera almost it's

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.520 
noticed it on the camera almost it's
almost<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.329> you're<00:00:39.450> just<00:00:39.600> holding<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
almost like you're just holding the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.490 
almost like you're just holding the
weight<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.219> camera<00:00:41.910> body<00:00:42.200> so<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.320> great

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
weight of the camera body so it's great

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.400 
weight of the camera body so it's great
for<00:00:43.530> walking<00:00:43.950> around<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:45.390> lens<00:00:45.570> itself<00:00:45.899> great

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
for walking around the lens itself great

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.080 
for walking around the lens itself great
build<00:00:46.620> quality<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.129> get<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.280> kind<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
build quality you get a kind of like a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.590 
build quality you get a kind of like a
full<00:00:48.420> lens<00:00:49.289> cap<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.860> protect<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:51.510> of

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
full lens cap to protect it and of

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.810 
full lens cap to protect it and of
course<00:00:51.840> has<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.110> bubbled<00:00:52.530> front<00:00:52.770> end<00:00:52.949> which

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
course has the bubbled front end which

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.000 
course has the bubbled front end which
is<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.449> thing<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.320> don't<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
is one thing that I don't like about the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.520 
is one thing that I don't like about the
lens<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:56.699> obviously<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:58.140> can't<00:00:58.350> put<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
lens because obviously you can't put a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.900 
lens because obviously you can't put a
filter<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.039> however<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.520> still<00:00:59.609> use

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
filter on it however you can still use

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.080 
filter on it however you can still use
with<00:01:00.780> these<00:01:00.899> little<00:01:01.020> side<00:01:01.289> things<00:01:01.559> like<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
with these little side things like a

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.039 
with these little side things like a
graduated<00:01:03.090> neutral<00:01:03.180> density<00:01:03.390> or<00:01:03.750> something

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
graduated neutral density or something

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.899 
graduated neutral density or something
because<00:01:04.229> it'll<00:01:04.559> lay<00:01:04.920> flat<00:01:05.189> against<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.580> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
because it'll lay flat against this and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.640 
because it'll lay flat against this and
then<00:01:06.060> barely<00:01:06.450> has<00:01:06.990> enough<00:01:07.020> room<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.439> it

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
then barely has enough room so it

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.370 
then barely has enough room so it
doesn't<00:01:07.920> touch<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.280> lens<00:01:09.260> but<00:01:10.260> it's

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
doesn't touch the lens but it's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.010 
doesn't touch the lens but it's
extremely<00:01:10.740> fast<00:01:10.950> focusing<00:01:11.610> great<00:01:12.450> build<00:01:12.720> and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
extremely fast focusing great build and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.929 
extremely fast focusing great build and
so<00:01:13.439> if<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.189> lens<00:01:14.460> or<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.790> have

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
so if you do get this lens or you have

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.140 
so if you do get this lens or you have
it<00:01:15.119> always<00:01:15.299> make<00:01:15.930> sure<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:17.369> know<00:01:17.490> your

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
it always make sure that you know your

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.490 
it always make sure that you know your
little<00:01:18.299> bubble<00:01:18.420> front<00:01:18.750> end<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.049> there<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
little bubble front end is there and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.149 
little bubble front end is there and
that<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.770> don't<00:01:19.890> hit<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.580> or<00:01:20.729> scratch<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:22.159> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
that you don't hit it or scratch it the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.859 
that you don't hit it or scratch it the
things<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.700> don't<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:24.030> about<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.330> lens<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
things I don't like about the lens is

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.859 
things I don't like about the lens is
that<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.650> only<00:01:25.770> goes<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.100> f-22<00:01:26.700> which<00:01:27.570> will<00:01:27.720> go

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
that it only goes to f-22 which will go

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.789 
that it only goes to f-22 which will go
tad<00:01:28.229> higher<00:01:28.500> than<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.970> for<00:01:30.619> longer<00:01:31.619> shutter

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
tad higher than that for longer shutter

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.160 
tad higher than that for longer shutter
speeds<00:01:32.189> during<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> daylight<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.079> you're

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
speeds during the daylight so if you're

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.640 
speeds during the daylight so if you're
trying<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.409> no<00:01:34.530> blur<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.520> water<00:01:35.990> at<00:01:36.990> f-22

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
trying to no blur the water at f-22

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.710 
trying to no blur the water at f-22
sometimes<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.759> can't<00:01:38.939> get<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> slow<00:01:39.600> enough

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
sometimes you can't get a slow enough

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.719 
sometimes you can't get a slow enough
shutter<00:01:40.020> speed<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.320> get<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.680> really<00:01:41.100> awesome

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
shutter speed to get that really awesome

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.940 
shutter speed to get that really awesome
blur<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.899> course<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.170> can't<00:01:43.380> put<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
blur and of course you can't put a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.389 
blur and of course you can't put a
neutral<00:01:44.670> density<00:01:44.700> or<00:01:45.649> polarizer<00:01:46.649> or<00:01:47.189> any

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
neutral density or polarizer or any

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.010 
neutral density or polarizer or any
other<00:01:47.579> kind<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.880> filter<00:01:48.180> on<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> lens<00:01:48.750> because

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
other kind of filter on the lens because

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.139 
other kind of filter on the lens because
it<00:01:49.110> doesn't<00:01:49.320> have<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> filter<00:01:49.710> thread<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:51.030> those

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
it doesn't have a filter thread so those

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.149 
it doesn't have a filter thread so those
are<00:01:51.240> probably<00:01:51.420> only<00:01:51.720> two<00:01:52.110> things<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.130> don't

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
are probably only two things I don't

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.510 
are probably only two things I don't
like<00:01:53.340> about<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.700> lens<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:55.189> even<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.340> had

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
like about the lens and even if you had

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.609 
like about the lens and even if you had
an<00:01:56.640> adapter<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.240> lens<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.350> wide

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
an adapter for the lens it's so wide

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.560 
an adapter for the lens it's so wide
that<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.280> set<00:01:59.549> something<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.390> lens

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
that if you set something on the lens

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.859 
that if you set something on the lens
right<00:02:00.810> here<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.590> lens<00:02:01.799> would<00:02:01.979> see<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.869> as

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
right here the lens would see that as

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.330 
right here the lens would see that as
far<00:02:03.930> as<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.409> an<00:02:04.500> adapter<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:04.950> something<00:02:05.250> on

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
far as like an adapter or something on

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.449 
far as like an adapter or something on
the<00:02:05.399> outside<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.290> fantastic<00:02:07.979> lens

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
the outside so it's just fantastic lens

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.710 
the outside so it's just fantastic lens
it<00:02:08.700> picks<00:02:08.910> up<00:02:09.060> anything<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.599> everything

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
it picks up anything and everything

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.260 
it picks up anything and everything
you<00:02:10.990> can<00:02:11.140> imagine<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:11.850> online<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:12.880> think<00:02:13.180> it

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
you can imagine and online I think it

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.640 
you can imagine and online I think it
says<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.570> has<00:02:13.660> like<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.900> minimum<00:02:14.290> focusing

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
says it has like a minimum focusing

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.580 
says it has like a minimum focusing
distance<00:02:14.710> of<00:02:15.160> like<00:02:15.340> 8<00:02:16.030> inches<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.690> I've

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
distance of like 8 inches and I've

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.850 
distance of like 8 inches and I've
focused<00:02:18.460> images<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.210> close<00:02:19.450> where<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.410> front

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
focused images so close where the front

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.260 
focused images so close where the front
bubble<00:02:21.160> element<00:02:21.490> is<00:02:21.610> almost<00:02:21.820> touching

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
bubble element is almost touching

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.770 
bubble element is almost touching
whatever<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.350> subject<00:02:23.560> may<00:02:23.860> be<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:25.570> it's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
whatever the subject may be and so it's

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.840 
whatever the subject may be and so it's
fantastic<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.890> if<00:02:27.160> you're<00:02:27.310> looking<00:02:27.460> for<00:02:27.760> an

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
fantastic and if you're looking for an

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.940 
fantastic and if you're looking for an
extremely<00:02:28.060> wide<00:02:28.480> angle<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:29.110> would<00:02:29.470> definitely

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
extremely wide angle I would definitely

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.130 
extremely wide angle I would definitely
recommend<00:02:30.040> this<00:02:30.490> like<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.240> said<00:02:31.450> it's<00:02:31.840> just

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
recommend this like I said it's just

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.740 
recommend this like I said it's just
used<00:02:32.650> for<00:02:33.340> anything<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:33.790> everything<00:02:33.880> because

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
used for anything and everything because

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.960 
used for anything and everything because
you<00:02:34.810> can<00:02:34.930> focus<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:35.410> close<00:02:35.680> or<00:02:35.980> far<00:02:36.010> away<00:02:36.520> for

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
you can focus so close or far away for

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.020 
you can focus so close or far away for
great<00:02:37.480> landscapes<00:02:38.080> or<00:02:38.380> if<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.460> want<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.910> know

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
great landscapes or if you want you know

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.760 
great landscapes or if you want you know
the<00:02:40.330> action<00:02:40.780> sports<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.380> can<00:02:41.500> be<00:02:41.590> laying

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
the action sports you can be laying

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.140 
the action sports you can be laying
underneath<00:02:42.130> them<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.490> they<00:02:42.550> jump<00:02:42.760> over<00:02:43.030> you

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
underneath them and they jump over you

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.300 
underneath them and they jump over you
and<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.420> can<00:02:43.540> get<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.720> great<00:02:43.900> picture<00:02:44.320> the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
and you can get the great picture the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.940 
and you can get the great picture the
storm<00:02:45.610> isn't<00:02:46.000> as<00:02:46.060> bad<00:02:46.209> as<00:02:46.270> everyone<00:02:46.600> says<00:02:46.950> if

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
storm isn't as bad as everyone says if

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.130 
storm isn't as bad as everyone says if
you<00:02:48.100> have<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.370> know<00:02:48.400> 8<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.450> 15<00:02:49.600> millimeter

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
you have you know 8 to 15 millimeter

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.910 
you have you know 8 to 15 millimeter
fisheye<00:02:50.530> that<00:02:51.180> distorts<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.450> lot<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.290> that's

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
fisheye that distorts a lot and that's

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.550 
fisheye that distorts a lot and that's
of<00:02:54.130> course<00:02:54.160> is<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.700> fisheye<00:02:55.060> but<00:02:55.270> this<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.690> have

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
of course is the fisheye but this I have

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.210 
of course is the fisheye but this I have
a<00:02:56.620> sample<00:02:56.860> video<00:02:57.430> at<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.820> end<00:02:59.010> that<00:03:00.010> shows

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
a sample video at the end that shows

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.280 
a sample video at the end that shows
that<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.550> doesn't<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.209> store<00:03:01.570> unless<00:03:01.840> you

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
that it doesn't the store unless you

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.460 
that it doesn't the store unless you
want<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.070> distort<00:03:03.490> and<00:03:03.730> so<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:05.200> can<00:03:05.350> get

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
want it to distort and so you can get

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.440 
want it to distort and so you can get
incredibly<00:03:05.920> sharp<00:03:06.130> images<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:06.940> don't<00:03:07.300> have

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
incredibly sharp images and don't have

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.390 
incredibly sharp images and don't have
to<00:03:07.540> have<00:03:07.770> all<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:09.040> post-production

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
to have all the post-production

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.630 
to have all the post-production
afterwards<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.600> lens<00:03:11.560> correction<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.250> doing

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
afterwards of lens correction and doing

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.600 
afterwards of lens correction and doing
all<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:12.940> for<00:03:13.330> buildings<00:03:14.040> but<00:03:15.040> anyways<00:03:15.370> here

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
all that for buildings but anyways here

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.729 
all that for buildings but anyways here
are<00:03:15.790> some<00:03:17.310> sample<00:03:18.310> images<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:20.110> I<00:03:20.140> took<00:03:20.230> a

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
are some sample images that I took a

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.830 
are some sample images that I took a
while<00:03:21.550> back<00:03:21.790> in<00:03:21.820> Rocky<00:03:22.540> Mountain<00:03:22.780> National

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
while back in Rocky Mountain National

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.690 
while back in Rocky Mountain National
Park<00:03:23.290> just<00:03:23.320> for<00:03:23.680> this<00:03:23.830> video<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:24.340> none<00:03:24.489> of<00:03:24.610> them

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
Park just for this video so none of them

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.750 
Park just for this video so none of them
are<00:03:24.959> fantastic<00:03:25.959> shots<00:03:26.620> but<00:03:26.860> this<00:03:27.550> is<00:03:27.640> just

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
are fantastic shots but this is just

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.509 
are fantastic shots but this is just
showing<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.650> minimum<00:03:29.650> focusing<00:03:30.010> distance<00:03:30.070> I

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
showing the minimum focusing distance I

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.820 
showing the minimum focusing distance I
was<00:03:30.580> probably<00:03:30.880> like<00:03:31.120> Oh<00:03:31.390> an<00:03:32.260> inch<00:03:32.440> or<00:03:32.650> two

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
was probably like Oh an inch or two

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.120 
was probably like Oh an inch or two
inches<00:03:33.040> away<00:03:33.340> from<00:03:34.150> this<00:03:34.660> tree<00:03:34.989> stump<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.500> as

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
inches away from this tree stump and as

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.910 
inches away from this tree stump and as
you<00:03:36.280> can<00:03:36.370> see<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.840> get<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.050> whole<00:03:38.260> bottom<00:03:38.800> of

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
you can see you get the whole bottom of

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.610 
you can see you get the whole bottom of
the<00:03:39.010> tree<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.459> some<00:03:39.730> of<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.850> background<00:03:40.030> and

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
the tree and some of the background and

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.190 
the tree and some of the background and
so<00:03:41.620> this<00:03:41.799> is<00:03:41.920> probably<00:03:42.220> maybe<00:03:42.370> oh<00:03:42.760> 3<00:03:43.540> or<00:03:43.690> 4<00:03:43.989> foot

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
so this is probably maybe oh 3 or 4 foot

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.190 
so this is probably maybe oh 3 or 4 foot
tall<00:03:44.260> stump<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.340> of<00:03:46.180> course<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.510> top<00:03:46.720> looks

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
tall stump and of course the top looks

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.440 
tall stump and of course the top looks
extremely<00:03:47.830> huge<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.820> bottom<00:03:49.090> just<00:03:49.209> falls

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
extremely huge and the bottom just falls

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.330 
extremely huge and the bottom just falls
off<00:03:49.660> as<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:49.930> can<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:50.650> know<00:03:50.769> tell<00:03:50.980> what<00:03:51.190> else

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
off as you can you know tell what else

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.490 
off as you can you know tell what else
was<00:03:51.519> there<00:03:51.700> but<00:03:52.600> that<00:03:52.750> just<00:03:52.870> shows<00:03:52.959> how<00:03:53.200> close

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
was there but that just shows how close

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.500 
was there but that just shows how close
you<00:03:53.650> can<00:03:53.769> focus<00:03:53.980> with<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.400> this<00:03:55.299> was<00:03:55.480> a

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
you can focus with it this was a

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.789 
you can focus with it this was a
vertical<00:03:55.900> shot<00:03:56.080> I<00:03:56.110> did<00:03:56.320> just<00:03:56.470> to<00:03:56.560> show<00:03:56.739> you

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
vertical shot I did just to show you

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.090 
vertical shot I did just to show you
that<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:57.730> picked<00:03:57.970> up<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:59.380> other<00:03:59.500> set<00:03:59.739> of<00:03:59.830> trees

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
that it picked up the other set of trees

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.789 
that it picked up the other set of trees
up<00:04:00.400> here<00:04:00.600> this<00:04:01.600> was<00:04:01.750> on<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:01.900> road<00:04:02.140> going<00:04:02.560> up<00:04:02.650> to

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
up here this was on a road going up to

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.240 
up here this was on a road going up to
our<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:04.269> pro<00:04:04.420> of<00:04:05.019> Trail<00:04:05.410> Ridge<00:04:05.650> or<00:04:05.950> I<00:04:06.130> don't

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
our the pro of Trail Ridge or I don't

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.789 
our the pro of Trail Ridge or I don't
know<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:06.670> top<00:04:06.850> of<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:08.320> point<00:04:08.530> there

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
know to the top of the the point there

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.050 
know to the top of the the point there
and<00:04:08.950> I<00:04:09.010> just<00:04:09.160> pulled<00:04:09.340> off<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.580> side<00:04:09.760> of<00:04:09.880> roads

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
and I just pulled off the side of roads

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.009 
and I just pulled off the side of roads
to<00:04:10.330> show<00:04:10.510> that<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:12.370> road<00:04:12.549> with<00:04:12.820> down<00:04:13.030> here<00:04:13.060> is

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
to show that the road with down here is

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.650 
to show that the road with down here is
just<00:04:14.440> below<00:04:14.709> these<00:04:14.980> trees<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:15.790> doing<00:04:16.570> a

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
just below these trees and doing a

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.990 
just below these trees and doing a
vertical<00:04:16.900> shot<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:17.859> picked<00:04:18.400> up<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.820> other<00:04:18.849> half

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
vertical shot I picked up the other half

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.650 
vertical shot I picked up the other half
the<00:04:19.330> trees<00:04:19.630> and

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
the trees and

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
the trees and
the<00:04:21.230> Sun<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:22.250> here's<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.640> shot<00:04:22.850> just<00:04:23.120> that

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
the Sun and here's the shot just that

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.260 
the Sun and here's the shot just that
horizontal<00:04:24.680> wide-angle<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.610> so<00:04:25.940> you<00:04:26.000> pick<00:04:26.150> up

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
horizontal wide-angle and so you pick up

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.760 
horizontal wide-angle and so you pick up
a<00:04:26.360> lot<00:04:26.480> of<00:04:26.570> trees<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:27.050> as<00:04:27.140> you<00:04:27.260> can<00:04:27.320> see<00:04:27.530> with

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
a lot of trees and as you can see with

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.350 
a lot of trees and as you can see with
the<00:04:27.860> trees<00:04:28.160> because<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:28.880> was<00:04:28.970> pretty<00:04:29.090> close

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
the trees because it was pretty close

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.090 
the trees because it was pretty close
they<00:04:29.630> start<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:30.020> kind<00:04:30.200> of<00:04:30.230> bow<00:04:30.440> in<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:30.950> get

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
they start to kind of bow in you get

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.920 
they start to kind of bow in you get
that<00:04:31.280> circular<00:04:32.030> effect<00:04:32.360> I<00:04:32.510> don't<00:04:32.600> know<00:04:32.780> how

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
that circular effect I don't know how

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.520 
that circular effect I don't know how
well<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:34.310> can<00:04:34.430> tell<00:04:34.640> but<00:04:34.850> they<00:04:34.970> slightly<00:04:35.720> kind

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
well you can tell but they slightly kind

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.250 
well you can tell but they slightly kind
of<00:04:36.710> sweep<00:04:37.610> in<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.030> all<00:04:38.540> kind<00:04:38.900> of<00:04:38.930> angle

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
of sweep in and all kind of angle

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.410 
of sweep in and all kind of angle
towards<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.680> middle<00:04:40.120> but<00:04:41.120> here<00:04:41.240> is<00:04:41.360> a

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
towards the middle but here is a

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.040 
towards the middle but here is a
landscape<00:04:41.900> shot<00:04:42.460> at<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.610> top<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:44.180> or<00:04:44.690> half<00:04:44.870> way

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
landscape shot at the top of or half way

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.510 
landscape shot at the top of or half way
up<00:04:45.170> the<00:04:45.260> mountain

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
up the mountain

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.080 
up the mountain
that<00:04:46.790> just<00:04:47.060> shows<00:04:47.600> that<00:04:48.370> at<00:04:49.370> 14<00:04:49.760> millimeter

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
that just shows that at 14 millimeter

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.550 
that just shows that at 14 millimeter
how<00:04:50.930> much<00:04:51.110> you<00:04:51.260> can<00:04:51.380> capture<00:04:51.980> of<00:04:52.820> landscape

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
how much you can capture of landscape

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.580 
how much you can capture of landscape
same<00:04:54.560> thing<00:04:54.770> with<00:04:54.920> this<00:04:55.510> and<00:04:56.510> this<00:04:56.720> shows<00:04:56.990> the

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
same thing with this and this shows the

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.260 
same thing with this and this shows the
different<00:04:58.220> kind<00:04:58.430> of<00:04:58.460> perspectives<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.240> can

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
different kind of perspectives you can

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.480 
different kind of perspectives you can
get<00:04:59.540> so<00:05:00.530> the<00:05:00.620> camera<00:05:00.860> is<00:05:00.920> pretty<00:05:01.070> close<00:05:01.280> to<00:05:01.400> the

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
get so the camera is pretty close to the

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.030 
get so the camera is pretty close to the
ground<00:05:02.020> probably<00:05:03.020> three<00:05:03.410> or<00:05:03.500> four<00:05:03.650> inches<00:05:03.890> off

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
ground probably three or four inches off

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.190 
ground probably three or four inches off
the<00:05:04.070> ground<00:05:04.520> but<00:05:05.420> it<00:05:05.540> makes<00:05:05.660> all<00:05:05.810> these<00:05:05.960> rocks

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
the ground but it makes all these rocks

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.560 
the ground but it makes all these rocks
look<00:05:06.710> extremely<00:05:07.070> kind<00:05:07.490> of<00:05:07.580> elongated<00:05:08.150> and<00:05:08.360> big

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
look extremely kind of elongated and big

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.340 
look extremely kind of elongated and big
it<00:05:09.560> makes<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:09.950> background<00:05:10.960> proportions<00:05:11.960> look

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
it makes the background proportions look

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.190 
it makes the background proportions look
smaller<00:05:13.040> I<00:05:13.190> guess<00:05:13.430> you<00:05:13.550> could<00:05:13.670> say<00:05:13.850> and<00:05:14.150> so<00:05:15.140> you

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
smaller I guess you could say and so you

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.450 
smaller I guess you could say and so you
can<00:05:15.620> get<00:05:15.680> a<00:05:15.740> lot<00:05:15.890> of<00:05:16.010> different<00:05:17.980> I'm<00:05:18.980> not<00:05:19.040> sure

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
can get a lot of different I'm not sure

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.870 
can get a lot of different I'm not sure
how<00:05:19.580> to<00:05:19.640> explain<00:05:20.300> it<00:05:20.360> per<00:05:20.690> se<00:05:20.900> but<00:05:21.730> you<00:05:22.730> give

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
how to explain it per se but you give

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.530 
how to explain it per se but you give
different<00:05:23.240> I<00:05:23.570> don't<00:05:24.440> know<00:05:24.500> looks<00:05:24.920> two<00:05:25.130> shots

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
different I don't know looks two shots

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.300 
different I don't know looks two shots
depending<00:05:26.540> on<00:05:26.630> where<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:26.960> camera<00:05:27.530> is<00:05:27.560> same

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
depending on where the camera is same

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.770 
depending on where the camera is same
thing<00:05:28.490> here<00:05:28.700> as<00:05:28.880> far<00:05:29.060> as<00:05:29.120> the<00:05:29.270> rocks<00:05:29.450> really

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
thing here as far as the rocks really

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.550 
thing here as far as the rocks really
tiny<00:05:29.990> but<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:30.950> perspective<00:05:31.460> is<00:05:32.270> different

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
tiny but the perspective is different

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.620 
tiny but the perspective is different
same<00:05:33.560> thing<00:05:33.740> here<00:05:33.920> the<00:05:34.100> field<00:05:34.370> that<00:05:35.360> was<00:05:35.450> kind

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
same thing here the field that was kind

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.330 
same thing here the field that was kind
of<00:05:35.690> there<00:05:35.870> was<00:05:36.140> actually<00:05:36.440> pretty<00:05:36.650> tiny<00:05:36.920> with

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
of there was actually pretty tiny with

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.070 
of there was actually pretty tiny with
the<00:05:37.430> mountains<00:05:37.730> in<00:05:37.790> the<00:05:37.850> back<00:05:38.000> but<00:05:38.870> with<00:05:38.960> the

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
the mountains in the back but with the

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.980 
the mountains in the back but with the
camera<00:05:39.470> on<00:05:39.650> the<00:05:40.070> bottom<00:05:40.870> almost<00:05:41.870> on<00:05:41.960> the

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
camera on the bottom almost on the

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.970 
camera on the bottom almost on the
ground<00:05:42.250> you<00:05:43.250> get<00:05:43.340> more<00:05:43.580> of<00:05:43.730> a<00:05:43.880> wider<00:05:44.480> angle<00:05:44.980> and

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
ground you get more of a wider angle and

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.680 
ground you get more of a wider angle and
so<00:05:46.100> that's<00:05:46.280> pretty<00:05:46.730> much<00:05:46.910> as<00:05:47.120> far<00:05:47.240> sample

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
so that's pretty much as far sample

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.810 
so that's pretty much as far sample
images<00:05:48.020> and<00:05:48.440> information<00:05:49.310> so<00:05:49.550> if<00:05:49.640> you<00:05:49.730> have

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
images and information so if you have

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.760 
images and information so if you have
any<00:05:49.970> other<00:05:50.150> questions<00:05:50.660> or<00:05:51.050> something<00:05:51.500> I<00:05:51.650> may

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
my house you get a very wide perspective

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.930 
my house you get a very wide perspective
which<00:06:26.510> is<00:06:26.540> with<00:06:26.960> his<00:06:27.110> lens<00:06:27.410> and<00:06:28.010> the<00:06:28.760> thing

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
which is with his lens and the thing

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.100 
which is with his lens and the thing
that<00:06:29.060> I<00:06:29.090> love<00:06:29.300> the<00:06:29.330> most<00:06:29.450> and<00:06:30.080> just

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
that I love the most and just

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.690 
that I love the most and just
demonstrate<00:06:30.890> the

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
demonstrate the

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.970 
demonstrate the
is<00:06:31.790> the<00:06:32.030> minimum<00:06:32.570> focusing<00:06:32.990> distance<00:06:33.080> so<00:06:33.590> the

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
is the minimum focusing distance so the

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.930 
is the minimum focusing distance so the
front<00:06:34.250> of<00:06:34.520> the<00:06:35.030> lens<00:06:35.270> is<00:06:35.600> about<00:06:36.290> to<00:06:36.530> touch<00:06:36.940> this

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
front of the lens is about to touch this

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.210 
front of the lens is about to touch this
flower<00:06:38.300> and<00:06:38.630> it<00:06:39.200> still<00:06:39.410> focuses<00:06:39.890> to<00:06:40.070> about

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
flower and it still focuses to about

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.350 
flower and it still focuses to about
right<00:06:40.370> there<00:06:40.430> you<00:06:40.700> can<00:06:40.820> see<00:06:40.940> the<00:06:41.060> camera

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
right there you can see the camera

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.350 
right there you can see the camera
starts<00:06:41.600> to<00:06:41.660> create<00:06:41.840> a<00:06:41.900> shadow<00:06:42.670> and<00:06:43.670> so<00:06:43.970> it

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
starts to create a shadow and so it

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.940 
starts to create a shadow and so it
focuses<00:06:45.110> extremely<00:06:45.710> close<00:06:46.010> and<00:06:46.280> so<00:06:47.770> you<00:06:48.770> get<00:06:48.890> a

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:48.950 
focuses extremely close and so you get a

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.220 
focuses extremely close and so you get a
really<00:06:49.190> wide<00:06:49.430> angle<00:06:50.150> with<00:06:50.270> it<00:06:50.450> and<00:06:50.600> the

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
really wide angle with it and the

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.220 
really wide angle with it and the
distortion<00:06:51.770> isn't<00:06:52.340> what<00:06:52.660> most<00:06:53.660> people<00:06:53.960> say<00:06:54.140> it

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:54.230 
distortion isn't what most people say it

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.380 
distortion isn't what most people say it
is<00:06:54.290> as<00:06:54.470> far<00:06:54.680> as<00:06:54.710> the<00:06:54.920> trees<00:06:55.390> according

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
is as far as the trees according

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.750 
is as far as the trees according
widescreen<00:06:56.870> or<00:06:57.020> straight<00:06:57.320> up<00:06:57.440> and<00:06:57.560> down<00:06:57.760> and

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
widescreen or straight up and down and

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.150 
widescreen or straight up and down and
they<00:06:58.850> normally<00:06:59.030> are<00:06:59.800> always<00:07:00.800> even<00:07:01.040> in<00:07:01.130> a

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
they normally are always even in a

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.560 
they normally are always even in a
landscape<00:07:01.490> picture

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:02.570 
landscape picture

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.120 
landscape picture
so<00:07:02.900> hopefully<00:07:03.080> the<00:07:03.290> noise<00:07:03.470> wasn't<00:07:03.860> too<00:07:03.950> bad

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.130 
so hopefully the noise wasn't too bad

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.670 
so hopefully the noise wasn't too bad
from<00:07:04.340> the<00:07:04.490> wind<00:07:04.730> and<00:07:05.060> I<00:07:06.050> hope<00:07:06.230> you<00:07:06.380> enjoyed

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
from the wind and I hope you enjoyed

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.130 
from the wind and I hope you enjoyed
