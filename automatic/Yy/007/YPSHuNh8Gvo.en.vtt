00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
talked to say they one of the reasons

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.270 
talked to say they one of the reasons
why<00:00:08.360> they<00:00:08.540> don't<00:00:08.690> build<00:00:09.260> a<00:00:09.440> backyard<00:00:09.920> rink<00:00:10.130> at

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
why they don't build a backyard rink at

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.370 
why they don't build a backyard rink at
their<00:00:10.429> house<00:00:10.610> is<00:00:10.880> because<00:00:11.030> it's<00:00:11.750> too<00:00:11.990> much<00:00:12.200> to

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
their house is because it's too much to

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.440 
their house is because it's too much to
maintain<00:00:12.700> while<00:00:13.700> there's<00:00:13.880> a<00:00:13.940> lot<00:00:14.059> of<00:00:14.150> snow<00:00:14.389> to

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
maintain while there's a lot of snow to

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.390 
maintain while there's a lot of snow to
shovel<00:00:14.750> you<00:00:15.349> can<00:00:15.469> always<00:00:15.620> get<00:00:15.799> a<00:00:15.860> snow<00:00:16.160> blower

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
shovel you can always get a snow blower

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.970 
shovel you can always get a snow blower
but<00:00:16.730> flooding<00:00:17.360> is<00:00:17.600> always<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:18.470> big<00:00:18.650> thing<00:00:18.859> and

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
but flooding is always the big thing and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.650 
but flooding is always the big thing and
I<00:00:19.070> hear<00:00:19.250> people<00:00:19.550> say<00:00:19.699> we'll<00:00:19.970> have<00:00:20.119> to<00:00:20.270> flood<00:00:20.510> it

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
I hear people say we'll have to flood it

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.500 
I hear people say we'll have to flood it
all<00:00:20.779> the<00:00:20.930> time<00:00:21.140> and<00:00:21.680> I<00:00:21.859> you<00:00:22.850> have<00:00:22.970> to<00:00:23.119> flood<00:00:23.359> it

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
all the time and I you have to flood it

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.689 
all the time and I you have to flood it
after<00:00:23.930> you<00:00:24.080> use<00:00:24.320> it<00:00:24.560> but<00:00:24.710> flooding<00:00:25.099> really

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
after you use it but flooding really

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.730 
after you use it but flooding really
isn't<00:00:25.849> a<00:00:26.000> big<00:00:26.150> deal<00:00:26.390> if<00:00:26.840> you<00:00:27.289> have<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.590> right

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
isn't a big deal if you have the right

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.650 
isn't a big deal if you have the right
tools<00:00:28.070> I<00:00:28.490> think<00:00:28.849> a<00:00:29.029> lot<00:00:29.179> of<00:00:29.269> people<00:00:29.480> make<00:00:29.630> a

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
tools I think a lot of people make a

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.749 
tools I think a lot of people make a
mistake<00:00:29.750> where<00:00:30.349> they<00:00:30.500> just<00:00:30.740> let<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.039> hose<00:00:31.250> run

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
mistake where they just let the hose run

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.210 
mistake where they just let the hose run
on<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.029> ice<00:00:32.210> or<00:00:32.840> I<00:00:33.140> hear<00:00:33.740> people<00:00:34.070> where

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
on the ice or I hear people where

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.420 
on the ice or I hear people where
they'll<00:00:34.370> dump<00:00:34.700> a<00:00:34.850> big<00:00:35.030> bucket<00:00:35.510> of<00:00:35.600> water<00:00:35.810> on<00:00:35.960> it

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
they'll dump a big bucket of water on it

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
they'll dump a big bucket of water on it
that<00:00:37.430> usually<00:00:37.700> doesn't<00:00:37.850> turn<00:00:38.090> out<00:00:38.270> too<00:00:38.420> well

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
that usually doesn't turn out too well

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.620 
that usually doesn't turn out too well
your<00:00:38.750> ice<00:00:38.900> isn't<00:00:39.260> very<00:00:39.440> good<00:00:40.060> if<00:00:41.060> you<00:00:41.300> have<00:00:41.540> the

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
your ice isn't very good if you have the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.780 
your ice isn't very good if you have the
right<00:00:41.780> tools<00:00:42.020> though<00:00:42.380> like<00:00:43.190> this<00:00:43.400> thing<00:00:43.640> that

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
right tools though like this thing that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.540 
right tools though like this thing that
I<00:00:43.820> built<00:00:44.090> here<00:00:44.480> this<00:00:44.690> ice<00:00:44.900> flutter<00:00:45.340> you<00:00:46.340> can

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
I built here this ice flutter you can

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.120 
I built here this ice flutter you can
see<00:00:46.790> it<00:00:46.910> here<00:00:47.290> you<00:00:48.290> can<00:00:48.440> get<00:00:48.560> the<00:00:48.680> ice<00:00:48.830> almost

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
see it here you can get the ice almost

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.820 
see it here you can get the ice almost
as<00:00:49.460> smooth<00:00:49.700> as<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.090> arena<00:00:50.330> you<00:00:51.230> use<00:00:51.470> very

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
as smooth as the arena you use very

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.540 
as smooth as the arena you use very
little<00:00:52.100> water<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:52.640> it's<00:00:53.270> always<00:00:53.570> smooth<00:00:54.550> so

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
little water and it's always smooth so

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.250 
little water and it's always smooth so
you<00:00:55.610> can<00:00:55.820> see<00:00:56.000> it's<00:00:56.150> just<00:00:56.450> basically<00:00:56.810> built<00:00:57.080> at

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
you can see it's just basically built at

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.920 
you can see it's just basically built at
a<00:00:57.290> copper<00:00:57.800> there's<00:00:58.580> a<00:00:58.670> hose<00:00:58.970> end<00:00:59.390> or<00:00:59.630> the<00:00:59.720> valve

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
a copper there's a hose end or the valve

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.170 
a copper there's a hose end or the valve
that<00:01:00.770> you<00:01:00.920> hook<00:01:01.100> on<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.550> control<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.030> amount

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
that you hook on to control the amount

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.170 
that you hook on to control the amount
of<00:01:02.270> water<00:01:02.330> and<00:01:03.040> there's<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.100> goes<00:01:04.610> down<00:01:04.850> into<00:01:05.059> a

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
of water and there's a goes down into a

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.400 
of water and there's a goes down into a
tee<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.860> there's<00:01:07.370> a<00:01:07.430> bar<00:01:07.910> and<00:01:08.300> a<00:01:08.810> mat<00:01:09.020> on<00:01:09.290> the

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
tee and there's a bar and a mat on the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.860 
tee and there's a bar and a mat on the
back<00:01:09.590> to<00:01:09.830> squeegee<00:01:10.160> out<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.670> water<00:01:10.910> so<00:01:11.840> you

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
back to squeegee out the water so you

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.110 
back to squeegee out the water so you
hook<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.200> hose<00:01:12.380> to<00:01:12.680> this<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:13.850> do<00:01:13.970> your

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
hook the hose to this and you do your

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.630 
hook the hose to this and you do your
flood<00:01:14.360> I'm<00:01:14.540> going<00:01:14.690> to<00:01:14.750> show<00:01:14.870> you<00:01:14.900> how<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:15.260> works

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.910 

so<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.570> other<00:01:19.720> night<00:01:19.870> Alexander<00:01:20.620> had<00:01:20.740> the

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
so the other night Alexander had the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.970 
so the other night Alexander had the
dorium<00:01:21.580> boys<00:01:21.970> over<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:22.750> they<00:01:23.440> ripped<00:01:23.770> up<00:01:23.950> the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
dorium boys over and they ripped up the

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.560 
dorium boys over and they ripped up the
ice<00:01:24.250> pretty<00:01:24.520> good<00:01:24.760> probably<00:01:25.120> about<00:01:25.240> two<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.480> a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
ice pretty good probably about two and a

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.320 
ice pretty good probably about two and a
half<00:01:25.720> hours<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.320> skating<00:01:26.800> so<00:01:27.100> I<00:01:27.370> hasn't<00:01:28.120> been

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
half hours of skating so I hasn't been

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.430 
half hours of skating so I hasn't been
flooded<00:01:28.690> since<00:01:28.960> then

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
flooded since then

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.260 
flooded since then
so<00:01:29.740> we're<00:01:29.920> scrape<00:01:30.220> down<00:01:30.670> with<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:30.910> shovel

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
so we're scrape down with the shovel

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.630 
so we're scrape down with the shovel
we're<00:01:31.450> gonna<00:01:31.540> do<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.350> flood<00:01:32.620> now<00:01:32.830> with<00:01:33.430> our

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
we're gonna do the flood now with our

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.130 
we're gonna do the flood now with our
flooding<00:01:34.120> tool<00:01:34.330> so<00:01:34.540> you<00:01:34.630> can<00:01:34.720> see<00:01:34.900> how<00:01:35.020> it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
flooding tool so you can see how it

00:01:35.140 --> 00:03:25.500 
flooding tool so you can see how it
works

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.830 

and<00:03:26.510> just<00:03:26.810> like<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:26.989> a<00:03:27.530> couple<00:03:28.370> of<00:03:28.459> minutes

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
and just like that a couple of minutes

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.559 
and just like that a couple of minutes
the<00:03:29.840> ice<00:03:29.959> is<00:03:30.200> already<00:03:30.440> frozen<00:03:31.569> almost

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
the ice is already frozen almost

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.539 
the ice is already frozen almost
instantly<00:03:33.140> flooded<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.920> ready<00:03:34.069> for<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.370> next

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
instantly flooded and ready for the next

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.790 
instantly flooded and ready for the next
game
