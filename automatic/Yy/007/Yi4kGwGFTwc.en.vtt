00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
large glaring cons with these so for the

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.270 
large glaring cons with these so for the
sake<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:20.780> listening<00:01:21.289> at<00:01:21.350> least<00:01:21.530> one<00:01:21.740> con<00:01:21.979> I

will<00:01:22.729> just<00:01:22.910> nitpick<00:01:23.300> on<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.630> one<00:01:23.810> pretty

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
will just nitpick on the one pretty

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.109 
will just nitpick on the one pretty
minor<00:01:24.440> thing<00:01:24.679> I<00:01:24.770> can<00:01:24.920> find<00:01:25.160> it's<00:01:25.759> that<00:01:25.970> the

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
minor thing I can find it's that the

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.700 
minor thing I can find it's that the
inline<00:01:26.360> music<00:01:26.659> controls<00:01:27.020> don't<00:01:27.200> have<00:01:27.409> full

there's no fast-forwarding rewinding or
skipping<00:01:37.130> tracks<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:38.030> would<00:01:38.180> have<00:01:38.270> been<00:01:38.360> nice

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
skipping tracks it would have been nice

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.330

and once you and it would definitely

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.780 
and once you and it would definitely
bring<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:47.990> cost<00:01:48.200> up<00:01:48.470> however<00:01:49.130> Sennheiser<00:01:49.490> did

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
pair would get obviously if you're

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.600 
pair would get obviously if you're
working<00:05:48.289> out<00:05:48.500> and<00:05:48.650> pushing<00:05:48.860> yourself<00:05:49.009> as<00:05:49.460> hard

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
working out and pushing yourself as hard

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.550 
working out and pushing yourself as hard

as you should any non ent headphones

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.170 
as you should any non ent headphones
will<00:05:51.830> get<00:05:52.009> warm<00:05:52.220> but<00:05:52.580> these<00:05:52.789> definitely

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
will get warm but these definitely

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.969 
will get warm but these definitely
stayed<00:05:53.389> cool<00:05:53.570> the<00:05:53.720> longest<00:05:54.169> and<00:05:54.440> I'm<00:05:54.590> guessing

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
stayed cool the longest and I'm guessing

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.409 
stayed cool the longest and I'm guessing
that's<00:05:55.099> probably<00:05:55.639> a<00:05:55.729> result<00:05:56.090> of<00:05:56.300> the

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
that's probably a result of the

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.689 
that's probably a result of the
Alcantara<00:05:56.900> also<00:05:57.740> as<00:05:57.919> you<00:05:58.039> can<00:05:58.159> see<00:05:58.340> they<00:05:58.490> don't

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
Alcantara also as you can see they don't

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.100 
Alcantara also as you can see they don't
have<00:05:58.849> a<00:05:58.880> huge<00:05:59.180> amount<00:05:59.330> of<00:05:59.599> padding<00:05:59.750> on<00:05:59.960> the<00:06:00.020> top

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
have a huge amount of padding on the top

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.320 
have a huge amount of padding on the top
but<00:06:00.620> because<00:06:01.280> they're<00:06:01.490> so<00:06:01.699> lightweight<00:06:01.940> and

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
but because they're so lightweight and

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
throughout the ear cups this is a

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
any top of the head pressure I think the

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.839 
any top of the head pressure I think the
fact<00:06:09.770> that<00:06:09.830> Sennheiser<00:06:10.250> split<00:06:10.610> the<00:06:10.699> head

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849 
fact that Sennheiser split the head

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:12.790 
fact that Sennheiser split the head
bending<00:06:11.120> to<00:06:11.330> further<00:06:11.780> increases<00:06:12.259> the<00:06:12.380> comfort

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
bending to further increases the comfort
