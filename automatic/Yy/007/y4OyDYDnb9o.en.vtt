little<00:03:24.890> CDC<00:03:25.890> hackle<00:03:27.799> now<00:03:28.799> we<00:03:28.859> can<00:03:29.099> take<00:03:29.310> our

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
little CDC hackle now we can take our

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:42.790 
little CDC hackle now we can take our
wing<00:03:29.730> that<00:03:29.940> we<00:03:30.060> made<00:03:32.900> tie<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.170> down

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.420 

let's<00:03:43.370> see<00:03:43.520> that<00:03:43.670> makes<00:03:43.850> just<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.150> really<00:03:44.510> nice

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
let's see that makes just a really nice

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.990 
let's see that makes just a really nice
wing<00:03:46.430> shape<00:03:46.790> for<00:03:47.060> a<00:03:47.090> cat<00:03:47.330> it's<00:03:47.570> very<00:03:47.780> realistic

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
wing shape for a cat it's very realistic

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.490 
wing shape for a cat it's very realistic
now<00:03:50.000> you<00:03:50.060> can<00:03:50.210> do<00:03:50.300> some<00:03:50.510> more<00:03:50.660> CDC<00:03:51.230> for<00:03:51.470> a

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
now you can do some more CDC for a
