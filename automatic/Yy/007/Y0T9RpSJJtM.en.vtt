00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 this is an aerial wall raid is a 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.600
 wallride with an entity or not if not 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.380
 you have the entity 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.900
 Adheres to the wall what air is what 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:21.920
 we are flying all the how 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:24.230
 the title can be the title because there 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:33.019
 a tree on top 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:35.559
 because if you look more for cole so 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:35.559
 start a career 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.500
 my past you will not see past no no but yes 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:51.040
 I go only say one thing 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.480
 I shit on your uncle is impossible 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.600
 but what do you say ten and there's no point here 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.600
 down 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.280
 I'm falling like a sausage 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.530
 Do not jump quarrels to see what it is that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.220
 no no no no it's easy it's easy only 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.220
 You have to share 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.570
 this has a secret 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:30.170
 to the left then no more trees 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.930
 but hey, this has dried up, you know, but 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.180
 I can believe 40 checkpoints 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.210
 then amazing that so it does not happen 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.210
 nothing 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:52.730
 the next day with this serious world right 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.800
 spend nothing huelva are your friends punishment 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.050
 but on top of that you have to get there 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.950
 another point beyond my reach the 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.560
 gas I already covered it poster tampons me is 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.150
 that never wide with the right right if 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.020
 let's see leaders and see here and 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.500
 close I no longer have enzymes is what happens is 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.650
 that I have the car a little more degree 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.439
 x 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.680
 the roller passes is what it is but it is 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:21.989
 impossible 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.049
 you have to go with patience joy 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:30.060
 uproar and accelerating to the left 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:32.129
 then to the left a little bit to the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.180
 right and in heaven step where it came out and 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:38.090
 you the body the car in god 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.030
 already the field car again is not a 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.400
 very fruitful idea not the truth that no 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.400
 but good here road and I can not 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:54.069
 road highway two minutes to pass 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.349
 we support from here you know 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:01.480
 minutes the first point of the race of 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.480
 10 10 meters does not reach 10 meters 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.430
 it's fine it's good also my football 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.420
 but I think it's good that it hits me 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.770
 the scream in the second 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.630
 in the first and five meters of you 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.209
 you have to get to the other one to fall well 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.489
 because at no point of control has 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:28.069
 past and over no no that has gone well and 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.069
 so I think it will have been done 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.290
 to pass first 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:40.390
 now we are going to lose 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.390
 and there's no point 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.599
 so better of 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:56.439
 my mother I with this race I can not 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:59.100
 5 man who will tell you what I did 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.940
 he knows his tribe gave him 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.940
 Let's see 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.760
 one 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.270
 but nothing happens you have a little 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.270
 time already 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:39.110
 there is no turning back where we left 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.110
 another and then 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:57.560
 this is a past the goal where a 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.560
 point where yes but with the first
