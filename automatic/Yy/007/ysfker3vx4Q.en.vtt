00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.799 
gather it and how we hold the hand on
how<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.900> will<00:00:13.160> drop<00:00:14.160> out<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.639> we<00:00:14.700> let<00:00:14.880> go<00:00:15.030> okay

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
how it will drop out and we let go okay

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.410 
how it will drop out and we let go okay
we<00:00:16.109> gather<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.560> team<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.920> by<00:00:17.210> grabbing<00:00:18.210> the

we gather the team it by grabbing the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.830 
we gather the team it by grabbing the
dart<00:00:18.779> okay<00:00:19.439> then<00:00:20.130> all<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:21.240> links<00:00:21.510> will<00:00:21.570> line

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
dart okay then all the links will line

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.740 
dart okay then all the links will line
up<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.470> can<00:00:22.619> see<00:00:23.269> have<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.420> handle<00:00:24.689> in

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
up like you can see have the handle in

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.080 
up like you can see have the handle in
the<00:00:24.810> dart<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.980> flip<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.490> halfway<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.029> I

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
the dart that I flip it up halfway and I

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.320 
the dart that I flip it up halfway and I
chech<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.539> here<00:00:27.920> flip<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.099> end<00:00:29.250> flip<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> end

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
chech it here flip the end flip the end

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.510 
chech it here flip the end flip the end
I'm<00:00:30.720> still<00:00:31.170> holding<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.679> handle<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
I'm still holding on to the handle so I

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.639 
I'm still holding on to the handle so I
can<00:00:32.669> just<00:00:32.759> swing<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.030> out<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> extent<00:00:33.930> okay

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
can just swing it out in the extent okay

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.620 
can just swing it out in the extent okay
and<00:00:34.920> last<00:00:35.309> week<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:35.730> talked<00:00:35.940> about<00:00:36.180> two<00:00:36.420> things

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
and last week we talked about two things

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.840 
and last week we talked about two things
one<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.410> vertical<00:00:37.950> nature<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> spin

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
one was the vertical nature of the spin

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.119 
one was the vertical nature of the spin
so<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.960> incorrect<00:00:40.969> this<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.210> correct

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
so this is incorrect this is correct

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.119 
so this is incorrect this is correct
incorrect<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.640> correct<00:00:45.559> okay<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
incorrect and correct okay we have a

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.850 
incorrect and correct okay we have a
fast<00:00:47.520> spin<00:00:47.940> or<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.360> slow<00:00:48.960> spin<00:00:49.289> either<00:00:49.620> one

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
fast spin or a slow spin either one

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.400 
fast spin or a slow spin either one

it back hit step through bring it back
from<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.650> angle<00:01:11.540> get<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.720> arm<00:01:13.070> step<00:01:14.070> through

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
from this angle get the arm step through

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.570 
from this angle get the arm step through
bring<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.180> back<00:01:15.799> three<00:01:16.799> former<00:01:17.100> training<00:01:17.369> this

neck step forward
elbow<00:01:55.280> back<00:01:55.780> take<00:01:56.780> faster<00:01:57.319> motion<00:01:59.170> next<00:02:01.420> so<00:02:02.420> we

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
elbow back take faster motion next so we

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.130 
elbow back take faster motion next so we
have<00:02:02.749> under<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.259> arm<00:02:03.409> under<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.340> arm
