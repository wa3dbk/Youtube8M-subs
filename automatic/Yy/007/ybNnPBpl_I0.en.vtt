00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.760
 How do you make gourmet brigadeiro a 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.939
 How to make chocolate bar 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.119
 first you will use 300 grams of 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.730
 milk bar chocolate and one 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.000
 box of 395 grams of milk 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:30.230
 condensed reminding applied bar 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.730
 of this corresponds to 100 grams of 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.449
 milk chocolate 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:39.110
 You pick the chocolate, let me tell you 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.839
 he all just take shore at least in the 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.010
 midfield in the middle the bars divided 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:48.519
 in two and puts it condensed milk 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:55.180
 and carries the microwave and temperature 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:55.180
 normal or about three minutes 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.080
 The three minutes you put it on 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:11.200

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:16.460

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.560
 touch them you will already realize that already 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.009

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.060

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:55.330
 There you go, it's not consistent. 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:07.220
 You're not tinkering after he's 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:15.790
