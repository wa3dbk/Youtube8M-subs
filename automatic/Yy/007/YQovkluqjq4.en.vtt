00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:09.210
 unfortunately my ladies and gentlemen must 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.530
 our society again one 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.969
 bad expression learning suitcase bomber 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.710
 according to peer steinbrÃ¼ck the us 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.990
 In the broadest sense, a suitcase bombs away 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.170
 So in a figurative sense makes times 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.570
 less holiday but it 's about this 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.279
 bad box of terrorism and so on 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.039
 they know what I'm talking about and I have to 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.039
 let's say you 're a bit proud 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:41.820
 with all negative have the second 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.020
 So yes, there is still there 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.940
 suspicions 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.410
 I find here in Cologne one easily 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.020
 in suspicion if somehow I say 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.180
 sometimes southern European looks like someone like that 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.480
 Called and I have a bit 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.300
 fear that the whole high-boiled so the yes 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.039
 deescalation that has always been that 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.989
 the main motto of the program is myself 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.040
 recently during a fire in Cologne 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.619
 main station when I get my coffee 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.619
 drunk and there crashed an older one 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.500
 lady past me and turns around and 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.820
 says ertl has neither sit yes and me 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.600
 Did not hear it was a call 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.710
 fared 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.820
 please leave the cologne 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.619
 main station again an empty one 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.880
 found a suitcase that did not belong because of it 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.680
 somehow a train was not mine 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.520
 I did not belong at all and that 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.020
 was a false alarm 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.729
 shortly afterwards you hear and that too is 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.750
 important de-escalation that sounded then 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.750
 at the cologne main station so on 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.780
 due to misinformation 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.479
 they came to age these out 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.619
 installing the house with operate here 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.619
 station thank 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:52.770
 learning from a lot of praise 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:56.040
 fro and keep the ball flat and 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.300
 they thought we would become the world 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.680
 the world is getting more and more complicated 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.630
 it's actually worse 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.980
 ask how to watch the whole thing 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.560
 and the people out in the country 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.360
 mediated there is a man for me 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.210
 that can do it perfectly and that had too 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.520
 at the wm shown that is klop of zdf 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.050
 Great was absolutely fantastic and 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.090
 the war, as it is said, also matters 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.090
 maybe sell them a bit 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.800
 are delicate and that is our new one 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.810
 claim to the Federal Press Office kloppo 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.370

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.540

 You do not need much there because you have 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.050

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.130
 Actually, this is a sound 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.570
 wall or it is a sketchy a graf 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.140

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.900
 it is clear 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.720
 how did you have that crucial you have 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.250

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.970
 on 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.380
 and in that sense I have to 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.430
 say how happy I am the first time 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.720
 For example, you would not be here 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.160
 thrown out just because you one 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.650
 testosterone plaster on the title has 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.340
 what I have for years and indeed 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.570
 in the size of a robber pavement but 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.550
 not because of the testosterone where they are 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:55.650
 say but what's up to me 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.420
 brings the feeling when pulling off so 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.250
 klopper reports at the end of the day 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.290

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.660
 Bye your eva herman and now that 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.980
 current from the day with kloppo hello 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.180
 Maybe the scene is coming 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.560
 Let's see it maybe 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.349
 run once shows last 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.630
 It was an okay all- clear game 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.849
 here is also michael rise times 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.190
 wrong ok thanks 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.320
 so clearly now have the situation 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.940
 I know clearly believes is necessary to 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.320
 ask absolutely horny I am often there 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.630
 a great atmosphere is just like that 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.669
 Going shopping and shopping surrounded them 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.750
 urgent is coming so cologne station is 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.460
 for me a very clear 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.740
 when touch station far 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.270
 that means I go in I have feeling 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.010
 where is my train I the same high 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.270
 climb a day off to now there is 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.680
 But the possibility is just the question 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.599
 which philosophy do I have which 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.530
 system games i look at here 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:45.030
 Michael assures me what is unusual 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.890
 you have a suitcase here and me 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.570
 would be with the staple bag powdered if 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.640
 I would give me the money he has 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.020
 leave your suitcase that is to say 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.640
 so get the stairs up here 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.140
 now have two options and no matter 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.000
 if you look a banker until all 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.800
 mourinho or a felix magath you can 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.659
 move or b here to the front 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.310
 the question is what you for your 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:05.110
 personal philosophy is cool 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.819
 is cool about it is also more fun 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.289
 brings where that says hey people come com 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:10.569
 we're giving haifa, too 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.580
 times sharply higher we go in here 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:14.470
 So that means when I'm on the cologne 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.000
 station and I tell myself bingguo there 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.490
 is a suitcase bags you are there only 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.750
 to as to increase the acute 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.750
 reasonably relative
