 Change shape to help people 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.800

 Rick cares about what's far 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.530
 It is of sound and Mr. Hibikionibeni 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.010
 I know it's painted 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:34.240
 The sound of the soft vinyl hero, Mr. Hibiki 's ultimate soul 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:37.230
 Mr. Miki is also there, but it was awkward to put out a little 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:44.420
 Let's say it will go up 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:48.020
 The booklet comes in like the time of a rose when it is opened 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.720
 Such a manual is included 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.829
 Blister is in a two-stage 3 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.380
 Hibiki's body and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.040
 Additional accessories 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.190
 I will check the table roughly will be like this 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:06.110
 Hibiki 3 body hard shooting rod for deterioration hand-held 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:10.430
 Sound stick stick flame flame effect parts as attached to sound stick stick six flowers 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:14.400
 Three disc animals and a disc animal for back sitting 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.280
 The sound is real. Takana-Tetsu closed version and open version. 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.470
 Eight sea 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:27.640
 It is a guy like a singer in this area, and the type is like cutting it into a sound stick after a while. 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:31.690
 I think I want to look at you So modeling more than contains the Toka thing 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.950
 First, whether the eyes of part Tteyuu It is a face Eyes 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:39.550
 It's not a clear part, so it's already that already 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.900
 I do not feel like this partial compound eye 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:50.270
 It looks like being painted with in gradation feeling like 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:54.679
 The mark of the demon of this part of the forehead is also made exactly 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.620
 It looks like this from the side to the back 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:04.220
 Naturally because here is hard 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:05.600
 It is painful I'm body Kedomo is what any say from before this sounds pretty macho 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.560
 But when viewed from the side 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.140
 I guess I have become if if the belt like it was crying I say there are tremendous 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.480
 It looks like this 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.610
 Color splash 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.880
 It is metallic purple, isn't it probably not with Majora color? 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:27.660
 that 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.350
 That geisha of Majola color wants to put a pin etc. right now, but in me, iridescent 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.100
 Is that right? 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:38.130
 Is that tint and a little changing the angle of the light 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.870
 I feel that school red and green feel like it is a high reflection 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:45.990
 Even though it is a Majola color, I have a home 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:50.010
 The sound's because it is not a kind of feeling Well that 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:54.650
 Anyway, it's okay with metallic purple 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.600
 I am responsible for the day-to-day naturalized purple 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.170
 after 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.860
 I love this place here I like this here 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.560
 It has become this way referred to in purple from red, which has been the gradient 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.950
 And the abs are said to mukimuki 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.470
 Let's go back 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.280
 It has become to it around here is I feel that was little I Muscles 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.430
 Nice belt around the sound attack Koganei parentheses 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:24.900
 And it is here of the part that is in that loincloth-like 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:28.560
 That's right, but it's brown, it's a little dirty and it's like painting and it looks like it 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:35.370
 Well that in something like the back that has become the atmosphere 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:37.680
 What is here because it has parts of a situation that is leathery and now has no sound stick 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.190
 I have not been down , but here too 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:51.560
 If you replace it, it means that sand iron sticks to the scale 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:53.790
 The undercarriage is particularly purple for its painting , but the purple of the part of the thigh here is slightly 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.939
 Do and say, Poi' 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:01.409
 I feel that the color is slightly different 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:07.230
 So what's wrong with the legs? 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:11.580
 I'm rolling around the bottom of the foot does not contain a complex mold, but something like this 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:15.150
 It is the next sound shooter that makes me feel a little 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:18.959
 Are you able to understand the elder brother who is finely made moving ? 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:22.940
 With each other to properly face wrote Well that 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:26.770
 There are two types of caps and open ones 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:32.860
 This is the sound shooter of Kubrick's 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.849
 I'm doing a good job Kubrick I'm doing my best 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.050
 you know 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:40.910
 Well, it's not the case of Kubrick's explanation, but it's also quite a cat 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:46.400
 It can also not sounds good 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:51.050
 The grip part has a mark of Mr. Hioki's sound properly . 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:55.139
 It is a sound shooting stick like attached to the waist, and also with my sister 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.180
 The two parts are in clear parts 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.320
 think 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.850
 It is written somehow 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.400
 In to put on Well come to been able to slightly smallish 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.610
 If the person who has it is this length 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.210
 Well it is about 80% size 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:18.100
 It is So hey this is let's mounting it on a daily basis Mr. 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.790
 First of all, it 's a part of the waist part I 'm in a state that is not a polymer bite, but also take this 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.430
 I will 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.740
 And if you stick this 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:32.729
 It feels like this 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:34.180
 It's meaty, it's tight, and it's a disk animal. It 's three blue red greens. 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.340
 Ne 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:41.139
 I already abandoned it 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:47.260
 I think that the red one was a cuckold green was a frog 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:53.020
 The blue one is rare because it was a wolf and the hanging version on the hip 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:56.330
 Immediately Well then takes the child is the ne parts of this part Let's stuck polymer 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:00.610
 Pattern without disk animal 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:04.800
 Well, here's a great little bit 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.139
 I like this do If you do not do this to lose 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.219
 it's scary 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.219
 When this is attached 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.490
 Yes 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:19.050
 The equipment is getting ready gradually 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.940
 And next is music This is a great piece festival 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.969
 Such a tiny 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:30.909
 Paint or dig even if something is good 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:35.469
 This day my good luck luck Geki this mark is included I was in the state with this from the waist 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:39.250
 It's a hanging version, but this is also true when reading a disk animal 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:42.849
 It is a form, but it is working as it is 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:45.280
 Don't you run this on 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:48.500
 Once here to enter the Pyu' 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:51.230
 It is not true that there are only 2 issues 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:56.410
 Well then I think I want to equip this too 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.410
 It's a part here, I'm removing this part 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.950
 And it sticks to the coffin 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.510
 Yes you can- 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:09.310
 It sounds like all the sound equipment around the waist is attached 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.310
 At first it is such a feeling 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.860
 Sounds good 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.860
