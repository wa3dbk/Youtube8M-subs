00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.670 
those rocks down there
I<00:02:24.770> wouldn't<00:02:25.190> even<00:02:25.250> touch<00:02:25.340> this<00:02:25.760> deep<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:27.500> my

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
I wouldn't even touch this deep in my

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.350 
I wouldn't even touch this deep in my
eyes<00:02:27.860> this<00:02:28.100> thing<00:02:28.370> does<00:02:28.640> not<00:02:28.850> even<00:02:29.060> need<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.270> be

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
eyes this thing does not even need to be

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.510 
eyes this thing does not even need to be
here<00:02:29.600> this<00:02:29.990> could<00:02:30.200> just<00:02:30.320> be<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.800> straight<00:02:31.280> wall

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
here this could just be a straight wall

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.850 
here this could just be a straight wall
because<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.540> would<00:02:32.810> hit<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.110> as<00:02:33.230> fast<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:33.620> could

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
because I would hit that as fast I could

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
Joey probably do something but he'd

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.880
