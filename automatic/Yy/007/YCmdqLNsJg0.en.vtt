surgery is something that we do every
day<00:00:05.130> I<00:00:05.160> always<00:00:05.340> tell<00:00:05.730> patients<00:00:05.910> it's

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
day I always tell patients it's

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.810 
day I always tell patients it's
absolutely<00:00:06.990> routine<00:00:07.309> just<00:00:08.309> like<00:00:08.430> an<00:00:08.549> airline

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
of the day and drives home we show up at

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.609 
of the day and drives home we show up at
the<00:00:14.459> hospital<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:15.059> we'll<00:00:15.180> operate<00:00:15.660> two<00:00:16.230> three

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
the hospital and we'll operate two three

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.130 
the hospital and we'll operate two three
four<00:00:16.890> times<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.369> day<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:18.150> go<00:00:18.270> home<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.750> it's

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
four times a day and we go home and it's

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.410 
four times a day and we go home and it's
absolutely<00:00:19.560> routine<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.370> do<00:00:20.490> not<00:00:20.640> expect<00:00:21.090> to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
absolutely routine we do not expect to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.360 
absolutely routine we do not expect to
ever<00:00:21.540> see<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.110> plane<00:00:22.350> crash<00:00:22.650> as<00:00:22.950> I<00:00:23.040> like<00:00:23.190> to<00:00:23.340> say

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.370 
ever see a plane crash as I like to say

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.850 
ever see a plane crash as I like to say
just<00:00:24.270> like<00:00:24.390> an<00:00:24.510> airline<00:00:24.780> pilot<00:00:24.990> never<00:00:25.320> expects

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
just like an airline pilot never expects

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.160 
just like an airline pilot never expects
that<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.160> his<00:00:26.310> life<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.450> actual<00:00:27.720> procedures

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
that in his life the actual procedures

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.720 
that in his life the actual procedures
so<00:00:28.530> routine<00:00:28.860> here<00:00:29.100> that<00:00:29.280> I<00:00:29.310> tell<00:00:29.550> patients

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
so routine here that I tell patients

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.700 
so routine here that I tell patients
it's<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.210> clockwork<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.960> patient<00:00:31.590> will<00:00:31.680> come

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
it's like clockwork a patient will come

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.260 
it's like clockwork a patient will come
in<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> morning<00:00:32.730> will<00:00:32.910> meet<00:00:33.090> their

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
in in the morning will meet their

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.990 
in in the morning will meet their
anesthesiologist<00:00:34.260> at<00:00:34.410> 7:30<00:00:35.010> they'll<00:00:35.790> get<00:00:35.970> a

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
anesthesiologist at 7:30 they'll get a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.550 
anesthesiologist at 7:30 they'll get a
little<00:00:36.270> medicine<00:00:36.540> which<00:00:36.840> makes<00:00:37.079> them<00:00:37.230> kind<00:00:37.410> of

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
little medicine which makes them kind of

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.930 
little medicine which makes them kind of
sleepy<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.160> take<00:00:38.340> them<00:00:38.489> back<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
sleepy and we take them back to the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.850 
sleepy and we take them back to the
operating<00:00:39.390> room<00:00:39.510> once<00:00:40.470> they<00:00:40.590> are<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
operating room once they are in the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.830 
operating room once they are in the
operating<00:00:41.280> room<00:00:41.579> they<00:00:41.970> get<00:00:42.149> more<00:00:42.360> medicine

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
operating room they get more medicine

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.600 
operating room they get more medicine
which<00:00:43.110> makes<00:00:43.380> them<00:00:43.530> go<00:00:43.680> absolutely<00:00:44.220> asleep

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
which makes them go absolutely asleep

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.920 
which makes them go absolutely asleep
and<00:00:44.790> then<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.300> would<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.540> them<00:00:45.720> really

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
and then we would get them really

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.690 
and then we would get them really
comfortable<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.739> put<00:00:46.950> them<00:00:47.040> up<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.280> their<00:00:47.460> side

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
comfortable we put them up on their side

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.580 
comfortable we put them up on their side
we<00:00:47.970> put<00:00:48.149> pillows<00:00:48.360> front<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.050> behind<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.530> we

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
we put pillows front and behind and we

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.049 
we put pillows front and behind and we
wrap<00:00:49.739> them<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.130> a<00:00:50.250> nice<00:00:50.430> warm<00:00:50.730> cuddly

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
wrap them up in a nice warm cuddly

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.970 
wrap them up in a nice warm cuddly
blanket<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:52.260> get<00:00:52.380> them<00:00:52.500> all<00:00:52.590> snug<00:00:52.950> in

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
blanket and we get them all snug in

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.860 
blanket and we get them all snug in
there<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.520> hold<00:00:53.670> them<00:00:53.880> in<00:00:53.969> place<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.510> then<00:00:54.690> we

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
there to hold them in place and then we

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.450 
there to hold them in place and then we
put<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.200> head<00:00:55.380> in<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.590> head<00:00:55.770> holder<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.309> their

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
put the head in a head holder so their

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.720 
put the head in a head holder so their
head<00:00:56.700> stays<00:00:56.969> absolutely<00:00:57.620> still<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:59.370> then<00:00:59.550> use

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
head stays absolutely still we then use

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.000 
head stays absolutely still we then use
a<00:00:59.760> computer<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.420> all<00:01:00.600> our<00:01:00.719> operations<00:01:01.110> to<00:01:01.710> map

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
a computer on all our operations to map

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.350 
a computer on all our operations to map
the<00:01:02.219> brain<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.879> what<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.239> made

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
the brain and this is what it's made

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.479 
the brain and this is what it's made
neurosurgery<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.350> incredibly<00:01:04.979> safe<00:01:05.219> and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
neurosurgery so incredibly safe and

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.730 
neurosurgery so incredibly safe and
accurate<00:01:05.670> there's<00:01:06.630> cameras<00:01:07.139> in<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> ceiling

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
accurate there's cameras in the ceiling

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.160 
accurate there's cameras in the ceiling
that<00:01:07.920> are<00:01:08.039> taking<00:01:08.399> continuous<00:01:08.999> movies<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.719> I'm

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that are taking continuous movies as I'm

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.410 
that are taking continuous movies as I'm
tracing<00:01:10.709> out<00:01:10.889> all<00:01:11.399> around<00:01:11.819> the<00:01:11.969> patient's

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
tracing out all around the patient's

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:20.149 
model in space of the patient's head
that<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.270> then<00:01:18.479> matched<00:01:18.779> up<00:01:19.109> with<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.770> MRI

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that is then matched up with the MRI

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.580 
that is then matched up with the MRI
scan<00:01:20.609> of<00:01:20.639> the<00:01:20.969> patient's<00:01:21.450> head<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.079> brain<00:01:22.289> and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
scan of the patient's head and brain and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.289 
scan of the patient's head and brain and
then<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.459> the<00:01:23.609> screen<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
then on the screen then is a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.059 
then on the screen then is a
three-dimensional<00:01:25.139> rendering<00:01:25.529> of<00:01:25.709> the<00:01:25.859> brain

three-dimensional rendering of the brain

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.129 
three-dimensional rendering of the brain
and<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.369> can<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:26.670> take<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.939> wand<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.539> I<00:01:27.929> can

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:28.139 
and I can then take a wand and I can

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:30.379 
and I can then take a wand and I can
point<00:01:28.979> at<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.219> spot<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.850> patient's<00:01:30.209> head

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:30.389 
point at a spot on the patient's head

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:31.279 
point at a spot on the patient's head
and<00:01:30.569> it<00:01:30.630> will<00:01:30.719> show<00:01:30.899> me<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> screen

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
and it will show me on the screen

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.559 
and it will show me on the screen
exactly<00:01:32.219> where<00:01:32.340> I'm<00:01:32.459> pointing<00:01:32.700> at<00:01:32.969> so<00:01:33.359> they

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
exactly where I'm pointing at so they

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:34.969 
exactly where I'm pointing at so they
have<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> tumor<00:01:34.109> and<00:01:34.259> let's<00:01:34.380> say<00:01:34.469> the<00:01:34.619> tumor<00:01:34.920> is

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
have a tumor and let's say the tumor is

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.169 
have a tumor and let's say the tumor is
right<00:01:35.189> here<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.819> can<00:01:36.509> find<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.020> spot<00:01:37.409> exactly

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
right here I can find that spot exactly

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.699 
right here I can find that spot exactly
using<00:01:39.179> this<00:01:39.299> computer<00:01:39.539> and<00:01:40.020> then<00:01:40.139> plan<00:01:40.439> my

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
using this computer and then plan my

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.399 
using this computer and then plan my
incision<00:01:41.249> and<00:01:41.399> plan<00:01:41.639> my<00:01:41.939> window<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> bone

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
incision and plan my window in the bone

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.190 
incision and plan my window in the bone
to<00:01:44.099> exactly<00:01:44.609> be<00:01:44.700> right<00:01:45.179> over<00:01:45.479> where<00:01:45.719> I<00:01:45.779> want<00:01:46.109> to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
to exactly be right over where I want to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.159 
to exactly be right over where I want to
be<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.740> allowed<00:01:46.919> us<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.069> make<00:01:47.340> operations

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:48.169 
be so it's allowed us to make operations

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:51.739 
be so it's allowed us to make operations
safer<00:01:49.169> smaller<00:01:50.130> easier<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.359> patient's

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
safer smaller easier for the patient's

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.629 
safer smaller easier for the patient's
to<00:01:51.840> tolerate<00:01:52.319> so<00:01:52.799> once<00:01:53.009> we've<00:01:53.189> mapped<00:01:53.429> the

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:53.639 
to tolerate so once we've mapped the

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.909 
to tolerate so once we've mapped the
brain<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.450> then<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.899> don't<00:01:55.079> cut<00:01:55.229> any<00:01:55.439> hair<00:01:55.469> and

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:55.919 
brain we then we don't cut any hair and

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:57.800 
brain we then we don't cut any hair and
make<00:01:56.039> our<00:01:56.189> patients<00:01:56.340> very<00:01:56.549> happy<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.569> we<00:01:57.689> do

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
make our patients very happy what we do

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.199 
make our patients very happy what we do
is<00:01:57.959> we<00:01:58.079> find<00:01:58.349> the<00:01:58.529> spot<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.039> then<00:01:59.609> we<00:01:59.729> part<00:02:00.029> the

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
is we find the spot and then we part the

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:01.999 
is we find the spot and then we part the
hair<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.899> we<00:02:01.020> put<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> lot<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.469> shampoo<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:01.859> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
hair and we put a lot of shampoo in the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.709 
hair and we put a lot of shampoo in the
hair<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.310> hold<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.639> into<00:02:02.789> place<00:02:02.999> and<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.389> make<00:02:03.569> my

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
hair to hold it into place and I make my

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.510 
hair to hold it into place and I make my
incisions<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.529> line<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.069> part<00:02:05.340> and

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
incisions in the line of the part and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.789 
incisions in the line of the part and
then<00:02:06.209> that<00:02:06.359> opens<00:02:06.539> the<00:02:06.899> scalp<00:02:07.200> up<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.560> allows

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
then that opens the scalp up and allows

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.790 
then that opens the scalp up and allows
us<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.190> expose<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.819> skull<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.959> then<00:02:10.200> use<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
us to expose the skull we then use the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.310 
us to expose the skull we then use the
computer<00:02:11.160> again<00:02:11.460> to<00:02:11.820> exactly<00:02:12.450> identify<00:02:13.050> where

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
computer again to exactly identify where

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.380 
computer again to exactly identify where
that<00:02:13.530> window<00:02:13.920> needs<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.340> be<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.970> we<00:02:15.060> have<00:02:15.180> very

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that window needs to be and we have very

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.309 
that window needs to be and we have very
special<00:02:15.630> drills

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
special drills

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.780 
special drills
tools<00:02:16.620> allow<00:02:16.980> us<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.159> remove<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.489> small<00:02:17.640> piece

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
tools allow us to remove a small piece

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.850 
tools allow us to remove a small piece
of<00:02:18.030> bone<00:02:18.329> which<00:02:18.870> then<00:02:19.140> gets<00:02:19.290> put<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.650> some

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
of bone which then gets put in some

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.170 
of bone which then gets put in some
antibiotic<00:02:20.700> solution

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
antibiotic solution

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.270 
antibiotic solution
once<00:02:21.780> that's<00:02:21.959> done<00:02:22.260> there's<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.799> covering<00:02:23.159> of

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
once that's done there's the covering of

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.679 
once that's done there's the covering of
the<00:02:23.370> brain<00:02:23.489> which<00:02:23.819> we<00:02:23.969> then<00:02:24.120> open<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.629> that

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
the brain which we then open and that

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.599 
the brain which we then open and that
exposes<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.349> surface<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.859> the<00:02:25.920> brain<00:02:26.040> and

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
exposes the surface of the brain and

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.099 
exposes the surface of the brain and
this<00:02:26.879> is<00:02:27.030> where<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.239> gets<00:02:27.329> interesting<00:02:27.629> right

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
this is where it gets interesting right

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.259 
this is where it gets interesting right
the<00:02:28.290> brain<00:02:28.469> is<00:02:28.680> an<00:02:28.859> unbelievable<00:02:29.700> beautiful

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
the brain is an unbelievable beautiful

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.960 
the brain is an unbelievable beautiful
organ<00:02:30.719> to<00:02:30.930> look<00:02:31.079> at<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:32.219> very<00:02:32.519> complex

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
organ to look at and it's very complex

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.030 
organ to look at and it's very complex
we<00:02:33.299> have<00:02:33.329> to<00:02:33.720> wake<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.170> patient<00:02:34.530> up<00:02:34.650> from

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
we have to wake the patient up from

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.069 
we have to wake the patient up from
their<00:02:35.250> sedation<00:02:35.879> so<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.480> we<00:02:36.599> can<00:02:36.780> map<00:02:37.049> the

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
their sedation so that we can map the

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.110 
their sedation so that we can map the
surface<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.159> brain<00:02:38.370> which<00:02:38.640> involves

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
surface of the brain which involves

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.940 
surface of the brain which involves
stimulating<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.900> surface<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:40.439> brain<00:02:40.680> and

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
stimulating the surface of the brain and

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.619 
stimulating the surface of the brain and
when<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.129> stimulate<00:02:41.579> it<00:02:41.700> whatever's<00:02:42.239> there

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
when you stimulate it whatever's there

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.890 
when you stimulate it whatever's there
will<00:02:42.870> be<00:02:43.099> activated<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:45.450> patient<00:02:45.810> will

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
will be activated and the patient will

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.509 
will be activated and the patient will
then<00:02:46.109> tell<00:02:46.500> us<00:02:46.620> what<00:02:46.829> they're<00:02:46.980> feeling<00:02:47.400> or

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
then tell us what they're feeling or

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.039 
then tell us what they're feeling or
maybe<00:02:47.730> their<00:02:47.939> hand<00:02:48.180> will<00:02:48.329> move<00:02:48.450> or<00:02:48.750> their<00:02:48.870> leg

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
maybe their hand will move or their leg

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.289 
maybe their hand will move or their leg
will<00:02:49.230> move<00:02:49.459> sometimes<00:02:50.459> they<00:02:50.639> have<00:02:50.790> memories

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
will move sometimes they have memories

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.210 
will move sometimes they have memories
it's<00:02:51.540> all<00:02:51.689> very<00:02:51.959> interesting<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.769> map<00:02:52.950> my

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
it's all very interesting to map my

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.399 
it's all very interesting to map my
person's<00:02:53.639> brain<00:02:53.849> and<00:02:54.120> once<00:02:54.750> we've<00:02:54.930> mapped<00:02:55.230> it

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
person's brain and once we've mapped it

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.990 
person's brain and once we've mapped it
and<00:02:55.560> determined<00:02:56.010> where<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.400> important<00:02:56.849> areas

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
and determined where the important areas

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.270 
and determined where the important areas
are<00:02:57.329> that<00:02:57.870> tells<00:02:58.109> us<00:02:58.260> where<00:02:58.439> the<00:02:58.470> safe<00:02:58.829> area<00:02:59.189> is

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
are that tells us where the safe area is

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.099 
are that tells us where the safe area is
that<00:02:59.609> we<00:02:59.669> can<00:02:59.909> then<00:03:00.000> make<00:03:00.239> an<00:03:00.359> incision<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.049> go

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
that we can then make an incision and go

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.960 
that we can then make an incision and go
into<00:03:01.409> the<00:03:01.650> brain<00:03:01.859> to<00:03:02.099> where<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.609> tumor<00:03:02.909> is

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
into the brain to where the tumor is

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.000 
into the brain to where the tumor is
located<00:03:03.200> once<00:03:04.200> we've<00:03:04.379> gotten<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.769> where<00:03:04.889> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
located once we've gotten to where the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.490 
located once we've gotten to where the
tumor<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.400> located<00:03:05.519> we<00:03:06.239> then<00:03:06.269> use<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> very

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
tumor is located we then use a very

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.409 
tumor is located we then use a very
special<00:03:07.950> instrument<00:03:08.400> called<00:03:08.459> an<00:03:08.760> ultrasonic

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
special instrument called an ultrasonic

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.539 
special instrument called an ultrasonic
aspirator<00:03:09.959> which<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.680> long<00:03:10.980> needle<00:03:11.250> nosed

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
aspirator which is a long needle nosed

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.970 
aspirator which is a long needle nosed
instrument<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.180> tip<00:03:12.419> of<00:03:12.599> it<00:03:12.720> vibrates<00:03:12.980> at

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
instrument the tip of it vibrates at

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.860 
instrument the tip of it vibrates at
ultrasonic<00:03:14.849> speed<00:03:15.120> ultrasound

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
ultrasonic speed ultrasound

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.449 
ultrasonic speed ultrasound
you<00:03:16.230> know<00:03:16.349> ultrasound<00:03:16.859> will<00:03:17.010> dissolve<00:03:17.280> a

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
you know ultrasound will dissolve a

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.460 
you know ultrasound will dissolve a
kidney<00:03:17.819> stone<00:03:17.879> which<00:03:18.269> is<00:03:18.389> like<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.540> rock<00:03:18.870> so

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
kidney stone which is like a rock so

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.110 
kidney stone which is like a rock so
ultrasound<00:03:20.040> can<00:03:20.189> be<00:03:20.250> set<00:03:20.609> at<00:03:20.819> a<00:03:20.849> frequency

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
ultrasound can be set at a frequency

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.629 
ultrasound can be set at a frequency
that<00:03:21.389> will<00:03:21.690> dissolve<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.739> brain<00:03:22.979> tumor<00:03:23.340> but

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
that will dissolve the brain tumor but

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.550 
that will dissolve the brain tumor but
leave<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.419> brain<00:03:24.690> that's<00:03:25.019> healthy

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
leave the brain that's healthy

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.830 
leave the brain that's healthy
completely<00:03:26.280> normal<00:03:26.699> and<00:03:27.090> we<00:03:27.449> put<00:03:27.690> that

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
completely normal and we put that

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.449 
completely normal and we put that
ultrasound<00:03:28.409> device<00:03:28.739> right<00:03:28.949> in<00:03:29.129> the<00:03:29.220> middle<00:03:29.370> of

ultrasound device right in the middle of
the<00:03:29.519> tumor<00:03:29.819> we<00:03:29.940> turn<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.269> on<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.840> we<00:03:30.989> just<00:03:31.019> sort

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
the tumor we turn it on and we just sort

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.199 
the tumor we turn it on and we just sort
of<00:03:31.590> paint<00:03:32.069> around<00:03:32.370> with<00:03:32.639> it<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.090> the

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
of paint around with it so that the

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.360 
of paint around with it so that the
tumor<00:03:33.569> dissolves<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.379> gets<00:03:34.530> sucked<00:03:34.859> out<00:03:35.040> the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
tumor dissolves and gets sucked out the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.939 
tumor dissolves and gets sucked out the
inside<00:03:35.909> of<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.479> needle<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.049> then<00:03:37.680> we<00:03:37.799> can

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
inside of that needle and then we can

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:39.830 
inside of that needle and then we can
leave<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.340> surrounding<00:03:38.819> brain<00:03:39.030> intact<00:03:39.540> and

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
leave the surrounding brain intact and

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.659 
leave the surrounding brain intact and
we<00:03:39.989> can<00:03:40.139> remove<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.500> brain<00:03:40.919> tumor<00:03:40.979> even<00:03:41.489> in<00:03:41.579> the

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
we can remove a brain tumor even in the

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.909 
we can remove a brain tumor even in the
deep<00:03:41.909> critical<00:03:42.269> parts<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:42.989> brain<00:03:43.199> very

ultrasound device once the tumor has
been<00:03:48.209> removed<00:03:48.569> we<00:03:48.840> just<00:03:49.019> rinse<00:03:49.199> things<00:03:49.409> out

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
been removed we just rinse things out

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.140 
been removed we just rinse things out
real<00:03:49.769> well<00:03:49.889> if<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.159> patient's<00:03:50.579> been<00:03:50.699> awake<00:03:50.940> we

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
real well if the patient's been awake we

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.759 
real well if the patient's been awake we
say<00:03:51.329> good<00:03:51.510> night<00:03:51.659> let<00:03:51.930> them<00:03:52.019> go<00:03:52.169> back<00:03:52.349> to<00:03:52.560> sleep

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
say good night let them go back to sleep

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.830 
say good night let them go back to sleep
and<00:03:52.979> then<00:03:53.489> we<00:03:53.609> close<00:03:53.909> up<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.299> put<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.629> bone

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
and then we close up and put the bone

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.750 
and then we close up and put the bone
back<00:03:54.870> in<00:03:55.379> we<00:03:55.530> connect<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:56.010> bone<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.430> skull

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
back in we connect the bone to the skull

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.339 
back in we connect the bone to the skull
with<00:03:56.940> little<00:03:57.180> titanium<00:03:57.780> plates<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.260> screws

with little titanium plates and screws

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.069 
with little titanium plates and screws
these<00:03:59.280> are<00:03:59.489> non-magnetic<00:04:00.479> they<00:04:00.720> don't<00:04:00.900> set

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
these are non-magnetic they don't set

these are non-magnetic they don't set
off<00:04:01.109> metal<00:04:01.560> detectors<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:02.280> can<00:04:02.400> get<00:04:02.519> MRI

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
off metal detectors you can get MRI

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.179 
off metal detectors you can get MRI
scans<00:04:03.239> but<00:04:04.049> they<00:04:04.139> hold<00:04:04.349> the<00:04:04.560> bone<00:04:04.709> into<00:04:04.919> place

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
scans but they hold the bone into place

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.520 
scans but they hold the bone into place
with<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.459> bone<00:04:05.760> then<00:04:06.060> confuse<00:04:06.720> over<00:04:07.229> the<00:04:07.349> next

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
with the bone then confuse over the next

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.439 
with the bone then confuse over the next
three<00:04:07.829> months<00:04:07.859> and<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.459> know<00:04:08.639> six<00:04:09.209> months

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
three months and you know six months

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:10.969 
three months and you know six months
later<00:04:09.629> if<00:04:09.750> we<00:04:09.840> were<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:09.989> come<00:04:10.139> back<00:04:10.169> the<00:04:10.799> bone

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
later if we were to come back the bone

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.770 
later if we were to come back the bone
would<00:04:11.159> be<00:04:11.310> just<00:04:11.579> like<00:04:11.729> new<00:04:11.790> just<00:04:12.359> all<00:04:12.509> fused

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
would be just like new just all fused

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.319 
would be just like new just all fused
across<00:04:13.139> we<00:04:13.829> then<00:04:14.040> sew<00:04:14.459> up<00:04:14.609> the<00:04:14.729> scalp<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.180> put

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
across we then sew up the scalp and put

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.640 
across we then sew up the scalp and put
some<00:04:15.509> staples<00:04:15.720> in<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.079> skin<00:04:16.289> and<00:04:16.440> sort<00:04:16.590> of

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
some staples in the skin and sort of

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.229 
some staples in the skin and sort of
fluff<00:04:16.889> the<00:04:17.070> hair<00:04:17.250> up<00:04:17.400> again<00:04:17.699> so<00:04:17.849> no<00:04:17.970> one<00:04:18.120> can

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
fluff the hair up again so no one can

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.240 
fluff the hair up again so no one can
see<00:04:18.449> the<00:04:18.599> incision<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.199> that's<00:04:19.680> it<00:04:19.919> that

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
see the incision and that's it that

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.430 
see the incision and that's it that
whole<00:04:20.579> procedure<00:04:21.030> on<00:04:21.359> an<00:04:21.539> average<00:04:21.720> typical

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
whole procedure on an average typical

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.649 
whole procedure on an average typical
case<00:04:22.919> takes<00:04:23.220> about<00:04:23.370> two<00:04:23.669> hours<00:04:24.030> so<00:04:24.330> it's<00:04:24.479> not<00:04:24.599> a

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
case takes about two hours so it's not a

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.469 
case takes about two hours so it's not a
long<00:04:25.050> surgery<00:04:25.680> three<00:04:26.430> hours<00:04:26.760> would<00:04:27.060> be<00:04:27.120> one

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
long surgery three hours would be one

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:28.700 
long surgery three hours would be one

you do need radiation and you do need
chemotherapy<00:05:20.410> that<00:05:20.950> starts<00:05:21.730> in<00:05:21.850> about<00:05:22.060> a

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
chemotherapy that starts in about a

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.480 
chemotherapy that starts in about a
month<00:05:22.390> after<00:05:22.600> surgery<00:05:22.900> ends<00:05:23.380> so<00:05:24.190> that's<00:05:24.370> the

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
month after surgery ends so that's the

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.250 
month after surgery ends so that's the
routine<00:05:24.850> and<00:05:25.180> again<00:05:25.540> it's<00:05:25.750> very<00:05:25.840> well

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
routine and again it's very well

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.410 
routine and again it's very well

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
tolerated and patients are always amazed

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.090 
tolerated and patients are always amazed
their<00:05:28.690> families<00:05:29.080> are<00:05:29.200> always<00:05:29.380> amazed<00:05:29.710> at<00:05:29.920> how

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
their families are always amazed at how

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.100 
their families are always amazed at how
well<00:05:30.340> they<00:05:30.520> are<00:05:30.700> after<00:05:31.360> surgery<00:05:31.930> and

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
well they are after surgery and

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.780 
well they are after surgery and
particularly<00:05:32.830> if<00:05:32.890> they<00:05:32.980> haven't<00:05:33.280> had<00:05:33.400> general

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
particularly if they haven't had general

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.880 
particularly if they haven't had general
anesthesia<00:05:34.240> if<00:05:35.020> they've<00:05:35.290> just<00:05:35.320> been<00:05:35.680> done

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
anesthesia if they've just been done

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.980 
anesthesia if they've just been done
with<00:05:36.130> sedation<00:05:36.640> where<00:05:36.790> we<00:05:36.910> wake<00:05:37.030> them<00:05:37.090> up<00:05:37.420> it's

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
with sedation where we wake them up it's

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.330 
with sedation where we wake them up it's
the<00:05:38.140> same<00:05:38.350> sedation<00:05:38.830> that's<00:05:39.010> given<00:05:39.310> for

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
the same sedation that's given for

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.250 
the same sedation that's given for
colonoscopy<00:05:39.970> so<00:05:40.540> they<00:05:40.660> really<00:05:40.870> do<00:05:41.020> feel<00:05:41.200> like

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
colonoscopy so they really do feel like

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.410 
colonoscopy so they really do feel like
going<00:05:41.590> home<00:05:41.740> you<00:05:42.280> know<00:05:42.370> right<00:05:42.670> away<00:05:42.820> they<00:05:43.210> feel

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
going home you know right away they feel

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.270 
going home you know right away they feel
really<00:05:43.600> well<00:05:43.870> because<00:05:44.650> they<00:05:44.770> haven't<00:05:44.950> had<00:05:45.160> the

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
really well because they haven't had the

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.000 
really well because they haven't had the
general<00:05:45.610> anesthesia
