of<00:01:24.180> dollars<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.409> was<00:01:25.560> probably

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
of dollars and this one was probably

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.249

like<00:01:26.070> thirty<00:01:26.400> dollars<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.810> still<00:01:28.229> looks

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
like thirty dollars and it still looks

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.160
