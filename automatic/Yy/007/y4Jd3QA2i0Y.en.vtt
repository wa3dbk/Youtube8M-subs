you a two star wanted level although

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.700 
you a two star wanted level although
personally<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.460> do<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.390> all<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> time<00:01:58.049> and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
personally I do that all the time and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.859 
personally I do that all the time and
fucking<00:01:59.159> like<00:01:59.820> there<00:02:00.030> has<00:02:00.149> even<00:02:00.180> been<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.600> cop

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
fucking like there has even been a cop

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.080 
fucking like there has even been a cop
around<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.320> corner<00:02:01.710> nothing<00:02:02.490> happens<00:02:02.909> so

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
around the corner nothing happens so

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.789 
around the corner nothing happens so
that's<00:02:03.299> actually<00:02:03.750> pretty<00:02:03.899> ridiculous<00:02:04.560> like

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
that's actually pretty ridiculous like

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.700 
that's actually pretty ridiculous like
just<00:02:05.340> based<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.850> if<00:02:06.060> i<00:02:06.180> do<00:02:06.240> rate<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.380> low

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
just based on that if i do rate the low

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.740 
just based on that if i do rate the low
santos<00:02:08.220> cops<00:02:08.520> i'm<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> scale<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.119> one<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.390> ten

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
santos cops i'm a scale of one to ten

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.690 
santos cops i'm a scale of one to ten
I'd<00:02:09.959> give<00:02:10.229> them<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> two<00:02:10.979> they<00:02:11.310> are<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.640> us

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
I'd give them like a two they are to us

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.920 
I'd give them like a two they are to us
they<00:02:12.150> do<00:02:12.209> not<00:02:12.569> care

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
they do not care

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.929 
they do not care
about<00:02:13.109> their<00:02:13.260> pedestrians<00:02:13.920> which<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.730> mean

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
about their pedestrians which I mean

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.410 
about their pedestrians which I mean
like<00:02:15.349> no<00:02:16.349> harm<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.859> me<00:02:17.069> but<00:02:17.340> still<00:02:17.609> like<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:17.909> feel

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
like no harm to me but still like I feel

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.770 
like no harm to me but still like I feel
like<00:02:18.569> that's<00:02:18.900> pretty<00:02:19.439> pretty<00:02:20.219> flawed<00:02:20.780> but

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
like that's pretty pretty flawed but

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.390 
like that's pretty pretty flawed but
regardless<00:02:22.290> it's<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.680> like<00:02:22.829> I'm<00:02:22.980> getting<00:02:23.159> run

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
regardless it's not like I'm getting run

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.000 
regardless it's not like I'm getting run
over<00:02:23.430> by<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> car<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.299> whatever<00:02:24.629> and<00:02:24.870> finally<00:02:25.469> to
