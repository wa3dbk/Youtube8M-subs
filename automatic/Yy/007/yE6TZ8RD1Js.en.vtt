00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
cheap it's not like there's not wasn't a

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.140 
cheap it's not like there's not wasn't a
lot<00:03:45.359> in<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.540> formation<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.199> choose<00:03:46.410> from<00:03:46.590> but

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
lot in the formation to choose from but

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.159 
lot in the formation to choose from but
like<00:03:48.150> said<00:03:48.419> they're<00:03:48.660> quite<00:03:48.870> cheap<00:03:49.019> like

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.309 
sometimes I spent a bit more money on
because<00:03:51.030> they<00:03:51.299> cause<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.690> what<00:03:51.989> they<00:03:52.260> were

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319
