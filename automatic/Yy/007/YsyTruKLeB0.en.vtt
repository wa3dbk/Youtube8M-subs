status going

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.450 
status going
I<00:00:15.389> can't<00:00:16.080> keep<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.470> can't<00:00:16.740> push<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.010> too<00:00:17.130> far<00:00:17.160> you

I can't keep I can't push it too far you

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.519 
I can't keep I can't push it too far you
know<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.760> can't<00:00:18.000> disappear<00:00:18.390> for<00:00:18.570> too<00:00:18.690> long<00:00:18.840> but

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
know I can't disappear for too long but

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.529 
know I can't disappear for too long but
I<00:00:19.590> think<00:00:19.980> one<00:00:20.220> month<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.730> between<00:00:21.000> each<00:00:21.119> upload

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
I think one month in between each upload

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.810 
I think one month in between each upload
is<00:00:21.660> good<00:00:21.900> enough<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.410> keep<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.100> status<00:00:23.460> going

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
is good enough to keep that status going

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.380 
is good enough to keep that status going
but<00:00:24.119> anyways<00:00:25.050> actually<00:00:25.470> though<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:26.390> haven't
