to the polishing one take our purple
buffing<00:02:01.250> pad<00:02:01.460> a<00:02:02.140> little<00:02:03.140> bit<00:02:03.229> of<00:02:03.320> compound

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
buffing pad a little bit of compound

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.040 
buffing pad a little bit of compound
roughly<00:02:04.280> about<00:02:04.369> a<00:02:04.490> dime-size<00:02:06.670> too<00:02:07.670> much

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
roughly about a dime-size too much

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.200 
roughly about a dime-size too much
we<00:02:09.590> have<00:02:09.680> anymore<00:02:09.920> we<00:02:10.220> can<00:02:10.370> always<00:02:10.490> go<00:02:10.580> back

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
we have anymore we can always go back

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:23.040 
we have anymore we can always go back
and<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:12.510> move<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.960> power

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.400 

alright<00:02:23.740> moving<00:02:24.640> forward<00:02:25.230> we're<00:02:26.230> going<00:02:26.260> to

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
alright moving forward we're going to

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.860 
alright moving forward we're going to
keep<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.650> same<00:02:26.890> da<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.460> wash<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.600> we're<00:02:28.750> going

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
keep the same da to wash and we're going

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.890 
keep the same da to wash and we're going
to<00:02:28.900> move<00:02:29.050> on<00:02:29.200> for<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.470> plaque<00:02:29.680> polishing<00:02:30.220> pad

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
to move on for the plaque polishing pad

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.210 
to move on for the plaque polishing pad
the<00:02:31.900> reason<00:02:32.200> for<00:02:32.380> this<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.560> we're<00:02:32.830> changing

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
the reason for this is we're changing

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.040 
the reason for this is we're changing
solutions<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.450> we're<00:02:34.570> moving<00:02:34.690> from<00:02:34.960> the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
solutions so we're moving from the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.380 
solutions so we're moving from the
compound<00:02:35.470> cleaner<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.610> perfect<00:02:37.000> lens

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
compound cleaner to the perfect lens

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.080 
compound cleaner to the perfect lens
cleaner<00:02:38.370> again<00:02:39.370> we're<00:02:39.550> going<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.730> take<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.880> nice

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
cleaner again we're going to take a nice

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.150 
cleaner again we're going to take a nice
little<00:02:40.270> small<00:02:40.510> portion<00:02:40.960> not<00:02:41.710> too<00:02:41.920> much<00:02:42.100> not

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
little small portion not too much not

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.370
