00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.970
 starting here Luis and today you go 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.550
 learn the recipe of another classic 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.010
 from italian noodles to 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.650
 matriciana this sauce here based on 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.260
 tomato bacon and onion and it goes a little bit 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.630
 of pepper and also a little bit of 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.070
 white wine with the obligatory sauce 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.859
 cookbook 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.260
 So let's learn, we'll start. 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.900
 putting water to boil our 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.490
 pasta while the water is boiling 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.040
 People are already going to the pot. 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.590
 so in a large pan and low people 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.350
 will start frying bacon recipe 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.840
 original and tanabi punch eta but you 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.469
 you can use the same nozzle that is already 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.899
 great 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.040
 You will fry a little before he 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.920
 to be crispy 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.420
 You can take it out then just book it. 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.210
 a bowl with a little of 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.910
 paper napkin to dry the excess 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.800
 of fat now in the same pan yet 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.079
 with the bacon fat you go 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.420
 add diced onion 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.730
 just sautÃ© more or less for a minute 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.350
 and at this stage you can already 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.360
 season with a little salt and 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.189
 pepper does not need to put too much salt 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.970
 because we're going to season another one 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.340
 a little 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.119
 in the end now you're going to add 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.189
 chili 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.689
 If you follow the channel for long, you 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.790
 you should know that generally people 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.130
 strip the pepper seeds 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.710
 but here, in this case, we want the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.890
 dish is a little spicy then 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.130
 You will slice and it will get that pepper. 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.350
 feel the seed just add in your 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.460
 panela and you will revoke for a 30 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.530
 seconds 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.479
 here we can put the wine 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.420
 white or going to cook 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.790
 this wine until alcohol evaporates and until 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 it slightly reduce while it is 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.470
 reducing you can already put your 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.180
 noodles in the water this water is already 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.590
 salt and here we are using 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.270
 Uniting Tony 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.180
 another legal mass to use with this 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.520
 brat is the mouth had these two masses 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.380
 are the most traditional for you 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.110
 use with this sauce after 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.570
 reduce a little this wine you 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.759
 So will the bacon come back to the pan? 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.560
 after mixing a little is just 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.550
 add the tomato here we are 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.920
 using tomatino ata 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.920
 incubus you can put everything with the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.840
 water is just to stir everything very well and 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.210
 after raising boil 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.270
 You'll leave this cooking engine. 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.970
 for about 15 minutes while he cooks 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.880
 and will reduce quite fast and quite 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.100
 water and that's exactly what you want. 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.370
 the amatriciana sauce is not a sauce of 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.890
 Tomato watery it is so dry in 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.780
 pieces of tomato to see with this is the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.670
 Thanks here for Simon you can 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.100
 season with a little salt 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.380
 but now an important point people 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.810
 will use to finish here the 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.510
 pecorino cheese and pecorino cheese one 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.580
 cheese well salty so do not get carried away 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.560
 and much with the sun that at this moment 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.540
 you use the parmesan to finish 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.590
 your plate you can put one more 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.660
 little salt 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.820
 your sauce is ready, just turn off the 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.310
 and add dough that is already 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.820
 ready and dry and will mix everything very 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.580
 good 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.160
 It's just to serve and to finish you go 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.930
 roll the cheese over like I said 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.300
 the most traditional cheese here for this 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.070
 Sauce is the pecorino and gives a whole touch 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.290
 especially if you want you can 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.750
 use the parmesan even this pasta 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.450
 It gets a delicious bacon with the tomato to 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.030
 Onions look amazing and the pepper gives a 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.070
 special touch here I hope 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.260
