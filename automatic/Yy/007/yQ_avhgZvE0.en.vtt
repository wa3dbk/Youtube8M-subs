00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:15.120
 the melting chocolate together 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:19.400
 For that we have dark ones here 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.400
 chocolate and white chocolate 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.380
 Melt it in a water bath 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.550
 that's just kind of the 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.050
 Gentle way around chocolate 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.630
 Melt it takes a bit longer 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.189
 But chocolate should not be too hot either 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.170
 become 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.640
 bad for the aroma is important 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.230
 Here I have the chocolate here 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.180
 So pieces do not cut their own 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.760
 throw in the whole block but with 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.190
 the chocolate then a big knife 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.530
 also lend fed 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.940
 Here I now cook the water 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:57.120
 what comes in here now in two basins 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:59.820
 and then here the chocolate or on it me 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.020
 purposely use metal basin here 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.489
 Of course, the heat is better too 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.960
 transports that when I'm here now 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.519
 just take a plastic bowl 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.340
 Last of a chocolate here really 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.030
 enough time to rest entirely in front of him 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.090
 to melt 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.979
 I can then also get to know and 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.210
 which is always a bit stuck if 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.250
 Anything happens but I see 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.330
 here it already starts here 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.500
 to become liquid 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.750
 she is also here now that white 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.030
 chocolate melts that much faster 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.530
 because of that the melting core of the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.170
 white chocolate at around 34 35 degrees 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.150
 is already starting to become you and here 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.820
 the dark chocolate needs something 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:44.009
 closer temperature if you intentional 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.520
 small thick down in the big basin 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.200
 above 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.700
 the thing is here i can do that now 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.829
 stir and here are different straight 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.850
 absolutely nothing is the problem 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.310
 if water is here in here now 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.310
 The pure chocolate comes here 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.080
 their elasticity would then lose 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.850
 getting so hard 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.250
 and hard to be touched and that 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.030
 Of course we do not want so the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.770
 Water bath always a very gentle 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.250
 method but also a bit careful 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:24.000
 necessary 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:25.620
 the white is already finished now 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.600
 everything is liquid here we can now 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.640
 continue here a little tip 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.290
 in addition , really use quality 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.080
 good chocolate, if only 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.600
 Part of recipe or dough is one 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.440
 it tastes good already now you can 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.040
 click on the recipe I hear here 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.040
 a little further
