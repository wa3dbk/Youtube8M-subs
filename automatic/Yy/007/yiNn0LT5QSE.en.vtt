00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.420
 welcome to the kingdom day my name is 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.390
 jover gonzÃ¡lez and we are inaugurating 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.120
 this channel with this video about the 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.760
 metabolism how to accelerate it is going to be 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.370
 a lot to all those people who have 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.210
 some weighty goal that they are working 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.210
 in it but I hope you like the theme 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.210
 we start 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.570
 the first recommendation is about 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.640
 breakfast breakfast is something that there is not 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.740
 to be missing every day but many 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.120
 people when they listen to someone who 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.390
 He tells them that breakfast is food 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.190
 most important of the day they hear it as if 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.840
 nothing, not as if they did not speak to him, 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.060
 many do in fact matter 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.790
 people skip breakfast thinking that 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.350
 they will reduce calorie consumption 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.140
 but for midmorning or for the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.750
 midday are already starving and it's 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.660
 binges when they come either in the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.700
 late or at night it is robbed and 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.740
 I recommend rather consuming more 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.050
 calories they would have consumed 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.450
 if they had breakfast apart from avoiding 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.580
 bingeing when we eat breakfast we throw 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.729
 to walk our metabolism in addition 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.229
 when it is filling frequently 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.540
 we do not produce the enzymes that 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.490
 they need to metabolize the fat the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.979
 next recommendation is to avoid the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.680
 sugar as much as possible when consuming 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.300
 too much sugar overloads the body and 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.009
 this is going to produce that the levels of 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.530
 blood sugar are carried in little 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.380
 time when this happens 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.450
 your body store more fat and goes to 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.730
 burn fewer calories many times 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.160
 when we go to the supermarket to buy 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.500
 the pantry of the week we bought 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.440
 food that in the packages says free 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.890
 fat or fat free as they say some 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.040
 US packaging 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.440
 with this we think that it is your food not 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.840
 no we will not do fat that is 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.209
 because it says fat free but you have to 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.610
 see the detail of sugar many of 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.740
 our food is somewhat sugary 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.530
 and free of fat 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.300
 then it's not necessarily that they're going 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.180
 to help you lose weight if you do this 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.330
 is on a diet you can consume them for 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.310
 large amounts because if you 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.830
 consume these foods in quantities 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.860
 great what the body does is that 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.320
 converts excess sugar into fat 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.630
 the next recommendation is is about 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.940
 from the spiciness what chili works here 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.459
 is an active component of chili that is 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.470
 called capsaicin and this is the one that gives 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.970
 the spicy taste to the different types 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.239
 of chile different studies have 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.950
 proven that a spicy meal can 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.440
 give a temporary increase in the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.750
 metabolism of a person although it is not 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.209
 permanent also has the benefit the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.000
 Spicy food that help suppress 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.459
 faster that 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.840
 something important that you have to make clear 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.330
 here is that not because it's spicy can 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.890
 eat all kinds of food by adding 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.080
 the chile 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.810
 will speed up your metabolism as you can 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.150
 eat etcetera etcetera for example not 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.640
 is going to eat a plate full of tamales 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.290
 and I'm going to say hello and I'll leave you salsa 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.900
 nothing else because it's going to accelerate my 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.700
 metabolism and I will not get fat 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.400
 then it is wrong next 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.080
 recommendation is about sleeping 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.780
 well if we are not sleeping well 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.790
 probably the metabolism does not work 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.010
 how should i do it 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.530
 also when we deprive we deprive ourselves of 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.290
 sleep there are two hormones that go into the 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.630
 one is ghrelin and another is 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.940
 leptin and ghrelin is the hormone that 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.150
 tells us when to eat and when we 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.180
 we deprive ourselves of sleep we have more gray and na 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.760
 and leptin is the hormone that tells us 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.490
 when to stop eating and when we 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.280
 we deprive of sleep we have less leptin 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.580
 so if we have more greg and na and 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.940
 minus leptin probably equals 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.940
 this 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.080
 so if you're not sleeping what 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.740
 enough you're probably eating 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.200
 more than necessary and your metabolism is 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.940
 come back slower if you're from the people 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.460
 who have trouble sleeping more 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.980
 I'm going to make a video about how 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.470
 solve that problem so you can 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.480
 sleep well naturally how 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.790
 do it in our homes the next 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.530
 recommendation is about water the 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.080
 drinking water is the easiest thing 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.960
 that anyone can do more 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.810
 go ahead I'm going to make a video about 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.540
 good only water because if 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.270
 it's a little bit more extensive but 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.290
 here we are going to focus only on what 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.120
 what is the metabolism 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.980
 if we are dehydrated the metabolism 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.900
 and the functions of the body become 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.860
 slower when we do not consume 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.229
 sufficient water 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.020
 the metabolism becomes slower for 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.729
 conserve energy and the organs of 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.060
 body work do not work like 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.060
 they should 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.960
 as rise or taken two 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.540
 glasses of warm water to remove the 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.050
 remains of food from the digestive system 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:45.410
 that were left there from the previous day 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.930
 another thing you can do for this is 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.660
 take a cup of water and add the 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.100
 juice of half a lemon and they take it the same 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.400
 Regarding the following recommendation 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.320
 is to lower the level of stress you can 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.450
 say that stress is something that happens 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.180
 in a natural way we can not eliminate it 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.940
 completely of our life but if what 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.750
 we can reduce to a level that we do not 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.970
 affect 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.220
 to our health when a person 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.100
 stresses too much the body releases a 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.410
 hormone called cortisol this is the 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.990
 body's response to those situations 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.980
 stressors that we can be 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:25.090
 happening then but it's not very beneficial 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:29.540
 let's say for us because because 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:32.060
 cortisol is responsible for the 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:36.200
 immune system from us the system 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.570
 immune is weaker and also 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.360
 makes the digestive functions are 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.220
 slower therefore it affects the 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.550
 metabolism then you have to look 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.770
 ways of not being stressed so much 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.980
 other recommendations never skip 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.740
 the meals just as it happens as they 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.680
 I said earlier about breakfast that tastes 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.270
 that we give some food then it is possible 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.280
 that after the binge comes 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.280
 if we skip any day food the 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.440
 body will burn less calories because 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.660
 does not have the fuel and we are not 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.340
 giving the necessary fuel that 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:14.030
 need to perform those tasks 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:16.430
 then the functioning of the 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:19.430
 metabolism to conserve energy 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.230
 so you do not have to take out more meals if 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:24.520
 you in people who like to go out 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:27.310
 to run or jog or walk 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.020
 I recommend you do so before the 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.300
 breakfast since this way it's going to 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.460
 stimulate the metabolism faster 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.379
 I hope you liked the topic of 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.389
 today let me not know what you think about this 

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:39.789
 video if they liked what videos 

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:41.470
 like to see and you can also 

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:43.720
 subscribe here up 

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:46.479
 the button tells us to subscribe or if not in 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.659
 the button that I have here next to me that 

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:52.030
 it's all for today we'll see you on Saturday 

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:54.490
 is uploading videos on Wednesdays and Saturdays 

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:57.460
 I hope you like my next videos 

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.860
 and the important thing that these issues are 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.900
 of their benefit that they serve him as something 

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.099
 well see you on Saturday until the 

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.099
 next thanks friends
