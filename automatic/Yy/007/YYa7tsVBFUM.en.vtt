 the idea of ​​having the Hebrew there with him and 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.600
 his house 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.750
 That's the reason he's going to enjoy himself. 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.550
 of the situation it becomes clear that he 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.870
 It's bad but he's going to make it 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.700
 Use it to buy it to make it worth it. 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.520

 the meeting will take advantage of this 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.330
 People already know that more ahead they 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.840
 they will stay together because she is 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.520
 kind of promised him and we'll wait 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.830
 next week the tale more about this 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.930
 new villain there who is conquering country 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.330
 whole since we're talking about 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.840
 Record is google that has this 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.700
 season one and super well with 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.150
 some polemics right? 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.890
 but super good in the audience still exists 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.390
 that doubt whether or not he renews 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.489
 contract with a record because people 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.920
 You know you're doing everything for the 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.930
 independent producer of him 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.540
 but ultimately the success was so much that he 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.590
 renewed with a record for three more 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.780
 months so he in that niche in that 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.660
 resumes him on his return to the tv he 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.820
 I was kind of not sure if I really 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.290
 is that this receptivity and such but 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.350
 Google is a phenomenon we know it 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.360
 is a success and will continue and with us 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.019
 then for at least three more 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.730
 months 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.940
 Good, I love google, I think he 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.440
 I really did miss TV or 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.489
 It's just that I was watching the program. 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.110
 I think something like that is kind of boring 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:46.430
 made a great homage to marcelo 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.829
 most deservedly. 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.630
 celebrate even though celebrate and associate 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:55.430
 and back of the record debate and had 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.540
 lots of people marcelo team rezende 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.910
 on the stage and was a bit boring 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.880
 for the gadget family that is actually 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.130
 losing her place in the balance of 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.459
 morning to own bat 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.650
 I think this is unnecessary is not having 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.170
 I feel the poor thing is there with a 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.540
 Hey, man, you know I hit back. 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.320
 to take her place 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.660
 Anyway, I do not think so, either. 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.970
 from outside would be uglier we are still 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.430
 see now what the record prepares for 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.170
 There are some people betting that 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.780
 she goes back to Manaus where she did 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.120
 major police matters and that 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.760
 bid to invest in the match to 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.330
 that lever in the morning and 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.730
 to continue to give the same audience as 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.450
 marcelo rezende on Saturdays in the city 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.550
