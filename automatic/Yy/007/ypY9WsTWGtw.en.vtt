00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.890
 is like reading something like a book 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.190

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:19.870
 bus and no and no bandage think I need 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:24.870

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.460
 home heart saw how she reads 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.320
 the book then I saw a delightful 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:52.690

 imagine this cloak butterfly no artist 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.270
 focus on books because the book 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.909
 this is the key how the book can be the key 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:10.690
 I do not understand well, except that it is a port and 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:12.340

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.350

 I really don't remember you having their rights 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.120
 this is a puzzle 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.840
 or maybe candy 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.630

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.630

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.520

 surprises tell me well and in general 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.810
 if I tell you everything is not 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.020
 be a surprise let's say this is the focus 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.520
 which then fails but can 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.500
 practice in my shipito 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.870

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.870
 continue and we don't
