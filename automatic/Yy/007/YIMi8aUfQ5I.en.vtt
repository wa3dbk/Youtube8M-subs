00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
batteries here three CH 12 volt and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.609 
batteries here three CH 12 volt and
another<00:00:28.710> 12<00:00:28.980> over<00:00:29.460> here<00:00:30.140> so<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.260> kind<00:00:31.529> of

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
another 12 over here so this kind of

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.290 
another 12 over here so this kind of
like<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> controller<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.759> got<00:00:32.940> your<00:00:33.030> brakes

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.190 
like the controller you got your brakes
right<00:00:33.600> here<00:00:33.950> then<00:00:34.950> 24<00:00:35.610> volts<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.180> 36<00:00:36.690> volts<00:00:37.079> so

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
right here then 24 volts and 36 volts so

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:46.500 
right here then 24 volts and 36 volts so
I'm<00:00:37.260> 24<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.219> one's<00:00:38.399> 36<00:00:40.610> all<00:00:41.610> right

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510
