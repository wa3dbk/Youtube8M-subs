properly and the way you do it is coming
up<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.910> looks<00:00:24.060> like<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.420> circular<00:00:24.720> pattern

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
up it looks like in a circular pattern

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.170 
up it looks like in a circular pattern
to<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.500> strode<00:00:25.830> up<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.580> then<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.880> end<00:00:27.060> up

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
to the strode up so then you end up

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.810 
to the strode up so then you end up
working<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.779> front<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.470> side<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.130> you

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
working the front to the side and you

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.030 
working the front to the side and you
get<00:00:29.970> through<00:00:30.150> your<00:00:30.480> delts<00:00:30.869> red<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.230> then<00:00:31.380> to

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
get through your delts red and then to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.889 
get through your delts red and then to
focus<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> side<00:00:33.120> laterals<00:00:33.600> very

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
focus on like the side laterals very

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.510 
focus on like the side laterals very
good<00:00:34.140> Larry<00:00:34.350> still<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.800> all<00:00:34.890> about<00:00:35.130> working

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
good Larry still it's all about working

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.970 
good Larry still it's all about working
in<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.760> clock<00:00:36.270> motion<00:00:36.719> as<00:00:36.840> well<00:00:36.989> what<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.770> had

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
in that clock motion as well what I had

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.190 
in that clock motion as well what I had
to<00:00:38.100> pick<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.700> what<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.480> had<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.750> do<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.020> when<00:00:40.170> I

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
to pick on it what I had to do is when I

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.290 
to pick on it what I had to do is when I
did<00:00:40.290> my<00:00:40.559> delts<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.640> my<00:00:41.730> reach<00:00:41.910> their<00:00:42.120> body

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
did my delts one of my reach their body

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.240 
did my delts one of my reach their body
parts<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.020> get<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.290> wider<00:00:43.829> because

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
parts and I have to get it wider because

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.940 
parts and I have to get it wider because
my<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:45.329> was<00:00:45.539> hitting<00:00:45.809> more<00:00:45.930> my<00:00:46.110> traps<00:00:46.440> he's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
my I was hitting more my traps he's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.740 
my I was hitting more my traps he's
right<00:00:47.160> there<00:00:47.309> really<00:00:47.430> focused<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
right there really focused on the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.779 
right there really focused on the
lateral<00:00:49.079> head<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.950> everything<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.550> is

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
lateral head so everything I do is

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.160 
lateral head so everything I do is
really<00:00:51.030> focused<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.570> lot<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.750> heads<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
really focused on a lot of heads the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.200 
really focused on a lot of heads the
kids<00:00:52.350> out<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.559> you

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
kids out on you

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.970 
kids out on you
right<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:54.020> this<00:00:54.140> technique<00:00:54.560> will<00:00:54.680> do<00:00:54.830> it

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
right and this technique will do it

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.500 
right and this technique will do it
showers<00:00:55.700> should<00:00:55.730> take<00:00:56.000> Nick<00:00:56.180> my<00:00:56.330> friend<00:00:58.510> what

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
showers should take Nick my friend what

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.660 
showers should take Nick my friend what
I<00:00:59.570> do<00:00:59.630> is<00:01:00.020> basically<00:01:00.320> come<00:01:00.890> up<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.220> in<00:01:01.580> a

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
I do is basically come up and in a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.920 
I do is basically come up and in a
circular<00:01:01.910> pattern<00:01:02.330> just<00:01:03.110> like<00:01:03.230> this<00:01:04.780> so<00:01:05.780> when

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
circular pattern just like this so when

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.210 
circular pattern just like this so when
you're<00:01:06.050> doing<00:01:06.170> your<00:01:06.320> working<00:01:06.590> your<00:01:06.830> front<00:01:07.070> end

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
you're doing your working your front end

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.500 
you're doing your working your front end
and<00:01:08.120> you're<00:01:08.240> working<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.630> side<00:01:08.870> as<00:01:09.050> well

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
and you're working the side as well

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.640 
and you're working the side as well
all<00:01:11.510> right<00:01:11.660> compound<00:01:12.140> movement<00:01:12.440> for<00:01:12.590> the

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
all right compound movement for the

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.290 
all right compound movement for the
delts<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.010> can<00:01:13.130> see<00:01:13.340> rich<00:01:13.550> here<00:01:13.760> is<00:01:13.880> working

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
delts you can see rich here is working

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.420 
delts you can see rich here is working
in<00:01:14.479> this<00:01:14.660> art<00:01:15.020> like<00:01:15.470> motion<00:01:15.710> just<00:01:16.070> like<00:01:16.130> Larry

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.130 
three heads of the delts exercise number
one<00:01:27.560> or<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.310> delts<00:01:28.640> perfect<00:01:29.420> form<00:01:29.660> from<00:01:30.020> the

one or the delts perfect form from the
man's<00:01:30.550> very<00:01:31.550> rich<00:01:32.360> we've<00:01:32.720> done<00:01:32.899> exercise

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
man's very rich we've done exercise

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.170 
man's very rich we've done exercise
number<00:01:33.500> one<00:01:33.649> how<00:01:34.130> many<00:01:34.399> sets<00:01:34.820> how<00:01:35.000> many

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
number one how many sets how many

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.210 
number one how many sets how many
repetitions<00:01:35.330> if<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.140> about<00:01:36.320> while<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:37.009> warm

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
repetitions if you about while you warm

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.920 
repetitions if you about while you warm
up<00:01:37.310> within<00:01:37.640> one<00:01:37.820> or<00:01:37.910> two<00:01:38.030> sets<00:01:38.330> yes

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
up within one or two sets yes

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.780 
up within one or two sets yes
so<00:01:39.200> then<00:01:39.350> from<00:01:39.530> there<00:01:39.740> I<00:01:39.770> do<00:01:40.040> maybe<00:01:40.250> about<00:01:40.369> four

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
so then from there I do maybe about four
