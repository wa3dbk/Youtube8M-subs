00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.540
 the classic season is over 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.840
 there were three wins in a true classic 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.990
 the next round of others tom bean and president per individual studying in 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.990
 Paris tours excellently done 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.810
 that the Christmas nothing spot but the day of the round of Lombardy is the 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.759
 Most important points 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.759
 London Anp Madonna del Ghisallo 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.699
 in the one-day rates 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.090
 are the Belgians 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.780
 better chances were two three years ago 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.490
 bean is also still standing 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.110
 these mountains completely made the connection that they are doing 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.680
 and now you come up with ten first generation with the new van avermaet with one 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.940
 roelandts and perhaps a reduced one later 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.950
 I think it will be very strong for the next five years 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.100
 there will be a definite appearance 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.100
 this season started on some nice in goal 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.850
 recovers 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.630
 this fireworks 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.250
 instinctively exceptionally strong 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.690
 that can mean 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.700
 and that horse dogs happen 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.680
 I don't think China will be the biggest engine 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.590
 but i think there is a line to put through 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.250
 this time the first one hit as much as the absolute in the air 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.760
 strong doubts that this can result in the round of flanders and in after one 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.890
 pass the broker can put that to the taxes for the murder anyway 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:36.700
 is larger 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.740
 and we will meet someone in the lap of his own team next year 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.900
 a larger engine absolutely certain 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.030
 that is van van adema's 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.820
 You should also not forget that there is a headline to say that 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.470
 that the standards are go-getter 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.000
 and that is on a late bloomer in other words it still has a lot of energy 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.310
 in his garden that is still looking for interests 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.930
 who thought it was as with Tom Boonen 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.700
 I was pretty wrong 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.250
 nevertheless I think that the size of all sporting indoor tom beans at 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.700
 tom boonen became the highest number of matches and we all know 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.679
 competitions therefore a very high level 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.329
 Beans in Paris despite treme pressure m 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.629
 actually did that in a very clever way 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.749
 he masters that competition from start to finish 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.189
 residents also meet teammate 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.189
 this year it was shown that he can finally realize the ambitions 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.640
 I am especially pleased that a third preliminary round has come up 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.989
 that one then known by the Norwegian to the amateurs 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.219
 was unable to handle unpredictably large things 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.850
 for me that was the form of scams 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.929
 the next 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.669
 is taking the big step forward here 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:48.099
 because as a Fleming that wall of Geraardsbergen victory maybe 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.169
 not 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.549
 The Italian is struggling with the same problem that will be a dream 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:53.689
 the parties 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.179
 ten times a year 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.519
 when the riders came by, the bells of the church rang 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.209
 this is in stark contrast 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.209
 from the other days 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.189
 didulica who is not cycling and justine henin 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:12.940
 the whole union i have my ex 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.469
 and simon that 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:15.520
 cycling 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.249
 has an incredibly beautiful growth for members 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:22.479
 but unfortunately this has of course also been the case in recent years 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.049
 finds it first on sunday 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.829
 I am not waiting to get rid of the arrival 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.679
 I don't have to do that 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:33.189
 and proved to me enough that I don't want to wait for a busy job 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.319
 also find on course not on a return of basel 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.479
 you can be a bit uncomfortable now if I have to comment later 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.479
 deliver in which possibly the boys were at the start 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.550
 they are men of a generation that has passed 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.579
 the generation that has been adapted 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.749
 and I don't think it's possible 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:54.680
 to play it out with the young people of the new generation of whom we 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:56.029
 at least hope one 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:57.299
 that is going in a different way
