00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 and how everyone thinks so for us 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.110
 say what we are really great 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.219
 We play that all matches won all matches 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.049
 sure enough against what u 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.840
 we haven't been much yet 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.279
 one battle and where we are here hall summary by 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.699
 you're in the first minute of the national teams 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.699
 Sweden opens an account in this meeting 19 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.880
 seconds past cotton and start and oscar 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.969
 having run off 11 replays 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.129
 Beavers Solopov new Russian team 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.649
 talked about the chances of catching up with us 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.110
 will be if we manage to throw the first 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.690
 and just paid attention to the Swedes 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.930
 which is very active for the Russian team on this 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.000
 tournament starts and level this 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.410
 starting onslaught to be different here 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.030
 what we want to do 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.370
 said the Swedish players before this 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.680
 meetings and they did exactly that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.449
 I wanted to say that there was not yet a match where 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.460
 we had to get some 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.460
 internal reserves for learning that we 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.770
 like we want to play here 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.130
 first we lose so sure 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.130
 throw off and here 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.130
 parables 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.260
 it's all logic 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.909
 the opening of this tournament 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.370
 feel the puck he throw from gasoline 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.630
 interview in the club got a mirror 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.759
 imperative 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.920
 Few probably expected that the brush 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.320
 so 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.100
 Sergey Carpenters throws the most important 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.149
 washer 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.630
 throw Medvedev somehow incomprehensible 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.070
 reasons stumped nelson 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.840
 just did not appreciate the Swedish situation 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.740
 goalkeeper kind of beat the puck off somewhere 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.929
 to quart 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.670
 you were completely unaware that 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.250
 there will be a carpenter who is tight 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.230
 krovnik press way granted 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.370
 a chance to dispose of 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.430
 Sergei turned tanks need 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.010
 lights the right time in the right place 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.530
 so well he played he was always 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.750
 and prick there so many pucks 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.750
 that he was just noticed and 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.500
 in a vase 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.220
 walk forward brush my moles sergei 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.160
 wide 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.240
 becomes an insurmountable problem for 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.770
 Anders can not break it 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.099
 yes, let's see the replay beauty seriously 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.750
 out of kodi protection 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:37.680
 very uncomfortable powder here's the cheese position 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.560
 it will be clearly visible but again and now when 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.680
 all the advantages there are not the son and their valera but 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.520
 Apparently on him this pressure is strong 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.750
 affected and 1 puck and now it's 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.270
 taking about hill but she 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.910
 squad lose to the national team of sweden again 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.010
 we failed in numerical advantage 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.319
 use tivoli we will be neater 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.300
 need to play the next minute because 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.300
 but the Swedes in a row as deletions were 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 but 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.660
 and then 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.670
 he kicks the puck into the net 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:18.730
 sweden on here's the big to be different not 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.730
 succeeded and let's see 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.730
 from fila again very unfortunate one price 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.030
 and just cost so much for it all 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.730
 equal to advertising transfer will write 2 she 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.879
 for him it will be well, and u biovd and how 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.640
 got but 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:40.280
 waved from the bedzhan, then Anton saw very 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.260
 good I must pay tribute to him 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.780
 really incredible turned out not 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.439
 very comfortable it would seem there is no killer 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.439
 such opposites
