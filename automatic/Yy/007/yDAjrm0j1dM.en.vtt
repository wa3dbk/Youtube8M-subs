00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.519
 it is purely for me to take a picture later 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:15.670
 to put 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:18.579
 on video video nutrition is not on the past 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.279
 video then I talked about my back on 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:26.500
 60 more thumbs up 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:28.629
 and the power to make a video I do not know 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.950
 specifically what do you want them to 

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:36.460
 explained how to work carbohydrates proteins 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.289
 live pricked how much to eat all 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.870
 so yes density you like her 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.489
 digest quickly slowly for example 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.270
 Statement GEL eat it all Come 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:49.480
 digest than brown rice and what 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:54.130
 it or you just want to find out how i am 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:57.600
 eat how I eat how I eat 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.600
 so I will tell you how I eat 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:05.019
 it's very simple when trying to reset 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.500
 weight if i start gaining fat then 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:13.119
 two things I start to eat less 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.810
 calories somewhere there with bass I consider my 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:20.350
 calories i'm trying to eat this 2000 1500 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.909
 calories that's all and keep doing 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.179
 sports are always easy 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:32.170
 when i try to gain muscle mass 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:35.859
 up everything i do i eat more i 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.969
 trying to eat 3000 3500 4000 calories in 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:42.759
 so average day plus or minus usually 3 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.889
 500 that's fine so try to eat 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.560
 you have two kilograms for two weeks 

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:49.329
 gain muscle mass here if you 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.279
 probably the American channel watched 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:57.159
 video she is here to me videos like 

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:57.819
 pump shoulders there I scored somewhere two 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.240
 kilogram 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:03.929
 and for some where maybe even 3 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.029
 kilogram tension of two weeks i am pure 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.739
 I ate very, very much to the site 

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:11.380
 see because everyone wanted to know 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.440
 as much as I can gain weight now I 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.000
 back down somewhere 71 72 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.850
 I weigh kilograms now 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.200
 that is, I am very small only because 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.930
 it's hard to eat so much 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.850
 protein I do not think at all 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.080
 medical research 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:32.080
 need to eat one kilo oh apologize 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.240
 1 gram of protein per kilogram of weight 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.160
 its that is if you weigh 60 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.170
 kilogram it is up to 60 grams of protein 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.060
 american medical research ones 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.800
 who say how to type correctly 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.140
 muscle mass is not so bad that you need 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.390
 gram pound that is always at times 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.220
 more than 120 grams will have protein 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.770
 eat but this is American research 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.000
 and in the US also medical data 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.000
 I saw a few 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.489
 published papers 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.580
 reports that wrote 1 gram per 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.010
 a kilogram is enough I so much so I 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.650
 about always 80 grams of protein in 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.190
 all day and if someone tells you that 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.580
 it's too little nonsense what is 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.239
 stupidity and you do not pick up trash 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.459
 everything is out 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.799
 well what is all nonsense all that is possible 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.560
 count from your callaris 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:33.930
 sit enough grams 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.610
 protein a day and everything is easy and simple 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.570
 do if you want to gain muscle 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.090
 mass 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.850
 all you need to do when the horizontal bar 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.030
 do one two approaches on each 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.440
 exercise all 12 approaches if you do and 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.600
 more approaches are already starting 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.670
 train yourself endurance but not 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.670
 need endurance j like i did where 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.400
 mouse massandra 1st approach made by 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.640
 maximum made pull up 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.690
 push up 45 minutes i'm all all all body 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:08.350
 I have already trained myself nowhere 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.220
 pains and everything I finished today for example 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.140
 so I see how sick minutes 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.270
 a little clogged i run go i don't 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.910
 I did, that is, I now bass weight, I 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.980
 I run when I dine usually faster 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.870
 a cold passes all that so i 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.870
 I'm starting to study more a 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.660
 cardiac system 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.070
 when you prepare yourself in English and 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.480
 Russian called that is blood vessels 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.820
 that's it so she turned 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.980
 well here we have almost 40 now 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.980
 degrees outside heat that is there 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.350
 very warm I ran six now 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.860
 kilometers and 6 kilometers it is very 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.410
 it is good for you to pierce in such heat 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.690
 so that's all i eat i try 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.480
 eat organic foods like you all 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:59.990
 yes I eat everything less chips 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:04.610
 there any less and the cashier less 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.560
 chips smaller than any Pepsi-Cola yes he 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.750
 gritty alina uniformity normal 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.100
 like pizza he ate them more or less 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.470
 makes it useful not so much its here 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.010
 there are a lot of products that are better 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:21.080
 beware of which is thicker to eat but in 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.960
 the end of the end 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.370
 so you have enough calories 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.560
 Of course you need to have to become a pro 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.810
 enough minerals has enough 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.490
 reduced vitamins 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.820
 enough carbohydrates there is enough 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.250
 in succession yes although carbohydrates are not included in this 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.830
 this list of carbohydrates do not include themselves 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.820
 there became thicker at all 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:48.050
 all you need to collect weight food 300 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.900
 3500 calories and enough protein and all 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.150
 and play sports 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:56.030
 if slowly too play and lift 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.150
 eat even more so it will be hard to eat 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:02.210
 so many calories do it and you will see 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:07.240
 the result you want to lose weight 1500 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:11.720
 calories and go all marks nothing on 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:16.280
 the easiest with you was paul you 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:18.880
 boils boots yes how they suffered that is not 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.040
 complicate your life well 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.380
 saw next want to write to the bottom and 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.650
 where most will be thumbs up I'm 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:32.530
 made a video of how it will be guilty hope still 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:36.880
 see you bye bye 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.880
 some may already be pulling up 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:57.770
 concentrate again to muscle 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:57.770
 backs strained and down arms start 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.300
 it is clear yes that is, we concentrated 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.300
 not to
