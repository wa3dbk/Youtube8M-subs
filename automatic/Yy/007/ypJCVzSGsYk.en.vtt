100 and it's a reaction bite there's a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.460 
100 and it's a reaction bite there's a

tungsten bunk bunk bunk and it starts to

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.020 
tungsten bunk bunk bunk and it starts to
go<00:03:46.470> through<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:47.040> largemouth<00:03:47.519> will<00:03:47.790> eat

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
go through and that largemouth will eat

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.360 
go through and that largemouth will eat
that<00:03:48.299> as<00:03:48.690> soon<00:03:49.019> as<00:03:49.169> that<00:03:49.410> bait<00:03:49.650> penetrates

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
that as soon as that bait penetrates

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.099 
that as soon as that bait penetrates
through<00:03:50.639> so<00:03:50.940> it's<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.180> reaction<00:03:51.630> bite<00:03:51.780> hunter

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109
