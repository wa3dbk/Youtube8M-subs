00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
for food power and in the mid-range it's

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.990 
for food power and in the mid-range it's
got<00:02:01.420> an<00:02:01.510> increase<00:02:01.930> of<00:02:02.230> more<00:02:02.650> like<00:02:03.040> 60<00:02:03.430> or<00:02:03.460> 70<00:02:03.880> at

got an increase of more like 60 or 70 at

got an increase of more like 60 or 70 at
the<00:02:04.090> wheels<00:02:04.330> so<00:02:05.110> in<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:05.560> mid<00:02:05.710> range<00:02:05.920> of

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
the wheels so in the mid range of

the wheels so in the mid range of
consumer<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.550> talks<00:02:06.850> have<00:02:06.970> a<00:02:07.060> massive
