00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
mesh backer to it what that allows for

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.760 
mesh backer to it what that allows for
is<00:01:35.670> basically<00:01:36.179> cross<00:01:36.389> ventilation<00:01:36.929> so<00:01:37.679> in

is basically cross ventilation so in

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.200 
is basically cross ventilation so in
those<00:01:37.920> days<00:01:38.069> when<00:01:38.249> it's<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.460> little<00:01:38.700> bit<00:01:38.819> warmer
