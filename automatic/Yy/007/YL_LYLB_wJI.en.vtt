00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.780
 secular ethics

 Provost father stressed that learning 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.079

 better understanding of Russian schoolchildren 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.460

 at the table and a set of established in society 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.350

 gay marriage propaganda that is quite 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.060
 complies with European ethical 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.620
 norms 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:53.730
 but absolutely unacceptable to us is the basis 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.910

 interest in discussing father's performance
