 walking the violin you can see 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.629

 explains how to properly skype doctors 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.079
 staging of the left hand in Italy we 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:00.420
 consider specifically the movement of the fingers 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:02.730
 so well, and we took the violin here 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.530
 much empty space of your face with us 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.530
 the hand is in a natural position 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.070
 relaxed and fingers first 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.090
 must have a round shape 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.400
 rounded to the same also we must 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.430
 fingers 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.680
 hold over the neck here we have black 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.290
 neck and we try to keep polish in 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.509
 position over the fingerboard and especially will 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.400
 little finger we have neither twist it 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.380
 wrong we do not put under the neck why 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.240
 if we need to play fourth 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.280
 finger quickly and we have it under the violin 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.329
 she will need a long time to reach out and 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.200
 put so we seek in the fingers 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.380
 the game of the left hand of the hand of simplicity we 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.890
 make sure your fingers are above 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.950
 strings 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.430
 round shape all just achieve 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.100
 simplicity here 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.210
 that is, and it is also worth noting that 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.050
 as we put a finger please note 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.570
 here is the finger we put in the middle of the lobe 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.120
 middle of the lobe we put a finger and we 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:20.910
 do not put and like this string re we 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.070
 inside we do not put so or so it is bad 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.830
 habit that is, we are pursuing 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.380
 independent seek to 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.840
 fingers were placed in the middle of the lobe as 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.100
 hammers that is here for simplicity in 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.190
 staging to the point that we do not understand 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.959
 fingers are too high in runes 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.410
 It was not as long to put your fingers on a 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.410
 neck
