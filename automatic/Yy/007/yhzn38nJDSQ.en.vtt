00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.890
 out 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.869
 in the field of sports facilities and ferrets 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:14.459
 from over 460 items even the watchmaker then a valuable watch 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:15.579
 together 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:20.259
 She works on a model for up to two months, often creating a depth 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:22.800
 Bond between dysentery and creator 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.029
 No 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.910
 it sets its judgment is in my soul with the ears 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.680
 who knows her colleagues a workshop further the most important feature of a 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.840
 Watchmaker is 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.880
 Dr founded 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.910
 much patience 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.880
 To make statements from the beginning must and one more thing is certainly correct 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.290
 to have done 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.530
 the whole is a 2 unitas 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.850
 what I thought 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.960
 then you start again from the beginning 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.740
 Functions such 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.609
 Scholz has plenty here 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.779
 in Glashütte in the Saxon Erzgebirge there is little distraction 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.310
 7000 people live here over 500 of them are watchmakers 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.490
 Glashütte is the center of German watchmaking writings of companies which 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.170
 are in demand worldwide 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.740
 one of them is Glashütte again the manufactory has been with for 20 years 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.900
 Clocks in the Bauhaus design internationally successful 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.440
 the remote location of Glashütte is considered a clear location advantage 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.430
 the peace 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.690
 Well, this one 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.030
 m seclusion is sad in winter you are almost snowed 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.840
 you can probably make a bow that you need from other group around 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.240
 even more tourists 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.070
 reliability 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.340
 to come to Buche Markt in peace and quiet 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.370
 this has a long tradition here 1845 Ferdinand Adolph long the first 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.860
 Watchmaker workshop one of his watches 10-ball the most exclusive on the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.560
 To market his best apprentices he encourages his own businesses to do so 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.560
 a number of new manufactories are built locally 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.930
 No in the GDR, they are all produced together to form one company 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.119
 will be mass-produced 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.299
 the company the Glashütte Original goes from the ddr sales experienced 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.769
 if not remembered since 1 these roots specializes in the manufactory 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.959
 looking for luxury 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.419
 the long &amp; sons founded 1990 after reunification new 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:30.099
 the flagship of the company the long 1 has since been awarded many times 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.889
 and further developed 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:37.299
 Glashütte still has to be redone in 1990 by the entrepreneur Roland Schwertner 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.559
 The design always refers back to the past of course 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:47.920
 Had to find the quotes in Glashütte you should fit what you new into it 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.869
 guided by what was connect 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:56.009
 and therefore looking for old books and records what it is in the 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.979
 Story of Josef Bücker 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:02.269
 Of course, many of these fine pocket watches and complications 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.819
 so inner life, on the other hand, is based on state-of-the-art technology 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:10.099
 I 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.999
 that works very well 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.609
 nothing is superfluous not a few lines 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:15.989
 then you would have to 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.249
 all 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:24.129
 by 60 percent the problem percent Seidel the 2 as a painter even that he 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.049
 is reliable 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.690
 like many still out 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.010
 Tangente one of the most successful models of the manufactory 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:36.299
 Of course, we must continue to work on this peace and constantly 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.079
 improve that is not the same here 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.900
 we wanted the reason why i stay for this aesthetic that is it will be 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.950
 that is the advantage of classic percent will not be outmoded the modern 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.389
 Classics that are many watches from Glashütte meanwhile 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:57.999
 Pound also there is new model it lacks a bit of the long tour makers 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:03:59.509
 Tradition of glassworks
