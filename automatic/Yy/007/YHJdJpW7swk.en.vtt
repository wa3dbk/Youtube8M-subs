00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.779
 psv has just presented in the tube as head coach the old 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.330
 International succeeds Dick Lawyer who left the club after a dramatic 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.819
 past season 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:13.429
 it is also the second time that he has the role as head coach training and filling 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:14.449
 at psv 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.970
 at the end of last season he did that let them resign from fred rutten even though 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.970
 the past year trainer phillip cocu in the arena of psv 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.439
 a step back to learn but after the departure of dick lawyer best time 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.769
 now he has left 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.499
 I am someone who 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.819
 yes, walk that way consciously step by step 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
 not too fast somewhere in the city if you think you are not ready yet 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.050
 the old to learn 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.540
 yes Paul's car to learn by car was at the press conference 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.690
 and that is what stadium jaap think about what was going on with the ambitions of the koran 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.860
 term when we become champions 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.370
 metz was a different press conference than when performed with dick lawyer 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.710
 competition was immediately talked about a championship in the anniversary year 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.080
 well that goal is now a lot lower sales is here 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.780
 presented as the new trainer for the next four years and the objective 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.560
 is recognizable psv on her husband very good psv in which he is the space 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.490
 for their own players and players from the youth academy and were together for years 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.140
 will be formed with a team in the coming years that will join you and you 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.290
 the highest level in the Netherlands so nothing following a championship 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.150
 season or for the champions league you can get filipino 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.330
 silenced real side way to a new team to go to build cocu 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.000
 themselves for that they are so 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.250
 is the expectation pattern 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.270
 that as a psv we generally have to keep doing the prices 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.440
 but you must also be realistic if you 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.850
 for changes 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.250
 and your team will achieve 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.100
 building a new team 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.570
 and thereby goes 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.759
 these young talents will connect and grow 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 then you have to be realistic that it needs some time 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.049
 jacob here what is going to build in between also sets land in itself 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.289
 has long journey itself you perform with players that we have for example 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.380
 the defense 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.650
 no no that is a bit premature override, said the technical manager 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.250
 marcel brands that there is strengthening the defense 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.690
 has absolute priority and can play the idea will be shooter 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.230
 groningen apeldoorn from fc utrecht where there is serious interest 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.950
 speculating the psv about the players coming to psv is something 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.850
 too early that will also depend on which players to leave because thieme 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.910
 Sanders general manager even though here today notes that they are again 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.990
 PSV Treasury is not so very full that it is not too much money 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.350
 spend is that the first players have to leave for a nice amount 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.090
 before that money can be reinvested but the defense 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.770
 the fire was the priority then the booty home press conference was me 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.849
 I also think that the image of PSV has been badly damaged 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:51.729
 although there was going to claim 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:55.319
 well different but that reason is among other things compiled one by one 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.109
 to form a recognized PSV supporter under the leadership of Pieter van den Hoogenband 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.619
 and that for me many other members goes the supporters but also the sponsors 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:06.829
 basically anyone who feels involved until the psv interview on zoom one 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.159
 little inventory 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.229
 what do you have to do to make forests psv a pleasant, more pleasant, fun club 

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:15.909
 which also plays a role at the highest level, so that there is one 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:16.490
 contract 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.250
 in addition, two here at home press conferences were also about 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.840
 those on the training sessions 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.940
 whether or not private training falls on the redevelopment must be done with that 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.209
 well in the end it doesn't happen that much changed not so much 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.500
 again this season many private trainings philip cocu de roover 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:32.810
 there will be structural 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.599
 at the training in the stadium 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.339
 and with the vacations 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:40.019
 there will be more on the training 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.290
 We try to think along with our fans to the people who sacrificed us 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.519
 according to 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.609
 and on the other hand, among us they must still be able to go optimally 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:48.439
 to work 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.759
 four line that we are actually going to plot 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.889
 but it can be all for the coming season thanks for 9 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:56.169
