up like this we're going to kind of put

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.310 
up like this we're going to kind of put
it<00:01:03.770> where<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.970> intersection<00:01:05.600> is<00:01:05.750> in<00:01:06.140> between

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.870 

this<00:01:27.289> is<00:01:27.409> how<00:01:27.590> I<00:01:27.619> like<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:27.950> hide<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.670> bobby

this is how I like to hide the bobby

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:43.790 
this is how I like to hide the bobby
pins<00:01:29.289> so<00:01:30.289> they<00:01:30.649> can't<00:01:30.920> be<00:01:31.130> seen<00:01:31.520> your<00:01:31.820> hair

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
where you can just pin it and try to

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.410 
where you can just pin it and try to
hide<00:01:46.050> it<00:01:46.080> in

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.140
