sometimes<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.860> see<00:01:50.070> folks<00:01:50.340> though<00:01:50.610> they'll<00:01:51.149> do

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
sometimes I see folks though they'll do

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.370 
sometimes I see folks though they'll do
this<00:01:51.829> where<00:01:52.829> they<00:01:52.920> shove<00:01:53.220> their<00:01:53.399> membrane

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
this where they shove their membrane

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.179 
this where they shove their membrane
flashing<00:01:55.380> membrane<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> brick<00:01:56.159> and

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
flashing membrane in the brick and

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.319 
flashing membrane in the brick and
they'll<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.610> use<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> grout

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
they'll just use a grout

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.420 
they'll just use a grout
I<00:01:57.360> myself<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.259> used<00:01:58.500> caulking<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.979> few<00:01:59.189> times

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
I myself have used caulking a few times

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.270 
I myself have used caulking a few times
to<00:01:59.909> do<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.240> anyhow<00:02:01.170> here's<00:02:01.890> what<00:02:02.130> we're

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
to do that anyhow here's what we're

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.950 
to do that anyhow here's what we're
doing<00:02:02.549> okay<00:02:03.119> now

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
doing okay now

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.380 
doing okay now
I've<00:02:04.829> plastered<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.759> I've<00:02:05.850> used<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.149> fast

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
I've plastered that and I've used a fast

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.350 
I've plastered that and I've used a fast
set<00:02:06.659> plaster<00:02:07.200> obviously<00:02:07.710> because

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
set plaster obviously because

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.210 
set plaster obviously because
I<00:02:09.450> don't<00:02:10.289> want<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.680> come<00:02:10.830> back<00:02:11.009> up

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
I don't want to have to come back up

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.690 
I don't want to have to come back up
here<00:02:11.960> it's<00:02:12.960> not<00:02:13.170> worth<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.620> for<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:14.130> coach<00:02:14.400> to

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
here it's not worth it for to coach to

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.240 
here it's not worth it for to coach to
come<00:02:14.880> here<00:02:15.090> twice<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.840> now<00:02:16.590> I've<00:02:16.770> got<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> sponge

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
come here twice so now I've got a sponge

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.040 
come here twice so now I've got a sponge
float<00:02:17.580> here<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.000> see<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.300> finish<00:02:18.720> here<00:02:18.900> this

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
float here and see this finish here this

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.190 
float here and see this finish here this
is<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.260> heavy<00:02:20.070> heavy<00:02:21.030> finish<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.840> get<00:02:22.050> that

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
is a heavy heavy finish and you get that

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.350 
is a heavy heavy finish and you get that
by<00:02:22.680> bringing<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.340> sand<00:02:23.790> or<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.090> aggregate

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
by bringing the sand or the aggregate

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.240 
by bringing the sand or the aggregate
out<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.990> here<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.320> could<00:02:25.590> only<00:02:25.710> bring<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.100> out

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
out of here I could only bring that out

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.460 
out of here I could only bring that out
with<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.460> wet<00:02:26.670> sponge<00:02:27.030> float<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.630> I'll<00:02:27.960> take<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
with a wet sponge float so I'll take the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.300 
with a wet sponge float so I'll take the
sponge<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.430> I'll<00:02:29.580> go<00:02:29.730> upward<00:02:30.060> right<00:02:30.300> here<00:02:31.310> now

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
sponge and I'll go upward right here now

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.820 
sponge and I'll go upward right here now
I've<00:02:33.270> got<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.510> garden<00:02:33.840> hose<00:02:34.170> up<00:02:34.440> here<00:02:34.650> because

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
I've got a garden hose up here because

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.880 
I've got a garden hose up here because
it<00:02:35.130> was<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.910> was<00:02:36.060> pretty<00:02:36.270> wet<00:02:37.080> when<00:02:37.320> we<00:02:37.500> got<00:02:37.709> up

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
it was it was pretty wet when we got up

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.980 
it was it was pretty wet when we got up
here<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.580> figured<00:02:39.090> I'll<00:02:39.180> drop<00:02:39.450> something

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
here and I figured I'll drop something

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.050 
here and I figured I'll drop something
and<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.709> want<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.950> be<00:02:41.010> able<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.220> clean<00:02:41.459> up<00:02:41.490> anyhow

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
and I want to be able to clean up anyhow

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.010 
and I want to be able to clean up anyhow
so<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:44.250> fact<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.640> I've<00:02:44.850> going<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.720> drop<00:02:45.959> a

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
so the fact that I've going to drop a

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.550 
so the fact that I've going to drop a
little<00:02:46.140> bit<00:02:46.350> or<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:47.070> this<00:02:48.110> finish<00:02:49.110> here<00:02:49.380> is

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
little bit or that this finish here is

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.650 
little bit or that this finish here is
created<00:02:50.160> with<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.310> lot<00:02:50.520> of<00:02:50.550> water<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.420> when<00:02:51.570> you

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
created with a lot of water and when you

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.930 
created with a lot of water and when you
use<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> lot<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.140> water<00:02:52.380> on<00:02:52.820> something<00:02:53.820> like

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
use a lot of water on something like

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.640 
use a lot of water on something like
this<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.239> get<00:02:54.390> this<00:02:54.510> heavy<00:02:54.720> texture<00:02:55.260> what<00:02:55.530> I'll

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
this to get this heavy texture what I'll

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.590 
this to get this heavy texture what I'll
do<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:55.980> it'll<00:02:56.160> run<00:02:56.370> down<00:02:56.610> it'll<00:02:56.940> hit<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.360> and

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
do is it'll run down it'll hit this and

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.830 
do is it'll run down it'll hit this and
then<00:02:58.380> kind<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.770> run<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.820> that's<00:03:00.420> why<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.600> got<00:03:00.750> the

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
then kind of run so that's why I got the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.640 
then kind of run so that's why I got the
hose<00:03:01.100> fortunately<00:03:02.100> for<00:03:02.280> me<00:03:03.020> none<00:03:04.020> of<00:03:04.050> its<00:03:04.260> run

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
hose fortunately for me none of its run

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.550 
hose fortunately for me none of its run
down<00:03:04.920> but<00:03:05.700> anyway<00:03:06.000> that's<00:03:06.270> how<00:03:06.780> simple<00:03:06.840> this

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
down but anyway that's how simple this

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.350 
down but anyway that's how simple this
this<00:03:08.489> fix<00:03:08.820> can<00:03:09.030> be

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
this fix can be

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.820 
this fix can be
