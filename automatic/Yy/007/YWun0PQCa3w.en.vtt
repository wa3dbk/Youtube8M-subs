I<00:00:08.450> chose<00:00:09.450> medical<00:00:09.809> health<00:00:09.990> informatics

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
I chose medical health informatics

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.589 
I chose medical health informatics
because<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:11.340> combines<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:12.030> lot<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.330> my

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
because it combines a lot of my

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.930 
because it combines a lot of my
interests<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.380> like<00:00:13.860> computers<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.670> like

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
interests I like computers I like

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.300 
interests I like computers I like
analyzing<00:00:15.360> data<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:16.080> like<00:00:16.590> learning<00:00:16.949> about

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
analyzing data I like learning about

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.010 
analyzing data I like learning about
medicine<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:17.880> healthcare<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.660> thinking<00:00:18.900> all

medicine and healthcare and thinking all

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.140 
medicine and healthcare and thinking all
that<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.560> putting<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.220> towards<00:00:20.550> good<00:00:20.699> use<00:00:20.910> I

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
that and putting it towards good use I

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.060 
that and putting it towards good use I
chose<00:00:21.630> medical<00:00:21.960> health<00:00:22.199> informatics<00:00:22.529> because

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
chose medical health informatics because

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.500 
chose medical health informatics because
I<00:00:23.279> wanted<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.609> pursue<00:00:23.970> an<00:00:24.090> interdisciplinary

patients<00:01:08.830> my<00:01:09.340> favorite<00:01:09.640> course<00:01:09.850> so<00:01:10.000> far<00:01:10.210> would

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
patients my favorite course so far would

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.330 
patients my favorite course so far would
have<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:10.690> be<00:01:10.920> computing<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.040> informatics

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
have to be computing and informatics

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.100 
have to be computing and informatics
through<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.700> life<00:01:12.850> sciences<00:01:13.210> we<00:01:13.720> learn<00:01:13.900> a<00:01:13.960> lot

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
through the life sciences we learn a lot

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.720 
through the life sciences we learn a lot
of<00:01:14.170> interesting<00:01:14.350> computer<00:01:14.950> concepts<00:01:15.400> in<00:01:15.580> that

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
of interesting computer concepts in that

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.670 
of interesting computer concepts in that
course<00:01:16.000> like<00:01:16.330> machine<00:01:16.660> learning<00:01:16.690> so<00:01:17.470> we<00:01:17.560> can

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
course like machine learning so we can

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.010 
course like machine learning so we can
write<00:01:17.830> a<00:01:17.860> program<00:01:18.070> that<00:01:18.310> can<00:01:19.120> predict<00:01:19.480> if<00:01:19.720> for

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
write a program that can predict if for

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.750 
write a program that can predict if for
example<00:01:20.050> a<00:01:20.470> tumor<00:01:20.800> is<00:01:20.920> gonna<00:01:21.070> be<00:01:21.190> malignant<00:01:21.640> or

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
example a tumor is gonna be malignant or

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.790 
example a tumor is gonna be malignant or

most medical health informatics has
taught<00:03:07.069> me<00:03:07.280> how<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.549> effectively<00:03:08.299> use

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
taught me how to effectively use

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.360 
taught me how to effectively use

computers to solve problems and that's

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.220 
computers to solve problems and that's
not<00:03:10.549> only<00:03:10.880> important<00:03:11.420> in<00:03:11.540> medicine<00:03:11.780> but<00:03:12.079> also

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
not only important in medicine but also

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.790 
not only important in medicine but also
