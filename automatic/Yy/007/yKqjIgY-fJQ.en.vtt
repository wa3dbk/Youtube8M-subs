00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
right here see the holes right there did

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.590 
right here see the holes right there did
the<00:01:21.740> same<00:01:21.920> thing<00:01:22.189> with<00:01:22.340> it<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:22.789> the<00:01:23.420> damn

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
thing popped out get you a catch pan

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.709 
thing popped out get you a catch pan
because<00:01:26.329> coolant<00:01:27.049> will<00:01:27.320> come<00:01:27.619> out<00:01:27.799> and<00:01:28.719> the

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
because coolant will come out and the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.249 
because coolant will come out and the
gallon<00:01:30.049> on<00:01:30.320> already<00:01:30.710> coming<00:01:31.159> on<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.399> arm<00:01:32.259> you

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
gallon on already coming on the arm you

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.859 
gallon on already coming on the arm you
to<00:01:33.530> gain<00:01:34.460> impression<00:01:34.999> needs<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.539> crack

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
to gain impression needs to crack

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.609 
to gain impression needs to crack
luckily<00:01:36.710> mines<00:01:37.100> on<00:01:37.340> cracking<00:01:37.670> yet<00:01:38.259> and<00:01:39.259> it

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
luckily mines on cracking yet and it

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.029 
luckily mines on cracking yet and it
might<00:01:39.799> be<00:01:39.950> because<00:01:41.140> it<00:01:42.140> looks<00:01:42.380> like<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.560> wing

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
might be because it looks like a wing

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.870 
might be because it looks like a wing
fell<00:01:43.369> right<00:01:43.670> there<00:01:43.909> can<00:01:44.509> you<00:01:44.569> see<00:01:44.749> that<00:01:45.880> see

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
fell right there can you see that see

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.209 
fell right there can you see that see
that<00:01:47.030> old<00:01:47.179> wing<00:01:47.359> radon<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:47.929> them<00:01:48.130> so<00:01:49.130> I'm

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
that old wing radon in them so I'm

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:50.709 
that old wing radon in them so I'm
guessing<00:01:49.700> that<00:01:49.789> these<00:01:50.149> have<00:01:50.390> been<00:01:50.509> replaced

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
guessing that these have been replaced

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.389 
guessing that these have been replaced
that's<00:01:51.530> probably<00:01:51.859> the<00:01:51.950> reason<00:01:52.069> why<00:01:52.249> they

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
that's probably the reason why they

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.059 
that's probably the reason why they
haven't<00:01:52.579> cracked<00:01:53.590> but<00:01:54.590> I<00:01:54.619> mean<00:01:54.859> when<00:01:54.979> you

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
haven't cracked but I mean when you

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.459 
haven't cracked but I mean when you
remove<00:01:55.369> those<00:01:55.549> three<00:01:55.759> boats<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:57.170> can<00:01:57.319> lift

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
remove those three boats you can lift

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.419 
remove those three boats you can lift
this<00:01:57.649> up<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.509> now<00:01:59.509> you<00:01:59.569> can<00:01:59.749> get<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.429> your

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
this up and now you can get to your

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.599 
this up and now you can get to your
valve<00:02:01.850> cover<00:02:01.969> gaskets<00:02:02.719> I<00:02:03.009> was<00:02:04.009> afraid<00:02:04.219> that<00:02:04.369> I

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
valve cover gaskets I was afraid that I

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.989 
valve cover gaskets I was afraid that I
had<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:05.240> then<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.649> one<00:02:06.950> video<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:07.340> saw<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.880> guy

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
had to then the one video I saw the guy

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.449 
had to then the one video I saw the guy
gave<00:02:08.209> me<00:02:08.269> an<00:02:08.450> impression<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:09.739> water<00:02:10.159> pump

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
gave me an impression it this water pump

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.050 
gave me an impression it this water pump
housing<00:02:11.000> had<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.299> come

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
housing had to come

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.610 
housing had to come
but<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.360> didn't<00:02:13.840> have<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.050> touch<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.440> water

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
but I didn't have to touch the water

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.820 
but I didn't have to touch the water
pump<00:02:15.010> housing<00:02:15.600> by<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.660> way<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:20.230> where

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
pump housing by the way this is where

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.830 
pump housing by the way this is where
one<00:02:21.760> pipe<00:02:22.030> goes<00:02:22.300> into<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.830> pipe<00:02:24.040> wrap<00:02:24.250> buyer

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
one pipe goes into the pipe wrap buyer

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.650 
one pipe goes into the pipe wrap buyer
goes<00:02:25.840> into<00:02:26.230> there<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:28.300> can<00:02:28.390> see<00:02:28.540> this

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
goes into there and you can see this

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:37.170 
goes into there and you can see this
pipe<00:02:28.900> goes<00:02:29.200> into<00:02:31.890> ratchet<00:02:32.890> layer<00:02:36.180> so

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
pipe goes into ratchet layer so

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.890 
pipe goes into ratchet layer so
basically<00:02:37.480> I<00:02:37.840> mean<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:38.920> can<00:02:39.100> get<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.370> my<00:02:39.900> my

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
basically I mean I can get to my my

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.340 
basically I mean I can get to my my
valve<00:02:41.170> cover<00:02:41.440> gasps<00:02:41.680> I'm<00:02:41.920> in<00:02:42.070> you<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.930> like

valve cover gasps I'm in you I just like

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.620 
valve cover gasps I'm in you I just like
I<00:02:44.380> said<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:44.830> don't<00:02:45.190> think<00:02:45.370> anybody<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.360> few

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
so I'm setting if I log for dealing

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.420 
so I'm setting if I log for dealing
doing<00:02:59.890> this<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:02.140> not<00:03:02.200> too<00:03:02.500> bad<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:03.130> thought<00:03:03.400> I

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
doing this it's not too bad I thought I

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.870 
doing this it's not too bad I thought I
was<00:03:03.640> going<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.850> be<00:03:04.450> myself<00:03:04.570> but<00:03:05.880> you

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
was going to be myself but you

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.120 
was going to be myself but you
start<00:03:07.120> too<00:03:07.240> bad<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.750> mean<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.770> rest<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
start too bad I mean the rest of the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.530 
start too bad I mean the rest of the
 is<00:03:09.430> pretty<00:03:09.610> straightforward

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
 is pretty straightforward

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
 is pretty straightforward

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
then you take this off you can get the

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.310 
then you take this off you can get the
front<00:03:14.740> off<00:03:15.330> but<00:03:16.330> on<00:03:16.800> by<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:17.860> way<00:03:19.320> well

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320
