 if this here counts for the campaign will be 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.670
 the 100% that is terrible if you have 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.800
 I chipped because I thought she was what I 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.660

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.750
 I brought the video there for you. 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.630

 the game play for the guys leaving the house 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.090

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.780
 I brought you both on departure. 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.390
 in game o is not the gameplay route of 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.240
 normal hunting you will see why it was 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.270
 very bizarre thing that happened to our 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.950
 trophy at the end of it was tragic and you 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.260
 You will see it very funny now everything 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.140
 Laughter, but when did it happen to talk to? 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.080
 You guys, I got really pissed off with 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.140

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.820
 continuing here our season of 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.270
 hunt here 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.080
 the bob running there at last I could not 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.060
 kill 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.220
 Let's go, she 's not seeing that she does not have 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.320
 a lot to talk about because even because 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.550
 including this video is to record and then 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.550
 nÃ© a gameplay type serious to gameplay 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.830
 first and then the audio because I 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.660
 I did not expect this because I was not talking 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.640
 home video I left recording 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.810
 only I was not recording audio such 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.470
 That's when, after how it happened 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:41.150
 this fact is with me I decided to bring 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.970
 You and you are going to me very much. 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.160

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.220

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.530
 I do not continue at the end of the gameplay. 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.090
 Speaking a few things here for you. 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.970
 very basic and finally I think the following 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.989
 It's very cool interaction with you. 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.850

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.680
 and you know where there sometimes watched 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.930
 the videos and not let the young man did not 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.480

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.220
 ask questions anyway if you really like 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.680

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.810
 hundreds of times they have no idea how 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.720
 this helps in channel growth 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.040
