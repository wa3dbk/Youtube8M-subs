00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:21.739 
hi everyone welcome to the first week in

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.519 
hi everyone welcome to the first week in
our<00:00:21.890> series<00:00:22.279> of<00:00:22.310> classes<00:00:23.029> in<00:00:23.390> this<00:00:24.320> tutorial

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
our series of classes in this tutorial

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.799 
our series of classes in this tutorial
we're<00:00:25.160> going<00:00:25.399> to<00:00:25.550> take<00:00:25.939> a<00:00:25.969> look<00:00:26.390> at<00:00:26.539> how<00:00:26.750> you

00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:26.809 
we're going to take a look at how you

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:30.069 
we're going to take a look at how you
can<00:00:27.019> use<00:00:27.439> a<00:00:27.469> flatbed<00:00:28.099> scanner<00:00:28.869> believe<00:00:29.869> it<00:00:29.989> or

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
can use a flatbed scanner believe it or

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.189 
can use a flatbed scanner believe it or
not<00:00:30.230> to<00:00:30.980> create<00:00:31.309> some<00:00:31.640> very<00:00:31.910> fine<00:00:32.269> images<00:00:32.899> of

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
not to create some very fine images of

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.290 
not to create some very fine images of
three-dimensional<00:00:33.980> objects<00:00:34.550> like

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
three-dimensional objects like

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.049 
three-dimensional objects like
microfluidic<00:00:36.290> devices<00:00:36.670> petri<00:00:37.670> dishes<00:00:37.850> and

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
microfluidic devices petri dishes and

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.569 
microfluidic devices petri dishes and
other<00:00:38.600> sorts<00:00:39.050> of<00:00:39.170> material<00:00:39.710> you're<00:00:39.949> creating

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
other sorts of material you're creating

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.810 
other sorts of material you're creating
or<00:00:40.760> working<00:00:41.269> with<00:00:41.420> in<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.720> lab<00:00:42.460> now<00:00:43.460> you<00:00:43.519> might

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
or working with in the lab now you might

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.939 
or working with in the lab now you might
be<00:00:44.059> wondering<00:00:44.329> why<00:00:44.870> we're<00:00:45.199> starting<00:00:45.800> this

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
be wondering why we're starting this

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.160 
be wondering why we're starting this
course<00:00:46.309> with<00:00:46.699> a<00:00:46.729> tool<00:00:47.059> that<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:47.479> probably

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
course with a tool that you probably

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.079 
course with a tool that you probably
wouldn't<00:00:48.589> think<00:00:48.739> of<00:00:48.979> for<00:00:49.280> creating<00:00:49.790> really

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
wouldn't think of for creating really

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.070 
wouldn't think of for creating really
fine<00:00:50.330> images<00:00:50.900> of<00:00:51.110> your<00:00:51.199> work<00:00:51.909> well<00:00:52.909> we<00:00:53.780> want

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
fine images of your work well we want

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.229 
fine images of your work well we want
you<00:00:54.290> to<00:00:54.530> experience<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.369> fun<00:00:55.640> part<00:00:56.119> of

you to experience the fun part of

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.170 
you to experience the fun part of
creating<00:00:56.600> images<00:00:57.229> at<00:00:57.530> first<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.309> frankly<00:00:58.879> we

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
creating images at first and frankly we

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.479 
creating images at first and frankly we
wanted<00:00:59.689> you<00:00:59.839> to<00:00:59.989> start<00:01:00.259> off<00:01:00.439> with<00:01:00.979> some<00:01:01.250> easy

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
wanted you to start off with some easy

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.020 
wanted you to start off with some easy
stuff<00:01:01.939> well<00:01:02.439> relatively<00:01:03.439> easy<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.189> not

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
stuff well relatively easy and not

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.330 
stuff well relatively easy and not
having<00:01:05.390> to<00:01:05.630> worry<00:01:05.810> too<00:01:06.170> much<00:01:06.200> about<00:01:06.380> technical

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
having to worry too much about technical

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.210 
having to worry too much about technical
issues<00:01:07.640> which<00:01:08.000> believe<00:01:08.570> me<00:01:08.600> will<00:01:09.409> come<00:01:09.740> later

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
issues which believe me will come later

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.789 
issues which believe me will come later
it's<00:01:10.880> a<00:01:11.000> promise

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
it's a promise

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.560 
it's a promise
this<00:01:12.799> course<00:01:13.159> is<00:01:13.340> meant<00:01:13.369> to<00:01:13.759> encourage<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:14.390> to

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
this course is meant to encourage you to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.510 
this course is meant to encourage you to
capture<00:01:15.049> your<00:01:15.229> material<00:01:15.890> in<00:01:16.070> a<00:01:16.159> number<00:01:16.490> of

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
capture your material in a number of

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.410 
capture your material in a number of
ways<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:17.590> probably<00:01:18.590> most<00:01:18.950> important<00:01:19.640> to

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
ways and probably most important to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.399 
ways and probably most important to
learn<00:01:20.689> to<00:01:21.140> see<00:01:21.530> in<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:21.979> process<00:01:23.260> so<00:01:24.260> you're

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
learn to see in the process so you're

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.440 
learn to see in the process so you're
seeing<00:01:24.800> and<00:01:25.070> will<00:01:25.250> continue<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.820> see<00:01:26.210> all

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
seeing and will continue to see all

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.270 
seeing and will continue to see all
sorts<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:27.080> images<00:01:27.260> that<00:01:27.530> I<00:01:27.740> made<00:01:28.010> on<00:01:28.159> the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
sorts of images that I made on the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.310 
sorts of images that I made on the
flatbed<00:01:28.550> scanner<00:01:29.120> with<00:01:29.930> different

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
flatbed scanner with different

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.280 
flatbed scanner with different
approaches<00:01:30.890> I'll<00:01:31.760> go<00:01:32.030> into<00:01:32.299> detail<00:01:32.330> for<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:32.990> few

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
approaches I'll go into detail for a few

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.200 
approaches I'll go into detail for a few
of<00:01:33.409> them<00:01:33.590> in<00:01:33.830> all<00:01:34.070> of<00:01:34.220> these<00:01:34.370> tutorials<00:01:35.030> and

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
of them in all of these tutorials and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.590 
of them in all of these tutorials and
we'll<00:01:35.810> call<00:01:36.140> them<00:01:36.350> case<00:01:36.680> studies<00:01:37.299> you'll<00:01:38.299> see

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
we'll call them case studies you'll see

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.230 
we'll call them case studies you'll see
things<00:01:38.900> that<00:01:39.440> will<00:01:39.710> surprise<00:01:40.250> you<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:40.909> you'll

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
things that will surprise you and you'll

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.719 
things that will surprise you and you'll
discover<00:01:41.570> new<00:01:42.080> perspectives<00:01:42.770> that<00:01:43.310> is<00:01:43.520> new

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
discover new perspectives that is new

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.810 
discover new perspectives that is new
points<00:01:44.120> of<00:01:44.210> view<00:01:44.500> which<00:01:45.500> might<00:01:45.830> lead<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.610> new

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
points of view which might lead to new

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.570 
points of view which might lead to new
thinking<00:01:47.270> about<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:47.810> work<00:01:48.080> try<00:01:48.979> out<00:01:49.280> your

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
thinking about you work try out your

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.640 
thinking about you work try out your
ideas<00:01:49.970> about<00:01:50.180> imaging<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:50.930> won't<00:01:51.140> take<00:01:51.350> long

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
ideas about imaging it won't take long

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.830 
ideas about imaging it won't take long
that's<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.490> nice<00:01:52.640> part<00:01:53.030> about<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.420> flatbed

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
that's the nice part about the flatbed

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.350 
that's the nice part about the flatbed
scanner<00:01:54.170> some<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:55.100> your<00:01:55.250> ideas<00:01:55.640> will<00:01:55.880> work<00:01:55.909> and

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
scanner some of your ideas will work and

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.289 
scanner some of your ideas will work and
some<00:01:57.290> won't<00:01:57.520> believe<00:01:58.520> me<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.729> lot<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:59.030> them

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
some won't believe me a lot of them

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.039 
some won't believe me a lot of them
won't<00:01:59.479> from<00:01:59.960> my<00:02:00.110> personal<00:02:00.530> experience<00:02:01.159> and

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
won't from my personal experience and

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.210 
won't from my personal experience and
emphasizing<00:02:03.049> what<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:03.229> said<00:02:03.530> in<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.799> general

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
emphasizing what I said in the general

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.870 
emphasizing what I said in the general
overview<00:02:04.689> most<00:02:05.689> of<00:02:05.900> this<00:02:06.049> is<00:02:06.320> about

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
overview most of this is about

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.330 
overview most of this is about
experimenting<00:02:07.880> or<00:02:08.119> in<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.929> way<00:02:09.049> playing<00:02:09.530> the

experimenting or in a way playing the
process<00:02:10.939> I<00:02:11.120> hope<00:02:11.390> will<00:02:11.599> become<00:02:11.720> an<00:02:12.049> active

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
process I hope will become an active

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.559 
process I hope will become an active
discovery<00:02:12.950> as<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.400> did<00:02:13.549> for<00:02:13.760> me<00:02:13.909> when<00:02:14.269> I<00:02:14.299> made

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
discovery as it did for me when I made

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.839 
discovery as it did for me when I made
these<00:02:14.720> images<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:16.010> should<00:02:16.280> think<00:02:16.459> of<00:02:16.640> this

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
these images you should think of this

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.970 
these images you should think of this
process<00:02:17.390> in<00:02:17.569> a<00:02:17.659> similar<00:02:18.080> way<00:02:18.200> as<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.650> do<00:02:18.830> with

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
process in a similar way as you do with

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.860 
process in a similar way as you do with
your<00:02:19.040> own<00:02:19.750> investigations

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
your own investigations

you<00:04:16.760> can<00:04:17.000> very<00:04:17.239> quickly<00:04:17.630> make<00:04:17.989> some<00:04:18.470> very<00:04:18.769> fine

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
you can very quickly make some very fine

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.250 
you can very quickly make some very fine
images<00:04:19.579> without<00:04:20.000> going<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:20.570> more<00:04:20.780> complicated

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
images without going to more complicated

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.650 
images without going to more complicated
setup<00:04:21.769> with<00:04:22.070> your<00:04:22.220> camera<00:04:22.729> as<00:04:22.910> you'll<00:04:23.450> see

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
setup with your camera as you'll see

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.380 
setup with your camera as you'll see
later<00:04:23.690> in<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.440> next<00:04:24.590> few<00:04:24.890> weeks<00:04:25.039> you<00:04:26.030> can<00:04:26.210> show

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
later in the next few weeks you can show

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.630 
later in the next few weeks you can show
evidence<00:04:26.660> that<00:04:27.080> is<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:28.130> you've<00:04:28.310> made

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
evidence that is that you've made

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.950 
evidence that is that you've made
something<00:04:29.270> or<00:04:29.450> that<00:04:29.570> you're<00:04:29.780> observing

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
something or that you're observing

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.130 
something or that you're observing
something<00:04:30.860> you<00:04:31.729> might<00:04:31.880> want<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.300> show<00:04:32.510> a<00:04:32.539> part

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
something you might want to show a part

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.140 
something you might want to show a part
of<00:04:33.260> something<00:04:33.560> larger<00:04:33.890> a<00:04:34.370> small<00:04:34.789> structure

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
of something larger a small structure

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.020 
of something larger a small structure
for<00:04:35.510> example<00:04:35.710> you'll<00:04:36.710> be<00:04:36.890> able<00:04:37.070> to<00:04:37.400> share<00:04:37.669> some

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
for example you'll be able to share some

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.029 
for example you'll be able to share some
observations<00:04:38.500> quickly<00:04:39.500> with<00:04:39.890> your

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
observations quickly with your

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.430 
observations quickly with your
colleagues<00:04:40.550> you<00:04:41.419> can<00:04:41.450> consider<00:04:42.140> it<00:04:42.289> as<00:04:42.409> a

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
colleagues you can consider it as a

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.360 
colleagues you can consider it as a
draft<00:04:42.740> image

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
draft image

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.070 
draft image
that<00:04:43.490> you<00:04:43.610> will<00:04:43.729> eventually<00:04:43.940> use<00:04:44.479> in<00:04:44.660> a<00:04:44.750> figure

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
that you will eventually use in a figure

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.950 
that you will eventually use in a figure
for<00:04:45.380> a<00:04:45.410> submission<00:04:46.270> perhaps<00:04:47.270> you<00:04:47.510> can<00:04:47.690> even

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
for a submission perhaps you can even

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.890 
for a submission perhaps you can even
use<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.530> image<00:04:48.800> as<00:04:49.010> a<00:04:49.070> patent<00:04:49.820> submission<00:04:50.750> and

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
use the image as a patent submission and

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.939 
use the image as a patent submission and
something<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.770> think<00:04:51.919> about<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:54.710> wonderful

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
something to think about the wonderful

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.659 
something to think about the wonderful
surprise<00:04:55.610> here<00:04:56.090> is<00:04:56.120> that<00:04:56.570> you<00:04:56.780> can<00:04:56.990> put<00:04:57.320> a

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
surprise here is that you can put a

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.890 
surprise here is that you can put a
three-dimensional<00:04:58.669> object<00:04:58.790> on<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.540> scanner

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
three-dimensional object on the scanner

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.740 
three-dimensional object on the scanner
and<00:05:00.169> create<00:05:01.070> images<00:05:01.580> that<00:05:01.639> suggest<00:05:02.449> their

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
and create images that suggest their

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.650 
and create images that suggest their
three<00:05:03.050> dimensionality<00:05:03.790> yes<00:05:04.790> you<00:05:05.180> will<00:05:05.419> lose

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
three dimensionality yes you will lose

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.870 
three dimensionality yes you will lose
