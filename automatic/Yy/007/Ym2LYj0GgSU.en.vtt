after you don't give up another one so
when<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.540> think<00:00:12.809> about<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:13.200> feud<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.740> far<00:00:14.870> it

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
when I think about this feud so far it

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.870 
when I think about this feud so far it
is<00:00:16.049> getting<00:00:16.320> very<00:00:16.410> interesting<00:00:17.250> i<00:00:17.430> think<00:00:17.670> that

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
is getting very interesting i think that

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.140 
is getting very interesting i think that
w<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.600> trying<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.080> keep<00:00:19.670> Mayweather<00:00:20.670> at<00:00:20.910> face

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
w is trying to keep Mayweather at face

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.880 
w is trying to keep Mayweather at face
but<00:00:21.449> any<00:00:21.630> working<00:00:22.080> because<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.410> crowd<00:00:22.619> don't

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
but any working because the crowd don't

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.370 
but any working because the crowd don't
or<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:24.090> boom<00:00:24.359> him<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.840> cheering<00:00:25.080> for<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
or just boom him and cheering for the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.839 
or just boom him and cheering for the
big<00:00:25.560> slow<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.070> it's<00:00:26.279> kind<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.519> hard<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> tell

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
big slow so it's kind of hard to tell

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.779 
big slow so it's kind of hard to tell
who's<00:00:27.330> going<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.570> be<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.840> hue<00:00:28.080> or<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.560> face<00:00:29.550> in

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
who's going to be the hue or the face in

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
tonin that this is a box and where

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.849 
tonin that this is a box and where
you're<00:00:56.460> stepping<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> my<00:00:57.329> right<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:57.960> that's

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
you're stepping the my right now that's

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.650 
you're stepping the my right now that's
the<00:00:59.039> w/e<00:00:59.519> you<00:00:59.550> read<00:00:59.850> so

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
the w/e you read so

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.720 
the w/e you read so
Molly<00:01:02.320> made<00:01:02.590> whether<00:01:02.890> you<00:01:03.130> may<00:01:03.280> win<00:01:03.579> at

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
Molly made whether you may win at

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.280 
Molly made whether you may win at
WrestleMania<00:01:04.360> but<00:01:04.600> I<00:01:04.690> think<00:01:04.960> you're<00:01:05.080> going<00:01:05.230> to

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
WrestleMania but I think you're going to

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.800 
WrestleMania but I think you're going to
take<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:05.500> beating<00:01:05.800> so<00:01:06.160> that's<00:01:06.400> for<00:01:06.610> sure

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
take a beating so that's for sure

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.300 
take a beating so that's for sure
because<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.930> base<00:01:08.110> soil<00:01:08.350> is<00:01:08.500> just<00:01:08.710> kissed<00:01:09.100> you

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
because the base soil is just kissed you

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.010 
because the base soil is just kissed you
don't<00:01:09.460> want<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:09.729> piss<00:01:09.880> this<00:01:10.060> guy<00:01:10.210> off<00:01:10.360> as<00:01:10.780> for

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
don't want to piss this guy off as for

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.710 
don't want to piss this guy off as for
sugar<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.340> I<00:01:12.700> think<00:01:13.120> this<00:01:13.210> is<00:01:13.270> going<00:01:13.510> to<00:01:13.600> be

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
sugar so I think this is going to be

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.150 
sugar so I think this is going to be
interesting<00:01:13.870> if<00:01:14.229> I<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.440> WrestleMania<00:01:15.100> I'm

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
interesting if I the WrestleMania I'm

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.330 
interesting if I the WrestleMania I'm
really<00:01:15.400> looking<00:01:15.670> forward<00:01:15.700> to<00:01:16.090> it<00:01:16.300> so<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:18.130> got

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630

monday night raw in there probably will

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.600 
monday night raw in there probably will
be<00:01:33.700> I<00:01:34.270> sure<00:01:35.260> that<00:01:35.500> Mayweather<00:01:36.010> wants<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.460> get

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
be I sure that Mayweather wants to get

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.180 
be I sure that Mayweather wants to get
back<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.150> missile<00:01:37.600> i<00:01:37.870> inferred<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:38.770> may

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
back the missile i inferred that may

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.520 
back the missile i inferred that may
winners<00:01:39.610> arm<00:01:40.060> is<00:01:40.210> broken<00:01:40.510> or<00:01:40.810> elbow<00:01:41.170> i<00:01:41.200> do<00:01:41.290> not

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
winners arm is broken or elbow i do not

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.330 
winners arm is broken or elbow i do not
know<00:01:41.770> if<00:01:41.800> this<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.310> work<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:42.909> our

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
know if this is a work of our

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.389 
know if this is a work of our
the<00:01:44.820> true<00:01:45.060> hopefully<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.869> over<00:01:46.289> so<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:47.189> still

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the true hopefully just over so we still

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.219 
the true hopefully just over so we still
can<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.909> massive<00:01:48.210> WrestleMania<00:01:48.929> but<00:01:49.109> I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
can have this massive WrestleMania but I

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.300 
can have this massive WrestleMania but I
think<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.939> he's<00:01:50.939> probably<00:01:51.859> ruin<00:01:52.859> us<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
think that he's probably ruin us just to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.910 
think that he's probably ruin us just to
