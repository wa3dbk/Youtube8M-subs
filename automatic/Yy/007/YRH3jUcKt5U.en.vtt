00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.960 

okay<00:00:00.810> I<00:00:00.960> just<00:00:00.989> finished<00:00:01.439> working<00:00:01.890> letter<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.490> of

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
okay I just finished working letter a of

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.240 
okay I just finished working letter a of
this<00:00:03.149> problem<00:00:03.659> but<00:00:04.319> I<00:00:04.350> forgot<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.710> tell<00:00:05.009> you

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
this problem but I forgot to tell you

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.629 
this problem but I forgot to tell you
that<00:00:06.080> the<00:00:07.080> outcome<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.710> letter<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.130> where<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.550> is

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
that the outcome to letter a where it is

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.209 
that the outcome to letter a where it is
not<00:00:08.880> factorable<00:00:09.719> that's<00:00:10.440> covered<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:12.170> page

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
not factorable that's covered on page

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.950 
not factorable that's covered on page
471<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:15.199> the<00:00:16.199> Algebra<00:00:16.740> one<00:00:16.770> textbook<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:18.600> some

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
471 of the Algebra one textbook the some

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:28.250 
471 of the Algebra one textbook the some
it's<00:00:19.380> called<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.770> sum<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:21.710> two<00:00:24.320> squares<00:00:27.260> and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
it's called the sum of two squares and

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.189 
it's called the sum of two squares and
that<00:00:28.769> rule<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.400> basically<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:30.029> squared<00:00:30.570> plus<00:00:30.900> B

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
that rule is basically a squared plus B

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.290 
that rule is basically a squared plus B
squared<00:00:31.279> anything<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.399> looks<00:00:32.610> like<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.000> is

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
squared anything that looks like that is

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:44.080 
squared anything that looks like that is
not<00:00:34.489> factorable<00:00:39.110> okay<00:00:40.110> not<00:00:40.770> factorable<00:00:41.700> so

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
not factorable okay not factorable so

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.090 
not factorable okay not factorable so
you<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.200> go<00:00:46.350> back<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.829> take<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> look

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
you can you can go back and take a look

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.799 
you can you can go back and take a look
at<00:00:47.340> that

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
at that

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.020 
at that
next<00:00:48.809> let's<00:00:49.260> look<00:00:49.649> at<00:00:49.890> letter<00:00:50.430> C<00:00:52.160> okay<00:00:53.160> let's

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
next let's look at letter C okay let's

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.270 
next let's look at letter C okay let's
write<00:00:54.180> letter<00:00:54.449> C<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.289> bigger<00:00:55.469> actually

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
write letter C a little bigger actually

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.080 
write letter C a little bigger actually
I'm<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.480> use<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> much<00:00:58.109> bigger<00:00:58.320> pen<00:00:58.680> I

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
I'm going to use a much bigger pen I

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.689 
I'm going to use a much bigger pen I
just<00:01:00.090> think<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.359> easier<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.899> see<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.079> okay<00:01:01.699> 3x

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
just think it's easier to see so okay 3x

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.120 
just think it's easier to see so okay 3x
squared<00:01:03.270> plus<00:01:04.129> 16x<00:01:05.180> plus<00:01:06.180> 5<00:01:07.080> I'm<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:08.010> going

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
squared plus 16x plus 5 I'm just going

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.230 
squared plus 16x plus 5 I'm just going
to<00:01:08.159> go<00:01:08.280> ahead<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.580> tell<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.060> prefer<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:10.860> use

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
to go ahead and tell you I prefer to use

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:19.219 
to go ahead and tell you I prefer to use
the<00:01:12.240> quadratic<00:01:12.810> formula<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:16.670> but<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:18.229> think

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the quadratic formula here but I think

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.170 
the quadratic formula here but I think
the<00:01:19.590> book<00:01:19.830> likes<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.520> use<00:01:20.640> trial<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the book likes for you to use trial and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.499 
the book likes for you to use trial and
error<00:01:21.390> at<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.960> point<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.560> we'll<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.670> we'll

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
error at this point so we'll just we'll

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.649 
error at this point so we'll just we'll
just<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:25.400> some<00:01:26.400> trial<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.759> error<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.180> couple<00:01:27.570> of

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
just do some trial and error a couple of

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.090 
just do some trial and error a couple of
things<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.229> might<00:01:28.530> work<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.640> only<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:31.770> only

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
things that might work the only the only

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.670 
things that might work the only the only
two<00:01:32.460> options<00:01:32.600> here<00:01:33.600> would<00:01:33.840> really<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.320> you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
two options here would really be you

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.550 
two options here would really be you
know<00:01:34.799> 3x<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.090> X<00:01:36.270> obviously<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.079> what<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.409> have

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
know 3x and X obviously is what we have

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.190 
know 3x and X obviously is what we have
to<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.159> get<00:01:38.310> 3x<00:01:38.579> squared<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:40.079> can

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
to have to get 3x squared so we can

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.899 
to have to get 3x squared so we can
either<00:01:40.439> add<00:01:40.799> 1<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.299> add<00:01:42.540> 5<00:01:42.990> there<00:01:43.500> or<00:01:43.920> we

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
either add 1 here and add 5 there or we

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.389 
either add 1 here and add 5 there or we
might<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.299> able<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:45.869> three<00:01:46.350> X<00:01:46.560> plus<00:01:46.740> five

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
might be able to do three X plus five

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.480 
might be able to do three X plus five
and<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.439> X<00:01:49.439> plus<00:01:49.799> one<00:01:49.979> but<00:01:50.189> those<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.399> going

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
and have X plus one but those are going

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.179 
and have X plus one but those are going
to<00:01:50.579> be<00:01:50.670> our<00:01:50.759> only<00:01:50.939> real<00:01:51.270> options<00:01:51.750> because<00:01:52.110> 5<00:01:53.009> is

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
to be our only real options because 5 is

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.789 
to be our only real options because 5 is
prime<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:54.060> these<00:01:54.360> 1<00:01:54.869> &amp;<00:01:55.049> 5<00:01:55.170> are<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.500> only

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
prime so these 1 &amp; 5 are it's only

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.520 
prime so these 1 &amp; 5 are it's only
factor<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.509> something<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.170> going<00:01:58.320> to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
factor so if if something is going to

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.810 
factor so if if something is going to
work<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:59.009> going<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.250> be<00:01:59.369> one<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.579> these<00:01:59.759> two

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
work it's going to be one of these two

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.420 
work it's going to be one of these two
things<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:01.110> try<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.500> by<00:02:01.979> doing<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
things so we try this by doing the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.940 
things so we try this by doing the
distributive<00:02:02.719> property<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:03.960> get<00:02:04.140> 3x

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
distributive property and we get 3x

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.520 
distributive property and we get 3x
squared<00:02:05.899> plus<00:02:06.950> 15<00:02:07.950> X<00:02:08.250> plus<00:02:08.819> X<00:02:09.149> plus<00:02:09.629> 5<00:02:10.080> over

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
squared plus 15 X plus X plus 5 over

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.059 
squared plus 15 X plus X plus 5 over
here<00:02:11.599> 3x<00:02:12.599> squared

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
here 3x squared

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.210 
here 3x squared
sixteen<00:02:15.030> x<00:02:15.299> plus<00:02:15.720> five<00:02:15.989> okay<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.980> one

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
sixteen x plus five okay so this one

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.410 
sixteen x plus five okay so this one
works<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.329> these<00:02:18.930> are<00:02:19.290> our<00:02:19.709> factors<00:02:20.610> just

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
works and and these are our factors just

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.149 
works and and these are our factors just
for<00:02:21.659> fun<00:02:21.900> let's<00:02:21.930> go<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.500> take<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.709> look<00:02:22.920> at<00:02:23.040> what

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
for fun let's go and take a look at what

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.119 
for fun let's go and take a look at what
the<00:02:23.280> second<00:02:23.610> one<00:02:23.640> might<00:02:23.970> have<00:02:24.120> been<00:02:24.829> and<00:02:25.829> that

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
the second one might have been and that

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.380 
the second one might have been and that
gives<00:02:26.340> us<00:02:26.459> three<00:02:26.849> x<00:02:27.060> squared<00:02:28.010> plus<00:02:29.010> 3x<00:02:29.909> plus

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
gives us three x squared plus 3x plus

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.740 
gives us three x squared plus 3x plus
five<00:02:31.019> x<00:02:31.349> plus<00:02:31.879> five<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:32.909> we<00:02:33.299> can<00:02:33.450> see<00:02:33.599> that

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
five x plus five and we can see that
