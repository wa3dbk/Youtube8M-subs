00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.360
 what exactly is paradox 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.190
 which suffocated the spirit of the festival 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.899
 the spirit is both the discovery 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.340
 and the mixture of genres so and then the 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.989
 respect for the place as I said so he 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.879
 go there to contemporary music 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.250
 we are not passionate about music 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.719
 traditional and the big work in 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.510
 images around the castle 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.850
 so that means 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.109
 to tell you downright revisit places 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.359
 then to bring it down to another 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.519
 dimension problem from a little bit of the 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.269
 trace that has in the past 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.859
 the impression that he is when we see him 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.039
 and who led it downright really 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.039
 elsewhere 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.190
 paradox to come this it comes from a 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.750
 mix between lots of universes and who 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.750
 really sticks in fluorescent identity 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.039
 the idea is to work around the 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.539
 electronic music but in its sense 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.250
 the widest not to decline the 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.209
 different forms than funk music 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.209
 teams cited 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.760
 the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.650
 not 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.020
 Paris 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.740
 we saw a lot of German artists 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.080
 paradox so why do you 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.150
 went there 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.569
 especially good it's a story 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.659
 of favorites finally we know we 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.590
 find that corresponds really hungry they 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.599
 have an approach to music that we 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.010
 really interested what is it both 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.049
 extremely electronic 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.019
 it's really techno what and at the same 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.329
 time they have in their technos 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.790
 brain research is the 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.079
 complexity that actually makes us one 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.389
 always surprised it's always very 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.379
 purposes and a trip it works for the 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.150
 body really for once in the 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.739
 prochians it works and for the body and 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:04:20.009
 for the mind what weary very effective 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:04:22.549
 visually see her tube arrives 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.549
 the year Thursday 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.990
 transport what is it 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.860
 I love it goes the potato elsewhere it's 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:40.119
 ah good memory of a harness I'm not 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.539
 from the beginning but it's under his 

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:42.069
 superb 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.049
 it makes the place live the family that 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.539
 receives and super sweet the team of the 

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:48.309
 spin 4 sauce the technical team is delighted 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.739
 to come play there the collective at the envi 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:55.289
 who tears all you do not see how one 

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:55.289
 is doing better and public is having fun so come on
