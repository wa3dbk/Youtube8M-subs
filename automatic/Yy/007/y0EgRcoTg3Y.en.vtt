no<00:01:32.319> dad<00:01:32.829> I<00:01:35.520> think<00:01:36.520> twice<00:01:36.789> as<00:01:36.969> many<00:01:37.090> lines<00:01:37.359> to<00:01:37.509> be

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
no dad I think twice as many lines to be

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:44.339 
no dad I think twice as many lines to be
better<00:01:42.509> all<00:01:43.509> right<00:01:43.629> I<00:01:43.750> got<00:01:43.899> another<00:01:44.079> layer

fiberglass on top of there I just need

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.319 
fiberglass on top of there I just need
to<00:01:46.659> flip<00:01:46.899> these<00:01:47.020> over<00:01:47.229> and<00:01:48.179> fiberglass<00:01:49.179> them

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
to flip these over and fiberglass them

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.339 
to flip these over and fiberglass them
again<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.689> those<00:01:49.780> parts<00:01:50.079> should<00:01:50.469> be<00:01:50.619> done<00:01:50.799> oh

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349

good though
I<00:02:01.409> got<00:02:02.409> solar<00:02:02.619> panels

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.850 

think<00:03:01.560> so

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:59.790 

electric<00:03:19.110> boat<00:03:19.320> is<00:03:19.590> totally<00:03:20.070> viable

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.670

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.850 

easier<00:04:07.670> parking

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.390 

well<00:04:11.860> we<00:04:12.069> could<00:04:12.280> Golder<00:04:12.670> when<00:04:12.879> I<00:04:13.000> learn<00:04:13.239> you

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
well we could Golder when I learn you

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.539 
well we could Golder when I learn you
could<00:04:15.400> build<00:04:15.519> our<00:04:15.730> own<00:04:15.760> island<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.799> then<00:04:18.370> make

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
could build our own island and then make

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.820 
could build our own island and then make
whatever<00:04:18.729> kind<00:04:19.060> of<00:04:19.180> card<00:04:19.389> in<00:04:19.510> slot<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:19.870> want

solar<00:04:46.410> power<00:04:46.650> I<00:04:47.150> want<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.240> take<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.080> out<00:04:49.170> of<00:04:49.260> the

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
solar power I want to take it out of the

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.830 
solar power I want to take it out of the
water<00:04:49.580> put<00:04:50.580> more<00:04:50.760> fiber<00:04:50.970> glass<00:04:51.270> on<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.630> hulls

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
water put more fiber glass on the hulls

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.320 
water put more fiber glass on the hulls
to<00:04:52.500> make<00:04:52.620> them<00:04:52.740> stronger<00:04:53.040> put<00:04:53.880> a<00:04:53.910> floor<00:04:54.180> on

the hulls with a wire brush and rinsing
it<00:05:17.040> off<00:05:17.130> with<00:05:17.340> fresh<00:05:17.490> water<00:05:17.850> so<00:05:18.270> should<00:05:19.200> be

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
it off with fresh water so should be

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.990 
it off with fresh water so should be
almost<00:05:19.590> ready<00:05:19.770> to<00:05:19.890> put<00:05:20.070> fiberglass<00:05:20.580> on<00:05:20.760> there

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000
