00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.630
 hello welcome I want to show you the 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.769
 way in which you calibrated the lens of a 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:13.650
 xbox 360 particularly in the case of 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.680
 when the chip has been put and only 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.660
 read a few discs in what you 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.600
 happens this xbox that I have here and I want 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.130
 show them what happens 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.130
 I'll light is 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.370
 you can see how the disk starts to 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.900
 turn 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.900
 the xbox is starting 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.840
 and the lens noise is heard 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.900
 moving trying to read the disk 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.090
 but 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.600
 what happens then is that he stays 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.059
 reading already there does not do anything else 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.129
 this same thing happens with a lot of 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.990
 game discs 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:58.050
 there are really few who read 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.670
 but there is a way to fix it 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.309
 the tools that we are going to need 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.309
 they are only a multimeter 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.409
 that is set on the scale to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.080
 measure up to 20 kilos or more and a small 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.320
 flat tip screwdriver 2 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.320
 millimeters 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.690
 Well, what we are going to do is take 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.990
 a measurement 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.120
 in this pre set the one on the side 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.100
 left 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.520
 and we're going to take the measurement between 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.370
 terminal that is here from this 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.080
 side at the top and the one that is 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.080
 on this side in the middle part 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:47.730
 we take the tips of the multimeter 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.730
 and we arrange them to take the reading 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.810
 a little bit difficult there we can see 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.899
 that gives us approximately 7.2 kilos 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.720
 the recommended setting to read the 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.730
 discs 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.860
 3 between 3.2 and 3.6 kilometers what 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.660
 let's do is without letting go 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.860
 and with the help of the screwdriver we are going to 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.160
 turn in the joust of the present 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.040
 until it reaches more or less at 3.5 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.319
 and who 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.510
 this is very slow because it is very 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.540
 sensitive the present and also that 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.730
 Be careful not to damage yourself 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.269
 you have to squeeze a lot you do not have to apply 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.269
 a lot of pressure 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.390
 very well we are in 3.49 remember that 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:48.090
 turns to the left side 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.870
 Now that it's like this we 're going to try it out 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.870
 see how it works 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.730
 well I have already put the disk back and 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.730
 now i'm going to turn on the xbox samsung 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.430
 let's see what happens on the disc 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.850
 begins to turn equally the xbox is 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.850
 turn on 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.100
 Now we can see how the reader 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.100
 move faster and faster 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.730
 the disc logo has already appeared 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.000
 and well, the game started that 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.420
 would be everything really is something simple and 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.700
 Well, if you liked the video, 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.769
 I would like to be told that I 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.750
 they will say if you have done this if 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.349
 they know another way to do it and then 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.349
 thank you
