00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.079 
at the TD 12 I'm really excited about
working<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.009> module<00:00:23.339> because<00:00:23.910> it's

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:24.089 
working with this module because it's

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.179 
working with this module because it's
really<00:00:24.330> simple<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:25.080> set<00:00:25.349> up<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.769> play<00:00:25.859> with

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
really simple to set up and play with

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.970 
really simple to set up and play with
pin<00:00:26.429> tech<00:00:26.640> drums<00:00:27.060> after<00:00:27.509> you<00:00:28.320> go<00:00:28.499> in<00:00:28.740> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
pin tech drums after you go in and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.060 
pin tech drums after you go in and
change<00:00:29.160> just<00:00:29.669> the<00:00:29.820> basic<00:00:30.240> trigger<00:00:30.630> type<00:00:31.070> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
change just the basic trigger type the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.069 
change just the basic trigger type the
settings<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.970> module<00:00:33.449> are<00:00:33.629> pretty<00:00:33.899> much

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
settings of the module are pretty much

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.900 
settings of the module are pretty much
where<00:00:34.379> you<00:00:34.530> need<00:00:34.739> them<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.980> be<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.520> there's<00:00:35.699> not

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
where you need them to be so there's not

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.760 
where you need them to be so there's not
a<00:00:35.969> lot<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.329> user<00:00:36.629> adjustment<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.620> you're

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770

dive<00:01:03.030> into<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.570> module<00:01:03.839> and<00:01:04.320> take<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> look<00:01:04.800> at

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
dive into this module and take a look at

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.480 
dive into this module and take a look at
the<00:01:05.040> settings<00:01:06.110> okay<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.530> said<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:07.980> tv12

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the settings okay like I said the tv12

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.150 
the settings okay like I said the tv12
is<00:01:08.880> really<00:01:09.330> easy<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.810> set<00:01:10.170> up<00:01:10.230> the<00:01:10.620> main<00:01:10.860> thing

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
is really easy to set up the main thing

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.630 
is really easy to set up the main thing
is<00:01:11.630> setting<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.870> correct<00:01:13.290> trigger<00:01:13.770> type<00:01:14.160> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
is setting the correct trigger type and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.150 
is setting the correct trigger type and
to<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.990> we're<00:01:16.230> gonna<00:01:16.350> press<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.890> trigger

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
to do that we're gonna press the trigger

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.700 
to do that we're gonna press the trigger
button<00:01:17.610> that's<00:01:18.510> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.780> take<00:01:18.960> us<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.440> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
button that's going to take us to the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.100 
button that's going to take us to the
trigger<00:01:20.040> bank<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:21.180> tells<00:01:21.510> you<00:01:21.660> what<00:01:21.840> type<00:01:22.080> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
trigger bank that tells you what type of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.290 
trigger bank that tells you what type of
pads<00:01:22.650> you're<00:01:22.920> using<00:01:23.720> for<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:24.750> kick<00:01:25.170> drum

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
pads you're using for your kick drum

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.900 
pads you're using for your kick drum
you're<00:01:27.300> gonna<00:01:27.390> use<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.870> kv-85<00:01:28.670> for<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
you're gonna use the kv-85 for the

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.370 
you're gonna use the kv-85 for the
8-inch<00:01:30.390> gig<00:01:30.840> kick<00:01:31.230> or<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.820> kV<00:01:32.960> 120<00:01:33.960> if<00:01:34.140> you're

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
8-inch gig kick or the kV 120 if you're

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.030 
8-inch gig kick or the kV 120 if you're
using<00:01:34.620> the<00:01:34.950> larger<00:01:35.370> kick<00:01:35.610> drums<00:01:36.380> for<00:01:37.380> any<00:01:37.800> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
using the larger kick drums for any of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.140 
using the larger kick drums for any of
the<00:01:38.190> 12-inch<00:01:38.790> pads<00:01:39.860> like<00:01:40.860> your<00:01:41.070> snare<00:01:41.430> or<00:01:41.760> even

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the 12-inch pads like your snare or even

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.380 
the 12-inch pads like your snare or even
your<00:01:42.270> floor<00:01:42.570> tom<00:01:42.950> I'd<00:01:43.950> suggest<00:01:44.520> using<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:44.940> PD

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
your floor tom I'd suggest using the PD

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.110 
your floor tom I'd suggest using the PD
120<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> seemed<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.310> work<00:01:47.550> a<00:01:47.730> little<00:01:47.850> better

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
120 it seemed to work a little better

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.830 
120 it seemed to work a little better
than<00:01:48.510> using<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.080> 125<00:01:49.890> setting<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.850> then<00:01:51.630> for

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
than using the 125 setting and then for

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.860 
than using the 125 setting and then for
any<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.230> 10-inch<00:01:52.710> pads<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.450> use<00:01:54.660> the

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
any of the 10-inch pads you can use the

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.240 
any of the 10-inch pads you can use the
PD<00:01:55.260> 105<00:01:56.190> or<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:57.690> you're<00:01:57.930> using<00:01:58.230> single<00:01:58.980> zone

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
PD 105 or if you're using single zone

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.270 
PD 105 or if you're using single zone
pads<00:01:59.670> that<00:02:00.300> don't<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.990> rim<00:02:01.200> trigger<00:02:01.620> you

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
pads that don't have the rim trigger you

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.590 
pads that don't have the rim trigger you
can<00:02:02.460> use<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.820> regular<00:02:03.000> PD<00:02:03.660> 100<00:02:05.330> for<00:02:06.330> your

us to our basic you'll notice on the
hi-hat<00:02:58.540> symbol<00:02:59.349> I<00:03:00.060> increase<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.329> sensitivity

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
hi-hat symbol I increase the sensitivity

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.899 
hi-hat symbol I increase the sensitivity
to<00:03:02.440> 20<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.239> then<00:03:04.239> on<00:03:04.359> my<00:03:04.540> snare<00:03:04.870> drum<00:03:04.900> I

to 20 and then on my snare drum I
increase<00:03:06.909> the<00:03:07.209> sensitivity<00:03:07.629> to<00:03:08.230> 9<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.890> was

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
increase the sensitivity to 9 it was

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.330 
increase the sensitivity to 9 it was
normally<00:03:09.489> at<00:03:09.640> 6<00:03:10.090> so<00:03:10.810> I<00:03:10.870> did<00:03:11.079> up<00:03:11.260> those<00:03:11.530> 2<00:03:11.829> just<00:03:12.190> a

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
not hitting your rim you can back down

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.880

really<00:04:20.370> you're<00:04:20.820> not<00:04:20.850> going<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.239> have<00:04:21.450> to

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
really you're not going to have to

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.200 
really you're not going to have to

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.330 
the threshold any of that in the rim
area<00:04:27.180> you'll<00:04:27.780> find<00:04:28.140> that<00:04:28.380> all<00:04:28.590> of<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.920> factory
