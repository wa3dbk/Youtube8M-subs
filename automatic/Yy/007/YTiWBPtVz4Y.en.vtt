00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480 

I<00:00:01.070> think<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.220> real<00:00:02.490> problem<00:00:02.520> was<00:00:04.279> they<00:00:05.279> know

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
I think the real problem was they know

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.089 
I think the real problem was they know
they<00:00:05.970> have<00:00:06.000> barely<00:00:06.509> enough<00:00:06.720> judges<00:00:07.649> here<00:00:07.950> in

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
they have barely enough judges here in

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.549 
they have barely enough judges here in
the<00:00:08.250> bottom<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:09.179> go<00:00:09.360> around<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.230> one

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
the bottom to go around this is one

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.580 
the bottom to go around this is one
cause<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.330> car

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
cause it is to car

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.160 
cause it is to car
and<00:00:14.100> so<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.520> argument<00:00:14.700> was<00:00:15.240> well<00:00:15.480> then<00:00:15.900> that

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
and so the argument was well then that

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.260 
and so the argument was well then that
big<00:00:16.560> car<00:00:17.119> because<00:00:18.119> one<00:00:18.420> fight<00:00:19.170> one<00:00:19.650> show<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.220> a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
big car because one fight one show is a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.620 
big car because one fight one show is a
under<00:00:21.810> scenery<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.100> other<00:00:23.280> God<00:00:23.700> to<00:00:24.240> make

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
under scenery and the other God to make

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.260 
under scenery and the other God to make
it<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.840> juror<00:00:25.170> like<00:00:25.440> 4000<00:00:26.310> Davis<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:27.090> that

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
it a juror like 4000 Davis but that

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.710 
it a juror like 4000 Davis but that
isn't<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:28.260> problem<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.160> problem<00:00:29.190> is<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.480> had

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
isn't the problem the problem is we had

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.510 
isn't the problem the problem is we had

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
judges or referees to go around it

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.030 
judges or referees to go around it

Avatar<00:01:23.670> before<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.300> changes<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.869> made

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
Avatar before for the changes we made

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.990 
Avatar before for the changes we made
this<00:01:25.860> was<00:01:26.130> something<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.460> they<00:01:26.700> always

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
this was something that they always

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.170 
this was something that they always
allow<00:01:27.479> they've<00:01:27.810> all<00:01:27.960> become<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:29.060> you're<00:01:30.060> going

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
allow they've all become so you're going

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.740 
allow they've all become so you're going
to<00:01:30.300> talk<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> him<00:01:30.750> about<00:01:30.869> Jesus

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.520 

I think<00:01:34.550> this

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
I think this

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.590 
I think this
right<00:01:36.740> if<00:01:37.100> they<00:01:37.369> were<00:01:37.549> chil<00:01:37.850> if<00:01:38.180> there<00:01:38.420> was<00:01:38.540> a

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
right if they were chil if there was a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.270 
right if they were chil if there was a
big<00:01:38.990> show<00:01:39.350> like

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
big show like

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.750 
big show like
a<00:01:41.369> big<00:01:41.880> fight

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
a big fight

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.750 
a big fight
another<00:01:44.090> bite<00:01:44.530> thinks<00:01:45.530> they<00:01:45.800> have<00:01:45.830> ways<00:01:46.430> to

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
another bite thinks they have ways to

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.860 
another bite thinks they have ways to
say<00:01:47.000> no

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
say no

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.900 
say no
so<00:01:47.990> they<00:01:48.140> judge<00:01:48.500> in<00:01:48.710> on<00:01:48.860> what<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.250> revenue<00:01:49.730> is

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
so they judge in on what the revenue is

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.540 
so they judge in on what the revenue is
going<00:01:50.150> to<00:01:50.240> see<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.840> that's<00:01:51.320> not<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.620> criteria

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
going to see and that's not the criteria

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.300 
going to see and that's not the criteria
the<00:01:52.700> criteria<00:01:52.730> is<00:01:53.570> how<00:01:54.380> many<00:01:54.710> bikes

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the criteria is how many bikes

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.970 
the criteria is how many bikes
the<00:01:56.399> judges<00:01:57.060> saliva<00:01:57.720> can<00:01:58.049> record

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
the judges saliva can record

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.280 
the judges saliva can record
it<00:01:59.340> was<00:01:59.520> due<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.480> go<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> an<00:02:00.750> immediate<00:02:00.930> rematch

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
it was due to go to an immediate rematch

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.420 
it was due to go to an immediate rematch
ours<00:02:01.650> are<00:02:01.800> going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.980> be<00:02:02.040> something<00:02:02.250> in
