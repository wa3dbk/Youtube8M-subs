00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.879 
to us and I think tonight it just kind
of<00:00:11.580> seesaw<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.059> little<00:00:12.210> bit<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.690> know<00:00:12.889> we

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
of seesaw it a little bit you know we

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.620 
of seesaw it a little bit you know we
start<00:00:14.130> off<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> great<00:00:14.549> start<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.030> course<00:00:15.240> and

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630

when when you guys had the lead as like

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
think at that point in time not that the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:43.209 
think at that point in time not that the
game<00:01:41.689> was<00:01:41.840> over<00:01:41.990> but<00:01:42.350> that<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:42.740> had<00:01:42.890> control

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
game was over but that you had control

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:48.249 
game was over but that you had control
of<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.579> game<00:01:45.759> no<00:01:46.759> not<00:01:47.149> at<00:01:47.270> all<00:01:47.359> we<00:01:47.689> definitely

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
of the game no not at all we definitely

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.980 
of the game no not at all we definitely
went<00:01:48.380> into<00:01:48.560> halftime<00:01:48.789> feeling<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:50.840> know<00:01:50.959> like

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
went into halftime feeling you know like

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.550 
went into halftime feeling you know like
momentum<00:01:51.709> sort<00:01:52.490> of<00:01:52.579> swung<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:52.819> little<00:01:53.090> bit

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
momentum sort of swung a little bit

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.469 
momentum sort of swung a little bit
before<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.619> break<00:01:54.799> but<00:01:55.069> I<00:01:55.520> don't<00:01:56.149> think<00:01:56.359> there

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
before the break but I don't think there

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.999 
before the break but I don't think there
was<00:01:56.569> one<00:01:56.630> minute<00:01:57.049> we<00:01:57.200> took<00:01:57.349> for<00:01:57.530> granted<00:01:57.560> or

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
was one minute we took for granted or

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:58.839 
was one minute we took for granted or
thought<00:01:58.159> that<00:01:58.280> we're<00:01:58.369> going<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.579> win<00:01:58.700> it

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
thought that we're going to win it

season's over and kind of just the way

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.260 
season's over and kind of just the way
it<00:02:46.030> happened<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.810> know<00:02:46.930> very<00:02:47.860> quickly<00:02:48.270> you

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
it happened you know very quickly you

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.940 
it happened you know very quickly you
know<00:02:49.390> all<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.810> sudden<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.410> buzzers<00:02:50.680> going

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
know all of a sudden the buzzers going

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.000 
know all of a sudden the buzzers going
off<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.870> know<00:02:52.990> there's<00:02:53.470> this<00:02:53.680> wait<00:02:53.980> a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
off and you know there's this wait a

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.920 
off and you know there's this wait a
minute<00:02:54.660> moment<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.990> I<00:02:56.410> think<00:02:57.600> this<00:02:58.600> is<00:02:58.720> one<00:02:58.870> of

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
minute moment and I think this is one of

minute moment and I think this is one of
those<00:02:59.020> things<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.380> doesn't<00:02:59.530> set<00:03:00.070> in<00:03:00.250> until
