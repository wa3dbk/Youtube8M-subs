00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.160
 nice worked as a cleaning lady in the house 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.690
 from Dona Cleuza, one more day 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.820
 paulinho's birthday 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.859
 Dona Cleusa, I could not find the author 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.380
 would be open to order without 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.529
 brigadeiros can let me do the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.609
 lady says start if you do 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.310
 appropriate $ 130 responded from the ship and 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.610
 Brigadiers were a delight. 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.420
 you should do to sell shows 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.270
 here I will tell you to your friends and it was 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.450
 as soon as it enters the goal of the cios 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.940
 the business process consists of three 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.340
 first negotiate the order after 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.390
 make the order and finally deliver 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.149
 the request 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.629
 the newest and most complex phase for alice is 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.010
 the first stage of the negotiation itself is 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.800
 novelty 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.229
 depending on who makes the request to nice 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.979
 follows a different path for the owner 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.710
 cleza 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.890
 she charges 1 and 30 for each brigadeiro 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.210
 no matter quantities are very grateful 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.850
 na creuza 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.040
 already to the others he said he does not answer 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.220
 order with less than 100 units 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.880
 not worth even a thousand 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.040
 it is very risky plus the nice not 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.159
 answers same-day orders 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.259
 God grant me what here is when you negotiate 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.930
 with the customer for the first time 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.090
 nice I only accept the order if the customer 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.079
 has been indicated by someone from your 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.810
 confidence 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.640
 there are a lot of dishonest people out there for 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.850
 already known customers 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.369
 it takes into account the historical 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.159
 may even take default once again two 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.390
 nor think for new or 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.170
 unknown 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.120
 the price of each brigadeiro is a 60 and 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.930
 this way we have the flow of the process 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.590
 to negotiate today complicated request this 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.750
 huh 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.510
 we can simplify the drawing if 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.470
 separated the processes into the rules of 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.830
 business 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.720
 The first step in negotiating is to check 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.790
 the validity of the request 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.030
 then we will see the rules that control 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.460
 that if the request is valid it is 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.360
 canceled and the brigadier will not be 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.730
 made 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.110
 the value is calculated only for the 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.630
 valid orders 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.690
 there are also rules to help here and with 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.140
 this the negotiation is concluded today 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.610
 the process was just that and pro 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.550
 publishing house 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.140
 the process is really simple 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.750
 separate from business rules 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.010
 let's see the first rule to know if 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.260
 the request is valid 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.750
 we need to determine the customer type 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.460
 and know if it's worth it 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.640
 we can show all results 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.120
 possible on a table requests 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.670
 VIP clients are always valid 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.640
 ordinary customers are only served if 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.760
 it's worth it and bad customer all the time 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.580
 but as it always goes up in this is 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.459
 defined in another rule that depends on the 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.470
 amount and deadline for what we have already seen 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.770
 an application is only worth to 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.830
 amounts between 100 and a thousand and deadlines 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.950
 at least one day to do in Sao 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.170
 even another rule used to 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.510
 determine if the type of bird client 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.540
 common or bad 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.150
 this depends on the payer profile of 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.940
 indication and who the customer is 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.900
 currently only owner cleuza is considered 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.070
 a VIP customer 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.370
 are many customers who have already bought and 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.650
 paid on time or who have an appointment are 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.720
 considered common customers 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.310
 unknown or unpaid 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.410
 considered bad 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.530
 I can even so the cap once more two 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.470
 nor think that's what the profile rule 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.440
 of payer seeks to avoid questioning whether 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.170
 already bought ans and if you paid a deadline one 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.570
 client is only considered a good payer 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.070
 if you respond positively to these two 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.190
 questions 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.500
 otherwise it may be classified 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.380
 like a deceased another known the 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.870
 order is set to valid based on the 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.540
 in this family of business rules and 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.940
 This is not a joke in the flow . 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.800
 are activities in the rules that guide 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.590
 the decisions 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.870
 the rule of the value of feeling in the heart 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.150
 also has its own structure 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.000
 it depends on the type of customer and 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.420
 quantity requested type of customer is 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.270
 that bad common VIP business right? 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:47.900
 we already have this rule modeled 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:51.350
 the value will then be the quantity times 1 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.330
 and 30 for VIP clients and sometimes about 60 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.440
 for any other was simply 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.000
 in the process and better than that 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.100
 independent of business rules 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.800
 if in the future we change the value of the price 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.060
 the rules of whoever lives the process 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.750
 keeps you stable 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.120
 I liked the separation between processes and 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.370
 rules is a fundamental concept in 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.200
 business modeling and can help 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.010
 enough to simplify and manage 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.010
 organizations
