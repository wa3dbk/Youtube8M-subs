00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.080
 here 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.440
 Hello, what are we going to do today? 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.260
 They are some Christmas ornaments 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.900
 to make a santa claus a reindeer and a tree 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.490
 of Christmas 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.420
 I'm going to catch 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.420
 for they thought 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.989
 of the two- sided thing we are the turn and what 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.989
 we put what is the basis 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.950
 we want in this 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.010
 is going to be some peaks that will teach us the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.010
 bottom part of what is the fir 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.100
 we can do it by show of hands what 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.310
 we can do 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.310
 previously with 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.750
 with a pencil 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.890
 and we started dinner 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.390
 we went up a little bit more than 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.650
 then we're over 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.650
 we can cut it 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.630
 and 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.420
 so that we do not move the paper you 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.610
 we will put in the heat points 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.790
 and it will not be easier when lining 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.790
 the 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.570
 and I think we're going easy 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.170
 I entered quoted that left over 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.570
 we doubled the opposite 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.820
 and the 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.090
 to be able to cut it and now 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.350
 we will continue 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.350
 doing what is the tree 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:12.280
 we can cut out pieces of paper 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.540
 harold colors 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.380
 or even I have thought of making little balls 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.380
 These are felt 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.300
 but we crave 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.910
 with different points of the tree 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.870
 back I glued some balls of felt 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.870
 but you can get latina 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.570
 you can put felt clippings and 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.590
 You can even put the glitter of 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.590
 this formica is that there 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.290
 or smooth glitter is simply embellish 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.360
 a little bit what is the tree 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.280
 and nothing what we are going to do is make 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.280
 for the kingdom the little eyes 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.050
 and we are going to put 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.690
 we will take what is the center more or 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.690
 less 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.900
 let's do the nose now 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.760
 or the truffle 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.400
 without cuts 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.260
 red 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.260
 we will give it an oval shape 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.170
 we will place it just below the eyes 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.540
 and this we can use for example 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.890
 with the lid of what the pot is 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.890
 we can make a cut 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:08.080
 we made a cut here in the center 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.080
 of the cover can be an 8 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.790
 and now in this we are going to do what 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.790
 It's the Santa Claus costume 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.470
 so that the heat of black color 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.960
 like the boat 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:42.350
 and in the center where we had tried 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:45.250
 before let's say this so they do not square 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.250
 One with another 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.800
 two 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.310
 we know what we're going to be left over and what 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.310
 we cut 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.910
 we 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.770
 what we go in the base we go all the 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.770
 return to the boat 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.139
 and what we are going to do is put the 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.139
 Bible 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.420
 we do not want a yellow color 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.530
 we will do we have more or less that it will be a 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.950
 little bigger than what is the 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.950
 belt 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:42.510
 and now we fold it a little 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.510
 in half 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.030
 we give you a little cut here 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.330
 now once finished putting the zeal 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.660
 what I have 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.660
 we pick up the boat 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:24.889
 let's put the villa by the conacyt 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.889
 as you will see we are going to put a little 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:28.169
 it is comfortable 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:35.479
 this for example can serve us for 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.379
 put any thing this as many 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.379
 of the visitors 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:43.599
 they are our
