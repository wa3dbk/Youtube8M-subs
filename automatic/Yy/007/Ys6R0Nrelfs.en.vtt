00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
a belt carrying case I recommend not

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.150 
a belt carrying case I recommend not
opening<00:04:52.960> it<00:04:53.080> especially<00:04:53.470> because<00:04:53.740> it's<00:04:53.979> Jeff

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
opening it especially because it's Jeff

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.290 
opening it especially because it's Jeff
Hardy<00:04:54.550> so<00:04:54.729> it<00:04:54.820> may<00:04:54.940> be<00:04:55.000> worth<00:04:55.270> something

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
Hardy so it may be worth something

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.750 
Hardy so it may be worth something
either<00:04:56.229> right<00:04:56.560> away<00:04:56.800> or<00:04:56.949> down<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.310> line<00:04:57.490> if
