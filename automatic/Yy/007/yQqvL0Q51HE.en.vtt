00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hello everybody welcome to an

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.740 
hello everybody welcome to an
introduction<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.669> computers<00:00:03.179> my<00:00:03.449> name<00:00:03.600> is

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
introduction to computers my name is

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.329 
introduction to computers my name is
William<00:00:04.110> Drescher<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.589> in<00:00:04.859> this<00:00:05.069> lesson

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
William Drescher and in this lesson

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.860 
William Drescher and in this lesson
we're<00:00:05.640> going<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.879> be<00:00:06.029> talking<00:00:06.240> about<00:00:06.450> the

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
we're going to be talking about the

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.600 
we're going to be talking about the
basics<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.589> computer<00:00:08.370> memory<00:00:10.309> so<00:00:11.309> what<00:00:11.490> is

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
basics of computer memory so what is

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.390 
basics of computer memory so what is
computer<00:00:12.059> memory<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:13.200> basically<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.070> way<00:00:14.190> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
computer memory is basically the way the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.640 
computer memory is basically the way the
computer<00:00:14.670> stores<00:00:15.179> data<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.929> what<00:00:16.260> how<00:00:16.470> it

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
computer stores data and what how it

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.310 
computer stores data and what how it
remembers<00:00:17.250> what<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.060> do<00:00:18.390> while<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:19.050> turned

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
remembers what you do while it's turned

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.540 
remembers what you do while it's turned
on<00:00:20.449> memory<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.720> stored<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.380> bits<00:00:22.769> which<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.519> a

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
on memory is stored in bits which is a

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.990 
on memory is stored in bits which is a
combination<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.390> word<00:00:24.570> binary<00:00:25.140> digit<00:00:25.740> and

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
combination of the word binary digit and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.429 
combination of the word binary digit and
AB<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.619> can<00:00:28.619> either<00:00:28.859> be<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.429> or<00:00:30.029> off<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
AB it can either be on or off in the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.950 
AB it can either be on or off in the
computer<00:00:31.859> which<00:00:32.160> also<00:00:32.880> equates<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.510> 1<00:00:33.780> or<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
computer which also equates to a 1 or a

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.420 
computer which also equates to a 1 or a
0<00:00:34.050> respectively<00:00:35.450> a<00:00:36.450> bit<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.649> most<00:00:37.860> basic

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
0 respectively a bit is the most basic

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.299 
0 respectively a bit is the most basic
form<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.059> memory<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.899> if<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.680> get<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
form of memory so if you can get the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.160 
form of memory so if you can get the
smallest<00:00:41.850> amount<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.510> memory<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.899> can

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
smallest amount of memory you can

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.639 
smallest amount of memory you can
possibly<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.399> computer<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.260> one<00:00:46.260> bit

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
possibly have in the computer is one bit

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.220 
possibly have in the computer is one bit
that's<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.789> it's<00:00:48.000> either<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.329> true<00:00:48.809> or<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> false

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
that's it it's either a true or a false

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.360 
that's it it's either a true or a false
so<00:00:49.710> 1<00:00:49.920> or<00:00:50.039> 0<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> how<00:00:52.680> does<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.949> computer

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
so 1 or 0 so how does the computer

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.630 
so 1 or 0 so how does the computer
actually<00:00:53.579> use<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:55.620> keep<00:00:56.280> track<00:00:56.610> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
actually use this to keep track of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.680 
actually use this to keep track of
information

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
information

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.360 
information
well<00:00:59.510> data<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.840> computer<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.410> divided<00:01:01.949> into

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
well data in a computer is divided into

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.760 
well data in a computer is divided into
cells<00:01:03.530> one<00:01:04.530> cell<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.900> pattern<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.200> eight

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
cells one cell is a pattern of eight

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.210 
cells one cell is a pattern of eight
bits<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.570> get<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> pattern<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.350> ones<00:01:10.979> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
bits so you get a pattern of ones and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.070 
bits so you get a pattern of ones and
zeros<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.720> eight<00:01:13.350> bits<00:01:14.189> long<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.299> that

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
zeros that is eight bits long and that

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.109 
zeros that is eight bits long and that
is<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.560> cell<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:18.650> cell<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:20.009> also<00:01:20.670> known<00:01:20.909> as<00:01:21.090> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
is one cell a cell is also known as a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.630 
is one cell a cell is also known as a
byte<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:23.240> one<00:01:24.240> byte<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:25.080> data<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.920> worth<00:01:26.340> eight

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
byte so one byte of data is worth eight

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.780 
byte so one byte of data is worth eight
bits<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.500> kind<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.860> saying<00:01:29.159> one

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
bits so it's kind of like saying one

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.260 
bits so it's kind of like saying one
dollar<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.329> worth<00:01:30.509> twenty-five<00:01:31.200> or<00:01:31.470> nah<00:01:32.270> one

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
dollar is worth twenty-five or nah one

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.410 
dollar is worth twenty-five or nah one
dollar<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.689> worth<00:01:33.900> four<00:01:34.530> quarters<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.759> one

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
dollar is worth four quarters so one

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.609 
dollar is worth four quarters so one
byte<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.140> worth<00:01:37.439> eight<00:01:37.710> bits<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.229> bytes<00:01:40.229> are

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
byte is worth eight bits and bytes are

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.080 
byte is worth eight bits and bytes are
then<00:01:41.490> grouped<00:01:42.240> into<00:01:42.509> words<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.820> four<00:01:44.820> bytes

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
then grouped into words so four bytes

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.120 
then grouped into words so four bytes
all<00:01:45.479> squished<00:01:45.930> together<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.530> equal<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.950> one

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
all squished together is equal to one

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.969 
all squished together is equal to one
word<00:01:47.369> that's<00:01:48.180> usually<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.689> most<00:01:48.930> systems<00:01:49.290> you

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
word that's usually in most systems you

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.280 
word that's usually in most systems you
can<00:01:50.130> sometimes<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.880> system<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.689> can

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
can sometimes get a system that is can

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.340 
can sometimes get a system that is can
have<00:01:52.530> two<00:01:53.070> bytes<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.729> word<00:01:54.479> or<00:01:54.840> maybe<00:01:55.020> six

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
have two bytes is a word or maybe six

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.350 
have two bytes is a word or maybe six
bytes<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> word<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:56.820> more<00:01:57.030> common

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
bytes is a word but it's more common

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.920 
bytes is a word but it's more common
that<00:01:57.509> four<00:01:57.750> bytes<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> word<00:01:58.729> so<00:01:59.729> each<00:02:00.450> word

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
that four bytes is a word so each word

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
that four bytes is a word so each word
is<00:02:01.229> assigned<00:02:01.649> an<00:02:01.890> address<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.579> memory<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.950> each

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
is assigned an address in memory so each

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.050 
is assigned an address in memory so each
address<00:02:05.750> it's<00:02:06.750> always<00:02:07.229> ordered<00:02:07.879> from<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
address it's always ordered from the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.080 
address it's always ordered from the
lowest<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.750> highest<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:11.430> starts<00:02:11.940> at

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
lowest to the highest and it starts at

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.360 
lowest to the highest and it starts at
zero

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
zero

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.880 
zero
if<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:13.940> wanted<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.569> store<00:02:14.930> some<00:02:15.290> data<00:02:15.319> in

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
if you wanted to store some data in

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.940 
if you wanted to store some data in
there<00:02:16.630> let's<00:02:17.630> go<00:02:17.750> back<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.170> water<00:02:18.620> in<00:02:18.860> the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
there let's go back to the water in the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.199 
there let's go back to the water in the
cups<00:02:19.220> example<00:02:19.819> you<00:02:20.569> have<00:02:20.750> your<00:02:20.930> glasses

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
cups example you have your glasses

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.630 
cups example you have your glasses
essentially<00:02:23.209> then<00:02:23.420> they<00:02:23.599> are<00:02:23.840> your<00:02:24.140> words<00:02:24.739> so

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
essentially then they are your words so

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.449 
essentially then they are your words so
the<00:02:26.270> glass<00:02:26.599> if<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.230> line<00:02:27.470> them<00:02:27.650> up<00:02:27.770> on<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.950> table

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
the glass if you line them up on a table

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.509 
the glass if you line them up on a table
and<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.780> numbered<00:02:29.780> all<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.140> glasses<00:02:30.519> you'd

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
and you numbered all the glasses you'd

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.270 
and you numbered all the glasses you'd
start<00:02:31.940> with<00:02:32.000> zero<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.959> then<00:02:33.590> count<00:02:34.010> upwards

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
start with zero and then count upwards

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.910 
start with zero and then count upwards
so<00:02:35.060> your<00:02:35.239> first<00:02:35.510> glass<00:02:35.870> is<00:02:36.170> actually<00:02:36.380> glass

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
so your first glass is actually glass

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.490 
so your first glass is actually glass
zero<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:37.849> your<00:02:38.300> second<00:02:38.690> glass<00:02:38.930> is<00:02:39.290> glass

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
zero and your second glass is glass

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.009 
zero and your second glass is glass
number<00:02:39.980> one<00:02:40.569> so<00:02:41.569> if<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.920> wanted<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.400> put<00:02:44.019> two

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
number one so if you wanted to put two

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.350 
number one so if you wanted to put two
pints<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.650> water<00:02:45.920> into<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.370> glass<00:02:46.459> that's<00:02:47.150> quite

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
pints of water into a glass that's quite

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.979 
pints of water into a glass that's quite
a<00:02:47.420> lot<00:02:47.569> of<00:02:47.600> water<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:48.019> one<00:02:48.170> glass<00:02:48.549> you<00:02:49.549> would

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
a lot of water in one glass you would

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.110 
a lot of water in one glass you would
put<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.140> in<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.380> first<00:02:51.980> glass<00:02:52.220> at<00:02:52.459> zero<00:02:52.760> and

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
put it in the first glass at zero and

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.840 
put it in the first glass at zero and
you<00:02:53.830> pour<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.980> water<00:02:55.100> in<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.549> then<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:55.819> put

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
you pour the water in and then you put

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.530 
you pour the water in and then you put
say<00:02:56.480> five<00:02:57.140> pints<00:02:57.530> in<00:02:57.920> glass<00:02:58.459> number<00:02:58.849> one<00:02:59.209> and

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
say five pints in glass number one and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.670 
say five pints in glass number one and
you<00:02:59.959> pour<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.349> in<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.910> basically<00:03:02.380> it's<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.620> way

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
you pour that in so basically it's a way

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.479 
you pour that in so basically it's a way
of<00:03:03.890> keeping<00:03:04.310> track<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:04.940> which<00:03:05.900> glass<00:03:06.769> has<00:03:07.220> how

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
of keeping track of which glass has how

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.970 
of keeping track of which glass has how
much<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.209> it's<00:03:08.900> just<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.260> it's<00:03:09.620> just<00:03:09.739> a

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
much in it it's just a it's just a

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.490 
much in it it's just a it's just a
labeling<00:03:10.489> system<00:03:10.880> really<00:03:13.209> so<00:03:14.209> there<00:03:14.810> are<00:03:15.019> two

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
labeling system really so there are two

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.160 
labeling system really so there are two
main<00:03:15.920> types<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.489> memory<00:03:16.790> there's<00:03:17.480> random

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
main types of memory there's random

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.099 
main types of memory there's random
access<00:03:18.530> memory<00:03:18.950> or<00:03:19.190> RAM<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.239> read-only

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
access memory or RAM and read-only

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.199 
access memory or RAM and read-only
memory<00:03:21.530> or<00:03:21.859> ROM<00:03:24.549> random<00:03:25.549> access<00:03:25.850> memory

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
memory or ROM random access memory

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.449 
memory or ROM random access memory
essentially<00:03:26.930> works<00:03:27.140> like<00:03:27.320> this<00:03:27.500> it's<00:03:28.190> the

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
essentially works like this it's the

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.250 
essentially works like this it's the
main<00:03:28.760> memory<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.359> the<00:03:29.450> computer<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.140> the

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
main memory of the computer so the

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.979 
main memory of the computer so the
computer<00:03:30.290> will<00:03:30.890> always<00:03:31.220> look<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.609> it<00:03:31.760> first<00:03:32.209> to

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
computer will always look to it first to

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.099 
computer will always look to it first to
look<00:03:33.200> for<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.769> data<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.250> needs

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
look for the data it needs

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.449 
look for the data it needs
it's<00:03:36.109> the<00:03:36.470> short-term<00:03:36.920> memory<00:03:36.980> of<00:03:37.400> the

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
it's the short-term memory of the

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.030 
it's the short-term memory of the
computer<00:03:37.940> so<00:03:38.420> when<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:39.170> turn<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.680> computer

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
computer so when you turn the computer

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.569 
computer so when you turn the computer
off<00:03:40.069> it<00:03:41.000> essentially<00:03:41.989> just<00:03:42.100> gets<00:03:43.100> rid<00:03:43.340> of<00:03:43.459> it

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
off it essentially just gets rid of it

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.530 
off it essentially just gets rid of it
so<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:46.069> need<00:03:46.220> a<00:03:46.280> different<00:03:46.760> source<00:03:47.060> to

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
so you you need a different source to

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.150 
so you you need a different source to
keep<00:03:47.900> your<00:03:48.139> data<00:03:48.319> after<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:48.889> turn<00:03:49.069> the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
keep your data after you turn the

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.590 
keep your data after you turn the
computer<00:03:49.250> off<00:03:49.549> which<00:03:49.880> we'll<00:03:50.060> get<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.420> a

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
computer off which we'll get to in a

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.720 
computer off which we'll get to in a
moment<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:51.739> stores<00:03:52.730> data<00:03:53.980> before<00:03:54.980> it's<00:03:55.489> saved

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
moment it stores data before it's saved

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.479 
moment it stores data before it's saved
to<00:03:55.880> a<00:03:55.910> file<00:03:56.239> so<00:03:56.569> essentially<00:03:57.530> if<00:03:57.709> you<00:03:58.069> want<00:03:58.370> to

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
to a file so essentially if you want to

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.330 
to a file so essentially if you want to
if<00:03:58.609> you're<00:03:58.819> using<00:03:59.239> word<00:04:00.100> whatever<00:04:01.100> you're

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
if you're using word whatever you're

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.120 
if you're using word whatever you're
currently<00:04:01.940> typing<00:04:02.239> into<00:04:02.989> the<00:04:03.260> Microsoft<00:04:03.799> Word

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
currently typing into the Microsoft Word

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.479 
currently typing into the Microsoft Word
program<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:05.389> data<00:04:05.720> is<00:04:05.930> stored<00:04:06.170> in<00:04:06.350> RAM<00:04:06.650> it's

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
program that data is stored in RAM it's

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.640 
program that data is stored in RAM it's
later<00:04:07.880> when<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:08.329> hit<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.690> Save<00:04:08.989> button<00:04:09.019> it

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
later when you hit the Save button it

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.280 
later when you hit the Save button it
stores<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.700> a<00:04:10.730> file<00:04:11.180> which<00:04:11.690> takes<00:04:11.989> it<00:04:12.170> out

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
stores it to a file which takes it out

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.830 
stores it to a file which takes it out
of<00:04:12.470> RAM<00:04:12.739> so<00:04:13.069> you<00:04:13.130> keep<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:13.910> when<00:04:14.480> you<00:04:14.569> turn<00:04:14.750> the

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
of RAM so you keep it when you turn the

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.890 
of RAM so you keep it when you turn the
computer<00:04:14.930> off<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:16.329> just<00:04:17.329> a<00:04:17.419> little<00:04:17.660> bit<00:04:17.780> of

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
computer off and just a little bit of

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.469 
computer off and just a little bit of
information<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:19.130> standard<00:04:19.549> amount<00:04:19.760> in<00:04:20.060> a

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
information the standard amount in a

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.810 
information the standard amount in a
computer<00:04:20.930> is<00:04:21.109> two<00:04:21.349> gigabytes<00:04:21.799> which<00:04:22.580> is

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
computer is two gigabytes which is

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.630 
computer is two gigabytes which is
abbreviated<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.510> GB<00:04:23.990> not<00:04:24.770> Great<00:04:25.010> Britain<00:04:25.430> it's

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
abbreviated to GB not Great Britain it's

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.830 
abbreviated to GB not Great Britain it's
gigabytes

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
gigabytes

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
gigabytes
and<00:04:26.980> nowadays<00:04:28.270> you<00:04:29.270> usually<00:04:30.110> will<00:04:30.650> see

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
and nowadays you usually will see

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.560 
and nowadays you usually will see
probably<00:04:31.130> four<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:33.530> sometimes<00:04:34.010> eight<00:04:34.490> in<00:04:34.880> if

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
probably four and sometimes eight in if

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.390 
probably four and sometimes eight in if
you<00:04:35.810> have<00:04:35.960> like<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.139> production<00:04:36.710> computer<00:04:37.160> for

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
you have like a production computer for

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.890 
you have like a production computer for
making<00:04:37.730> videos<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.270> things<00:04:38.510> you'll<00:04:38.690> probably

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
making videos and things you'll probably

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.560 
making videos and things you'll probably
see<00:04:39.200> eight<00:04:39.440> gigs<00:04:39.770> in<00:04:39.950> there<00:04:40.130> but<00:04:40.850> some

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
see eight gigs in there but some

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.170 
see eight gigs in there but some
computers<00:04:42.110> you'll<00:04:42.320> see<00:04:42.530> it<00:04:42.710> upwards<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.490> 32

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
computers you'll see it upwards to 32

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.140 
computers you'll see it upwards to 32
gigabytes<00:04:44.540> which<00:04:45.080> is<00:04:45.260> a<00:04:45.290> lot<00:04:45.650> of<00:04:45.800> RAM<00:04:46.070> but<00:04:46.850> it

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
gigabytes which is a lot of RAM but it

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.870 
gigabytes which is a lot of RAM but it
essentially<00:04:47.780> lets<00:04:48.139> you<00:04:48.260> hold<00:04:48.500> bigger<00:04:49.340> files

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
essentially lets you hold bigger files

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.080 
essentially lets you hold bigger files
without<00:04:50.510> saving<00:04:51.350> them<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.800> that<00:04:52.790> can

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
without saving them and that can

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.210 
without saving them and that can
essentially<00:04:53.600> make<00:04:53.990> your<00:04:54.139> computer<00:04:54.440> faster<00:04:54.590> as

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
essentially make your computer faster as

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.680 
essentially make your computer faster as
well<00:04:57.070> so<00:04:58.070> read-only<00:04:58.370> memory<00:04:58.760> is<00:04:59.180> the

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
well so read-only memory is the

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.890 
well so read-only memory is the
long-term<00:05:00.590> memory<00:05:01.040> of<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.220> computer<00:05:01.900> it's

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
long-term memory of the computer it's

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.290 
long-term memory of the computer it's
also<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.590> second<00:05:04.040> storage<00:05:04.430> choice<00:05:04.850> for<00:05:05.210> the

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
also the second storage choice for the

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.450 
also the second storage choice for the
computer<00:05:05.750> some<00:05:06.530> a<00:05:06.650> few<00:05:06.860> examples<00:05:07.340> of

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
computer some a few examples of

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.360 
computer some a few examples of
read-only<00:05:08.000> memory<00:05:08.390> are<00:05:08.720> CDs<00:05:09.110> and<00:05:09.290> DVDs<00:05:09.370> that

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
read-only memory are CDs and DVDs that

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.550 
read-only memory are CDs and DVDs that
when<00:05:10.730> you<00:05:10.880> if<00:05:11.090> you<00:05:11.210> put<00:05:11.480> a<00:05:11.510> CD<00:05:11.840> in<00:05:12.050> and<00:05:12.260> you<00:05:12.350> burn

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
when you if you put a CD in and you burn

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.800 
when you if you put a CD in and you burn
all<00:05:12.710> your<00:05:12.740> music<00:05:13.190> to<00:05:13.340> it<00:05:13.520> that's<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.300> term<00:05:14.540> for

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
all your music to it that's the term for

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.750 
all your music to it that's the term for
putting<00:05:15.140> data<00:05:15.350> onto<00:05:15.680> a<00:05:15.770> CD<00:05:15.980> by<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.370> way<00:05:16.550> is

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
putting data onto a CD by the way is

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.980 
putting data onto a CD by the way is
burning<00:05:17.540> if<00:05:17.800> you<00:05:18.800> burn<00:05:19.190> your<00:05:19.630> music<00:05:20.630> to<00:05:20.840> your

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
burning if you burn your music to your

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.940 
burning if you burn your music to your
CD<00:05:21.430> then<00:05:22.430> you're<00:05:23.060> essentially<00:05:23.950> permanently

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
CD then you're essentially permanently

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.440 
CD then you're essentially permanently
putting<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:25.340> on<00:05:25.460> that<00:05:25.580> CD<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:25.970> you<00:05:26.150> can't

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
putting it on that CD and you can't

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.570 
putting it on that CD and you can't
write<00:05:26.720> to<00:05:26.930> it<00:05:27.050> again<00:05:27.320> you<00:05:27.470> can<00:05:27.500> only<00:05:27.770> read<00:05:28.310> from

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
write to it again you can only read from

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.960 
write to it again you can only read from
it<00:05:29.030> so<00:05:29.540> it's<00:05:29.720> read-only<00:05:30.620> memory<00:05:33.460> now<00:05:34.460> there

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
it so it's read-only memory now there

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.550 
it so it's read-only memory now there
are<00:05:35.090> these<00:05:35.180> interesting<00:05:35.660> things<00:05:35.720> called<00:05:36.260> hard

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
are these interesting things called hard

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.040 
are these interesting things called hard
disk<00:05:36.890> drives<00:05:37.250> in<00:05:37.490> your<00:05:37.610> computer<00:05:38.090> they're<00:05:39.020> a

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
disk drives in your computer they're a

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.430 
disk drives in your computer they're a
form<00:05:39.650> of<00:05:39.919> long<00:05:40.400> term<00:05:40.729> memory<00:05:41.140> but<00:05:42.140> they<00:05:42.289> can

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
form of long term memory but they can

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.400 
form of long term memory but they can
also<00:05:42.650> be<00:05:42.919> written<00:05:43.340> to<00:05:43.520> and<00:05:43.760> read<00:05:43.940> from

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
also be written to and read from

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.700 
also be written to and read from
multiple<00:05:45.410> times<00:05:45.770> the<00:05:46.760> only<00:05:47.000> the<00:05:47.660> only

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
multiple times the only the only

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.140 
multiple times the only the only
downside<00:05:48.710> of<00:05:48.740> this<00:05:49.010> is<00:05:49.190> it's<00:05:49.460> a<00:05:49.550> lot<00:05:49.789> slower

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
downside of this is it's a lot slower

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.440 
downside of this is it's a lot slower
than<00:05:50.479> Ram<00:05:50.900> to<00:05:51.710> write<00:05:51.979> to<00:05:52.250> a<00:05:52.280> hard<00:05:52.970> disk<00:05:53.210> drive

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
than Ram to write to a hard disk drive

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.250 
than Ram to write to a hard disk drive
so<00:05:53.990> the<00:05:54.169> computer<00:05:54.620> prefers<00:05:55.100> to<00:05:55.400> use<00:05:55.430> RAM

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
so the computer prefers to use RAM

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.250 
so the computer prefers to use RAM
instead<00:05:57.260> of<00:05:57.320> the<00:05:57.500> hard<00:05:57.740> drives<00:05:58.360> to<00:05:59.360> kind<00:06:00.140> of

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
instead of the hard drives to kind of

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.440 
instead of the hard drives to kind of
flip-flop<00:06:00.890> information<00:06:01.640> in<00:06:01.760> and<00:06:01.910> out<00:06:02.030> so<00:06:02.330> like

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
flip-flop information in and out so like

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.360 
flip-flop information in and out so like
if<00:06:02.630> you're<00:06:02.750> editing<00:06:03.110> in<00:06:03.200> Word<00:06:03.440> and<00:06:03.710> you<00:06:04.039> had<00:06:04.190> to

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
if you're editing in Word and you had to

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.219 
if you're editing in Word and you had to
write<00:06:04.640> to<00:06:04.910> the<00:06:05.120> hard<00:06:05.300> drive<00:06:05.419> every<00:06:05.900> time<00:06:06.110> you

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
write to the hard drive every time you

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.620 
write to the hard drive every time you
press<00:06:06.410> the<00:06:06.590> key<00:06:06.830> it<00:06:07.550> would<00:06:07.820> take<00:06:08.030> you<00:06:08.180> hours

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
press the key it would take you hours

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.870 
press the key it would take you hours
just<00:06:09.530> to<00:06:09.650> write<00:06:09.830> a<00:06:09.860> sentence<00:06:11.890> so<00:06:12.890> hard<00:06:13.729> disk

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
just to write a sentence so hard disk

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.120 
just to write a sentence so hard disk
drives<00:06:14.120> are<00:06:14.419> useful<00:06:15.410> because<00:06:15.560> they'll<00:06:15.890> keep

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
drives are useful because they'll keep

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.340 
drives are useful because they'll keep
the<00:06:16.340> memory<00:06:16.729> that<00:06:17.270> is<00:06:17.479> written<00:06:17.720> to<00:06:17.870> it<00:06:17.990> even

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
the memory that is written to it even

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.200 
the memory that is written to it even
after<00:06:18.590> the<00:06:18.710> computer<00:06:19.100> is<00:06:19.190> turned<00:06:19.370> off<00:06:19.640> but

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
after the computer is turned off but

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.330 
after the computer is turned off but
they<00:06:20.360> are<00:06:20.570> essentially<00:06:21.260> fast<00:06:21.530> enough<00:06:21.890> to<00:06:22.220> be

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
they are essentially fast enough to be

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.400 
they are essentially fast enough to be
used<00:06:22.640> as<00:06:22.850> the<00:06:23.510> main<00:06:23.720> memory<00:06:24.050> of<00:06:24.169> the<00:06:24.229> computer

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.779 

okay<00:06:27.410> so<00:06:27.470> let's<00:06:27.770> run<00:06:27.919> through<00:06:28.100> a<00:06:28.190> quick<00:06:28.430> review

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
okay so let's run through a quick review

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:32.620 
okay so let's run through a quick review
here<00:06:29.590> memory<00:06:30.590> is<00:06:30.710> stored<00:06:30.979> in<00:06:31.340> 8-bit<00:06:31.700> patterns

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
here memory is stored in 8-bit patterns

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.390 
here memory is stored in 8-bit patterns
those<00:06:33.620> eight<00:06:33.919> bits<00:06:34.430> are<00:06:34.940> known<00:06:35.360> as<00:06:35.539> a<00:06:35.570> byte<00:06:36.400> you

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
those eight bits are known as a byte you

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.130 
those eight bits are known as a byte you
take<00:06:37.640> four<00:06:37.970> of<00:06:38.000> those<00:06:38.240> bytes<00:06:38.570> and<00:06:38.840> put<00:06:39.020> them

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.140 
take four of those bytes and put them

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.640 
take four of those bytes and put them
together<00:06:39.289> and<00:06:39.680> you<00:06:39.860> get<00:06:40.010> a<00:06:40.190> war

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
together and you get a war

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.830 
together and you get a war
or<00:06:40.770> keep<00:06:41.699> up<00:06:41.880> there's<00:06:42.120> a<00:06:42.180> lot<00:06:42.389> of<00:06:42.570> numbers<00:06:42.810> in

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
or keep up there's a lot of numbers in

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.920 
or keep up there's a lot of numbers in
here<00:06:43.110> I<00:06:43.199> know<00:06:43.350> it's<00:06:43.530> really<00:06:43.710> difficult<00:06:44.930> words

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
here I know it's really difficult words

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.010 
here I know it's really difficult words
are<00:06:46.470> organized<00:06:47.130> using<00:06:47.910> their<00:06:48.060> addresses<00:06:48.630> and

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
are organized using their addresses and

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.189 
are organized using their addresses and
it<00:06:49.229> allows<00:06:49.530> you<00:06:49.860> to<00:06:50.039> find<00:06:50.720> where<00:06:51.720> the<00:06:51.960> words

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 
it allows you to find where the words

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:54.469 
it allows you to find where the words
are<00:06:52.440> in<00:06:52.500> the<00:06:52.800> computer<00:06:53.130> is<00:06:53.430> essentially<00:06:54.240> just

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 
are in the computer is essentially just

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:56.330 
are in the computer is essentially just
like<00:06:54.570> the<00:06:54.810> addresses<00:06:55.350> on<00:06:55.470> a<00:06:55.500> house<00:06:55.740> it<00:06:56.070> tells

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
like the addresses on a house it tells

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.510 
like the addresses on a house it tells
you<00:06:56.490> where<00:06:56.759> the<00:06:56.789> house<00:06:57.090> is<00:06:57.620> so<00:06:58.620> an<00:06:58.800> address<00:06:59.310> on

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
you where the house is so an address on

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.550 
you where the house is so an address on
the<00:06:59.669> word<00:06:59.880> tells<00:07:00.330> you<00:07:00.509> where<00:07:00.840> that<00:07:01.080> word<00:07:01.320> is

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
the word tells you where that word is

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.320 
the word tells you where that word is
and<00:07:01.830> where<00:07:02.190> the<00:07:02.430> data<00:07:02.699> is<00:07:02.850> that<00:07:03.810> you<00:07:03.960> want

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
and where the data is that you want

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.210 
and where the data is that you want
there<00:07:06.330> are<00:07:06.360> two<00:07:06.630> types<00:07:06.870> of<00:07:07.050> memory<00:07:07.380> RAM<00:07:07.919> and

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
there are two types of memory RAM and

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.790 
there are two types of memory RAM and
ROM<00:07:08.490> random<00:07:09.449> access<00:07:09.780> memory<00:07:10.139> and<00:07:10.229> read-only

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
ROM random access memory and read-only

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.860 
ROM random access memory and read-only
memory<00:07:11.220> and<00:07:11.610> then<00:07:12.210> there<00:07:12.360> are<00:07:12.509> these<00:07:12.630> things

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870 
memory and then there are these things

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.050 
memory and then there are these things
called<00:07:13.139> hard<00:07:13.500> disk<00:07:13.800> drives<00:07:14.190> which<00:07:14.699> allow<00:07:15.000> you

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
called hard disk drives which allow you

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.900 
called hard disk drives which allow you
to<00:07:15.449> read<00:07:15.780> and<00:07:15.990> write<00:07:16.199> to<00:07:16.470> them<00:07:16.740> but<00:07:17.370> at<00:07:17.490> slower

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:17.910 
to read and write to them but at slower

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.719 
to read and write to them but at slower
speeds<00:07:18.360> than<00:07:18.570> Ram<00:07:18.930> so<00:07:19.740> they're<00:07:19.889> not<00:07:20.070> incorrect

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:20.729 
speeds than Ram so they're not incorrect

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:23.870 
speeds than Ram so they're not incorrect
they're<00:07:20.970> not<00:07:21.150> all<00:07:21.770> read-only<00:07:22.770> but<00:07:23.729> they're

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 
they're not all read-only but they're

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.330 
they're not all read-only but they're
still<00:07:24.150> slower<00:07:24.539> than<00:07:24.690> Ram<00:07:27.830> all<00:07:28.830> right<00:07:29.070> that's

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 
still slower than Ram all right that's

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.219 
still slower than Ram all right that's
all<00:07:29.490> I<00:07:29.520> have<00:07:29.760> for<00:07:29.910> this<00:07:30.030> lesson<00:07:30.479> if<00:07:30.600> you<00:07:30.990> have
