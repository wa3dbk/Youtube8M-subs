put<00:00:04.500> together<00:00:04.770> which<00:00:05.310> I<00:00:05.549> actually<00:00:06.200> made<00:00:07.200> my

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
put together which I actually made my

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.009 
put together which I actually made my
clarinet<00:00:07.799> fall<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.639> just<00:00:09.510> so<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.690> know<00:00:09.750> when

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
clarinet fall and just so you know when

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.660 
clarinet fall and just so you know when
you're<00:00:10.110> putting<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.440> together<00:00:10.679> don't<00:00:11.370> let<00:00:11.580> it

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
you're putting it together don't let it

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.370 
you're putting it together don't let it
fall<00:00:11.849> especially<00:00:12.420> if<00:00:12.480> you're<00:00:12.660> over<00:00:12.929> country

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
fall especially if you're over country

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.900 
fall especially if you're over country
or<00:00:13.530> something<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:14.040> recommend<00:00:14.340> you're<00:00:14.639> over

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
or something I recommend you're over

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.080 
or something I recommend you're over
carpet<00:00:15.389> because<00:00:15.900> if<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:17.340> would<00:00:17.520> be<00:00:17.699> concrete

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
carpet because if it would be concrete

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.820 
carpet because if it would be concrete
