just taking off from the runway after we

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.570 
just taking off from the runway after we
rigged<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> camera<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.920> first<00:01:05.190> day<00:01:05.339> ever

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
there we just basically said we have to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.330 
there we just basically said we have to
have<00:01:18.450> these<00:01:18.600> camera<00:01:18.960> systems<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.470> every<00:01:19.860> shoot

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.220

you know push the envelope you know
physically<00:04:01.830> what<00:04:01.980> we<00:04:02.160> mounted<00:04:02.459> on<00:04:02.610> next<00:04:02.910> and

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
physically what we mounted on next and

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.000
