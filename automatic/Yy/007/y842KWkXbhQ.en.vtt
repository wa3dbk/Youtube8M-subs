00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
is awesome tom hawk and a sort of small

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.620 
is awesome tom hawk and a sort of small
a<00:02:04.770> small<00:02:05.770> blade<00:02:06.100> but<00:02:06.340> he<00:02:06.429> uses<00:02:06.999> to<00:02:07.179> push<00:02:07.420> this

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
a small blade but he uses to push this

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.949 
a small blade but he uses to push this
guy<00:02:07.810> down<00:02:07.869> with<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.590> must<00:02:09.100> it<00:02:09.280> bit<00:02:09.429> but<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.750> so

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
guy down with a must it bit but and so

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.300 
guy down with a must it bit but and so
yeah<00:02:11.080> I<00:02:11.110> think<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.650> again<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.010> going<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.220> be<00:02:12.280> a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
yeah I think that again is going to be a

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.750 
yeah I think that again is going to be a
little<00:02:12.490> less<00:02:12.760> focused<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.980> me<00:02:14.980> i'm<00:02:15.400> not<00:02:15.459> saying

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
little less focused on me i'm not saying

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.160 
little less focused on me i'm not saying
but<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:15.940> was<00:02:16.030> ever<00:02:16.209> really<00:02:16.450> focused<00:02:16.900> i'm<00:02:16.990> just

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
but it was ever really focused i'm just

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.230 
but it was ever really focused i'm just
saying<00:02:17.350> that<00:02:17.410> like<00:02:18.190> most<00:02:18.400> people<00:02:18.760> used<00:02:19.030> for

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
saying that like most people used for

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
saying that like most people used for
hidden<00:02:19.360> blade<00:02:19.660> because<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.959> was<00:02:20.050> most

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
hidden blade because it was most

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.589 
hidden blade because it was most
efficient<00:02:20.590> been<00:02:20.709> here<00:02:20.830> so<00:02:21.400> yeah<00:02:21.550> I'm<00:02:21.730> fights

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
efficient been here so yeah I'm fights
