00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:13.799
 ok people here we are back with some goodies 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.619
 change as you can see the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.720
 small dwelling that once was one 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.220
 abandoned shack now become that 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.949
 case of more interesting apart with the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.760
 tempest ace the madness tube 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.740
 rose coming out 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.240
 let's say he dedicated us a little bit of 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.949
 time and I think to keep it that way because 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.109
 as you know, this is not one 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.210
 construction series so I will not pass 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.190
 the time here to build houses this 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.630
 it should be a fireplace now look 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.879
 to make it work but the thing I wanted 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.829
 try today were two things that don't 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.620
 still faced with the exit and show 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.500
 cobol those for notes not fished in e 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.239
 then some things some look so much that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.559
 cool these trophies I didn't know you did 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.590
 can be hang on the walls 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.420
 other thing, however, they are all at 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.280
 armor all stands that the shipowner 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.750
 or those proportions that can be 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.399
 carry out with the bibliography e 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.280
 present this way tac then 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.080
 let's start realizing now 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.119
 these and see how beautiful they will be 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.770
 inside this beautiful house 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.960
 of sp we begin with the harmon stand 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.640
 armor stand serves serves serves to iron and 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.780
 of the stones lab has therefore let us 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.490
 immediately to do 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.040
 they have to ask we have the enamel that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.509
 let's talk about simple stone perhaps from 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.280
 this part not on this side either 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.689
 this to people one of the things that 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.310
 I must remember to do is that of 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.509
 get coal because I am now 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.250
 going on to wood saw that in 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.710
 not all the adventures of the exit 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.509
 I never screwed anything about the coal and 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.250
 so I'm nothing to disassemble 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.750
 things in fact I'm doing that thing 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.759
 stupid thing that the fireplace should 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.890
 be a fireplace and I mini fireplace 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.180
 bricks are needed for the seraf bricks 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.220
 she has a clay sheet as you can 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.540
 see but I miss the coal at sta 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.640
 dying of hunger is not always less 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.259
 we use this aidan shaw 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.579
 right because I'm a pill though 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.500
 I should keep them because they give a 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.079
 lot of regeneration look at the whole 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.470
 full hunger, on the other hand, the carbon that 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.020
 you have perfect good so want 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.510
 and then the very simple simple 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.040
 very simple rock top or even del 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.810
 diamond even but you do n't think of 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.930
 strategy a little bit or not even 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.250
 a fucking tool to get the 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.990
 diamond so I'll come back in case 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.760
 then it is not too much 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.710
 important in the end diamonds now ne 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.000
 we kinda have you kind of like that 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.680
 diamond stack 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.660
 most things people from 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.130
 you were among the baskets or better now 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.470
 there are temporary accesses sto 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.000
 working from time to time but in the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.640
 meanwhile I would not register in 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.870
 in short, everything is not too short 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.160
 in the end I think I'm doing something in between 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.080
 demonstrate some passages 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.400
 the organization of the house then in the 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.540
 sorting of all the objects I have 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.890
 found resorted to exit 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.620
 but I do n't even want to bore you too much 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.410
 so then I say a little then we say 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.150
 so it is right is in the middle and wise 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.380
 what you have seen chaste all that chaste 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.940
 of English gardens that hello to all 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.100
 accurate etcetera etc. to the ned 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.690
 in short, to understand each other 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.550
 here it was not easy to get that 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.800
 what you find in dungeons so long 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.930
 ago but one element was missing 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.060
 decorative among the trees and has them 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.370
 obtained with the sweat of my forehead 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.140
 like what with south wing edel 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.480
 bombing because obviously to expino me 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.860
 like waiting for impacts, ideas or not 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.660
 worry we will come soon 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.610
 ten how much in this episode me 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.920
 would like to show how it works from 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.810
 hello kraft how to ride these a 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.489
 sorry for the ugly term the cabbage CEO 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.980
 and maybe even how they are reproduced 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.209
 but I think it's something that will show 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.459
 later the reproduction of the chocobos 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.810
 we hope not to engage that 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.010
 skeleton since they will be around like 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.510
 a joke without armor 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.799
 I don't know why I wanted to 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.400
 remove because I wanted to sort as well 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.200
 that 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.030
 I'm a fool, you can say it out loud 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.070
 so in short if we find some mobs 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.620
 that threatens us could also end 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.170
 marty is simply dead and then 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.070
 another thing we need for 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.540
 tame the chocobos as well as 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.100
 obviously I was also playing one 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.750
 kind of turnip and before they had it 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.400
 glimpsed in those parts but they are already 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.320
 lost sight but I think it must anyway 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.760
 to be someone in the baskets then not 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.489
 there will be no problems were 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.840
 dedicate ourselves to dissolving all of a 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.430
 the reason I want to accomplish 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.930
 this path obviously beyond that for 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.459
 an aesthetic reason also because of me 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.280
 a place in tributary of item would be needed 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.170
 that I don't care so they burn 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.850
 the path is the perfect thing of course 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.770
 here I will not leave the wood because I fear that 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.350
 don't be sure at all but I'll put in 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.240
 bricks point here brick bricks ai 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.370
 sides and I think I'm pretty 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.990
 place in the only thing we lack 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.569
 in all this beautiful design ours is 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.040
 the iron then the pieces of iron like 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.829
 you can see as I told you before I 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.870
 14 diamond blocks don't you think of 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.520
 never use them ever ever 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.139
 I don't really know a question I wanted 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.760
 make him how to convert this is true it 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.410
 shard what can i do with this is 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.210
 real richard because for the moment not 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.640
 I'm minding what to do with it I've already tried 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.650
 kraft arles and make small pieces 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.960
 always bigger than emeralds for 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.360
 get emerald mary but don't have it 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.010
 done so I don't know exactly what 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.720
 They serve the business side that reason 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.950
 del scida kindly if you know how 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.050
 so in form texts that every migrant 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.300
 complete what i need for this 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.590
 point is only the iron because I would like 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.120
 really accomplish something more than 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.919
 gymnasium track that to chatter aaa 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.780
 splitting things but I want to achieve 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.389
 something interesting with the mystery 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.790
 of the fuckin 'nest though that of the 29 of 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.770
 iron in excellent or shimano le moments 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.110
 they say that from marble stand what is needed to 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.960
 there are two types of harward stars there 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.600
 these almond stands, however, I do n't know how to do 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.370
 I both know I don't know what you love 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.160
 then maybe they are part of it 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.169
 fucking mode so let's try first 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.300
 realize this armor stand all in 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.080
 iron and then this that has iron and in 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.030
 stack 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:26.580
 I don't know what changes then then stones 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:29.340
 led and aion kingston print air armor 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.870
 stand that we are going to place on the floor 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.700
 superior because down here as you wish 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.930
 see they are quite tight it is 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.310
 in short, I don't want to make things 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.780
 practiced born and then we will try them 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.610
 we will do all our experiments that 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.289
 upstairs at this point we can 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.360
 put a stand on our armor 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.070
 which we see on the lower floor 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.300
 let's take a look at our armor 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.880
 as you can see it cataloged in 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.860
 super worries and let's see if 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.640
 we can find a suit of 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.500
 armor 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.090
 ok maybe the most complete thing that 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.680
 we have the Greek cra chloride light 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.850
 truck right click no ride too 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.190
 let's do so pro 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.840
 then we see crack non ride protection 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.100
 ok ok 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.410
 let's put this beautiful on christoph a 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.600
 my half of every back pack or my god 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.010
 i omitted the break cries mibac that yes 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.580
 they can also back pack that 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.530
 cool 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.000
 that's cool anyway I do n't want to do it 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:20.100
 so I want to take a flight because of 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.340
 strafigo ok it doesn't work the serious no 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.139
 that works it works 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.600
 I don't understand what this is for, maybe 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.040
 this is our armor we see it is 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.050
 our reason therefore harmonizes them 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.180
 stand at this point seem to work 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.120
 we showed the arm on stage il 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:39.720
 the rest is that it is blackburn 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.940
