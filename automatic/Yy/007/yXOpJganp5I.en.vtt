00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
said look at it this way if you could

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.870 
said look at it this way if you could
make<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.240> hundred<00:03:50.930> percent<00:03:51.110> per<00:03:51.709> annum<00:03:52.100> for

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
make a hundred percent per annum for

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.680 
make a hundred percent per annum for
five<00:03:53.180> years<00:03:53.540> on<00:03:53.900> ten<00:03:54.890> thousand<00:03:55.490> dollars<00:03:55.820> you'd

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
five years on ten thousand dollars you'd

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.900 
five years on ten thousand dollars you'd
have<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:56.870> really<00:03:57.530> big<00:03:57.860> amount<00:03:58.250> of<00:03:58.400> money<00:03:58.459> I

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
have a really big amount of money I

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.820 
have a really big amount of money I
guess<00:03:59.300> I'd<00:03:59.450> be<00:03:59.600> about<00:03:59.750> a<00:03:59.810> hundred<00:04:00.020> thousand

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
guess I'd be about a hundred thousand

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.040 
guess I'd be about a hundred thousand
know<00:04:01.490> wouldn't<00:04:01.880> it<00:04:02.180> be<00:04:03.910> 320,000<00:04:04.910> is<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.840> had

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
know wouldn't it be 320,000 is you had

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.420 
know wouldn't it be 320,000 is you had
the<00:04:06.260> snowball<00:04:07.100> effect<00:04:07.340> of<00:04:07.880> compound<00:04:08.870> growth

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
the snowball effect of compound growth

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.040 
the snowball effect of compound growth
so<00:04:10.430> whatever<00:04:10.790> amount<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.180> start<00:04:11.600> with<00:04:11.810> just

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
so whatever amount you start with just

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.080 
so whatever amount you start with just
work<00:04:12.260> it<00:04:12.290> out<00:04:12.530> you'd<00:04:12.890> have<00:04:13.100> in<00:04:13.280> five<00:04:13.580> years

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
work it out you'd have in five years

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.570 
work it out you'd have in five years
with<00:04:15.080> a<00:04:15.110> target<00:04:15.380> growth<00:04:15.709> fifty<00:04:16.100> percent<00:04:16.400> one

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
with a target growth fifty percent one

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.849 
with a target growth fifty percent one
hundred<00:04:16.820> percent<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:17.780> would<00:04:17.930> see<00:04:18.230> yeah

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
hundred percent and you would see yeah

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.310 
hundred percent and you would see yeah
it's<00:04:19.130> a<00:04:19.280> really<00:04:19.609> large<00:04:20.239> amount<00:04:20.419> of<00:04:20.870> money<00:04:20.989> this

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
it's a really large amount of money this

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.950 
it's a really large amount of money this
money<00:04:21.620> makes<00:04:21.890> money<00:04:22.010> to<00:04:22.400> snowball<00:04:22.850> effect<00:04:23.000> so

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
money makes money to snowball effect so

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.740 
money makes money to snowball effect so
if<00:04:24.169> you<00:04:24.350> run<00:04:24.980> a<00:04:25.010> forex<00:04:25.460> business<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.210> you<00:04:26.510> look

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
if you run a forex business and you look

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.630 
if you run a forex business and you look
long<00:04:27.050> term<00:04:27.080> like<00:04:27.740> most<00:04:27.980> traders<00:04:28.340> or

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
long term like most traders or

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.340 
long term like most traders or
businessman

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
businessman

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.680 
businessman
then<00:04:30.560> yeah<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.220> power<00:04:31.550> of<00:04:31.760> compound<00:04:32.330> growth

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
then yeah the power of compound growth

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.950 
then yeah the power of compound growth
will<00:04:33.080> really<00:04:33.680> kick<00:04:34.070> in<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:34.670> start<00:04:35.480> to<00:04:35.660> build

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
will really kick in and start to build

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.000 
will really kick in and start to build
your<00:04:36.740> equity<00:04:37.250> yo<00:04:38.030> quickly<00:04:38.690> and<00:04:38.930> I<00:04:39.650> think<00:04:39.920> yeah

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
your equity yo quickly and I think yeah

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.590 
your equity yo quickly and I think yeah
when<00:04:40.190> people<00:04:40.640> come<00:04:40.820> in<00:04:40.940> for<00:04:41.150> X<00:04:41.270> rating<00:04:41.540> that

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
when people come in for X rating that

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.970 
when people come in for X rating that
they<00:04:41.750> come<00:04:41.990> in<00:04:42.110> thinking<00:04:42.470> they're<00:04:42.800> going<00:04:42.830> to

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
they come in thinking they're going to

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.750 
they come in thinking they're going to
make<00:04:43.070> money<00:04:43.250> within<00:04:43.550> a<00:04:43.670> year<00:04:44.090> or<00:04:44.120> a<00:04:44.660> few<00:04:45.080> months

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
make money within a year or a few months

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.880 
make money within a year or a few months
there's<00:04:46.760> very<00:04:47.060> unrealistic<00:04:47.890> expectations

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
there's very unrealistic expectations

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.400 
there's very unrealistic expectations
it's<00:04:49.130> a<00:04:49.280> long-term<00:04:49.550> game<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.630> you<00:04:51.200> should<00:04:51.380> be

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
it's a long-term game and you should be

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.900 
it's a long-term game and you should be
really<00:04:51.740> looking<00:04:52.130> for<00:04:52.310> three<00:04:52.490> or<00:04:52.640> five<00:04:52.880> years

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
really looking for three or five years

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.200 
really looking for three or five years

make any more effort once your money
starts<00:05:08.210> to<00:05:08.330> grow<00:05:08.510> so<00:05:08.930> yeah<00:05:09.500> you've<00:05:09.680> got

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
starts to grow so yeah you've got

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.850 
starts to grow so yeah you've got
limited<00:05:10.970> effort<00:05:11.300> going<00:05:11.510> in<00:05:11.750> and<00:05:11.930> you're

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
limited effort going in and you're

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.160 
limited effort going in and you're
bigger<00:05:13.100> rewards<00:05:13.580> coming<00:05:13.880> out<00:05:14.060> and<00:05:14.420> that's<00:05:14.990> a

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
bigger rewards coming out and that's a

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.630 
bigger rewards coming out and that's a
lot<00:05:15.350> better<00:05:15.500> than<00:05:15.740> having<00:05:15.920> a<00:05:16.070> business<00:05:16.280> where

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
lot better than having a business where

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.460 
lot better than having a business where
you<00:05:16.700> have<00:05:16.790> to<00:05:16.910> manage<00:05:17.180> people<00:05:17.990> and<00:05:18.020> expand

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
you have to manage people and expand

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.560 
you have to manage people and expand
your<00:05:18.680> overhead<00:05:19.190> so<00:05:19.850> I<00:05:19.910> think<00:05:20.000> it's<00:05:20.240> a<00:05:20.300> huge

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
your overhead so I think it's a huge

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.810 
your overhead so I think it's a huge
advantage<00:05:21.020> of<00:05:21.500> forex<00:05:21.860> trading<00:05:22.250> which<00:05:22.490> many

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
advantage of forex trading which many

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.690 
advantage of forex trading which many
people<00:05:22.880> don't<00:05:23.390> consider<00:05:24.460> should<00:05:25.460> have<00:05:25.550> put

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
people don't consider should have put

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.920 
people don't consider should have put
four<00:05:25.910> x<00:05:26.000> trillions<00:05:26.180> long<00:05:26.510> term<00:05:26.750> business

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
four x trillions long term business

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.860 
four x trillions long term business
