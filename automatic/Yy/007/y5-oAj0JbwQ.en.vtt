00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
before the black I'm going to go ahead

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.680 
before the black I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:28.220> add<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> highlight<00:02:28.849> color<00:02:28.970> I'm<00:02:29.180> using<00:02:29.390> this

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
and add a highlight color I'm using this

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.140

shade from the Kat Von D shade and light
palette<00:02:32.209> I'm<00:02:32.959> just<00:02:33.140> going<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.319> place<00:02:33.560> that

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
palette I'm just going to place that

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.400 
palette I'm just going to place that
under<00:02:34.040> my<00:02:34.190> brow<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:35.209> help<00:02:35.390> these<00:02:35.540> Reds<00:02:35.989> blend

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
under my brow to help these Reds blend

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.220 
under my brow to help these Reds blend
out<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.590> little<00:02:36.890> better<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.810> also<00:02:38.989> think

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
out a little better and I also think

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.750 
out a little better and I also think
it's<00:02:39.380> easier<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.800> have<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.099> in<00:02:40.310> place<00:02:40.550> before

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
it's easier to have this in place before

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.690 
it's easier to have this in place before
you<00:02:41.030> start<00:02:41.300> with<00:02:42.080> your<00:02:42.260> darkest<00:02:42.680> color<00:02:42.920> that

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
you start with your darkest color that

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.490 
you start with your darkest color that
way<00:02:43.819> it<00:02:43.940> has<00:02:44.060> something<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.510> blend<00:02:45.110> into<00:02:45.319> a

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
way it has something to blend into a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.590 
way it has something to blend into a
little<00:02:45.860> bit<00:02:45.980> without<00:02:46.790> just<00:02:47.030> going<00:02:47.239> onto<00:02:47.390> your

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600

don't<00:02:58.069> want<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.310> pack<00:02:58.489> too<00:02:58.760> much<00:02:58.940> on<00:02:59.120> all<00:02:59.390> at

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
don't want to pack too much on all at

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.900 
don't want to pack too much on all at
once<00:02:59.720> at<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.019> very<00:03:00.290> beginning<00:03:00.760> because<00:03:01.760> that

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
once at the very beginning because that

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:12.630 
once at the very beginning because that
would<00:03:02.060> be<00:03:02.410> potentially<00:03:03.410> bad

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.890 

if<00:03:13.640> you're<00:03:13.760> having<00:03:14.030> some<00:03:14.210> trouble<00:03:14.240> blending

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
if you're having some trouble blending

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.750 
if you're having some trouble blending
the<00:03:15.050> red<00:03:15.350> and<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.650> black<00:03:15.800> always<00:03:16.220> go<00:03:16.400> back<00:03:16.580> in

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
the red and the black always go back in

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.850 
the red and the black always go back in
with<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:16.940> little<00:03:17.030> bit<00:03:17.330> more<00:03:17.480> of<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.690> red<00:03:17.860> and

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
with a little bit more of the red and

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.790 
with a little bit more of the red and
place<00:03:19.100> it<00:03:19.250> over<00:03:19.340> top<00:03:19.520> of<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:19.880> black<00:03:20.800> sometimes

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
place it over top of the black sometimes

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.340 
place it over top of the black sometimes
layering<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:22.940> like<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.300> best<00:03:23.480> way<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.750> blend

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
layering is like the best way to blend

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.990 
layering is like the best way to blend
and<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.680> get<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:24.950> most<00:03:25.100> seamless<00:03:25.460> blend<00:03:25.640> and

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
and you get the most seamless blend and

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.760 
and you get the most seamless blend and
it<00:03:26.090> just<00:03:26.270> makes<00:03:26.450> it<00:03:26.600> a<00:03:26.750> little<00:03:26.930> bit<00:03:27.200> easier<00:03:27.530> so

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
it just makes it a little bit easier so

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.590 
it just makes it a little bit easier so
don't<00:03:28.460> go<00:03:28.550> crazy<00:03:28.760> trying<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.240> swirl<00:03:29.510> them

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
don't go crazy trying to swirl them

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.630 
don't go crazy trying to swirl them
together<00:03:29.930> on<00:03:30.080> your<00:03:30.230> eyelid<00:03:30.560> if<00:03:30.710> you<00:03:30.740> can't<00:03:31.070> if

together on your eyelid if you can't if

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.130 
together on your eyelid if you can't if
it's<00:03:31.760> not<00:03:32.000> working<00:03:32.150> out<00:03:32.420> just<00:03:32.450> grab<00:03:32.870> some<00:03:33.050> more

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
it's not working out just grab some more

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.890 
it's not working out just grab some more
red<00:03:33.350> and<00:03:33.820> layer<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:35.060> two<00:03:35.240> until<00:03:35.660> you're<00:03:35.780> happy
