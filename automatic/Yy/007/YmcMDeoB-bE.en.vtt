time<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.230> go<00:03:00.590> in<00:03:00.769> with<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.980> belief<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.370> the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
time and go in with a belief of the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.860 
time and go in with a belief of the
manager<00:03:01.730> gives<00:03:01.940> us<00:03:02.060> on<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.450> training<00:03:02.690> pitch

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
and then on to the game so I think we

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.640 
and then on to the game so I think we
take<00:03:05.090> one<00:03:05.299> game<00:03:05.450> at<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.659> time<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:05.870> think<00:03:05.959> we're
