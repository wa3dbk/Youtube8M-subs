00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.700
 Chimera's Space Program Some program introduces some specialties like this News Juice 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.660
 I'm going for two hours. 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:19.770
 Why am I feeling like I was anchored in the backyard? 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:23.039
 At first, just for some issues, so now that I 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:30.980
 Is not the real participation Lara 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.980
 I 've been there for a long time in October, so there was a lot of requests from a lot of people. 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.989
 Let's join once and deoraguyo was indeed a difficult start during the first cleansing 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.120
 I'm in the sword. 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.559
 So many have also come breaking the breath for a few hours gappeuge gaining unpaired 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.570
 I have experience in 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:53.230
 I started to sit Jean Dark Dog yiseokgi Senator President's continued Newsflash Newsflash 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:57.550
 I do not have family. 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:02.860
 It's a little bit of a political tone this week. 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:05.590
 While progress in the sympathetic mdn ahkkado said deuryeotjiman at dawn in the morning 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:11.950
 It's hard to get out at dawn. 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:17.020
 Why did I think that so hard to choose, and yet the devil for 2 hours 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:21.670
 Listen to the senators' stories and stay in the same place 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.890
 Oh hard and difficult the worry of what will happen to pay well pull it 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.970
 I'm in it. 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:35.930
 Nevertheless, this program 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:42.110
 I have to be good for a long time. 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:47.450
 1 1 The ruling party is now ruling now, and this is Sarnuri, 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.230
 Now that you've been going for a long time, 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.060
 To be 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:58.670
 The opposition must also be some people to whip again if things happened 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:03.170
 That process would have to be repeated that this is the voice of the people whenever Toka 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.920
 Senators I can meet myself somewhere else, 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:12.620
 Pray for them to go forward 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:18.510
 Uh looks like to be able to talk with such a sense of responsibility prevailed'm fairly 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:22.220
 It's tough, but I have to do it well. 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.069
 Oh, well, it's a daily economy . 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.189
 I do not remember 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:36.079
 The notes for when uc 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:37.609
 This shows that plants hitting ten thousand cm're really warm, so that I always 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.969
 Painful 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:45.530
 The problem of irregular workers 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:51.650
 I wonder if these things will be used well . 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:57.200
 But even that is a program that is one step and one step empathy. 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:02.810
 Air under any room for another Nona what can go a little narrow these comments 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:08.329
 There is a desire that I would like to make such a thing gradually . 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:12.169
 But now that I'm starting now, 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:19.010
 It is time to cheer for now 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:20.449
 So, uh, really with that pd or crew here, no matter how society 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.489
 like this 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:30.639
 Because we present the directions to go, I'll try again. 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:33.319
 I get a lot of feedback from people and the viewers are really 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:39.590
 I was sympathetic with him. 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:40.970
 Such a consensus salrimyeon rises ratings yet so naturally the global 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.979
 It's a gulp art. 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:50.479
 I have never been to the experience, it is always broadcast according to the desires of viewers 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:55.519
 No I am not going to viewers, depending on the needs of the broadcasting 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:04:00.470
 So, now that I'm in charge of this program, 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:05.060
 I'm looking for something like that. 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:11.449
 Do not think that legally not going to go anywhere And now Kim Mi-hwa 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:15.829
 How well the program look look at the ratings come out a lot witbun are also scores 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:21.380
 Why do politicians say that they have not gone a long way in this direction? 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:26.300
 If the people appeal to the winds like this , we should go in that direction. 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:30.550
 I think the station is the same as if it was not 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.550
 I want you to look forward to it.
