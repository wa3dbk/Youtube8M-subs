00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.390
 welcome once more ambulances and 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:07.360
 Today I bring you the full analysis of 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.980
 a smartphone is off-road and when saying 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.030
 I do not mean everything that can be done 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.030
 this and many more things 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.740
 the hesperia go zoom is a smartphone that 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.810
 supports investments in liquids you can 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.060
 We can check up to one meter and 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.470
 blows with a level of strength not very 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.119
 high 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.450
 we are facing a smartphone that supports 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.400
 a daily activity we move to the 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.050
 design of the smartphone we are facing a 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.690
 terminal with a design that remote 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.059
 it is recognized that it is a sony xperia either 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.000
 for the minimalist design and little 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.770
 refined making it a very terminal 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.309
 elegant available in three colors 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.960
 yellow black and white materials 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.809
 of those who come and those who are 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.210
 facts this terminal are very good already 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.159
 that you can ask for investments in 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.500
 liquids and the exterior scratches to the 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.479
 sand that has a crystal 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.100
 front that resists scratching with 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.320
 metals and other materials as I've already 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.540
 said and in the back in the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.150
 casing has an interesting touch 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.780
 even though it's plastic, the touch is more 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.600
 foggy and gives a touch security 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.700
 awesome the xperia go does not have a 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.360
 unibody body since you can have the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.150
 Case 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.610
 and do as two pieces but at 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.150
 extract it only we can access 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.380
 the micro sd and micro sim slots 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.830
 we can verify that it is a hysteria 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.620
 has some very good finishes and it shows 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.280
 which is of the brand sony xperia can be 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.990
 see a few meters away and 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.510
 that at the hand of a feeling of 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.729
 robustness and a very pleasant touch 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.520
 thanks to the back of the housing 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.979
 that has a rough feel and we go or like 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.160
 I already said and very robust since it can 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.890
 bear falls and some hits if you do not 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.770
 all have the same point and the 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.880
 measures would be 111 millimeters high 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:10.410
 by 60 to 3 millimeters wide by 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.360
 a thickness of 9.8 millimeters thick and 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.020
 all this in a fairly light mobile and 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.830
 since only think 110 grams 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.780
 Accompanying the government is very large 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.390
 neither and that's why it has 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.280
 but so small of the screen we can 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.100
 say that it is a study that has 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.230
 the motor bravia engine and the size as 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.190
 I already said from 3.5 inches to one 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.620
 resolution that reaches 480 x 320 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.739
 pixel that is a point against 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.050
 terminal but as a positive point is that 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.720
 The touch screen can be used with the 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.000
 wet fingers 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.460
 As you can see, it has appeared on the screen of 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.260
 Suddenly a glass of water if you have water 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.570
 you can check it and what I've done 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.080
 before it supports the touch screen 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:58.580
 is to be able to use wet acquaintances 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.070
 I'm going to put my hand in a boat with water 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.700
 I have wet and we will check how 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.200
 the screen works the screen goes 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.560
 perfectly even with your fingers 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.270
 wet and this is a point in favor of 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.970
 terminal 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.650
 let's go to the hardware of the sony xperia go 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.700
 which has a dual processor 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.790
 core and a gigahertz accompanied by 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.460
 another negative point for the mobile 512 mb 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.350
 of ram and another point in favor is that it has 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.030
 8 gigas of internal memory which 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.400
 they are even extendable front that 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.410
 also that is given up to 32 gigas 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.980
 it can support a large staple 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.360
 capacity for games applications 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.400
 etcetera that means it 's a good 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.930
 terminal if you want memory in the 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.530
 software section of the terminal 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.320
 has android 4.0 point 4 if I do not 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.540
 I'm wrong and we can see it perfectly 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.970
 if we click here in settings we go down 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.310
 we're going over the phone and here 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.310
 we will appear 4.0 points 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:07.610
 4.0 point four days then if we press 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:10.860
 let's see an option as 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:14.100
 would disappear to spears sandwich and if 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.900
 we click on him he would also tell us that he is 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.900
 4.0 is thinking 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.740
 now we would move to one of the subjects very 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.590
 important sony that would be in the 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.290
 camera appearance sony xperia do cuenta 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.990
 with a 5 megapixel camera that is 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.860
 able to record with led flash and with the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.820
 possibility to record video in hd at 720p 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.490
 the camera is one of the biggest 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.280
 surprises that the swiss has given us 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.050
 periago since the camera without being what 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.450
 best of the market meets some 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.160
 expectations a great impression to the 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.930
 time to take the photos and now so that 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.380
 see what he does, let's take the 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.440
 terminal search the cameras and as already 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.460
 we have here we are going to take a picture to 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.460
 our muñoz 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.780
 we are here 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.490
 so you can see the quality of the 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.460
 photography here you have it 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.099
 It makes very good pictures and it's still a 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.810
 not very expensive terminal available for 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.120
 all prices this is a very good 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.430
 terminal and I recommend it 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.590
 now let's see how he behaves with 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.210
 the game always in rne 2 but let's go 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:30.479
 to see how he behaves if he has the ajax 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.479
 and we're not going to see 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.800
 yes for now this is all very correct 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.499
 does not have the activity of the screen 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.479
 4 but the screen lives quite 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.810
 good in comparison quality or price 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.960
 of the terminal 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.819
 As you can see, they behave perfectly 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.000
 we can move but he touched me he has already 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:52.000
 Eaten 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.880
 kobe ​​does everything perfectly and I go 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.790
 to be here I played all the time of 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.380
 day but as if the analysis would be 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.330
 too long we're going to stop it here 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.720
 so you can see that it contracts 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.720
 cool 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.009
 ah 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.009
 and 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.190
 Y 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.569
 and this is irony analysis of the son 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.759
 history 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.340
 joe lieberman analyzes his blog zinc 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:35.840
 applications continue with my breast 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.210
 channel and if you want you can subscribe 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.199
 I would love that you leave me a like that 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.030
 leave me a comment 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:44.300
 appeared the analysis that you thought 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:46.100
 the mobile and good until it came to the end 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.540
 the video if you liked it, leave me another 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.440
 like and see you until the next video

 goodbye
