00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.460
 although I've been a few days 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.690
 picking tomatoes of a pretty size 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.360
 decent like this are lemon tomato 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.759
 that sent me rock the truth is that this 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.610
 foreigners in the pot 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.080
 very rich in most cases what 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.380
 that I am growing in this year are 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.689
 cherries I have 17 different varieties 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.670
 but well what is amazing is that 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.880
 have grown as they have done this year 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.769
 that are so high and have flowers 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.320
 almost almost that only in the last third 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.590
 of what the plant is like this that 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.300
 measures almost two meters ten days in the 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.670
 most of the tomato plants are for a 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.340
 same are not very the others as well as 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.220
 other years it 's true although there's always 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.260
 exceptions like these that are the 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.540
 ferrys sprite that sent me whistling and 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.400
 who are in the sea of handsome or these 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.220
 which are the yellow irons of the 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.440
 green that happened to me in fatetar or the indie 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.720
 they give bouquets of a lot of 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.780
 tomatoes and that's good they're still growing 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.199
 or these are the red cherry of 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.000
 candín 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.619
 This is what made me very happy that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.380
 I got out and they are doing well they are 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.060
 the tomatoes bulbs the spreads of my 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.159
 area bayern 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.320
 these are the garden but that also 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.260
 Pitiusa and Dominique have cultivated with 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.120
 enough production 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.970
 in this part of the garden what I have 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.680
 are eggplants and cucumbers 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.680
 on the left you see the leaves bored 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.210
 we are not doing well enough as spaces 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.369
 white rock valenzuela 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.140
 producing quite a lot are also a 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.060
 charm of these that are the fairy tale 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.240
 What happened to me whistle that give bouquets 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.710
 of aubergines minis how are you? 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.860
 seeing here that it is already beginning to 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.210
 curd are great the black is 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.670
 normal that are the black benzines 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.369
 normal also seem to be 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.229
 carrying I know quite well and behind 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.260
 all this what I have is that speed 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.420
 of plastic 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.760
 in which I try to soak what 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.440
 Cucumbers are not always with much 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.750
 success like that you want and in the end that 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.280
 he has simply gone backwards and 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.560
 are rolling in a loeb was that not 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.840
 you see but it's there cucumbers I'm going 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.910
 picking up some like this one for example 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.390
 what are you doing starting to get fat 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.300
 that is up or some with shapes a 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.180
 little strange how is this that is very 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.100
 finite of the tip those that you know in my 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.450
 video of the courgettes that were not visible 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.300
 the male flowers and the females well 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.780
 well look there you have an up male and 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.730
 another one below female, look at what 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.340
 different than are the pistils of the one 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.380
 and on the other and in this other image that 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.210
 it comes now it's a little bit more sideways 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.270
 you can see that the one above is the 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.910
 flower male and does not have that little 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.620
 zucchini milestone stuck behind you see it 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.180
 has a simple stem while the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.940
 down that is the female flower as you see 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.220
 has a small zucchini behind it 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.620
 what is the flower the peppers as they go 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.900
 doing in this case this one has 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.540
 that black spot came out in the culete that 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.690
 I do not know what will be extracted same artichokes 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.430
 that is waiting to dry the seeds 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.050
 and the courgettes these in step 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.420
 bojan taste are hybrids but they are 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.280
 giving a pretty pretty production 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.110
 although I pick it up when they measure more or 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.080
 minus one span 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.100
 but there are also penalties and that and famous 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.530
 friend the red spider arrived 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.680
 well look there we have other zucchini 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.570
 that are sorry I put valentina and 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.030
 in this case what I am teaching here 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.340
 is what are the marriages that are 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.170
 the flowers are very cute but they are 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.740
 plagued and good went directly to 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.660
 The trash 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.430
 I show it to you because it looks so good there 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.710
 the fabrics that make up the red spider and 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.260
 maybe someone who does not know will help 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.630
 to identify it those sticks that you see there 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.930
 It is the pee that this year has been 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.180
 refused to resprout and good for 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.800
 pluck it is strawberries I'm still going 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.310
 picking some in the middle of all the 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.530
 stolons that are casting and good this 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.300
 year is also drunk nasturtium that 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.770
 I do not know if it repels something because it was 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.720
 full of white fly but good has 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.420
 giving their little flowers and I have to try 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.270
 those pickles I teach you finally 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.040
 I got him to hold on well 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.950
 white bougainvillea after 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.110
 five attempts and good another 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.390
 many of the aromatics have had 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:22.459
 red spider although they are bouncing 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.459
 also as you see 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.569
 It comforts me because I have many many 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.630
 Tomatitos still to be curdled I hope the 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:35.210
 temperatures allow it and the truth is 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.819
 that I also have many flowers that 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:42.370
 are beginning to curdle as they are 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:42.370
 these heroes that I pass pérez greetings
