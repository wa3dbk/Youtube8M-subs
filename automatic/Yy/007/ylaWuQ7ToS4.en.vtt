00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.380
 and this time we have a bio for 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:09.110
 10.1 arrives with the following symptom is 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.940
 treatable does not turn on this tablet not 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.400
 load 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.090
 apparently has no sign of life 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.560
 and eat arrived with this fault and the 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.539
 very simple solution then I want is 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.189
 explain it so that if it happens to happen 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.860
 the same as I have a very solution 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.040
 easy first to manny later to get it out without 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:36.170
 damage them impart the touch that's 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:38.480
 this tablet has here in the center here 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.550
 we can see the union out there we're going to 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.429
 put something to help us do the 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.859
 first to separate to do the first 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:47.629
 separation when we already have separated 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.269
 we are not going to make more force with something 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.510
 this metallic but love to get 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:58.749
 magnetic or something plastic that helps us 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.749
 to uncover the we started to run here 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.780
 opening the housing 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.500
 Y 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.690
 and they have arrived for me, we are going to have a lot 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.610
 Take care to uncover the ones that have 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.100
 the leds and if the scam showed the side 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.140
 that we're not going to do much soon 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.860
 force to the ground let's rent then 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.700
 the tactile that is the most 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:32.210
 the longest 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.210
 here we can analyze two things 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.979
 one and I have received acid freight 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.640
 display is offline this tablet 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.930
 was hit and the impact he suffered 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.060
 he made the flex 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.640
 of the display will be disconnected while 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.070
 disconnected from the display because it is not going 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.750
 to show no sign of life we ​​do not 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.300
 let's see what's going to turn on or something 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.440
 then it was simply to connect it and 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.130
 give solution 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.460
 in this case as it has been several days 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.490
 to off then the battery already 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.770
 has downloaded but 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.110
 If the battery is completely discharged 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.350
 let's uncover here this tape with 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.420
 Be careful because there is another flex 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.230
 here are the two contacts of the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.010
 battery there we're going to measure what voltage 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.620
 have we are going to measure in continuous voltage 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.630
 the continuous return scale and here 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.210
 to show you are loading in 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.210
 have three volts at least 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.910
 at least 3 volts and there we see the 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.910
 voltage 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.410
 there are 3.3 with this high g 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.050
 it will be possible that when you connect the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.720
 loader show me on the screen that 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.010
 has been loading if I connect the charger 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.870
 and it does not show me a screen that has 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.970
 loading is because it is below 3 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.830
 volts I'll have to wait if I'm 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.500
 connecting the original charger I will have 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.740
 to wait for there are 10-15 minutes maximum 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.300
 half an hour to start lighting 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.390
 the screen and it shows me that it's 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.610
 loading if it's below those 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.600
 voltages the charger is not going to be able 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.760
 to store the initial load or the load 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.160
 to be able to break the circuit of 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.080
 protector and that begins to receive charge 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.780
 I'll have to give you a load like the one shown 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.750
 in several videos or in a video that I have 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.540
 how to laugh lithium batteries for 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.980
 rooms giving direct charge and being able to give 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.980
 solution 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.340
 And this is when I look and have more than 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.799
 3 volts should already recognize it 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.370
 remembering that just like this tablet 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.090
 It has a very large battery 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.069
 a cell phone charger 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.470
 it will not be work will be very 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.300
 short to be able to charge this battery 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.830
 It must be an original charger 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:07.489
 such at least 22 amperes or two thousand 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.010
 milliamps at 5 volts then 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.019
 right now if we are going to connect first 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.290
 let's connect the tows that also 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.539
 is offline 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.549
 they have arrived found with this same 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:23.129
 symptom that after blows do not 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.810
 it does not show any signs of life and it is 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:29.030
 simply that they are disconnected 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.860
 well in this case they are disconnected 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.409
 two in the others were disconnected 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.379
 the display no more I'm going to connect and we're going 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:42.319
 to try and connect that does not have to the other 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:45.800
 world we simply raise the if not the 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:49.659
 has the black elche that is 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.659
 as the connector's safety 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.490
 income the flex slipped it without bending it 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:59.650
 to share it and I have it connected 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.110
 if I want to propose a tape project 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.020
 When you hit again, you do not know 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.660
 disconnect easy and I push alone 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.940
 I do not press the edges here in the 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.849
 half or more here the edge only in the 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:19.710
 edge cited so that the afternoon can 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:19.710
 close and I can not leave the altar 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.660
 we arrived from the beginning, sights and assassins 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.500
 remember the tablet is not going to turn on 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.540
 still because he has just 3.3 so that 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.120
 turn on I'll have 3 points 7 in 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.370
 ahead 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.190
 when I connect the charger it shows me 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.169
 that is loading there we can see the 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.210
 lightning and here already then I would have to 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.830
 wait a good time over there half an hour 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.260
 so you can accumulate the load 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.210
 enough to be able to give on 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.830
 it's that easy to fix that flaw 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.930
 helpful arauca technical service 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.710
 professional in mobile telephony and 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.710
