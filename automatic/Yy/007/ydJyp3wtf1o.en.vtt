00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.229 
that the use of the heater in the winter
time<00:00:45.690> gosh<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.620> varies<00:00:46.890> maybe<00:00:47.129> two<00:00:47.550> weeks<00:00:47.850> two

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
time gosh it varies maybe two weeks two

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.930 
time gosh it varies maybe two weeks two
and<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.420> half<00:00:48.539> weeks<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:49.020> I'm<00:00:49.170> lucky<00:00:49.700> but<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.789> all

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
refrigerators and my number one use of

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.770 
refrigerators and my number one use of
propane<00:01:57.500> like<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.590> said<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.829> run<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.570> steady<00:02:00.570> all

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
propane like I said I run it steady all

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.850 
propane like I said I run it steady all
the<00:02:00.899> time<00:02:01.110> right<00:02:01.890> now<00:02:02.040> I'm<00:02:02.189> running<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.700> AC

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
AC is pretty efficient if you're sitting

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.080 
AC is pretty efficient if you're sitting
in<00:02:06.570> one<00:02:06.719> spot<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.979> propane<00:02:08.459> works<00:02:08.700> really

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
in one spot but the propane works really

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.770 
in one spot but the propane works really
awesome<00:02:10.790> you<00:02:11.790> can<00:02:11.970> see<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.239> cooling<00:02:12.569> fans

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
awesome you can see the cooling fans

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.820 
awesome you can see the cooling fans
right<00:02:12.989> there<00:02:13.200> even<00:02:13.530> with

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
right there even with

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.340 
right there even with
owpain<00:02:14.070> it'll<00:02:14.280> get<00:02:14.430> iced<00:02:14.580> up<00:02:14.880> on<00:02:15.060> there<00:02:15.990> but

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
owpain it'll get iced up on there but

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.860 
owpain it'll get iced up on there but
anyways<00:02:16.590> keeps<00:02:16.920> everything<00:02:17.250> good<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.430> cool

and tidy you can see back up here in the
corner<00:02:56.640> that's<00:02:56.790> where<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.530> plumbed<00:02:58.530> in<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.740> valve

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
corner that's where I plumbed in a valve

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.160 
corner that's where I plumbed in a valve
into<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.350> line<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.830> goes<00:03:01.950> up<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.430> stove

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
into the line that goes up to the stove

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.660 
into the line that goes up to the stove
and<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.350> was<00:03:04.470> able<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.740> tee<00:03:04.950> off<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.370> for<00:03:05.580> my

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
and I was able to tee off of that for my

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.320 
and I was able to tee off of that for my
heater<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.450> when<00:03:06.630> I'm<00:03:06.780> don't<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:07.680> the

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
heater and when I'm don't have the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.360 
heater and when I'm don't have the
heater<00:03:09.330> in<00:03:09.450> use<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.900> usually<00:03:10.800> close<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.190> valve

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
heater in use I usually close that valve

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.600 
heater in use I usually close that valve
I<00:03:11.640> see<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.120> it's<00:03:12.240> open<00:03:12.480> right<00:03:12.510> now<00:03:12.630> but

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.100 
I see that it's open right now but
anyways<00:03:14.610> that's<00:03:14.790> how<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:15.000> is<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.840> runs

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
anyways that's how that is that runs

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.420 
anyways that's how that is that runs
across<00:03:16.260> over<00:03:16.680> here<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:19.170> in<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.590> mr.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
across over here and the in the mr.

across over here and the in the mr.
buddy<00:03:20.670> heater<00:03:20.940> sits<00:03:21.330> right<00:03:21.480> here<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:22.160> I've

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
buddy heater sits right here and I've

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.050

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.870 
got the dual tank one dual burner one
and<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:28.290> reason<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.739> did<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.160> I've<00:03:29.640> done<00:03:29.820> a

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
and the reason I did that I've done a

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.759 
and the reason I did that I've done a
video<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.330> this<00:03:30.600> already

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
video on this already

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.650 
video on this already

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
but the reason I did that is because I

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.440 
but the reason I did that is because I
can<00:03:33.840> do<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.560> hard<00:03:34.739> line<00:03:34.980> into<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.700> then<00:03:36.330> I

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
can do the hard line into it and then I

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.140 
can do the hard line into it and then I
can<00:03:36.600> also<00:03:36.780> run<00:03:37.110> two<00:03:37.350> bottles<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:38.760> one-pound
