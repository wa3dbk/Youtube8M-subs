in<00:00:05.850> this<00:00:06.060> video<00:00:06.299> we're<00:00:06.540> going<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.690> take<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.899> look

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
in this video we're going to take a look

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.730 
in this video we're going to take a look
at<00:00:07.230> HTC<00:00:07.919> image<00:00:08.639> sense<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.469> new<00:00:10.469> piece<00:00:10.710> of

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
at HTC image sense a new piece of

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.610 
at HTC image sense a new piece of
software<00:00:10.920> from<00:00:11.460> HTC<00:00:12.210> which<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.750> coming<00:00:13.380> on

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
software from HTC which is coming on

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.220 
software from HTC which is coming on
their<00:00:13.799> new<00:00:14.009> devices<00:00:14.400> bit<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.179> One<00:00:15.389> X<00:00:15.420> or<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
their new devices bit the One X or the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.620 
their new devices bit the One X or the
one<00:00:16.859> s<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.699> we're<00:00:17.820> going<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.029> take<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> look<00:00:18.480> at

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
one s so we're going to take a look at

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.779 
one s so we're going to take a look at
it<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> 1's<00:00:19.529> here<00:00:19.980> but<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> principle

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
it on the 1's here but the principle

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.310 
it on the 1's here but the principle
remains<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.180> same<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:21.660> any<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.170> new

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
remains the same on any of the new

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.370 
remains the same on any of the new
1-series<00:00:22.859> devices<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.570> if<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.869> go<00:00:25.019> into<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
1-series devices so if we go into the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.410 
1-series devices so if we go into the
dyson<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> camera<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.939> where<00:00:27.090> image

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
dyson to the camera this is where image

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.189 
dyson to the camera this is where image
sense<00:00:27.859> comes<00:00:28.859> into<00:00:29.279> its<00:00:29.429> own<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.359> already<00:00:30.750> what

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
sense comes into its own so already what

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.630 
sense comes into its own so already what
we've<00:00:31.320> done<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.529> we've<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:31.949> got<00:00:32.070> into<00:00:32.309> one

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
we've done is we've just got into one

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.540 
we've done is we've just got into one
icon<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.360> clicks<00:00:33.600> camera<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.160> remember<00:00:35.460> of

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
icon it clicks camera if you remember of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.220 
icon it clicks camera if you remember of
devices<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> past<00:00:36.600> where<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.930> may<00:00:37.050> have

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
devices in the past where you may have

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.690 
devices in the past where you may have
advice<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:37.770> where<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.160> either<00:00:38.280> slept

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
advice now where you can either slept

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.660 
advice now where you can either slept
between<00:00:38.879> camera<00:00:39.450> or<00:00:39.600> camcorder<00:00:40.250> no<00:00:41.250> longer<00:00:41.610> do

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
between camera or camcorder no longer do

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.889 
between camera or camcorder no longer do
you<00:00:41.700> need<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.000> do<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.420> just<00:00:42.450> click

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
you need to do that you just click

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.319 
you need to do that you just click
camera<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.890> you're<00:00:44.280> taken<00:00:44.730> into<00:00:45.210> an

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
camera and you're taken into an

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.150 
camera and you're taken into an
application<00:00:46.020> which<00:00:46.200> manages<00:00:46.680> both<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
application which manages both the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.190 
application which manages both the
camera<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.789> camcorder<00:00:48.450> functionalities

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
camera and the camcorder functionalities

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.069 
camera and the camcorder functionalities
let's<00:00:50.190> identified<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.210> we've<00:00:51.750> got<00:00:51.780> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
let's identified here we've got a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.040 
let's identified here we've got a
shutter<00:00:52.469> icon<00:00:53.010> or<00:00:53.190> we've<00:00:53.370> got<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> video

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
shutter icon or we've got a video

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
shutter icon or we've got a video
recording<00:00:55.050> icon<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.100> select<00:00:56.850> between

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
recording icon so we can select between

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.180 
recording icon so we can select between
the<00:00:57.390> two<00:00:57.539> modes<00:00:57.870> from<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.590> screen<00:00:59.070> we

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
the two modes from this one screen we

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.139 
the two modes from this one screen we
haven't<00:00:59.489> had<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.730> go<00:00:59.850> into<00:00:59.969> different

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
haven't had to go into different

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.020 
haven't had to go into different
applications<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:02.010> simply<00:01:02.399> put<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.879> just

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
applications so simply put we can just

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.350 
applications so simply put we can just
take<00:01:03.300> standard<00:01:03.809> pictures<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.180> you<00:01:06.180> can

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
take standard pictures like so you can

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.179 
take standard pictures like so you can
see<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.630> counting<00:01:07.049> down<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.290> number<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
see it counting down the number of

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.280 
see it counting down the number of
pictures<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.270> store<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.869> device

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
pictures that we can store on the device

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.700 
pictures that we can store on the device
on<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.979> internal<00:01:11.369> memory<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> taking

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
on the internal memory so taking

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.310 
on the internal memory so taking
pictures<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.150> take<00:01:15.299> video<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.140> would

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
pictures we can take video like we would

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.020 
pictures we can take video like we would
normally<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:16.979> records<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.640> different

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
normally now records in different

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.840 
normally now records in different
resolutions<00:01:18.150> but<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.470> goes<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.100> 1080p<00:01:20.640> on

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
resolutions but this goes up to 1080p on

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.080 
resolutions but this goes up to 1080p on
the<00:01:21.450> 1s<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.530> y<00:01:22.680> X<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.820> we're<00:01:24.000> now

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the 1s and the y X so we're now

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.050 
the 1s and the y X so we're now
recording<00:01:25.070> but<00:01:26.070> what<00:01:26.280> you'll<00:01:26.670> see<00:01:26.909> is

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
recording but what you'll see is

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.550 
recording but what you'll see is
different<00:01:27.509> here<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.750> we've<00:01:28.049> got<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.229> shutter

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
different here is we've got a shutter

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.950 
different here is we've got a shutter
icon<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:29.970> actually<00:01:30.090> take<00:01:30.420> pictures

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
icon so we can actually take pictures

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.649 
icon so we can actually take pictures
whilst<00:01:31.290> recording<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.159> i<00:01:32.250> tap<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.659> it

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
whilst recording so if i tap that it

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.490 
whilst recording so if i tap that it
takes<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.020> picture<00:01:34.460> takes<00:01:35.460> another<00:01:35.759> picture

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
takes a picture takes another picture

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.960 
takes a picture takes another picture
that's<00:01:37.500> taking<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.009> picture<00:01:38.250> whilst<00:01:38.729> i'm

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that's taking a picture whilst i'm

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.630 
that's taking a picture whilst i'm
recording<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.770> hasn't<00:01:40.770> made<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> shutter<00:01:41.250> sound

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
recording it hasn't made a shutter sound

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.310 
recording it hasn't made a shutter sound
so<00:01:41.909> there's<00:01:42.060> going<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.270> no<00:01:42.450> noise<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
so there's going to be no noise in the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440 
so there's going to be no noise in the
video<00:01:43.619> footage<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.399> i<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:44.820> stop<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
video footage and i can then stop the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.889 
video footage and i can then stop the
video<00:01:45.540> footage<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:47.180> those<00:01:48.180> pictures<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.840> we

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
video footage and those pictures that we

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.649 
video footage and those pictures that we
captured<00:01:49.140> during<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.009> video<00:01:50.189> recording<00:01:51.119> will

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
captured during the video recording will

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.270 
captured during the video recording will
be<00:01:51.810> stored<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> back<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.799> device<00:01:52.920> for

be stored on the back of the device for
us<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.490> review<00:01:53.610> later<00:01:54.500> whether<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> camera

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
us to review later whether in the camera

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.330 
us to review later whether in the camera
or<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.490> video<00:01:56.700> recording<00:01:58.040> option<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.159> can

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
or the video recording option we can

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.590 
or the video recording option we can
slide<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:01.140> zoom<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.549> are<00:02:02.790> now<00:02:02.939> on<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
slide the zoom and are now on the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.819 
slide the zoom and are now on the
subject<00:02:04.200> area<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.680> we<00:02:04.770> are<00:02:04.890> recording<00:02:06.829> we

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
subject area that we are recording we

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.309 
subject area that we are recording we
then<00:02:07.979> also<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> variety<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.450> options<00:02:09.840> when

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
then also have a variety of options when

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.809 
then also have a variety of options when
it<00:02:10.349> comes<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.979> effect

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
it comes to effect

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.239 
it comes to effect
so<00:02:12.769> let's<00:02:13.769> for<00:02:14.010> example<00:02:14.040> go<00:02:14.579> to<00:02:14.640> dots<00:02:15.569> so<00:02:16.439> if

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:17.249 
so let's for example go to dots so if

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.770 
so let's for example go to dots so if
you<00:02:18.030> like<00:02:18.239> this<00:02:18.450> effect<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.019> can<00:02:19.049> take

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
you like this effect you can take

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.360 
you like this effect you can take
pictures<00:02:21.780> using<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:24.709> now<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.769> can't<00:02:26.189> do

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
pictures using this now you can't do

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.220 
pictures using this now you can't do
that<00:02:26.519> with<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.939> video<00:02:27.269> so<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:27.959> see<00:02:28.109> you've

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
that with the video so you see you've

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.569 
that with the video so you see you've
gone<00:02:28.379> straight<00:02:28.650> into<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:28.859> video<00:02:29.010> mode<00:02:29.370> and

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
gone straight into the video mode and

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.869 
gone straight into the video mode and
it's<00:02:29.700> just<00:02:30.769> gone<00:02:31.769> back<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.010> normal<00:02:32.579> you<00:02:32.670> don't

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
it's just gone back to normal you don't

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.550 
it's just gone back to normal you don't
have<00:02:33.120> those<00:02:33.299> options<00:02:33.599> that's<00:02:34.019> just<00:02:34.290> when<00:02:34.439> it

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
have those options that's just when it

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.909 
have those options that's just when it
comes<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.370> actual<00:02:35.969> camera<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.829> can

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:37.919 
comes to the actual camera so that I can

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.129 
comes to the actual camera so that I can
flip<00:02:38.849> through<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.389> all<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.689> different

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
flip through to all the different

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.690 
flip through to all the different
effects<00:02:40.950> there's<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.370> distortion<00:02:42.090> effect

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
effects there's a distortion effect

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.179 
effects there's a distortion effect
their<00:02:44.700> but<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:46.049> sake<00:02:46.319> of<00:02:46.349> principle<00:02:46.980> let's

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
their but the sake of principle let's

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.640 
their but the sake of principle let's
just<00:02:47.400> go<00:02:47.579> back<00:02:47.609> to<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:48.359> no<00:02:48.510> effect<00:02:48.659> so<00:02:49.409> you<00:02:49.469> get

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
just go back to to no effect so you get

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.080 
just go back to to no effect so you get
the<00:02:49.769> idea<00:02:49.829> that's<00:02:50.219> how<00:02:50.549> you<00:02:50.609> can<00:02:50.849> customize

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
the idea that's how you can customize

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.209 
the idea that's how you can customize
some<00:02:51.629> of<00:02:51.719> the<00:02:51.810> settings<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.379> that's<00:02:52.949> one<00:02:53.189> of

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:53.219 
some of the settings and that's one of

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.069 
some of the settings and that's one of
the<00:02:53.340> elements<00:02:53.639> of<00:02:53.969> image<00:02:54.269> sense<00:02:54.569> with<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.870> lot

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
the elements of image sense with a lot

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.890 
the elements of image sense with a lot
of<00:02:55.109> cameras<00:02:55.650> on<00:02:55.859> devices<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.489> don't<00:02:57.419> get<00:02:57.719> all

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
of cameras on devices you don't get all

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.020 
of cameras on devices you don't get all
of<00:02:58.079> these<00:02:58.230> sort<00:02:58.469> of<00:02:58.530> options<00:02:58.919> for<00:02:59.459> customizing

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
of these sort of options for customizing

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.569 
of these sort of options for customizing
your<00:03:00.299> photos<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.049> making<00:03:01.439> changes<00:03:01.980> if<00:03:02.459> you

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
your photos and making changes if you

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.909 
your photos and making changes if you
look<00:03:02.730> at<00:03:02.849> Sony<00:03:03.120> devices<00:03:03.359> they<00:03:03.780> have<00:03:03.959> just<00:03:04.349> the

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:04.919 
look at Sony devices they have just the

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.759 
look at Sony devices they have just the
camera<00:03:05.250> application<00:03:05.969> and<00:03:06.449> you<00:03:06.540> often<00:03:06.870> need<00:03:06.900> to

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
camera application and you often need to

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.209 
camera application and you often need to
edit<00:03:08.340> your<00:03:08.669> photos<00:03:09.060> afterwards<00:03:09.719> on<00:03:09.989> a

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
edit your photos afterwards on a

edit your photos afterwards on a
computer<00:03:11.219> or<00:03:11.400> use<00:03:11.669> a<00:03:11.699> different<00:03:12.150> application

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
computer or use a different application

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.729 
computer or use a different application
to<00:03:12.989> do<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:14.340> effects<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:15.060> your<00:03:15.419> photos<00:03:15.739> from

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
to do the effects to your photos from

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.920 
to do the effects to your photos from
the<00:03:16.919> device<00:03:17.129> itself<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.849> this<00:03:17.939> is<00:03:18.060> where<00:03:18.209> HTC

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
the device itself and this is where HTC

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.659 
the device itself and this is where HTC
are<00:03:18.989> integrating<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.709> all<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:20.099> that's<00:03:20.459> why

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
are integrating it all and that's why

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.030 
are integrating it all and that's why
they<00:03:20.819> call<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.120> image<00:03:21.540> sense<00:03:21.840> so<00:03:22.799> we've<00:03:22.889> got

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
they call it image sense so we've got

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.800 
they call it image sense so we've got
some<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.340> options<00:03:23.519> regarding<00:03:23.939> the<00:03:24.509> flash

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
some of the options regarding the flash

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.379 
some of the options regarding the flash
here<00:03:25.139> so<00:03:26.099> the<00:03:26.250> layer<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.639> these<00:03:26.819> buttons<00:03:27.239> are

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
here so the layer of these buttons are

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.619 
here so the layer of these buttons are
the<00:03:27.479> same<00:03:27.750> on<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.079> One<00:03:28.290> X<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:30.060> we<00:03:30.239> also<00:03:30.359> then

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
the same on the One X and we also then

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.830 
the same on the One X and we also then
have<00:03:30.689> a<00:03:31.199> range<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.829> settings<00:03:32.340> from<00:03:32.909> switching

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
have a range of settings from switching

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.869 
have a range of settings from switching
between<00:03:34.079> which<00:03:34.530> camera<00:03:34.979> are<00:03:35.129> using<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:35.729> it's

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
between which camera are using so it's

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.210 
between which camera are using so it's
got<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.030> front-facing<00:03:36.540> camera<00:03:37.169> we<00:03:37.709> can<00:03:37.859> flick

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
got a front-facing camera we can flick

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.860 
got a front-facing camera we can flick
to<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.400> front-facing<00:03:38.909> camera<00:03:39.479> now<00:03:39.629> you<00:03:39.689> can

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
to the front-facing camera now you can

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.039 
to the front-facing camera now you can
see<00:03:40.109> that<00:03:40.290> it's<00:03:41.329> recording<00:03:42.329> Lee<00:03:42.509> the<00:03:42.689> camera

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
see that it's recording Lee the camera

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.860 
see that it's recording Lee the camera
that<00:03:43.139> we're<00:03:43.290> recording<00:03:43.470> this<00:03:43.769> with<00:03:44.689> you<00:03:45.689> can

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
that we're recording this with you can

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.759 
that we're recording this with you can
then<00:03:46.019> still<00:03:46.379> do<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:47.009> shutter<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:47.970> video

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
then still do the shutter and video

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.559 
then still do the shutter and video
options<00:03:49.769> just<00:03:50.040> like<00:03:50.310> we<00:03:50.430> would<00:03:50.579> on<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:51.329> main

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
options just like we would on the main

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.589 
options just like we would on the main
camera<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:52.859> we<00:03:52.889> switch<00:03:53.310> back<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.239> main

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
camera so we switch back to the main

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.089 
camera so we switch back to the main
camera<00:03:56.090> we<00:03:57.090> then<00:03:57.299> got<00:03:57.479> a<00:03:57.540> whole<00:03:57.919> range<00:03:58.919> of

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
camera we then got a whole range of

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.399 
camera we then got a whole range of
other<00:03:59.219> settings<00:03:59.759> that<00:03:59.939> I<00:03:59.969> could<00:04:00.150> spend<00:04:00.389> a<00:04:00.689> long

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
other settings that I could spend a long

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.159 
other settings that I could spend a long
time<00:04:01.439> going<00:04:01.979> into<00:04:02.129> these<00:04:02.430> but<00:04:02.729> you<00:04:02.819> can<00:04:03.169> change

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
time going into these but you can change

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.280 
time going into these but you can change
the<00:04:04.530> image<00:04:04.859> resolution<00:04:05.329> you<00:04:06.329> can<00:04:06.569> change<00:04:06.900> the

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
the image resolution you can change the

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.709 
the image resolution you can change the
video<00:04:07.650> quality<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.879> you<00:04:08.939> can<00:04:09.060> go<00:04:09.209> out<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.449> Full

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:09.719 
video quality so you can go out to Full

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.499 
video quality so you can go out to Full
HD<00:04:09.769> or<00:04:10.769> alternatively<00:04:11.609> we<00:04:11.849> could<00:04:11.969> go<00:04:12.180> down<00:04:12.479> to

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:12.509 
HD or alternatively we could go down to

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:15.619 
HD or alternatively we could go down to
something<00:04:13.019> that's<00:04:13.799> much<00:04:14.159> better<00:04:14.370> for<00:04:14.909> sending

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
something that's much better for sending

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.129 
something that's much better for sending
it<00:04:15.750> Vyra<00:04:16.019> a<00:04:16.320> message<00:04:16.949> for<00:04:17.159> example<00:04:17.989> we<00:04:18.989> can

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
it Vyra a message for example we can

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.870 
it Vyra a message for example we can
have<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.349> review<00:04:19.739> duration<00:04:20.250> if<00:04:20.340> we<00:04:20.430> want<00:04:20.669> it<00:04:20.820> we

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
have a review duration if we want it we

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.300 
have a review duration if we want it we
can<00:04:21.180> make<00:04:21.510> adjustments<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.800> image<00:04:23.159> in

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
can make adjustments to the image in

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.830 
can make adjustments to the image in
terms<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.669> exposure<00:04:24.150> control

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
terms of exposure control

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.140 
terms of exposure control
first<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:27.000> more<00:04:27.320> we've<00:04:28.320> got<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.650> ISO<00:04:29.280> white

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
first and more we've got the ISO white

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.360 
first and more we've got the ISO white
balance<00:04:30.630> we<00:04:31.380> got<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.710> option<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:32.130> do

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
balance we got the option to do

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.340 
balance we got the option to do
continuous<00:04:33.030> shooting<00:04:33.389> which<00:04:33.960> we'll<00:04:34.169> come

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
continuous shooting which we'll come

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.840 
continuous shooting which we'll come
back<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.710> in<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:34.889> moment<00:04:36.620> we<00:04:37.620> got<00:04:37.830> more<00:04:38.520> video

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.480 
back to in a moment we got more video
options<00:04:39.270> so<00:04:39.510> video<00:04:39.810> stabilization<00:04:40.490> record

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
options so video stabilization record

options so video stabilization record
with<00:04:41.669> audio<00:04:42.000> so<00:04:42.240> good<00:04:42.510> get<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:43.229> to<00:04:43.350> record<00:04:43.620> just

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
with audio so good get it to record just

footage and those sound if you wanted we
can<00:04:47.720> change<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:49.139> interface<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:51.150> we<00:04:51.479> can

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
can change the interface and we can

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.030 
can change the interface and we can
reset<00:04:52.110> default<00:04:54.199> we've<00:04:55.199> then<00:04:55.440> got<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:55.889> option

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
reset default we've then got the option

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.409 
reset default we've then got the option
to<00:04:56.460> select<00:04:56.910> different<00:04:57.270> scenes<00:04:57.870> so<00:04:58.290> we<00:04:58.620> can

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
to select different scenes so we can

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.990 
to select different scenes so we can
help<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:00.660> camera<00:05:01.080> work<00:05:01.290> out<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:02.370> environment

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
help the camera work out the environment

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.400 
help the camera work out the environment
that<00:05:03.030> we're<00:05:03.270> in<00:05:03.450> so<00:05:03.720> it'll<00:05:03.810> automatically

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
that we're in so it'll automatically

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.940 
that we're in so it'll automatically
detect<00:05:04.830> a<00:05:04.950> lot<00:05:05.160> of<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.570> scene<00:05:06.570> modes<00:05:06.950> but

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
detect a lot of the scene modes but

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.350 
detect a lot of the scene modes but
really<00:05:08.400> if<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:08.610> want<00:05:08.790> to<00:05:08.880> give<00:05:09.030> it<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.180> helping

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
really if you want to give it a helping

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.150 
really if you want to give it a helping
hand<00:05:09.720> and<00:05:09.810> get<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.050> best<00:05:10.229> shot<00:05:10.410> tell<00:05:10.860> it<00:05:10.979> what

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
hand and get the best shot tell it what

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.670 
hand and get the best shot tell it what
you're<00:05:11.340> shooting<00:05:12.080> so<00:05:13.080> if<00:05:13.229> we<00:05:13.380> went<00:05:13.530> to

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
you're shooting so if we went to

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.000 
you're shooting so if we went to
panorama<00:05:14.220> for<00:05:14.490> example<00:05:15.060> you<00:05:15.470> can<00:05:16.470> see<00:05:16.710> how

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
panorama for example you can see how

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.529 
panorama for example you can see how
some<00:05:17.280> of<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.430> settings<00:05:17.669> now<00:05:18.000> change<00:05:18.330> on

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
some of the settings now change on

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.990 
some of the settings now change on
screen<00:05:18.870> so<00:05:19.160> when<00:05:20.160> you're<00:05:20.310> taking<00:05:20.669> the<00:05:20.760> photo

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
screen so when you're taking the photo

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.689 
screen so when you're taking the photo
it<00:05:21.180> wants<00:05:21.419> you<00:05:21.510> to<00:05:21.660> line<00:05:21.870> out<00:05:22.080> per<00:05:22.560> level<00:05:23.220> so

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
it wants you to line out per level so

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.430 
it wants you to line out per level so
that<00:05:23.729> it<00:05:23.970> can<00:05:24.210> stitch<00:05:24.600> the<00:05:24.840> picture<00:05:25.260> together

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
that it can stitch the picture together

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.640 
that it can stitch the picture together
and<00:05:27.139> get<00:05:28.139> that<00:05:28.380> nice<00:05:29.039> shot<00:05:29.580> for<00:05:29.910> you<00:05:30.120> no<00:05:31.020> group

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
and get that nice shot for you no group

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.480 
and get that nice shot for you no group
portrait<00:05:32.280> mode<00:05:33.180> so<00:05:33.870> it<00:05:34.160> designed<00:05:35.160> to<00:05:35.250> get

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
portrait mode so it designed to get

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.469 
portrait mode so it designed to get
smiles<00:05:35.910> and<00:05:36.360> what<00:05:36.750> have<00:05:36.930> you<00:05:38.240> but<00:05:39.240> let's<00:05:39.419> just

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
smiles and what have you but let's just

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.070 
smiles and what have you but let's just
go<00:05:39.780> back<00:05:39.810> to<00:05:40.020> Otto<00:05:40.500> will<00:05:41.000> auto-detect<00:05:42.000> we<00:05:42.900> have

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
go back to Otto will auto-detect we have

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.900 
go back to Otto will auto-detect we have
got<00:05:43.289> this<00:05:43.410> continuous<00:05:44.070> shooting<00:05:44.310> mode<00:05:44.520> so<00:05:44.849> i

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
got this continuous shooting mode so i

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.330 
got this continuous shooting mode so i
could<00:05:48.440> so<00:05:49.440> it's<00:05:49.590> taken<00:05:49.889> all<00:05:50.070> of<00:05:50.099> those

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
could so it's taken all of those

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.390 
could so it's taken all of those
pictures<00:05:51.030> that<00:05:51.840> was<00:05:52.020> bit<00:05:52.200> difficult<00:05:52.410> to<00:05:52.830> tell

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
pictures that was bit difficult to tell

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.300 
pictures that was bit difficult to tell
differences<00:05:53.940> between<00:05:54.150> them<00:05:54.510> because<00:05:54.919> of<00:05:55.919> the

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
differences between them because of the

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.850 
differences between them because of the
background<00:05:56.760> that<00:05:56.849> we're<00:05:57.000> shooting<00:05:57.419> on<00:05:57.570> but

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
background that we're shooting on but

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
what you can see is all of those

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.589 
what you can see is all of those
pictures<00:06:00.570> that<00:06:00.720> we've<00:06:00.900> actually<00:06:01.260> taken

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
pictures that we've actually taken

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
during that continuous shooting mode to

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.450 
during that continuous shooting mode to
take<00:06:05.430> up<00:06:05.669> to<00:06:06.050> ninety<00:06:07.050> nine<00:06:07.200> shots<00:06:07.560> we've<00:06:08.280> got

the option to delete the images we can
go<00:06:12.660> to<00:06:12.720> the<00:06:12.840> best<00:06:13.560> shot<00:06:14.450> and<00:06:15.450> the<00:06:16.080> camera

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
go to the best shot and the camera

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.170 
go to the best shot and the camera
actually<00:06:16.530> intelligently<00:06:17.280> works<00:06:17.520> out<00:06:17.820> what

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
actually intelligently works out what

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.980 
actually intelligently works out what
the<00:06:18.389> best<00:06:18.539> shot<00:06:18.900> was<00:06:19.590> that<00:06:19.889> we<00:06:20.039> took<00:06:20.720> so<00:06:21.720> that's

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
the best shot was that we took so that's

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.089 
the best shot was that we took so that's
quite<00:06:22.770> a<00:06:22.889> nice<00:06:23.130> feature<00:06:23.610> there<00:06:24.380> so<00:06:25.380> I<00:06:25.470> come<00:06:25.979> out

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
quite a nice feature there so I come out

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.700 
quite a nice feature there so I come out
of<00:06:26.190> that<00:06:26.690> and<00:06:27.690> then<00:06:27.870> we've<00:06:27.990> got<00:06:28.020> the<00:06:28.139> shortcut

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
of that and then we've got the shortcut

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.640 
of that and then we've got the shortcut
back<00:06:28.979> to<00:06:29.430> our<00:06:30.240> galleries<00:06:31.050> so<00:06:31.580> we<00:06:32.580> can<00:06:33.650> go

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
back to our galleries so we can go

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.279 
back to our galleries so we can go
through<00:06:34.919> our<00:06:34.979> continuous<00:06:35.640> shots<00:06:35.909> here<00:06:36.240> so<00:06:37.110> it

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
through our continuous shots here so it

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:38.600 
through our continuous shots here so it
does<00:06:37.680> actually<00:06:37.860> watch

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
does actually watch

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:47.059 
does actually watch
do<00:06:39.469> something<00:06:40.469> with<00:06:40.560> these<00:06:40.740> we<00:06:41.039> can<00:06:46.069> expand

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:47.069 
do something with these we can expand

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:49.040 
do something with these we can expand
certain<00:06:47.520> images<00:06:47.909> so<00:06:48.240> there's<00:06:48.569> lots<00:06:48.810> of

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
certain images so there's lots of

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.140 
certain images so there's lots of
options<00:06:49.530> different<00:06:50.069> so<00:06:50.370> if<00:06:50.430> we<00:06:50.520> go<00:06:50.669> to<00:06:50.729> the

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
options different so if we go to the

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.529 
options different so if we go to the
gallery<00:06:51.539> we<00:06:51.870> can<00:06:52.080> see<00:06:52.729> we've<00:06:53.729> got<00:06:53.759> access

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 
gallery we can see we've got access

recording but if we were to go into a
video<00:07:33.599> we<00:07:34.560> can<00:07:34.680> play<00:07:34.889> that<00:07:35.099> back<00:07:35.310> and<00:07:35.550> you<00:07:35.610> can
