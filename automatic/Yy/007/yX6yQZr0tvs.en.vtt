 call of duty goes well what I want is 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.149
 that you look at the date is worth a 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:41.189
 year 14 of the other 2013 well this was in 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.929
 met ticos when the trailer came out 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.840
 multiplayer now I want you to notice 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:48.720
 in this multiplayer ever official trailer 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.640
 call of duty black ops 2 here we have it 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.989
 with the tourline mills that 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.579
 I will never forget how this came to 

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:57.119
 beginning of the trailer good look at the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.880
 date 7 of 8 of 2012 including a 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.700
 Weekly before and now look at the date 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.829
 that we are July 23 oh my god that 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.509
 there are two good weeks left and only 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.039
 will be missing two weeks I would not have done 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.229
 this video I would have expected a 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.500
 little else but there is an ingredient 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.200
 that this 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.210
 or call me more attention if you know 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.980
 but good sledge gamer is the company 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.860
 that is developing this call of duty 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.530
 and it turns out that he turns five years old 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.010
 independent study this means that 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.750
 they are celebrating and they are in one thing 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.700
 which is called the week gamer that 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.740
 translate as the week gamer not the 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.870
 celebrates the week that commemorates those 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.240
 five years that are as a study 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.920
 independent well well to celebrate it 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.320
 from Monday to Friday they have established a 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.000
 series of things practically to us 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.890
 we do not care on Monday will do a 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.600
 Tuesday photo gallery I do not know what it is 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.640
 are going to put the support between areva a 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.440
 series of things that matter to us but what 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.040
 that we do care is what they said 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.440
 they have prepared for Thursday what 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.500
 I will say vale is titled as surprise 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.720
 that is, they say this Thursday we have 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.020
 prepared one thing and they have called it 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.510
 clear surprise you say surprise what 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.459
 cojones will be plotting and also in 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.350
 these dates watching when the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.600
 trailer for example white two that 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.210
 practically two weeks and now it 's 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.640
 they say that this Thursday of this week 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.760
 to do or tomorrow they are going to make a 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.370
 surprise because that already gives you to think 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.930
 we would put the hand of the fire that goes 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.070
 to be something about the call multiplayer 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.560
 of duty atanÃ©s warfare I sincerely 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.410
 I have a lot of desire until now that 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.600
 is what we have seen then gameplays of 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.940
 campaign the most we've seen today what 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.920
 that despite what was presented in the e3 and 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.050
 a game train game of the soldier 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.160
 moving and such but really to what 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.720
 all of us who are all at the end is at 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.910
 multiplayer what interests us all 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.650
 it is clear that many of you many 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.110
 of us we spent the campaign in 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.970
 what I do not include myself does not mean that 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.700
 a campaign passes from the target that does not 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.740
 I think after all we all go to 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.270
 multiplayer and is what sells the most 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.670
 call of duty then we also have that 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.650
 alternative way that extinction zombies 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.170
 special operations this still does not 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.760
 it has been revealed and still not even 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.110
 know if there's going to be any of that but 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.700
 good that I'm going around the bush 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.560
 what matters ticos is the multiplayer 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.300
 watching these trailers watching the dates 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.950
 seeing that he's here in the gamescom of 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.330
 germany mid August that yesterday and 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.799
 what has to be presented on 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.570
 multiplayer for example in color and 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.590
 Ticos who did took the 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.960
 most famous youtubers 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.220
 to the angels now to willy so I'll 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.910
 he gets it right to go because he lives there 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.190
 clear then, nothing to get it 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.870
 promotion and such they showed it 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.280
 practically all last year in 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.870
 black bears I do not remember if they did 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.850
 also an event of those what yes 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.310
 I remember when they took out the trailer 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.220
 what with this video is that it is very 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.470
 little and also seeing this from the surprise 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.389
 in quotes on Thursday the first thing that 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.949
 it comes to your head is power then 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.470
 I could take out a multiplayer trailer 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.120
 but not so so suddenly first 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.860
 will release a teaser trailer that is like a 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.900
 trailer but much shorter than you do not 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.120
 says practically nothing but you want 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.520
 they are not creating hype they are heating the 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.460
 thing and because of that then maybe it's 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.470
 that from here to about two weeks a 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.240
 multiplayer trailer in conditions that 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.850
 I already tell you that in these dates it is usually 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.169
 when everything is revealed so nothing 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.460
 I think I have not told you what 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.250
 it goes but it's a part of jayaque 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.120
 skipper 35 4 a game that is not 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.220
 another world but what does it do? 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.199
 perfectly to comment what you 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.150
 I have commented nothing more guys I hope they 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.490
 liked the video the comment and 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.940
 nothing we see then at half past eight 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.940
 off-road
