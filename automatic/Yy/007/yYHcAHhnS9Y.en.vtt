00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.799
 I think it's important because it's a 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.799
 training 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.960
 Question 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:23.800
 x I am sofi de x 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.310
 said that for my Mexican nation screams 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.950
 lonely 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:33.440

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.060

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.190
 I say the quisco 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.710
 since I had thought not to follow it what 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.690
 I think I can see myself imagining all the time 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.520
 while I cook mud and clean the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.220
 sadness on the floor and I just want 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.320
 continue with what I have I do not care 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.510
 if it turns out very well I'll solve it 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.030
 starting from scratch beginning the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.890
 new music like placebo I snuffed is what 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.590
 that I bring and with the only thing that I die and 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.450
 Of course my trip is not just a painting 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.700
 a little tip of fire so I think 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.190
 wrong so I can forgive like that 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.980
 can you hear men tell me if I achieve 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.990
 that my voice can look at you guide you want 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.990
 listen to that noise from the band 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.580
 how are you that only opens the legs 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.930
 imprisoned by my appearance my salary to my 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.930
 house where they said 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:35.680
 the cover of a mix I prefer to make 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.680
 tail alive but with cloth 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.850
 with these casualties 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:55.410
 one by one 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.200
 without reservations at the end of life the 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.810
 success you want when you feel like not queuing 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.000
 changing and measuring your distance the seals 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.430
 of plasman with facts or will suffice if 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.170
 you want respect work with this the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.990
 turns that you spend your life trying 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.450
 do something thinking their broken rhymes 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.760
 in your rooms good manners and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.830
 learn at home and go in and tell me the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.830

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:34.300

 something more to the police of the group integra 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.110
 fit and the police that is to choose without 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.110
 complicated because 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.610
 I think it's also work 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.379
 learn to estimate art but also 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.379
