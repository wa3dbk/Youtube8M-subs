00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
pretty plain but I like it simple to the

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.120 
pretty plain but I like it simple to the
point<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:55.900> very<00:04:56.199> nice<00:04:56.409> got<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:56.800> headlights

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
point and very nice got the headlights

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.950 
point and very nice got the headlights
painted<00:04:57.460> on<00:04:57.550> there<00:04:57.789> both<00:04:58.389> sides<00:04:58.630> are<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.930> same

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
painted on there both sides are the same

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.450 
painted on there both sides are the same
I<00:04:59.229> think<00:04:59.289> yeah

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
I think yeah

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.060 
I think yeah
but<00:05:01.449> he's<00:05:01.840> facing<00:05:02.080> different<00:05:02.409> ways<00:05:02.680> so<00:05:02.889> this

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
but he's facing different ways so this

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.379 
but he's facing different ways so this
one<00:05:03.250> has<00:05:03.370> hands<00:05:03.580> pointing<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.210> back

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
one has hands pointing to the back

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.149 
one has hands pointing to the back
that's<00:05:05.139> when<00:05:05.320> his<00:05:05.440> hands<00:05:05.620> pointing<00:05:05.979> to<00:05:06.070> the

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
that's when his hands pointing to the

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.029 
that's when his hands pointing to the
front<00:05:06.430> but<00:05:06.970> I<00:05:07.000> think<00:05:07.389> it's<00:05:07.510> the<00:05:07.570> same<00:05:07.750> picture

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039
