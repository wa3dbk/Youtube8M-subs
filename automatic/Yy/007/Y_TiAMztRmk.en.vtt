that term is mostly applied to teach

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:44.289 
that term is mostly applied to teach
that<00:01:42.859> they've<00:01:42.950> had<00:01:43.069> some<00:01:43.369> shaping<00:01:43.729> on<00:01:44.060> there

that they've had some shaping on there
you<00:01:44.450> know<00:01:44.599> you're<00:01:44.779> shaping<00:01:45.049> and<00:01:45.409> now<00:01:45.829> you're

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
you know you're shaping and now you're

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.190 
you know you're shaping and now you're
reading<00:01:46.549> a<00:01:46.639> whole<00:01:47.119> different<00:01:47.599> facing<00:01:47.959> on<00:01:48.109> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
so but if you put that blue meanie on it

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.690 
so but if you put that blue meanie on it
with<00:02:18.030> help<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:19.470> know<00:02:19.620> kind<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.040> decreasing

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
with help you know kind of decreasing

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.000 
with help you know kind of decreasing
the<00:02:20.879> size<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.019> blue<00:02:22.200> first<00:02:22.530> by<00:02:22.800> grinding

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
the size of the blue first by grinding

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.369 
the size of the blue first by grinding
it<00:02:23.280> down<00:02:23.340> no<00:02:24.150> matter<00:02:24.390> what<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.930> tooth<00:02:25.170> is

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
it down no matter what that tooth is

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.960 
it down no matter what that tooth is
gonna<00:02:25.709> become<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.069> little<00:02:26.280> bit<00:02:26.459> bigger<00:02:26.730> because

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
gonna become a little bit bigger because

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.270 
gonna become a little bit bigger because
no<00:02:27.810> matter<00:02:27.959> how<00:02:28.170> thin<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.440> Vinny<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:29.010> or

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
no matter how thin that Vinny is or

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.190 
no matter how thin that Vinny is or
maybe<00:02:29.550> not<00:02:29.760> maybe<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.599> placement<00:02:31.049> in

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
maybe not maybe this so placement in

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.110 
maybe not maybe this so placement in
that<00:02:31.410> they<00:02:31.500> don't<00:02:31.739> see<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.010> but<00:02:33.860> still<00:02:35.120> so

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
that they don't see it but still so

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.630 
that they don't see it but still so
looks<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.110> me<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.260> sounds<00:02:37.769> it's<00:02:38.010> difficult

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
looks to me that sounds it's difficult

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.210 
looks to me that sounds it's difficult
to<00:02:38.730> then<00:02:38.879> just<00:02:39.150> do<00:02:39.299> one<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:40.080> weight<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.590> Ania<00:02:40.980> in

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
to then just do one to weight of Ania in

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.420 
to then just do one to weight of Ania in
front<00:02:41.549> because<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.599> may<00:02:42.930> out<00:02:43.470> proportion<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
front because it may out proportion the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.800 
front because it may out proportion the
other<00:02:44.610> teeth<00:02:44.819> or<00:02:45.090> not<00:02:45.560> right<00:02:47.420> doing<00:02:48.420> any<00:02:48.569> type

of<00:02:48.840> cosmetic<00:02:49.530> work<00:02:49.560> just<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.160> really<00:02:51.000> requires

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
of cosmetic work just it really requires

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.539 
of cosmetic work just it really requires
an<00:02:51.720> eye<00:02:51.959> for<00:02:52.019> what's<00:02:52.560> going<00:02:52.829> to<00:02:52.950> match<00:02:53.160> and

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
when you look at them the turgid they're

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.949 
when you look at them the turgid they're
gonna<00:03:22.950> blend<00:03:23.190> in<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.519> do<00:03:23.639> well<00:03:26.389> it's<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.660> same

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
gonna blend in and do well it's the same

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.080

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
it makes your tooth look good with a

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.370 
it makes your tooth look good with a
clip-on<00:03:31.069> you<00:03:32.069> know<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.280> ceramic<00:03:33.120> something<00:03:33.630> one

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
clip-on you know a ceramic something one

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.729 
clip-on you know a ceramic something one
is<00:03:34.549> one<00:03:35.549> is<00:03:35.760> pre<00:03:36.299> made<00:03:36.799> by<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.829> company<00:03:39.079> and<00:03:40.079> make

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
is one is pre made by a company and make

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.890 
is one is pre made by a company and make
them<00:03:41.010> very<00:03:41.160> thin<00:03:41.579> so<00:03:42.000> if<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.389> beef<00:03:42.569> doesn't

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
them very thin so if the beef doesn't

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.020 
them very thin so if the beef doesn't
have<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.440> be<00:03:43.620> scratched<00:03:44.010> then<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.730> would<00:03:44.849> be

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
have to be scratched then that would be

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.680 
have to be scratched then that would be
kind<00:03:45.419> of<00:03:45.480> good<00:03:46.069> can<00:03:47.069> be<00:03:47.190> used<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:48.299> other<00:03:48.389> one

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
kind of good can be used the other one

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.979 
kind of good can be used the other one
is<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> little<00:03:49.079> more<00:03:49.349> flexible<00:03:50.660> because<00:03:51.660> you

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
is a little more flexible because you

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.780 
is a little more flexible because you
already<00:03:52.079> grinding<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.739> tooth<00:03:52.950> down<00:03:53.220> anyway

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
already grinding the tooth down anyway

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.659 
already grinding the tooth down anyway
so<00:03:53.849> you<00:03:54.090> can<00:03:54.389> then<00:03:54.709> arrange<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:55.950> more<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.310> guess

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
so you can then arrange it more I guess

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.449 
so you can then arrange it more I guess
the<00:03:56.849> way<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.060> want<00:03:57.419> it<00:03:58.069> precisely<00:03:59.069> exactly

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
the way you want it precisely exactly
