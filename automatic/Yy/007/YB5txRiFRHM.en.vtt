so do it all in here and today I'd like

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.350 
so do it all in here and today I'd like
to<00:00:01.920> talk<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.190> you<00:00:02.310> about<00:00:02.520> playing<00:00:02.879> outside

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
to talk to you about playing outside

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.570 
to talk to you about playing outside
I've<00:00:03.659> talked<00:00:03.899> about<00:00:04.110> this<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.500> lot<00:00:04.740> but<00:00:05.130> I'm

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
I've talked about this a lot but I'm

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.039 
I've talked about this a lot but I'm
also<00:00:05.759> asked<00:00:06.180> this<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.359> lot<00:00:06.480> so<00:00:06.779> I<00:00:06.810> thought<00:00:06.990> I

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
also asked this a lot so I thought I

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.530 
also asked this a lot so I thought I
would<00:00:07.109> make<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.410> short<00:00:07.859> video<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.519> trying<00:00:09.450> to

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
would make a short video and trying to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.419 
would make a short video and trying to
simplify<00:00:09.780> things<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.469> little<00:00:10.620> bit<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.040> talking

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
simplify things a little bit and talking

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.910 
simplify things a little bit and talking
about<00:00:11.540> safe<00:00:12.540> zones<00:00:12.840> on<00:00:13.139> your<00:00:13.530> guitar<00:00:13.590> if

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
about safe zones on your guitar if

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.110 
about safe zones on your guitar if
you've<00:00:14.040> been<00:00:14.190> playing<00:00:14.429> for<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> while<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:15.000> have

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
you've been playing for a while you have

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.910 
you've been playing for a while you have
a<00:00:15.330> lot<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.599> safe<00:00:15.990> zones<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.590> you're<00:00:16.740> going<00:00:16.859> to

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
a lot of safe zones and you're going to

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.950 
a lot of safe zones and you're going to
be<00:00:16.980> fluent<00:00:17.190> all<00:00:17.520> over<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.970> fret<00:00:18.570> board<00:00:18.600> if

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
be fluent all over the fret board if

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.740 
be fluent all over the fret board if
you've<00:00:19.500> been<00:00:19.770> playing<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.609> not<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.210> long<00:00:21.449> or

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
you've been playing for not that long or

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.540 
you've been playing for not that long or
if<00:00:21.990> you've<00:00:22.199> been<00:00:22.380> stuck<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.949> minor<00:00:23.250> pentatonic

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
if you've been stuck in minor pentatonic

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.179 
if you've been stuck in minor pentatonic
mode<00:00:24.060> that's<00:00:24.720> okay<00:00:24.990> that's<00:00:25.350> your<00:00:25.590> safe<00:00:25.859> zone

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
mode that's okay that's your safe zone

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.250 
mode that's okay that's your safe zone
let's<00:00:26.880> consider<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> first<00:00:27.689> minor

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
let's consider the first minor

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.380 
let's consider the first minor
pentatonic<00:00:28.590> box<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> key<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.760> G<00:00:30.090> that's

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
pentatonic box in the key of G that's

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.150 
pentatonic box in the key of G that's
our<00:00:30.599> safe<00:00:30.929> zone<00:00:31.199> there<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.920> want<00:00:32.099> to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
our safe zone there and if you want to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.490 
our safe zone there and if you want to
sound<00:00:32.430> Fuzion<00:00:32.910> ego<00:00:33.420> outside<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> little<00:00:34.290> bit

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
sound Fuzion ego outside a little bit

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.290 
sound Fuzion ego outside a little bit
more<00:00:34.680> interesting<00:00:34.920> don't<00:00:35.850> think<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.120> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
more interesting don't think that you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.080 
more interesting don't think that you
have<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.630> learn<00:00:36.989> all<00:00:37.350> these<00:00:37.829> weird<00:00:38.309> modes<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
have to learn all these weird modes and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.810 
have to learn all these weird modes and
all<00:00:39.540> these<00:00:39.750> weird<00:00:40.410> shapes<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.219> knowing<00:00:41.670> all

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
all these weird shapes and knowing all

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.160 
all these weird shapes and knowing all
the<00:00:41.910> notes<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.210> print<00:00:42.420> board<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.989> don't

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the notes on the print board you don't

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.690 
the notes on the print board you don't
have<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.010> take<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> very<00:00:44.640> simple

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
have to you can take a very simple

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.080 
have to you can take a very simple
approach<00:00:45.480> by<00:00:46.410> looking<00:00:47.280> at<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.489> safe<00:00:47.760> zone

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
approach by looking at your safe zone

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.029 
approach by looking at your safe zone
which<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.660> pretty<00:00:48.840> much<00:00:48.960> happening<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.770> this

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
which is pretty much happening in this

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.400 
which is pretty much happening in this
area<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> fretboard<00:00:50.760> between<00:00:51.270> threats<00:00:51.539> three

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
area the fretboard between threats three

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.139 
area the fretboard between threats three
and<00:00:52.590> six<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:53.100> you're<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.370> g<00:00:53.579> minor<00:00:53.730> pentatonic

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and six if you're in g minor pentatonic

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.990 
and six if you're in g minor pentatonic
first<00:00:54.629> position<00:00:55.140> that's<00:00:56.070> your<00:00:56.219> safe<00:00:56.430> zone<00:00:56.730> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
first position that's your safe zone and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.389 
first position that's your safe zone and
if<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.960> go<00:00:58.199> outside<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.859> safe<00:00:59.190> zone

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
if you go outside of that safe zone

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.160 
if you go outside of that safe zone
you're<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.969> safe<00:01:00.270> anymore<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.020> we're

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you're not safe anymore and we're

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.750 
you're not safe anymore and we're
playing<00:01:01.530> outside<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> safe<00:01:02.789> zone<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.539> key

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
playing outside of the safe zone the key

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.840 
playing outside of the safe zone the key
I<00:01:04.850> should<00:01:05.330> say<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.720> goal<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:06.920> go<00:01:07.610> outside

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
I should say the goal is to go outside

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.630 
I should say the goal is to go outside
safe<00:01:08.840> zone<00:01:09.050> and<00:01:09.320> back<00:01:09.530> inside<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:10.250> safe<00:01:10.430> zone

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
safe zone and back inside the safe zone

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.620 
safe zone and back inside the safe zone
how<00:01:11.090> do<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:11.300> do<00:01:11.420> that<00:01:11.530> very<00:01:12.530> simple<00:01:12.950> just

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
how do you do that very simple just

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.660 
how do you do that very simple just
consider<00:01:14.630> your<00:01:14.780> safe<00:01:15.050> zone<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:15.650> consider<00:01:16.430> an

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
consider your safe zone and consider an

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.430 
consider your safe zone and consider an
outside<00:01:17.090> zone<00:01:17.330> very<00:01:17.540> close<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.140> which<00:01:18.410> is

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
outside zone very close to that which is

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.650 
outside zone very close to that which is
maybe<00:01:18.740> one<00:01:19.040> fret<00:01:19.310> higher<00:01:19.490> or<00:01:19.790> one<00:01:19.970> fret<00:01:20.240> lower

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
maybe one fret higher or one fret lower

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.410 
maybe one fret higher or one fret lower
so<00:01:21.410> if<00:01:21.500> i<00:01:21.590> take<00:01:21.770> my<00:01:22.010> minor<00:01:22.520> pentatonic<00:01:22.850> scale

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
so if i take my minor pentatonic scale

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.750 
so if i take my minor pentatonic scale
in<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.630> key<00:01:23.780> of<00:01:23.810> G<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.440> can<00:01:25.040> play<00:01:25.250> my<00:01:25.280> safe<00:01:25.730> zone

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
in the key of G I can play my safe zone

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.470 
in the key of G I can play my safe zone
first<00:01:26.660> position<00:01:27.050> of<00:01:27.170> G<00:01:27.380> my<00:01:28.070> not<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:28.940> safe<00:01:29.180> zone

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
first position of G my not so safe zone

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.510 
first position of G my not so safe zone
might<00:01:29.960> be<00:01:30.230> the<00:01:30.500> pentatonic<00:01:30.920> that<00:01:31.190> is<00:01:31.310> found

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
might be the pentatonic that is found

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.060 
might be the pentatonic that is found
the<00:01:32.240> same<00:01:32.450> shape<00:01:32.690> one<00:01:33.050> fret<00:01:33.320> higher<00:01:33.560> so

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
the same shape one fret higher so

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.040 
the same shape one fret higher so
starting<00:01:34.340> on<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.550> fourth<00:01:34.820> fret<00:01:35.210> or<00:01:35.480> one<00:01:35.810> fret

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
starting on the fourth fret or one fret

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.930 
starting on the fourth fret or one fret
lower<00:01:36.260> starting<00:01:36.710> on<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:36.890> second<00:01:37.310> fret<00:01:37.430> those

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
lower starting on the second fret those

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.450 
lower starting on the second fret those
are<00:01:38.180> your<00:01:38.210> outside<00:01:38.870> zones<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:39.680> now<00:01:40.160> that<00:01:40.370> you
