the<00:00:21.630> real<00:00:21.900> empathy<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.769> has<00:00:22.859> only<00:00:23.010> been

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
the real empathy for you has only been

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.740 
the real empathy for you has only been
around<00:00:23.400> for<00:00:23.580> five<00:00:23.730> years<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> real<00:00:24.510> world

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
around for five years in the real world

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.769 
around for five years in the real world
so<00:00:25.380> history<00:00:25.769> report<00:00:26.070> won't<00:00:26.160> do<00:00:26.369> us<00:00:26.400> much<00:00:26.490> good

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
so history report won't do us much good

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.179 
so history report won't do us much good
however<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.109> can<00:00:28.140> probably<00:00:28.439> tell<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.070> has

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
however as you can probably tell it has

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.400 
however as you can probably tell it has
glock<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.760> sigma<00:00:30.060> influences<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.289> it's

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
glock and sigma influences so it's

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.990
