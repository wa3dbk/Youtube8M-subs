00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
but instead of using water I use milk

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.910 
but instead of using water I use milk
and<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:30.179> added<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.660> cake<00:00:30.900> mix<00:00:31.170> into<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.679> bowl

middle<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.760> bowl<00:00:36.090> made<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.930> easier<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.770> me

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129

so first I added the milk the oil and
the<00:00:45.329> three<00:00:45.539> eggs<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.289> took<00:00:46.559> my<00:00:46.710> fork<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.219> I

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
matter how you frosted it so these

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.319 
matter how you frosted it so these
cupcakes<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.520> already<00:01:53.759> been<00:01:53.880> dipped<00:01:54.119> into

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
cupcakes have already been dipped into

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.090 
cupcakes have already been dipped into
the<00:01:54.420> sugar<00:01:54.720> sprinkles<00:01:55.200> now<00:01:55.590> I'm<00:01:55.740> making<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
the sugar sprinkles now I'm making the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.030 
the sugar sprinkles now I'm making the
face<00:01:56.570> for<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> eyes<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.229> am<00:01:58.320> placing<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
face for the eyes I am placing the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.090 
face for the eyes I am placing the
pointy<00:01:59.430> end<00:01:59.579> into<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.210> cupcake

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
pointy end into the cupcake

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.560 
pointy end into the cupcake
for<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.730> nose<00:02:01.970> I'm<00:02:02.360> pointing<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.380> pointy<00:02:04.190> end

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
for the nose I'm pointing the pointy end

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.270 
for the nose I'm pointing the pointy end
downwards<00:02:05.570> here's<00:02:06.440> a<00:02:06.530> tip<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:06.979> add<00:02:07.130> the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
downwards here's a tip to add the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.650 
downwards here's a tip to add the
sprinkles<00:02:07.520> you<00:02:07.880> might<00:02:08.119> want<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.420> use<00:02:08.630> a

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
sprinkles you might want to use a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.080 
sprinkles you might want to use a
tweezer<00:02:09.009> because<00:02:10.009> it's<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:10.399> much<00:02:10.580> easier<00:02:10.610> to

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
tweezer because it's so much easier to

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.930 
tweezer because it's so much easier to
place<00:02:12.020> onto<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.590> cupcake<00:02:13.070> add<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.580> little

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
place onto the cupcake add a little

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.750 
place onto the cupcake add a little
trouble<00:02:14.390> adding<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.170> sprinkles<00:02:15.590> because<00:02:16.550> my

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
trouble adding the sprinkles because my

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.570 
trouble adding the sprinkles because my
fingers<00:02:16.820> were<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.810> bit<00:02:18.470> too<00:02:18.740> large<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.370> hold

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
fingers were a bit too large to hold

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.160 
fingers were a bit too large to hold
these<00:02:19.700> wrinkles<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.780> doable<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:23.540> we're

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
these wrinkles but it's doable so we're

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.290 
these wrinkles but it's doable so we're
almost<00:02:24.470> done<00:02:24.890> making<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.459> Panda<00:02:25.790> face<00:02:26.000> all

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.580 
for the eyes to stay I had to wet it a
little<00:02:32.060> bit<00:02:32.330> on<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.630> back<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.170> that's<00:02:33.320> why

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
little bit on the back and that's why
