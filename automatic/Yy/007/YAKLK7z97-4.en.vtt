down to a day then back up to that same

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:49.020 
down to a day then back up to that same
deal<00:01:40.869> so<00:01:41.649> we<00:01:41.770> have<00:01:47.459> and<00:01:48.459> it<00:01:48.580> really<00:01:48.789> is

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
deal so we have and it really is

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.719 
deal so we have and it really is
triplets<00:01:49.989> there<00:01:50.229> so<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:51.129> first<00:01:51.399> one<00:01:51.580> is<00:01:51.640> a

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
triplets there so the first one is a

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.669 
triplets there so the first one is a
duple<00:01:52.239> and<00:01:53.200> then<00:01:53.319> we're<00:01:53.410> going<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.590> have

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
duple and then we're going to have

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.570 
duple and then we're going to have
triplets<00:01:54.750> triplets<00:01:55.979> triplets<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.190> then

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
triplets triplets triplets and then

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.729 
triplets triplets triplets and then
we'll<00:01:57.729> go<00:01:57.819> on<00:01:57.879> to<00:01:57.940> this<00:01:58.060> next<00:01:58.149> part<00:01:58.629> ok<00:01:59.349> and

00:01:59.729 --> 00:01:59.739 
we'll go on to this next part ok and

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:06.229 
we'll go on to this next part ok and
it's<00:02:00.280> marked<00:02:00.580> pianissimo<00:02:00.970> so<00:02:01.300> pretty<00:02:01.509> soft

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:06.239 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:11.930 

let<00:02:07.239> me<00:02:07.330> get<00:02:07.479> this<00:02:07.569> next<00:02:07.929> part

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.660 

so<00:02:12.940> let's<00:02:13.090> do<00:02:13.269> that<00:02:14.040> right<00:02:15.040> hand<00:02:15.220> will<00:02:15.370> have<00:02:15.519> a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
so let's do that right hand will have a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.559 
so let's do that right hand will have a
good<00:02:16.540> deed<00:02:16.750> together<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.980> then<00:02:18.790> e<00:02:19.030> by<00:02:19.209> itself

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
good deed together and then e by itself

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.110 
good deed together and then e by itself
and<00:02:19.930> then<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.409> sharp<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:21.250> then<00:02:21.909> we'll<00:02:22.000> come

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
and then in a sharp and then we'll come

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.759 
and then in a sharp and then we'll come
back<00:02:22.150> down<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.599> e<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:23.019> then<00:02:23.110> put<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.590> day

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
back down to the e and then put a day

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.259 
back down to the e and then put a day
with<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.129> and<00:02:24.879> then<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.599> see<00:02:25.780> sharp<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:27.269> then

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
with it and then it see sharp and then

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.460 
with it and then it see sharp and then
left<00:02:28.959> hand<00:02:29.200> will<00:02:29.349> have<00:02:29.560> be<00:02:30.370> below<00:02:30.730> middle<00:02:30.940> C

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
left hand will have be below middle C

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.550 
left hand will have be below middle C
with<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.590> Geo<00:02:32.799> boom<00:02:33.069> that<00:02:34.379> and<00:02:35.379> then<00:02:35.530> a
