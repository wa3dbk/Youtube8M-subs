00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
soup with Datsyuk it's through a doctor
dr.<00:01:43.170> Donna<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> goalie<00:01:43.829> didn't<00:01:44.100> fall<00:01:44.280> for

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
dr. Donna the goalie didn't fall for

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.399 
dr. Donna the goalie didn't fall for
whatsoever<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.630> actually<00:01:45.899> came<00:01:46.020> off<00:01:46.170> pretty

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
whatsoever it actually came off pretty

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.319 
whatsoever it actually came off pretty
good<00:01:46.500> too<00:01:46.770> he<00:01:46.890> actually<00:01:47.159> did<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.430> yeah<00:01:48.030> just

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
good too he actually did it yeah just

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.060 
good too he actually did it yeah just
the<00:01:48.420> goalie<00:01:48.630> did<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:49.020> fall<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.530> think<00:01:49.950> that's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the goalie did not fall I think that's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.289 
the goalie did not fall I think that's
the<00:01:50.189> thing<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.460> think<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.700> lot<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.939> players<00:01:51.119> in

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the thing I think a lot of players in

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.850 
the thing I think a lot of players in
shoot<00:01:51.659> out<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:52.079> when<00:01:52.350> somebody's<00:01:52.560> using

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
after the shoot oh I think that either

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.680 
after the shoot oh I think that either
went<00:03:40.830> five<00:03:41.100> hole<00:03:41.340> or<00:03:41.489> just<00:03:41.640> low<00:03:41.850> blocker<00:03:42.360> he

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
went five hole or just low blocker he

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.270 
went five hole or just low blocker he
should<00:03:42.870> have<00:03:42.989> saved<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.410> he<00:03:43.800> would<00:03:43.980> have<00:03:44.070> saved

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
should have saved it he would have saved

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.680 
should have saved it he would have saved
that<00:03:44.459> if<00:03:44.580> he<00:03:44.670> wasn't<00:03:45.000> holding<00:03:45.090> down<00:03:45.330> hug<00:03:45.570> the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
that if he wasn't holding down hug the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.030 
that if he wasn't holding down hug the
post<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:46.170> think<00:03:46.200> that's<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.560> only<00:03:46.620> reason<00:03:46.769> to

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040
