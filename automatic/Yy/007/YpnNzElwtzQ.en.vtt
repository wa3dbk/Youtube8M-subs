you<00:00:59.740> can<00:01:00.150> set<00:01:01.150> which<00:01:01.390> speed<00:01:01.810> I<00:01:02.080> mean<00:01:02.380> what<00:01:02.650> heat

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
you can set which speed I mean what heat

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:06.789 
to apply too much heat you could always

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.899 
to apply too much heat you could always
bring<00:01:07.119> the<00:01:07.270> temperature<00:01:07.450> down<00:01:07.749> and<00:01:08.909> I'm

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909

like<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.060> start<00:01:13.539> at<00:01:13.719> the<00:01:13.899> tips<00:01:14.229> but<00:01:14.710> I<00:01:14.859> like<00:01:15.159> to

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
like to start at the tips but I like to

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.130 
like to start at the tips but I like to
start<00:01:15.549> in<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.789> middle<00:01:15.969> and<00:01:16.270> slowly<00:01:16.630> release

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
damage by being right at the core of the

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:26.489 
damage by being right at the core of the
curling<00:01:22.990> iron<00:01:23.109> in<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:23.409> whole<00:01:23.590> time<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.350> I'm

just<00:01:26.969> kind<00:01:27.969> of<00:01:28.119> holding<00:01:28.450> it<00:01:28.600> in<00:01:28.689> place<00:01:28.840> as<00:01:29.140> I

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
just kind of holding it in place as I

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.899 
just kind of holding it in place as I
have<00:01:29.380> at<00:01:29.499> least<00:01:29.649> that's<00:01:30.130> just<00:01:30.399> something<00:01:30.640> I

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909

have at least that's just something I
like<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.149> do<00:01:31.450> that<00:01:31.600> way<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.840> heat<00:01:32.229> stays

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
like to do that way the heat stays

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.840 
like to do that way the heat stays
within<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:34.030> curl<00:01:35.219> but<00:01:36.219> um<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:39.009> people<00:01:39.729> that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
within the curl but um for people that

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.459 
within the curl but um for people that
aren't<00:01:39.969> experienced<00:01:40.659> just<00:01:40.929> be<00:01:41.079> careful

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
aren't experienced just be careful

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.499 
aren't experienced just be careful

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509

all the little pieces that I missed and
I<00:01:53.770> had<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.100> speed<00:01:54.369> it<00:01:54.490> up<00:01:54.579> because<00:01:54.759> this<00:01:55.090> video

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
I had to speed it up because this video

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.609 
I had to speed it up because this video
was<00:01:55.659> like<00:01:55.869> 16<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.829> 18<00:01:57.219> minutes<00:01:57.579> long<00:01:57.819> so<00:01:58.619> and

then there's grabbing me of the next

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:11.160 
then there's grabbing me of the next
section<00:02:08.220> some<00:02:09.220> curling<00:02:09.720> straight<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:10.929> then

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
section some curling straight and then

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.630 
section some curling straight and then
down<00:02:12.780> each<00:02:13.780> piece

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
down each piece

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.340 
down each piece
and<00:02:16.640> then<00:02:16.760> some<00:02:17.060> i<00:02:17.090> like<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.510> crawl<00:02:17.720> back<00:02:17.960> and

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
and then some i like to crawl back and

and then some i like to crawl back and
then<00:02:18.470> some<00:02:18.500> i<00:02:18.860> like<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.310> curl<00:02:19.520> towards<00:02:19.970> my<00:02:20.150> face

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
then some i like to curl towards my face

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
then just spread it out and this part is

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.050 
then just spread it out and this part is
kind<00:04:01.020> of<00:04:01.170> tricky<00:04:01.380> you're<00:04:02.340> going<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:02.580> curl<00:04:02.880> it

you have a good hold of it back then

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.009 
you have a good hold of it back then
you're<00:04:07.770> going<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.010> turn<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:09.299> curling<00:04:09.720> iron<00:04:09.840> to
